            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-dlc-arriving-next-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The release date and trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/">Star Wars Outlaw's</a> next DLC expansion, A Pirate's Fortune, have leaked online ahead of its scheduled reveal during Star Wars Celebration tomorrow, with the currently unlisted trailer appearing on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-reveal-trailer-launches-on-may-15th.1167036/">ResetEra</a>. Since publishing, Ubisoft has taken the trailer down.</p>
<p>Both the trailer and the video's description spoil the surprise that players will be able to step back into the boots of Kay Vess and experience an adventure with fan-favorite character Hondo Ohnaka on <strong>May 15, 2025</strong>, with the DLC including its own season pass, just as the first DLC, Wild Card, did.</p>
<p>The new expansion will also feature cosmetic items inspired by the recent television series Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, including an outfit for Nix, a trophy for the speeder, and trinkets for your speeder and Kay's ship, the Trailblazer.</p>
<p>This new trailer doesn't reveal too much about the story for A Pirate's Fortune, only that you'll be pitted against Stinger Tash and her band of Rokana Raiders while you race against them to do a bit of tomb raiding in the Khepi Tomb.</p>
<p>A Pirate's Fortune is the second of two planned DLCs for Star Wars Outlaws, after which Ubisoft is likely to announce that it has moved on to future projects, especially when considering that, by Ubisoft's admission, Outlaws did not have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">commercial performance</a> Ubisoft was expecting from it.</p>

            <p>
 "The next project set in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> universe" is even now in production, developers 11 bit have <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-boldly-invests-in-new-titles/">revealed</a> in their latest annual financial results. Whether it be known as Frostpunk 3, Fro3tpunk, Frostpunk: Revengeance, or some other variation of Frostpunkage, it could launch "as early as 2027". 11 bit have also begun development of a "larger-scale title", which they're hoping to release in 2029. 
</p>
<p>
The financial results paint a mixed picture of 11 bit's fortunes in 2024 - hence the decision to bejazzle the investors with talk of another Frostpunk game. On the one hand, 11 bit have experienced "the highest sales in the company's history", driven by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a>'s release and legacy sales of Frostpunk and This War Of Mine. On the other, there hasn't been a "corresponding increase" in profit margins, mostly thanks to the cancellation of Project 8, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-developers-share-new-details-of-project-8-their-ill-fated-fantasy-game-about-grieving">a third-person fantasy adventure with a theme of working through grief</a>. 
</p>
<p>
11 bit have also seen some disappointments in their publishing division: historical RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-thaumaturge">The Thaumaturge</a> and Pied Piper sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creatures-of-ava">Creatures of Ava</a> have "failed to resonate with gamers", though the experimental satire <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indika">Indika</a> has apparently done rather well.
</p>
<p>
Frostpunk 2's initially strong showing, meanwhile, has been blunted by mixed player reviews. "We hope that upcoming DLCs, including new gameplay features, will improve the ratings Frostpunk 2 has received from players," CEO Przemysław Marszał comments in the release. (Our own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-2-review">Frostpunk 2 review</a> summed it up as "an atmospheric, bold attempt to reinvent its own society-moulding subgenre whose story and building features too often frustrate with too few options or distract with too many.") 
</p>
<p>
11 bit have some larger hunks of coal in the boiler this year. On the publishing front, there's Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, "a sequel to the company's most successful third-party title to date", in which you must farm dungeons for goodies to flog in your village store. There's Death Howl, which some oaf who can't be arsed to think of a new description <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bits-latest-curiosity-death-howl-is-a-sorrowing-open-world-deckbuilder-set-in-the-nordic-stone-ages">once described</a> as "a sorrowing open world deckbuilder set in the Nordic Stone Ages". As for in-house games: 11 bit's big bet this year is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a>, in which one man and his many clones must collaborate to operate a rolling spacebase.
</p>
<p>
It's a while away, but: hopes for the next Frostpunk? At the risk of getting myself thrown off a glacier by the faithful, I wonder if it might be time for a change of genre. Perhaps a party-based RPG, like Wartales, with players scouring the icelocked crannies of New London for firewood.

But after over more than 46 years of being locked away in a temperature-controlled tomb in England, the public will get to see the first cut, a special, extra-colorful and well-preserved “dye-transfer imbibition” print of the movie, and George Lucas likely won’t be too happy about it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,194499,196842" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/star-wars-original-print-george-lucas-bfi/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/star-wars-original-print-george-lucas-bfi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">British Film Institute’s Film on Film Festival</a></span> will open in June with a screening of a rare Technicolor film print of the original <em>Star Wars</em> film that was released during its initial run in Britain. While it has been released on home video, this will be the first time the public will be able to watch it in theaters since December 1978. If Lucas had it his way, the world would probably have never seen it.<br></p><p>George Lucas has been tinkering with <em>Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope </em>for years, attempting to revamp the film with additional scenes here, a new opening sequence there, and a slew of special effects changes. The first changes happened in 1981, when a new cut with the subtitle added replaced the 1977 original print. Since then, Lucas has spent decades avoiding being beholden to his first attempt at his magnum opus. Since 1997, theaters have only been permitted to screen the rejigged, updated version. To Lucas, the version the British Film Institute will be screening “is not very good,” and he won’t acknowledge its existence.</p><p>“The Special Edition, that’s the one I wanted out there. The other movie, it’s on VHS, if anybody wants it. I’m not going to spend the—we’re talking millions of dollars here—the money and the time to refurbish that, because to me, it doesn’t really exist anymore,” Lucas told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/star-wars-original-cut-edit-screening-george-lucas-1236191847/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/star-wars-original-cut-edit-screening-george-lucas-1236191847/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <em>Associated Press</em></a></span> in 2004. “It’s like this is the movie I wanted it to be, and I’m sorry you saw a half-completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be.”</p><p>Unfortunately for him, Lucasfilm and Disney gave permission to the BFI to screen the original print of the <em>Star Wars</em> film. He may believe “a film belongs to its creator,” according to what he told the audience during his masterclass seminar at last year’s Cannes Film Festival. But, when you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-to-acquire-lucasfilm-ltd/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-to-acquire-lucasfilm-ltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sell your company</a></span> for $4 billion, you quickly learn it does not. After the two screenings at the BFI Film on Film Festival, the movie is “going straight back to the Master Film Store and those sub-zero conditions” which maintained the film’s pristine quality over the decades, according to BFI National Archive’s Senior Curator of Fiction and Programme Director of the festival James Bell.</p><p>The festival will open on June 12 in London.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the moment I saw the Charizard ex Super Premium Collection on sale, something in my brain short-circuited. My body? Fully ready for yet <em>another</em> unnecessary purchase.

There’s even a Charizard display figure (because, of course, there is), and—get this—ten booster packs. Not five. Not six. Ten. That’s ten chances to pull something ridiculous. </p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218886"><div id="218886" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG Charizard ex Super Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The set includes packs from Twilight Masquerade, Stellar Crown, Paradox Rift, Temporal Forces, and Obsidian Flames—some of the most exciting recent drops in the TCG lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help you further in your quest for great pulls, here are some of my favorite chase cards from these Pokémon TCG sets. Or, if you're done with chasing singles in boosters and fancy just picking up a couple of single cards instead of splashing out on this deal, I've included some handy offers from TCG Player to make sure you're getting the best price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Twilight Masquerade Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I want Perrin and Hisuian Growlithe purely for the art. GIDORA nailed the emotional bond between a Trainer and her Pokémon, and the way the two illustrations pair up makes pulling just one feel like an incomplete thought. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other end of the spectrum, Dragapult ex is is terrifyingly efficient and might be the best Pokémon ex in the set. Carmine is the real money card here though, continuing the trend of playable, stylish Trainer cards dominating the top of the market. Throw in cozy Eevee vibes and a surprisingly playable Ursaluna, and you’ve got a set with range.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Stellar Crown Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Crown is what happens when nostalgia and artistry shake hands. Squirtle and Bulbasaur show off their bird-watching hobbies in some of the most charming cards I’ve seen in years. Then there’s Terapagos ex, which looks like it belongs in a jewelry store, not a binder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hydrapple and Dachsbun are slightly more niche but still desirable thanks to lush illustrations and just enough playability to make you think twice before selling. I think this set knows what it's doing: hook you with Kanto starters, then keep you around with glittering, high-rarity flex pulls.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Paradox Rift Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Paradox Rift wants to make a statement. Roaring Moon ex is the best pull here, both in power and price, and Groudon isn’t far behind with volcanic drama cranked to eleven. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Valiant and Altaria offer very different flavors of future aesthetic, and somehow they both work. Iron Hands ex might not be pretty, but it’s still a beast in competitive decks. If you're after a set that brings both gorgeous artwork and raw pressure, this is the one to crack.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Temporal Forces Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Temporal Forces is part prehistoric brawl, part retro sci-fi. Raging Bolt ex leads the pack with one of the strongest attacks in Standard, and Iron Crown ex isn’t far behind, fueling Future decks with wild efficiency. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walking Wake ex wins big on artwork alone, thanks to Suicune’s eternal popularity, and Gouging Fire holds its own with surprise jungle-dino energy. Even Iron Leaves ex has sneaky-good utility. I want every single one of these cards for a different reason, which is exactly how a good set should work.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Obsidian Flames Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex is the undisputed king here, with two of the most sought-after variants in the entire block. The Special Illustration Rare version is especially gorgeous, all fire and fury, while the gold Hyper Rare keeps things flashy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninetales and Cleffa bring artistic value, and I think Cleffa might be the most unexpectedly stunning card in the set. Pidgeot ex also deserves a shout for balancing playability with an ultra-stylized take on a Gen I classic. This is one of those sets where almost every big pull earns its spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-single-player-campaign<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the single-player campaigns of Tempest Rising. For thoughts on multiplayer, stand by until after launch.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was only a matter of time before someone got tired of waiting for EA to announce a new Command &amp; Conquer real-time strategy game without canceling it a few months later, and finally, Danish developer Slipgate Ironworks has become the one to take matters into its own hands. Tempest Rising plays like a C&amp;C game with the serial number filed off, and it does a fairly good job of scratching the itch for this style of fast-paced action with two very traditional but well-made campaigns set to the tune of a familiar soundtrack partly composed by distinctive C&amp;C composer Frank Klepacki. Given how closely it follows that template, though, it’s a little disappointing that it didn’t have more fun building personality and atmosphere between missions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tempest Rising Single-Player Campaign Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">How closely, exactly? Aside from how it replicates the plate-spinning gameplay and basic tech tree (as many have done over the past 30 years), you could easily just change a few names – GDF to GDI and Tempest to Tiberium, for example – and Tempest Rising would be fairly indistinguishable from a C&amp;C iteration as you’re harvesting resources, building a base, and cranking out infantry, tanks, and aircraft that die in seconds if you’re not paying close attention when they encounter the enemy. Some of the similarities are amusingly on the nose: The Nod-like Dynasty faction’s barracks structure is shaped like giant hands reaching up from the ground, and they didn’t bother changing the name of the Mobile Construction Vehicle (MCV) that expands into your base’s central Construction Yard building at all. So yes, it’s pretty close!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaigns’ story is treated in much the same lovingly derivative way, reframing the GDI/Nod conflict as between the good guy Global Defense <s>Initiative</s> Force and the paramilitary Dynasty faction fighting for territory in Europe and northern Africa, though here it’s set in the aftermath of a Cuban Missile Crisis where things went much worse than they did for us. You wouldn’t really know that it’s a post-World War 3 world, though, because other than some wrecked roads on the battlefields, the regional maps in the briefings look pretty normal, and none of the missions take place anywhere recognizable. But more importantly, it’s missing a few of C&amp;C’s secret ingredients – chief among them a good villain. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We don’t get any good mustache-twirling villain moments like attacking the Pentagon or Eiffel Tower.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of the personality of the classic C&amp;C games came from the evil Nod faction and its mysteriously ageless leader, Kane (played with wild-eyed zeal by Joe Kucan). Granted, the Dynasty leaders who brief you before every mission have more character than the generic, gruff-voiced general of the GDF, but the constantly sneering Aleks can’t hold a candle to Kane. You can't build a cult of personality around a grumpy guy in a beret, and beyond being black leather fetishists, the Dynasty doesn’t have a lot going on ideologically – they’re not even explicitly framed as fascist bad guys out for global domination (especially when compared to the shadowy council pulling the GDF’s strings) so we don’t get any good mustache-twirling villain moments like attacking the Pentagon or Eiffel Tower. Without something like that to get invested in – and coupled with some instances of comically poor voice acting – I was unmotivated to sit through the multiple strings of optional dialogue that give you more bland background on the lore but nothing else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a day and age when anyone with a smartphone can replace their Zoom background with a high-tech command center or dark and ominous paramilitary headquarters, I’m sad Slipgate wasn’t granted the resources to do C&amp;C-style live-action cutscenes and get someone to follow in Tim Curry’s legendary footsteps by chewing the virtual scenery to pieces. These generic animated characters just can’t compete, especially when there was clearly no budget to even match mouth movements to dialogue on most of them (conspicuously, both factions have lieutenants who give you orders through gas masks for no reason). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to actual real-time strategy, though, Tempest Rising fares much better. It may be playing within the constraints of a very defined genre and style, but it looks nice, runs well (it only crashed on me when loading a specific saved game), its interface is modern and friendly, and it’s pretty good at finding ways to be inventive with its faction design. Once you get past basic infantry, just about everything has a special ability or a twist to it that you’ll want to spend some time learning to use and decide if it’s worth your time to micromanage, as opposed to selecting everything and sending it into the attack-move meat grinder. There are too many to list, but the GDF’s heavy use of drone controller units is a fun one: you can control them independently to scout within a radius, you can pack their pilots into an APC or transport chopper and they'll still fly around and shoot, and if they’re destroyed they simply respawn for free in a few seconds. It's also a nice touch to generate resources for special abilities by taking the extra step of marking a target before destroying it – it's a good reward for a little bit of extra micro-management in small engagements. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Trebuchet answers the question of what would happen if GDI’s Mammoth Tank and StarCraft 2’s Siege Tank loved each other very much.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I couldn't help but applaud when the GDF posed and then answered the question of what would happen if GDI’s Mammoth Tank and StarCraft 2’s Siege Tank loved each other very much; that's some excellent wish fulfillment for fans of both those series. These Trebuchet hybrids deploy and un-deploy so quickly – in about a second – that it really drives home how micromanagement-heavy Tempest Rising is built to be. You don’t need to constantly flip back and forth between mobile and stationary modes, but you’ll get more firepower and range out of them if you do.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the opposing side, the Dynasty’s Scrap Truck is a wildly powerful unit that automatically repairs every vehicle or building in a radius while it’s stationary, and it can deploy to become a turret structure with an even bigger repair range. You can then use that to expand your base building area and stock it with flame and missile turrets (Dynasty can build a structure in advance and then instantly place it, while GDF places structures and then builds them), quickly creating a vehicle repair outpost with self-healing defenses right on the enemy’s doorstep. That, combined with their ultra-long-range Porcupine missile trucks and deadly SAM launchers, makes Dynasty a fantastic offensive turtling faction. And when you want to get a bit more aggressive, they can literally roll out a giant metal ball that flattens any tanks or infantry in its path if they can’t destroy it first.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Missions are a good time to smash through, but very few stand out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, the variety of missions once you get past the first few tutorials is respectable but expected, including a lot of base-cracking, defense holdouts and last stands, and commando missions led by powerful specialist infantry, and all of them come with optional objectives for you to cross off that might encourage replays. It's interesting that some of those objectives don’t even pop up unless you scout out the whole map – it's a reason to go back and replay, but if you're trying to do everything in one go it might be a little trollish. All of these missions are well done but again, quite conventional; there’s nothing here that thinks radically outside the box or effectively builds minigame modes around unit abilities the way StarCraft 2 did. They are a good time to smash through, but very few stand out.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dan's Favorite RTS Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like nearly every RTS campaign ever made, Tempest Rising gradually gives you access to new units and airstrike support abilities as you go, but here you also choose a new global upgrade every mission from one of three linear trees – plus you can unlock and then mix-and-match upgrades to fill an expanding number of slots. Some of the upgrades are minor but useful, such as adding burn damage over time to Dynasty’s flamethrowers or stat bonuses that start units out with a veterancy level. Some feel a little exploitative, like one that increases infantry vision range by 50% (which makes them incredibly effective spotters for artillery). A few, though, are meaningful choices that I’d definitely think hard about if I were to play through again on a higher difficulty. The biggest of these for me was the “Stolen Plans” abilities that let you build some of the opposing factions’ vehicles without having to capture their buildings. Some of those, like the Trebuchet tank and Porcupine missile launcher truck, are game-changers that helped me break through tough defensive lines quickly. It’s true that leaning on these can homogenize the campaigns a bit rather than emphasizing what makes each faction unique, but I appreciate being able to customize my force. Also, the ability to re-pack the Dynasty Scrap Truck after deploying it was a huge upgrade that saved me from having to build a whole fleet of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not spoiling anything that isn’t on the Steam page to say that late in both the campaigns, which follow the same events from opposite perspectives, the story abruptly introduces a third, technologically advanced faction tied to the glowing resource they’re all fighting over – which is a sentence I could’ve copied directly from the Wikipedia page of Command &amp; Conquer 3. The alien (ish?) Veti don’t have a playable campaign and aren't yet available in skirmish or multiplayer, so it's a bit tricky to understand how they work differently, but it’s good that they’re here for variety’s sake. Fighting their heavier armies isn’t dramatically different from taking on the GDF or Dynasty in the campaign – they have similar base and defense structures, tanks, aircraft, and infantry – but they do have a few terrifying late-game units that GDF and Dynasty can’t go toe-to-toe with and required me to take an entirely different posture when one showed up.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Tempest Rising’s two good-sized single-player campaigns are a large helping of comfort food for RTS fans old enough to remember Command &amp; Conquer in its heyday, and a way for everyone else to sample a classic style we don’t see very often anymore without having to deal with any creaky old technology. Its nature as an homage to those games does mean that it’s not terribly ambitious when it comes to doing anything bold you won’t have seen before, but it does put its own interesting spin on faction design that kept me experimenting with abilities throughout the campaigns and prevented it from feeling like too much of a retread. The main place it disappointed an old C&amp;C fan like myself was in its straight-faced mission briefings that can’t compare to the B-movie goofiness and memorable characters of the games that inspired it.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Codemasters announced today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-announced-for-may-30-launch-pc-requirements-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 25</a> will join the extremely elite club of games supporting path tracing. Just like with all the others (Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Portal with RTX), the feature is a PC exclusive.</p>
<p>On the subject, the developer said:</p>
<p><em>Expanding on Ray Tracing technology and available as a new “Ultra Max” option in the graphics settings, light now follows every bounced path, including that from indirect lighting and multiple reflections. Shade, light, and colours dynamically shift as they would in real-life, whether you’re racing under the thousands of lights in Bahrain or navigating the castle section on Baku at sunset.</em></p>
<p><em>If you have a PC capable of experiencing it, Path Tracing is the most realistic simulation of light on track that we’ve ever delivered.</em></p>
<p>These aren't the only visual and technical improvements that fans will find in F1 25. Tonemapping and light balance improvements promise a more dramatic effect in all types of weather, with better representation of changes in cloud cover. There are also some enhancements to the track surface shader, which now displays more pronounced tyre and lock-up marks as well as physical changes based on other collected real-world data.</p>
<p>The addition of light detection and ranging scanning (LIDAR) makes tracks far more accurate overall. LIDAR also helped trees and foliage better match the species, placement, size, and shape of their real-life counterparts, with new additions such as cherry blossom trees in Suzuka.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 Authenticity and Customization Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2E_sML5CfY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Codemasters also introduced NVIDIA Audio2Face. This technology (already seen in STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl) improved the facial animations that players will see during modes such as Career and Braking Point. The reintroduced press interviews now capture drivers delivering their responses in a more authentic fashion, with this technology extending to facility heads in My Team. Lastly, PS5 Pro console users will enjoy split-screen racing at 60 frames per second in this year's edition of the official F1 racing game.</p>
<p>Codemasters hasn't shared the system requirements for path tracing usage on PC, but we'll let you know once it does. F1 25 will be available on May 30 across PC and consoles.</p>

            <p>
Colours! They exist, right? They're all around us, everywhere you go, and as of yesterday, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> did something revolutionary: it made them customizable. Taking my sarcasm hat off for a moment, that means developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/netease">NetEase</a> added in the ability to choose different colour palette options for your costumes. It's just a small little way to add some amount of uniqueness to your version of the game's extremely pre-established characters, really. Except, the catch is that you have to pay actual money for them.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Well, ok, to be specific you have to buy them with <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1912740887026888751">600 of a new currency called Unstable Molecules</a>. But you can't just buy Unstable Molecules, you have to convert your Lattice into them, at a 1:1 exchange rate. How do you get Lattice? Finally, this is where you can spend your hard earned cash, by buying a 100-pack and 500-pack for about $6. Costumes themselves already go for around $20, which is one of the main ways the game makes money seeing as characters are always free, so I understand the thought process of charging for colour swaps.
</p>
<p>
Even still, you can't help but raise an eyebrow to extraordinary heights at a developer trying to ask people to spend real money on colours. Not to mention doing so a new currency obfuscates how much these things actually cost. Such is the curse of free-to-play live service games, I suppose, but a curse I find quite agitating.
</p>
<p>
Right now the colour options are only for a few characters like Magik and Luna Snow, and I imagine more will come in the future. I do wonder if NetEase will stick to their guns or just wait for people to stop complaining about it on Twitter (the site trying to be known as X).
</p>
<p>
In any case, Season 2 kicked off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-begins-now-with-emma-frost-new-team-ups-and-a-pc-performance-boosting-mode">just last week</a>, with NetEase promising that new heroes will be coming to the game every single month. Sounds like overkill and too much work for a team <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">that isn't as big as it used to be</a>!

        <p><strong>Meet Jeanne and Maikan</strong></p><p>Jeanne is a French King’s Daughter with a heart full of hope to start a new life. Unfortunately, on one stormy night, her hopes turn into her darkest nightmare when her boat runs aground leaving her alone and unequipped to face the wilderness. The only other survivor is Capitaine, a cute English Shepherd traveling with her.</p><p>On the other side of the river, Maikan, a young and sharp Innu hunter feels a dreary shift in the atmosphere.

<p>Yoshida said (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/former-playstation-boss-predicted-the-switch-2-would-be-usd100-cheaper-than-it-is-but-isnt-irked-by-usd80-for-games-like-mario-kart-world-as-publishers-shouldnt-be-limited-to-a-fixed-price/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar</a>) that publishers should not be "limited to the fixed price on the shelf from the physical media days." Every game should be priced relative to what's being delivered he said, or in essence, "based on the value the publisher believes."</p><p>While Mario Kart World is $80, other first-party <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-release-date-trailer-gameplay-details-and-everything-we-know/1100-6530797/" data-ref-id="1100-6530797">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> are sticking with the $70 price point. Before this, Nintendo's Bill Trinen said Nintendo will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">"look at varying prices" for its games</a> "based off of just how robust the experience is."</p><p>Trinen added: "It's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value?"</p><p>Nintendo has also caught some heat for the $70 price point for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on Switch 2, in part over the fact that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-switch-2-release-does-not-include-dlc-content/1100-6530815/" data-ref-id="1100-6530815">doesn't include the DLC</a>.</p><p>Also in the interview, Yoshida said he expected the Switch 2 to be priced at $400 USD, when in reality Nintendo went with $450 for the system itself and $500 for a bundle with Mario Kart World. Yoshida said the price hike might be due to "the cost of goods going up these days."</p><p>Adjusted for inflation, the Switch 2 is about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">$50 more expensive</a> than the original Switch ($300) when it launched in 2017. Nintendo will reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-to-be-sold-at-a-loss-due-to-higher-production-costs-analyst-says/1100-6530766/" data-ref-id="1100-6530766">lose money on every Switch 2 it sells at the start</a>.</p><p>Explaining the price increase, Nintendo's Trinen said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-switch-2-is-more-expensive-according-to-nintendo/1100-6530645/" data-ref-id="1100-6530645">everything in life gets more expensive with time, and new Nintendo consoles are no different.</a> Others believe Nintendo is raising prices <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">simply because it can, knowing people will pay it.</a></p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5 worldwide. US preorders were expected to begin on April 9, but Nintendo delayed them due to Trump's tariffs. More recently, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo could open US preorders for the Switch 2 in the coming days.</a> Some are wondering if Nintendo will re-open US preorders for the Switch 2 at a higher price point due to the tariffs, but it remains to be seen if that will happen.</p>

            <p>When I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-writers-new-dark-fantasy-vania-also-features-vampires-plus-screaming-spiders">first wrote</a> about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mandragora">Mandragora: Whispers Of The Witch Tree</a> in January, I worried I might have spotlighted a dud. Or at least, something fairly routine. Mandragora sure does resemble a lot of other dark fantasy side-scrollers: gritty yet plump, like they stuck a bike pump in Castlevania, or took a chisel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trine">Trine</a>. It sure does have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> classes and skilltrees. It sure does have crafting, with hundreds of items to acquire. </p>
<p>I confess, I covered it in large part because they have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> writer Brian Mitsoda on the ticket. But then I read the comments on that piece, weeks later, and there were a few lost souls raving about playing the demo for hours. Mandragora launches today. I've now spent an hour or two with a full build myself, and yeah, this feels like the good stuff.</p><!--more-->

<p>The key opening draw is that for all the emphasis in certain trailers on systems and craftables, Mandragora seems very story-led. It takes place in an apocalyptic world where a sepulchral King Priest holds sway over the Crimson City, promising to keep the nightspawn at bay. The King Priest looks a bit like Judge Claude Frollo from Disney's The Hunchback Of Notre-Dame, and shares Frollo's enthusiasm for torturing witches.</p>
<p>You play a Crimson City inquisitor who intervenes to mercy-kill one of said tortured witches, saturating yourself with a mysterious power in the process. Seeking to save face, the King Priest anoints you as one of god's chosen, and sends you forth to track down another witch. Meanwhile, a voice starts whispering in your head. </p>
<p>The opening tutorial sections are filled with sturdily voiced NPC chit-chats that thicken the setting like delicious fistfuls of cornstarch. The character portraits twitch and glare like possessed oil paintings - some of the commenters on my last piece found them off-putting, but for me, they're the best thing about Mandragora's visual direction so far. Hurrying through the Crimson City, you bandy words with some fellow inquisitors and pick up the rudiments of dodge-rolling. Then it's off to the woods to rescue a blacksmith and bother some massive wolves.</p>
<p>As an action-RPG, Mandragora appears to have plenty going on, striking a balance between the lean feel of classic Castlevania and the unlocks fusillade of, say, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a>.  You've got a primary weapon and an auxiliary such as a spell or shield, a jump, a ledge-grab and a spread of gear slots. The combat goes heavy on stamina management and evasion, with the promise of stirring abilities and passives together into bespoke methods of monster-murderment.</p>
<p>The animations and controls are a bit halting, but it all seems engrossing enough. Still, I'm more interested in the gently labyrinthine levels, which are woven around Dark Soulsy altars where you can fast travel and level up, and are nicely abundant in secretive high platforms and concealed entrances.</p>
<p>Again, though, what grabs me upfront is the centrality of the story and writing. Even at its gamiest, Mandragora appears to be going for a certain consistency. There's a tutorial beat early on where you smash some crates and the merchant who owns those crates cusses you out, only to realise that you're an Inquisitor and beg for forgiveness. I like a game that knows how to turn an everyday Crash Bandicootism into characterisation. I'll hopefully have more thoughts down the road (Mandragora is an estimated 40+ hours in length). In the meantime, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721060/Mandragora_Whispers_of_the_Witch_Tree/">here's the Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But today’s mini <em>Mario Kart</em> Direct confirmed for me that I’m most interested in the Free Roam mode. It’s the <em>Burnout Paradise</em> sequel I’ve been waiting for since 2008.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197525" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="197525,197298,197284" data-current="197525"><div><p>Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23056.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502">the Switch 2 Direct</a></span> earlier this month first announced that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200?_gl=1*y9caif*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDQ4OTc2NjckbzQkZzEkdDE3NDQ4OTk1NDckajU3JGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200?_gl=1*y9caif*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDQ4OTc2NjckbzQkZzEkdDE3NDQ4OTk1NDckajU3JGwwJGgw">the launch title <em>Mario Kart World</em> will let you drive between the race tracks</a></span> and hinted at an explorable world, I found an immediate greater interest beyond that of “MORE <em>MARIO KART</em>!” The idea of just aimlessly driving around a Nintendo-created world sounds completely brilliant.</p><p>Today’s Direct assured me that my suspicions were correct—that there was no way the developer would be able to resist packing the world with secrets, bonus items, missions to complete, and collectibles to find. And honestly, I find that even more enticing that shaving microseconds off of my best times on my favorite tracks. (OK, admittedly, I’ve not actually lost too many hours in that particular pursuit since an obsession with the N64's Koopa Troopa Beach level.) It reminds me of another gaming obsession: smashing every barrier and smashable billboard in <em>Burnout Paradise</em>.</p><p>Not playing driving games properly is a bit of a habit. And the best driving games are the ones that positively encourage it, like <em>BP</em>, and also the wonderful <em>Forza Horizon</em> games. Sure, there are races and cups and what-have-you, but what if I just drive over there? There might be a windmill! There might be yellow fencing I’ve yet to knock over.</p><p>I return to <em>Burnout Paradise</em> with a concerning frequency, almost never replaying all the races, my enthusiasm focused on smashing my way around Paradise City. It’s a passion strong enough to get past the game’s interminable opening screens and the contemptible babble of Worst Character In All Of Fiction, DJ Atomika. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, albeit without all the barriers to break, is giving me that same drive (sorry) to aimlessly explore.</p><p>The footage shows <em>so</em> much stuff to find out there! All those pads to jump off, blocks to bop, blue P switches to trigger, and then coins and who knows what else. It’s going to be just so much fun to veer away from the races and uncover the secrets. Or just pootle about, nudging at the edges, seeing if I can break the boundaries, and approach the kart racer like a third-person action game.</p><p>It’d be nice if it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262">didn’t cost such an absurd amount of money</a></span>, although I’ve been fortunate enough to pre-order the bundled version (the magic of being a foreigner to your shores). I really hate that. I don’t care for any of the half-assed arguments about “worth” and “value”—I just hate that it means the game and all the joy it looks like it could offer will be cut off from so many more people.</p><p>Privileged as I am, I’m now far more hyped for this than I was before, my hopes of an open-world game beyond the racing seemingly validated. And then the racing on top of that, too! It’s fun to be <em>this</em> pumped for the ninth entry in an ongoing franchise.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, among the many different scenes was a sneakily silly reference to an infamous moment in Mario history, and it all revolves around a little blue penguin.</p><p dir="ltr">During the Free Roam section of the presentation--at around the 12:04 mark--we see the Penguin racer approaching a cliff and driving off of it, plummeting to the water below. The kart lands safely in the waves, and the little guy cheerfully drives away. This is a far more fortunate fate than old-school Mario fans anticipated back in 1996, when the baby penguin debuted in the Cool, Cool Mountain stage of Super Mario 64.</p>

            <p>
Back when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> was getting properly big, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-princes-carlton-sues-fortnite-for-copying-his-legendary-dance">Carlton from the Fresh Prince famously tried to sue Epic Games</a> for the use of his dance in the game. (You could also buy the Carlton dance in Destiny, I remember, which I absolutely did, but I suppose Fortnite had just become the biggest game on the planet at the time.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Carlton - real name Alfonso Ribeiro - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-dance-litigation-crumbles-as-alfonso-ribeiro-refused-carlton-dance-copyright">was ultimately unsuccessful, as were a handful of other similar cases</a>. But whether because of the bad publicity or actual legal concerns, Fortnite pretty quickly cleaned up its act. Today it's home to countless dance emotes, music tracks and other bits and pieces, all agreed legally and above board.
</p>
<p>
But now, six years on from Carlton vs Fortnite, we have the maker of the Charli XCX Apple dance vs Roblox. The former has alleged that the latter sold their dance without permission, raking in roughly $123k (£93k) in sales. Has no one learned anything over the past half decade?
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/559582/charli-xcx-apple-dance-roblox-lawsuit">Polygon</a>, Apple dance creator and copyright holder Kelly Heyer began legal action this week. Heyer originally posted the dance on TikTok last summer, and it was correctly licensed by Fortnite and added to that game last December. 
</p>
<p>
Roblox, according to Heyer, added the emote last August after contacting her to gain permission, but before the permission was actually granted. 
</p>
<p>
"Roblox moved forward using Kelley's IP without a signed agreement," Heyer's attorney Miki Anzai said. "Kelley is an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work and we saw no other option than to file suit to prove that. We remain willing and open to settle and hope to come to a peaceful agreement."
</p>
<p>
Charli XCX herself, by the way, does not seem to be getting involved. The artist has used the dance on tour, but was not part of its creation. 
</p>
<p>
"As the Apple Dance emote comprises solely of the Apple Dance choreography, completely separate and distinct from the Charli XCX song, the sole 'artist' for purposes of the emote is Ms. Heyer," the TikTok creator's lawsuit reads.
</p>
<p>
Responding to the lawsuit, a Roblox spokesperson said the game took "the protection of intellectual property very seriously and is committed to protecting intellectual property rights of independent developers and creators to brands and artists both on and off the platform". 
</p>
<p>
"Roblox is confident in its position and the propriety of its dealings in this matter and looks forward to responding in court."
</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Roblox boss Dave Baszucki said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">parents who were "not comfortable" about their children's safety shouldn't let them play Roblox</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Imperfect Words Of Parasite Eve]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/parasite-eve</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-imperfect-words-of-parasite-eve.1166931/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/parasite-eve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There used to be words to describe this, but they were imperfect. They were abstract ideas, loosely gathered, that served as a way through. Before the words I needed became the words wielded as blades in headlines and discourse, they were something beautiful but weird and alarming. They were <em>Parasite Eve</em>.</p><p>I bought <em>Parasite Eve</em> in September 1998 at a new-and-used video game store in Whitehorse, Yukon. I can’t recall the name of it anymore, but like all things in a small town, I can still picture it through the memory of all the landmarks that led me there: up the street from the SAAN store and the mall that isn’t really a mall, around the corner from the record store that isn’t there anymore, and across the road from the store that sold Hummel figurines of blank-faced children casting forlorn glances at an unseen God and discount copies of the King James Bible.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Parasite Eve</em> was given prominence on the shelf by the pedigree of its publisher Squaresoft (now Square Enix) and was displayed in conversation with its brethren. <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, released by Squaresoft in January of 1997, was the catalyst for sculpting Playstation devotees from children raised by parents who called all video games “Nintendos”. While <em>FF7</em> remained an insistent pleasure, catalogued by my well-worn and dog-eared copy of the official Prima strategy guide, I was hungry for something more as its secrets and mysteries waned.&nbsp;</p><p>A <em>Parasite Eve</em> ad in Electronic Gaming Monthly lingered in my mind: Portraits of two women’s faces, crafted by polygons, with the tagline “the worst foe lies within”. The ad claimed <em>Parasite Eve</em> was “the cinematic RPG” and promised the game would come with a collectors CD containing playable demos of <em>Xenogears, Bushido Blade 2, Brave Fencer Musashi</em>, and, notably<em>, Final Fantasy VIII</em>. I knew little about what <em>Parasite Eve</em> was going to be, but in my mind it was going to be everything, with a free demo of <em>FF8 </em>to boot. I can always be tantalized with the promise of a free taste of my lasting desires.&nbsp;</p><p>Every lunch break from work, I would walk up to the video game store and ask if <em>Parasite Eve </em>was out yet, until the day that it was, and then its secrets were mine to take home and unravel. When I bought it, the guy warned me that it was a Girl Game. “Just wanted to make sure you know”, he said. I said I wanted it mostly for the <em>FF8</em> demo, and left quickly with my lies in tow. I finished the rest of the workday, sped home, burrowed into the basement where the good TV sat alone in the dark, snapped the first disc into the flimsy Playstation spindle, and went to the Opera.&nbsp;</p><p>RPGs were still a new sensation for me, and while their meandering opening minutes are familiar to me now, at the time it felt like a challenge. In the opening of <em>FF7</em>, Cloud Strife leaps from the roof of a moving train to fight a whole mess of nameless Shinra guys, but in <em>Parasite Eve</em>, protagonist Aya Brea opens her story tepidly, reluctantly taking a dud on a pity date to opening night at Carnegie Hall.&nbsp;</p><p>My desire to keep going wavered at this moment, the clerk claiming this was a Girl Game taunting my heart. I was already struggling to weave the tender threads of my identity into some perfect tapestry of masculinity; I was afraid of being perceived by anyone, including myself, as anything other than status quo. I had questions about myself that had no clear answer: No words to describe how I felt at odds with my body, how I desired a change that I could not name or seek out. All this worry, all the careful upkeep of a lie, piled on and ran slipshod through the hallways of my anxious mind when Eve, <em>Parasite Eve</em>’s antagonist, emerged on stage piloting the body of a struggling New York actress and set the theatre on fire.</p><p>I had to know more. The ad in EGM had promised a cinematic RPG and here it was coming true, seamlessly moving between otherworldly cutscenes and action I was able to control. Given free rein of Aya Brea’s movement, albeit with the clunky tank controls <em>Resident Evil </em>was just beginning to popularize. Aya rushed the stage, and for the first time in a video game I questioned the outfit choices of my avatar. I wondered how she could run in the heels she wore with her black cocktail dress, where she had stashed the gun she pulled on Eve. I wanted to know where Aya kept her secret things, and how she managed to pull it all together with ease.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>I wanted words to describe the secrets of my body. A framework to develop a skeleton upon which to lay sinew and skin, to run blood that felt like my own through my veins. Cloud’s brief dalliance with crossing the boundaries of gender at the Honey Bee Inn in <em>FF7</em> had opened a window, but the door remained closed.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to stumble upon change in the wild and have it happen to me without having to ask. I wanted there to be words I never had to seek out. I wanted it to be easy, because I always wanted it to be easy. I wanted Cloud to point through the screen and demand my attention as he recited the words that could describe a body severed from its heart. I wanted words like ‘transgender” and “dysphoria” to materialize, even though I didn’t know they were real.&nbsp;</p><p>On <em>Parasite Eve</em>’s stage, as Aya has her gun trained on the fire-conjuring opera singer, Eve monologues about the cells in the body, how they call out in desperate communication. Then I’m controlling the action; I let Aya shoot Eve in the chest for very little damage. Eve laughs, and Aya wonders what is changing in her. “My Body!…It’s…! It’s getting hot!”&nbsp;</p><p>As Aya’s latent Parasite Energy came alive in her, my mind cried out with desire for questions it never knew were real. Eve says, “Just what I thought”, but gives no explanation why.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Parasite Eve</em> plays with formula. Engage in combat and the game becomes a blend of <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em>. Aya moves freely within the environment, able to sidestep attacks and wait for her action meter to build. She is like me, waiting to be ready. Throughout the game, Aya has a gun, then a club, then another, bigger gun. She has armour and stats and levels up. You can freely move about the battlefield, stopping only to select commands to attack, use items, or take control of Aya’s Parasite Energy. There are early shades of what would become the active battle mechanics of the overwrought remakes of <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, but here it’s pared down, with no party to control or broader magic system. It’s streamlined, beautiful in its simplicity. It’s a game that puts you into its world so completely that you might never return.&nbsp;</p><p>After Aya defeats her on the stage, Eve flees into the basement of Carnegie Hall like the Phantom lurking below the world. You can choose to jump down and give chase, or you can choose to forget it. I have only ever jumped down immediately. When you land, a mysterious child awaits you, and Aya gives chase into the stone hallways of the basement. A rat mutates before her eyes, its monstrous transformation triggered by changing cells in its body. It becomes a grotesque version of its former self, and then in death it becomes nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>In dressing rooms, bodies lay charred and dying on the floor, one of whom mutters the name “Melissa” as it succumbs. A diary in another room tells me that Melissa is the body that Eve has grown inside of, taken over and turned into something more. Something evil, but something aware of who they are. Melissa writes in her diary about the life she wants for herself and how she would make a deal with the devil to have it, even just for a moment.&nbsp;</p><p>The words in Melissa’s diary are familiar desires for desperate change. She knows there is something in her, something dangerous maybe, that she cannot find words to describe. Her desires have a name she doesn’t know for a change she cannot imagine. I remember my own hands clasped in desperate prayer for whatever God or devil might change me, and the fear that whatever I was hiding in my body might destroy everything I know. How afraid I was to admit I was willing to take the risk.&nbsp;</p><p>When Aya eventually finds Eve once more, she tells her of the mitochondria in the body she can manipulate and control, how she can turn anyone and anything into whatever she sees fit. Anyone save Aya, with whom she shares a secret bond, and is immune to the transformations happening around them. Aya fights more rats, a mutated parrot, and Eve again. Out of combat, the game returns the tank controls and clunky movement to my hands and I bid Aya to move. As she runs, I can hear the click-clack of her steps on the floor, and I worry about her feet in those heels.</p><p>The monstrous change Eve brings about in the lives she destroys should be terrifying, but it lights a fire of possibility in my chest all the same. I never tell anyone I want to know how it feels to be made so wholly new. In the game it’s grotesque, but that’s just pixels telling a story. I wonder how it would feel for my own bones to grow and reform into the beautiful vision of a body hidden in my mind.&nbsp;</p><p>The day after the Carnegie Hall incident, Aya dons her civilian attire: blue jeans, white shirt, leather jacket. Effortlessly cool but no less alluring. I move Aya through New York City as Eve turns people into goop and animals into monsters. We fight at the zoo, at the natural history museum. We battle on a carriage pulled at breakneck speed by a horse on fire. With each encounter, Eve begs Aya to join with her, become one with her. The body is hot, and desperate, and yearning. Aya defies Eve’s call, but questions herself all the same. Someone different from her peers, seeking to understand who she is becoming without hiding from the power challenging her perception of the truth of her body.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of representation has changed in the years since I searched for words and phrases in places they would never appear. I built ideas out of imperfect texts, and found sanctuary where none was slated to be built. Now, when the words appear, they are focused, honed like a blade. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has a trans bartender who street races with a truck emblazoned with a trans flag. The ghost in <em>Paper Mario</em> is canonically trans. There are flags and phrases hidden among the digital bric-a-brac of the world. This is all a net positive, but building a name for myself from grotesque and beautiful hints made transness an idea that never really needed the right words in order to build an altar to limitless potential. I need the answer of transness less than I needed the possibility of the questions it begged me to ask, of who I was and what I could build of myself by challenging an easy narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There were no words to describe who I really wanted to be, but there were hints and allegations, and they were alive in <em>Parasite Eve</em>. I played it all without ever once turning the Playstation off, and when it was over I played it again, searching for the secrets that might yet reveal themselves to me.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/otk-asmongold-mizkif-twitch-youtube-sponsors-controversy-report"><h3>How OTK Lost Its Way</h3></a><p>OTK was meant to be an org for and by some of the world's biggest streamers, but thanks to egos, whims, and controversies, it's proven to be anything but a sure bet

			<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> CI Games <a href="https://x.com/CIGamesOfficial/status/1912876320360439961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that there will be a small delay to the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0 on Steam due to a technical issue. The Epic Games Store, Windows Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X versions are unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>[ORIGINAL STORY]</strong> Today, CI Games launches <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-will-continue-to-receive-meaningful-updates-up-to-version-2-0-sequels-playtesting-to-take-place-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen 2.0</a>, a 'definitive' update to the Soulslike game that seeks to address several of the community's requests. Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Version 2.0 is the definitive edition of Lords of the Fallen and contains 50+ post-launch updates. The Free Friend’s Pass, shared progression co-op, and more are our way of saying thank you to our community. Honestly, the game has grown way beyond what we first imagined when we launched in 2023 – now is the perfect time for new players to join our franchise and current fans to experience Lords in an exciting new light.</em></p>
<p>As the executive mentioned, the game now includes fully shared co-op progression and a Free Friend's Pass. There's now free access to the character creator and the entire tutorial area of the base game. Following the completion of the tutorial, players can experience the entire adventure in online co-operative multiplayer when playing with a friend who owns the base game. Character progress and loot are saved between sessions, though only the host retains world progression.</p>
<p>In Lords of the Fallen 2.0, both co-op players save all mainline story progress when on the same ‘New Game’ playthrough, having killed a similar number of main bosses (within one). Defeated bosses and lit beacons persist in both worlds; both players can revive each other and collect 100% vigor and all loot.</p>

<p>There are also other improvements to be found in Lords of the Fallen 2.0. The character creator now includes improved facial options, skin textures, and body shapes for both male and female models. The User Interface has been overhauled to be cleaner and easier to navigate, and a new guidebook has been added so players may reference previous tutorial prompts at any time.</p>
<p>The combat system now has more accurate weapon handling and refined lock-on mechanics. Mobility has been improved, featuring quicker evasion moves and more responsive controls. A dedicated jump button improves the platforming experience. Weapon audio was enhanced, amplifying every swing, parry, and block. A brand-new Umbral Lamp guidance mechanic now highlights the path forward through Mournstead. Lastly, new grievous strike button prompts have been added.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a free update for existing users. Any potential newcomers can now get the game at discounted pricing:</p>

<p>The game didn't score highly <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review by Francesco De Meo</a>, but perhaps he'll be willing to give it another chance with the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0.</p>
