<p>The long-anticipated remake of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion could be revealed next month. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzBn7eW6JJs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaker Extas1s</a>, not only is The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake real, but Xbox could announce the game at an Xbox Direct event in January. Not only could it be announced next month, but the game could be released sometime in 2025.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-4-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous rumors</a>, the remake is being developed by Virtuos and is being built in Unreal Engine 5. Those rumors also hinted at a 2025 release for the game.</p>



<p>If you recall, the first word of a remake or remaster of the game came during the FTC’s investigation into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. At the time, the documents revealed the game was expected during fiscal year 2022, but that, obviously, never came to be. Since then, nothing has been said publicly by Microsoft or Bethesda on its status. </p>

<p>As with every rumor, please take the information with a grain of salt until it’s officially confirmed or Insider Gaming can independently verify the information.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324626/balatro-localthunk-18-plus-rating-europe-pegi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The creator of the poker roguelike <em>Balatro</em>, who goes by the alias LocalThunk, has been sharing some frustrations over the game’s 18-plus rating in Europe.</p><p>“Since PEGI gave us an 18-plus rating for having evil playing cards maybe I should add microtransactions / loot boxes / real gambling to lower that rating to 3-plus like <em>EA Sports FC,</em>” <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1868142749108797590">LocalThunk posted on X over the weekend</a>.</p><p><em>Balatro’s</em> 18-plus rating isn’t new. The game was originally rated 3-plus, but shortly after its February launch, PEGI bumped it up to 18-plus, as spelled out at the time <a href="https://x.com/PlaystackGames/status/1763614758043795909">by Playstack</a>, <em>Balatro’s</em> publisher. The game was briefly delisted from “a number of digital stores in some countries” as a result.</p><p>According to <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=balatro&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-UHS_qJPR8y3wmOQu29CLnMnZt4aDd3pN6XBAA02hku8&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form">PEGI’s page for <em>Balatro</em></a>, the rating was given because the game “features prominent gambling imagery.” PEGI also spells out the following “content specific issues”: </p><div><blockquote><p>This game teaches — by way of images, information and gameplay — skills and knowledge that are used in poker. During gameplay, the player is rewarded with ‘chips’ for playing certain hands. The player is able to access a list of poker hand names. As the player hovers over these poker hands, the game explains what types of cards the player would need in order to play certain hands. As the game goes on, the player becomes increasingly familiar with which hands would earn more points. Because these are hands that exist in the real world, this knowledge and skill could be transferred to a real-life game of poker.</p></blockquote></div><p>While it’s true that the game does feature poker imagery and poker hands that a player could translate into an actual game of poker, it’s worth noting that <em>Balatro</em> doesn’t actually have any gambling as part of playing the game. (LocalThunk has even <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1820752209765961746">stipulated in their will</a> that <em>Balatro</em> can’t be sold or licensed to a gambling company.)</p><p>Games like <em>EA Sports FC</em> include in-game purchases <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/fut-packs-explained">with randomized content</a>, which is what LocalThunk takes issue with. “I’m way more irked at the 3-plus for these games with actual gambling mechanics for children than I am about <em>Balatro</em> having an 18-plus rating,” <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1868540666869121033">he said on Sunday</a>.</p><p>LocalThunk <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/localthunk.bsky.social/post/3ldmanyal7k2d">said Wednesday</a> that they attempted to discuss <em>Balatro’s</em> rating with PEGI, but “they do not see anything wrong <em>Balatro</em> being rated 18-plus, nor with <em>EA Sports FC</em> (and similar games) having a 3-plus rating.” PEGI was “blaming EU laws, blaming storefronts, waiting for the future,” LocalThunk said.</p><p>PEGI didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-hidden-ones-hitori-no-shita-the-outcasts-preview-not-just-a-pretty-face<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The comeback wasn’t going to happen. I was blowing it. I lost my first character in my first match of The Hidden Ones because I didn’t cash out with my Ultimate Skill, but I made a comeback with my mid before losing her to my opponent’s anchor. I didn’t have a great answer for what he was doing, and I was convinced I was going to waste what had started off as a great comeback. Then my anchor came out. It was my first game; I’d never used her before. And at first, it was going about the same, and then I realized what I was doing. I canceled my default combo into another combo then another, and cashed out with my Ultimate. And on the last hit, I got the kill. God, I love fighting games, and if my time with it is any indication, The Hidden Ones is living up to what makes the genre so great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not up on The Lore ™, The Hidden Ones is based on the anime Hitori No Shita: The Outcasts, which in turn is based on Under One Person, a Chinese webcomic. Whew. Okay, so the history is a little complicated, but you don’t really need to know what’s going on with the other parts of the series to vibe with The Hidden Ones. I have no experience with the anime, but I was able to follow what I saw pretty easily. I started with the story mode, which dropped me into the shoes of Wang Ye. Ye is one of the Outcasts, blessed with one of the Eight Secret Arts, which were generally believed to have been lost to time. Once people figure out what Wang Ye has, though, they go after him to get it. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Hidden Ones (Hitori No Shita: The Outcasts) Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wang Ye tries to nip this in the bud by speaking with Li Gaofeng, the head of the Li Troupe, and trying to convince him to leave Wang and his family alone. Impressed by Wang’s gumption and fighting prowess, Li agrees to let him go and leave his family alone. Of course, things don’t go as planned and Wang finds himself framed for Li’s murder and battling the Li Troupe as he tries to escape.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Devil’s in the Details</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Whew, okay, set up. What’s cool, though, is the game Morefun games has made out of this. The Hidden Ones would probably be best described as an arena fighter, but you don’t just go from fight to fight. Between the fights themselves, you’ve got the ability to run around and check out The Hidden Ones’s world, whether that means enjoying the environmental detail on display or checking out a ledger or diary you find in the world. This attention to detail is important: during an interview that happened between my two play sessions, Lead Game Designer Fox Lin and Senior Game Designer Stan Fan told me that the team at Morefun spent a long time capturing the detail of these environments, many of which are based on actual, individual Chinese streets. They wanted the world of The Hidden Ones to feel real, and that comes across even in the relatively small area I was playing in.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The same is true of The Hidden Ones’s visual style. This game is stunning, and that attention to detail is clear in everything from the characters to the way they fight. This is intentional, too. The story and world of The Hidden Ones are based heavily (though not exclusively) in Chinese martial arts and myth, and that meant getting the little details right, right down to the motion capture done by real martial artists. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>These are regular people, and that’s a major part of the story here, even if they are throwing punches and casting magic.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Morefun is also quick to note that while the Outcasts are incredibly powerful, they’re also folks going about their day. Maybe they’re going out to buy groceries or just using their abilities to accomplish their goals in subtle ways. The point is these are regular people, and that’s a major part of the story here, even if they are throwing punches and casting magic.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Like a Flowing Stream</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the fighting, The Hidden Ones feels great when you’re throwing punches. This is an arena fighter, so movement is crucial, but the rock-paper-scissors interactions of what makes a fighting game a game fighting work are here, too. You’ve got your basic attacks, which lose to special attacks; those losey to your defensive stance; and your defensive stance loses to attacks, which become throws if they’re in that stance. There’s also a dodge, which costs a limited amount of stamina, and you can time perfectly for a Witch Time-style slowdown that will allow you to retaliate when you otherwise wouldn’t, and a parry that you can perform out of your defensive stance during special attacks, so you can swap from defense to offense with a well-timed button press.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stamina also comes into play on offense. You can spend it to cancel actions — whether they’re physical or special attacks — allowing you to build custom combos and combos into your Ultimate Skills, which is how I won that match I told you about at the start. If you’re the one getting your face rearranged, you can also spend stamina to break out of combos and reset to neutral. Put together, all of this means that, despite The Hidden Ones’s fairly simple control scheme and combo structure, you’re constantly making interesting choices where you’re alternating between playing neutral, reacting, and pre-empting your opponent, all while managing your character’s unique skills (Wang Ye, for instance, has a special attack that can go into three different variations). The right play at the right time, like say, throwing out a special attack when you think they’re going to swing at you, can swing a match.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nah, He Just Looks Big</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The real meat and potatoes, and my favorite part of my time with The Hidden Ones, is going to be the mano a mano fights between your three-person teams against other players, but I also really enjoyed the three boss fights I got to play. The first, which I ran into during the story mode, started off as a one-on-one brawl before the boss in question brought out her skyscraper-sized snake, forcing me to play around its massive fangs before its master would come down and I could get back to the fine art of knocking her out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Arena fighters are a tricky business, but so far Morefun has nailed the balance of simplicity, depth, and game feel that any good fighter needs.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If that’s not enough for you, though, there’s also Trial mode, where you can face off against a boss with any of the characters you’ve got. There were two available in the demo I played, and both were challenging, especially on the highest of the available difficulties. Both eventually went down, but they forced me to use characters I knew, pick my spots, and learn their patterns. It’s a fun change of pace for a game like this, and I’m eager to see what other fights look like in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When my time with The Hidden Ones ended, I left excited, and wishing I could have played more, especially more multiplayer. But I left with a good idea of what Morefun is trying to accomplish, and I liked how much cool stuff there was and how unique and interesting the characters they’ve created here are. Arena fighters are a tricky business, but so far Morefun has nailed the balance of simplicity, depth, and game feel that any good fighter needs while providing more to do if you’re not looking to throw down online. I’m excited to see where The Hidden Ones goes, and in the meantime, I’ll be thinking about landing that Ultimate Skill at the right moment, and how cool it was that The Hidden Ones gave me the options to play how I wanted in that moment. Like its characters, The Hidden Ones knows even when the chips are down and the outcome is uncertain, there’s always a play to be made, hidden in plain sight.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Free Counter-Strike 2 cases are hard to come by, and even if you do get your hands on one, it won’t open for free. Counter-Strike cases, the keys that open them, and the items inside have formed the foundation of a trading market now worth millions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how to get CS2 cases for free.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-free-counter-strike-2-cases">How to get free Counter-Strike 2 cases</h2>



<p>Players can get one free Counter-Strike 2 case from the in-game weekly care package. Every week, once a player reaches their next XP rank, they can select two of four available rewards. A case is always included in this group of rewards.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The weekly care package resets every Tuesday at 8pm CT. The weekly care package window can be found in the store, but it will pop up automatically after a player levels up their XP rank. Players can level up their XP rank by playing games using official matchmaking. More XP is earned by playing full-length matches in competitive or Premier mode.</p>



<p>Aside from this method, players can also sometimes get free cases from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS2 skin gambling</a> websites. In almost all cases, players have to sign up and use the site in order to get the free cases. Cases on these sites are typically site-specific, and don’t have the same odds and items as the official cases bought and sold through Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-cheap-counter-strike-2-cases">How to get cheap Counter-Strike 2 cases</h2>



<p>Getting only one case per week for free is a very slow method for acquiring cases. Thankfully, players with money in their Steam account can purchase cases for just a few cents.</p>



<p>On the Steam community market, players can go to the CS2 section and filter by the “Container” item type. There they can sort by price and find cases that sell for less than $0.50 like the Recoil Case, the Snakebite Case, and the Fracture Case. Players can even put in a “request to buy” at a specific price that will automatically purchase a case when it reaches a low enough price point.</p>



<p>Which case did you get in your last weekly care package? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you’ve got spare CSGO or CS2 skins and you’re feeling lucky,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-wheezy-indiana-jones-is-incredibly-relatable.1064973/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-immersive-machinegames<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/wolfenstein-new-order-colossus-machinegames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Despite my respect for the developers</a> and my own fondness for the character, when I saw the first trailer for <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> last year I was worried!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e17p2IVDUU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> It featured a lot of movement and a lot of combat</a>, and I thought (while simultaneously recalling the pedestrian pace of the single best <em>Indiana Jones</em> adaptation to day, <em>Fate of Atlantis</em>) hrm that's weird, it's going to feel off to be playing an Indiana Jones game if he's suddenly been imbued with the strength and agility of a 1930s Nathan Drake.</p><p>How relieving it's been, then, to sit down and finally play the game, and find that he's actually one of the most relatable video game protagonists of all time. Indy is anyone <em>but </em>Nathan Drake. He's 38 years old by the time of <em>Great Circle</em>, getting on by any standards, but I'd wager especially so for the period, without the scientifically-formulated diet and strict exercise regime we expect a reasonably active 38-year-old from today to be engaging in.</p><p>Which is me easing into politely saying Indy is slow as shit. He's not that fit, panting after the shortest jog (though you can boost his stamina via upgrades throughout the game), and his body complains loudly when he has to crawl through things. He's really only equipped to take on one person at a time in melee combat, and even then that can be a struggle. Shooting, while present in the game, is a last resort; professional soldiers are much better at it than a university professor.</p><p>Everything seems a struggle for our guy, basically, and my favourite of Indy's various physical struggles is the game's platforming. There are no death-defying leaps or parkour-like jumps here; you are playing as a 38-year-old man and he moves like it. Climbing your whip elicits grunts like he can't get himself up off the couch, while clambering up a ledge sounds more Sisyphean than Herculean. This dude is struggling to get around, to the point where I feel bad asking him to do anything but walk in a straight line.</p><p>I feel bad partly because I am also a middle-aged man, and this shit is hard! I can't even walk down the stairs on a Friday morning after Thursday night five-a-side, so Indy's body protesting every time he's gotta haul himself over some stones is extremely relatable. There but for the grace of god, and a few decades of time (I even studied archaeology at university!), go I.</p><p>Playing as a slow, creaky 38-year-old doesn't sound fun when you put it like that, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I've seen some reviews paint <em>Great Circle</em> as an immersive sim, owing to how slow and methodical some of your actions are, like having to press a button to put a key in a door then push another button to actually open it. I guess in that way it <em>kinda </em>is (even if the true hallmark of an "immersive sim" is a branching game based on your choices, not a fastidious control scheme), but also this is just the Machinegames way, adapted to suit the material.</p><p>These guys have always obsessed over the first-person perspective, from when a bunch of them worked at Starbreeze on <em>Riddick</em> through to <em>Wolfenstein </em>and now this, and have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of its immersion with every game. While some things are new here compared to something like the <em>Wolfenstein </em>series--like the aforementioned door opening--the slower pace and less audacious moveset is mostly down to the fact we're playing a middle-aged academic here instead of a super soldier wearing power armour. If we're supposed to be walking in the character's boots, and that character is slow and methodical, then so is this game.</p><p>Which I don't think is immersive in terms of the genre label; it's just a recalibration of what we should expect from our playable characters. I like that Indy being slow makes me consider which missions I'm tackling on a larger map at any time, so I don't have to walk all the way across it for nothing. I like that not being able to leap huge chasms or clamber up walls makes me look at each room like I would as a human being, not as some hyperactive jackrabbit with a camera strapped to their neck.</p><p>All of which helps ground you in the experience in the most wonderful way. We're not playing a regular video game with Indiana Jones on the cover, where you can bounce off walls and kill six Nazis in a combo move. We're playing an Indiana Jones game AS Indiana Jones, tedium and downtime and goofs all, which makes it a triumph not just as an immersive experience, but as an adaptation as well.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-outlaws-review-impressions-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I was only just talking about this the other day with <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>! About the joys of a great adaptation, of a team recognising what it is people really love about a thing and bringing it into a game. For <em>Outlaws</em> it was vibes, but here it's the man himself, with players able to possess Indy and play through all his limitations as well as his strengths. In <em>Outlaws </em>I was living in the Star Wars<em> </em>universe, but here the player IS the Indiana Jones universe.</p><p>It's an emphasis that's at the very heart of the game, with director Jerk Gustafsson<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/indiana-jones-the-great-circle-director-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> telling Inverse</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“To be honest, that was probably a harder sell internally...I remember reading this quote, I think it was from Spielberg who said ‘Indiana Jones is a non-superhero superhero.’ That became one of the core values of the project. Of course he’s still fit and can handle himself. But he’s also a 35-plus-year-old professor. I had this goal of trying to make it grounded in that way.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>They absolutely nailed it, and both me and my tired bones are so glad they did.&nbsp;<br></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324594/intel-performance-arrow-lake-core-ultra-200s-cpus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel’s new Arrow Lake CPUs came out in October promising high performance at lower power levels, but reviews, including ours, noted surprisingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278407/intel-ultra-9-285k-benchmarks-performance-hands-on">lackluster gaming performance</a>. Tom Warren said of the Core Ultra 9 285K, “...in many titles, it provides worse performance than the 14th Gen chips it was designed to replace.”</p><div><p>Now, <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Field-Update-1-of-2-Intel-Core-Ultra-200S-Series-Performance/post/1650490">the troubled chipmaker says</a> it has been gradually releasing updates that fixed most of the issues it identified, as <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intels-arrow-lake-performance-fix-is-now-available-another-update-coming-next-month">reported earlier by <em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a>.</p></div><p>“At the end of the day, there were four root issues that we needed to address, and fixes for those are actually already in the field right now,” Robert Hallock, Intel’s VP and GM of client AI and technical marketing said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6rwTGJTcOQ">during an interview with <em>HotHardware</em></a>. “They’ve been coming out over the last two weeks or so in drips and drabs, as update schedules allow.”</p><p>One issue stemmed from a “mistimed” update that was supposed to optimize Windows’ processor power management (PPM) system for Intel’s Core Ultra 200S-series processors. (PPM adjusts the performance of a CPU based on the current power plan, such as Balanced, High Performance, Power Saver, etc). </p><p>Instead of releasing the PPM update before reviewers got their hands on the processors, Intel says it scheduled the update to go out when it became widely available, which may have caused reviewers to see worse-than-expected performance. Due to the missing PPM update, Intel’s performance-boosting Application Performance Optimizer (APO) also couldn’t take effect in games, while “misconfigured” performance settings also had a negative impact on reviewers’ benchmarks.</p><p>A fix was already applied for these issues in&nbsp;Windows 11 build 26100.2161. Intel also says Epic Games resolved a driver compatibility issue <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc">causing the blue screen of death</a> when running games with Easy Anti-Cheat, such as <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>.</p><p>Intel is planning to release another set of performance upgrades for Arrow Lake CPUs in January, and it will “provide a comprehensive performance update” at CES. For now, Intel recommends updating Windows and applying the latest BIOS update to your motherboard if you haven’t already. Otherwise, you can wait until the “final” performance update next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Sword and Fairy 4: Remake Confirmed, Debut Trailer Released]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/sword-and-fairy-4-remake-confirmed-debut-trailer-released/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sword-and-fairy-4-remake-confirmed-debut-trailer-released.1064952/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sword-and-fairy-4-remake-confirmed-debut-trailer-released/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For those who had the chance to play the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sword-and-fairy-7-is-the-latest-stunning-nvidia-rtx-graphical-showcase/">Sword and Fairy games</a> when they were younger, it has now been confirmed that Sword and Fairy 4 is being remade. This has been announced with a debut trailer, which showcases the game with new graphics, as the title has been made in Unreal Engine 5. The developers are using the latest technology to recreate the original Sword and Fairy 4 experience. At the moment, details about this game are very slim. However, it's known that the game will be available on console and PC in the future when it eventually releases.</p>
<p><iframe title="《仙劍奇俠傳四》重製版前導PV（繁中）" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hG4_GqYnKs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This title is being developed by Up Software and published by Cube Game. Again, it's relatively hard to find any information about these studios and their history in the game industry, as it will bring up a lot of irrelevant results on the search engine.</p>
<p>Sword and Fairy 4 is a single-player RPG that is "reborn" using Unreal Engine 5, where you get to go on a journey full of adventure and battle to try and find the immortals with Tianhe Yun's team. On this journey, a hidden truth that has managed to remain hidden away from the public is starting to unravel, with people finding out the truth.</p>
<p>Sword and Fairy as a franchise is the most famous Chinese RPG series, but outside of South East Asia, it's unlikely that you will have heard of it, as it's not widely available internationally. As a result, people have had to turn to emulation and YouTube videos or Twitch streams to see more of Sword and Fairy.</p>
<p>For South East Asian gamers, it's very clear that this franchise means a lot, especially to the Chinese audience. From the comments alone that you can translate via Google, a lot of people are overjoyed and incredibly emotional about the game being remade, showing that the game has had a lot of emotional impact on gamers over the years. Many of the comments even refer to the original game as a masterpiece, so it seems that players are in for a great experience.</p>
<p>As the entire trailer is in Chinese, it's uncertain at the moment whether this game will be available globally or just be accessible to the Asian audience. Minimal details about the game have been revealed, as this is the first sighting of the Sword and Fairy 4 Remake.</p>
<p>The original Sword and Fairy 4 game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621680/Sword_and_Fairy_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on Steam</a>, a title that was first released in 2007. However, if you want to play it, the game is only available in Chinese.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Friday, we brought you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">leaked dimensions of the next Nintendo Switch</a> from the most likely source yet: a “3D scan of the actual hardware” obtained by case manufacturer Dbrand. But case manufacturers aren’t the<em> only</em> source of leaks.</p><p>A Redditor named “NextHandheld” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hdvb2d/ive_come_from_the_future/">claims to have seen and touched</a> an actual final retail unit of the Nintendo Switch 2. I spoke with them, and I’ve now heard and seen enough to think they might be legit.</p><p>In particular, I’ve seen two photos of a possible Nintendo Switch 2 dock, and one photo of the <em>inside</em> of a possible Switch 2 controller rail, covered in certification logos and with copper contacts exposed, which also shows its metal kickstand hinge open at an angle. Notably, the dock was <em>not</em> included in the 3D scan that’s circulating among case manufacturers.</p><p>If NextHandheld is telling the truth, we now know a good bit more about Nintendo’s next console. For example: as much as we’d love it to be called the “Super Nintendo Switch,” it’ll likely be introduced as the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.  </p><p><h3>Name and date</h3></p><p>Officially, Nintendo has only called it “the successor to Nintendo Switch,” promised to formally announce the new console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">by March 31st, 2025</a>, and revealed that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">be backward compatible</a> with original Switch games.</p><p>Unofficially, NextHandheld’s source has heard it might be announced as soon as January — and shared what they claim is first-hand evidence with <em>The Verge</em> that it is the Nintendo Switch 2. I saw a picture of a dock, with the same logo as as the original Nintendo Switch, only with a 2 attached. </p><p>And while NextHandheld says they’re “disappointed” that the dock doesn’t seem to have any more ports than the original — two USB-A, one HDMI, one ethernet, and one USB-C likely used for its power brick — it may have a <em>different</em> trick up its sleeve.</p><p><h3>Magnetic controllers — finally with drift-resistant joysticks</h3></p><p>In April, <a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350770848/exclusiva-switch-2-conocemos-en-primicia-nuevos-detalles-de-la-proxima-consola-de-nintendo/">Spanish pub Vandal</a>&nbsp;(which correctly reported&nbsp;<a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350744733/nuevos-detalles-exclusivos-de-switch-pro-pantalla-tamano-dock-llegada-a-europa/">minor details of the Switch OLED</a>&nbsp;before launch) reported that, incredibly, Nintendo might replace the Switch’s controller rails with <em>magnets</em> so your Joy-Cons can magically snap into place. </p><p>Today, it no longer seems incredible, because the photo I saw of a joystick rail region contains no rail: it’s just a long, rounded, hollow area, with a 13-pin connector that sticks out so it can slot into the Joy-Con. NextHandheld says there’s a physical magnetic click when you attach them, and that you’ll press a much larger button on the controller, one that’s physically connected to a magnet, to release. (You can see mockups of such buttons <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">in our Dbrand story</a>.)</p><p>More importantly, the Nintendo Switch 2 might finally get rid of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23571821/nintendo-switch-joy-con-joystick-drift-button">the infamous “Joy-Con Drift” that plagues its controllers to this day</a>. NextHandheld claims the controllers will have magnetic Hall effect joysticks, which don’t contain the same deteriorating sensor material and can be recalibrated easily. </p><p><h3>A U-shaped kickstand</h3></p><p>The original Nintendo Switch had a tiny, easy-to-topple gumstick of a kickstand, and the Switch OLED had a wide, flat plate. But the Nintendo Switch 2 will feature a U-shaped rail of a kickstand, according to a photo that NextHandheld shared with me. </p><p>I understand that the 3D CAD file shows the U-shape, too — and case manufacturers have begun sharing images of similar U-shaped kickstands, too. But it looks like it could be beefier than some of the mockups floating around:</p><p><h3>Extra power when docked?</h3></p><div><p>Once upon a time, Nintendo was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/nintendo-to-use-new-nvidia-graphics-chip-in-2021-switch-upgrade">reportedly planning to release a Nintendo Switch Pro</a>, one that would output 4K graphics when docked to your TV, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22348095/nintendo-switch-nvidia-dlss-graphics-ai-explained">at least partly thanks to Nvidia’s DLSS AI upscaling</a>. That didn’t happen, but the Nintendo Switch 2’s dock might be designed to let the handheld run a bit faster. </p></div><p>On Reddit, NextHandheld cryptically teased that asking if the dock had a fan was “the right question,” and in a picture shared with <em>The Verge</em>, I can see the alleged dock has big feet <em>around back, </em>ones positioned so it can lie down horizontally without blocking a set of vents. </p><p>While I don’t imagine you’d intentionally put it on its back, as the handheld might fall out of the completely open slot up top, I can imagine Nintendo wanting to make sure the console doesn’t overheat if you accidentally knock it over. </p><p>Intriguingly, NextHandheld says the dock is rated for 60W, while the Switch 2 is rated for 45W, both of which would be substantially higher than the original if true. The original Switch had an unusual 39W charger for both docked and handheld modes, which only provided up to 18W for the handheld.</p><p><h3>The many things we still don’t know</h3></p><p>You can dig through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NextHandheld/comments/">NextHandheld’s Reddit comments</a> or read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hf06co/switch_2_ama_with_next_handheld_summarized/">this early summary</a> for a lot more possible details about the new console. But the Redditor is upfront that they never got to turn the handheld on, or play any games. They don’t know whether a Switch 2 can play original Switch cartridges, or only digital Switch 1 games. They don’t know if it has a microphone, or a camera, or how much storage space it has, or its performance, or anything about its reportedly 8-inch screen, or its launch titles.</p><p>They do say it will launch in dark grey, however, like the original Nintendo Switch, and that it will be followed by a white model, and one themed with a Nintendo game that hasn’t received a themed Switch yet. And, they’re the latest to possibly corroborate a new second USB-C port on the top, though that was obviously revealed in the 3D scan.</p><p>If it’s true that Nintendo will announce the Switch 2 in January, though, you won’t have to wait long for more answers — or to find out if these ones are true.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>This week, several Polish websites <a href="https://www.gram.pl/news/microsoft-wycofuje-xboxy-w-polsce-konsola-stala-sie-niedostepna-w-sprzedazy#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Xbox Series X consoles were nowhere to be found in stores. These reports sparked rumors that Microsoft would essentially retire from selling the hardware in the European country.</p>
<p>We reached out to Microsoft and received the following comment from a spokesperson:</p>
<p><em>While we expect to have limited Xbox Series X supply in Poland this holiday due to player demand, Xbox Series S consoles will still be available. Players can visit <a href="http://xbox.com/regions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xbox.com/regions</a> to learn more about how to play with Xbox.</em></p>
<p>Fans of the Green team have been increasingly antsy following Microsoft's big policy change around first-party games. More games are getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ported</a> to other consoles (chiefly Sony's PlayStation 5) right away, and there's a growing concern that this, coupled with the consistently low sales for the past couple of years, might eventually persuade Microsoft to just give up on its own console ecosystem and focus on making games for all platforms instead.</p>
<p>It does not seem like there's much to worry about on that front for the time being. At the same time, there's no guarantee that the situation will not change in the future.</p>

While on court, a woman read their Christmas letters to Santa and handed out gifts. One kid, who worked <em>really </em>hard to get good grades this year, wanted a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904">PlayStation 5</a></span> console. And that’s what the kid got. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can see how happy he is in the video below</a></span>. But that video also claims that after halftime, staff took away the PS5 and replaced it with a jersey. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boston25news.com/news/national/hornets-apologize/PWWEP5OU5PE76JIMXXOKDX36FM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/national/hornets-apologize/PWWEP5OU5PE76JIMXXOKDX36FM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Boston 25 </em>explained</a></span> that cheerleaders and other people involved in the halftime event were reportedly confused when staff took away the kid’s PS5 gift. Apparently, the child’s uncle, likely the adult in the grey and blue hoodie in the video above, knew ahead of time that the gift would be taken away and failed to share that info with his nephew.</p><p>As you might expect, a team worth billions cheaping out and taking away a kid’s Christmas gift after pretending to give it to him in front of cameras didn’t go over well online. People rightfully called out the team and its staff for the horrible prank, and within 24 hours the Hornets issued an apology. </p><p>On Tuesday, the team said its “on-court skit...missed the mark” and blamed it on “bad decision making and poor communication.” </p><p><em>“</em>Simply put, we turned the ball over and we apologize.

Our goal is and will remain to elevate the guest experience for every person that enters Spectrum Center, and to show our fans how much we appreciate their relentless support.”</p><p>And if you were wondering: The Hornets received karmic justice Monday night after taking away the kid’s PS5. The team went on to lose 121-108 to the Sixers. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to the lawsuit, Gioeli says he was only aware “Live &amp; Learn” had been used in the original release of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, and was only clued into all the other times it had been used by a fan in 2024.</p><p>Gioeli is looking to the court for clarity on who owns the masters of the original song and is seeking compensation for all the uses of the song beyond those in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. Gioeli confirmed earlier this year that he had signed a deal with Paramount allowing the use of “Live &amp; Learn” in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>. He has been in contact with at least two lawyers regarding the dispute, one from Sega who told him he didn’t have rights to the song, and another who allegedly called the song a “joint work,” making Gioeli entitled to “50 percent of Sega’s profits” from the song. The singer’s lawyer says that damages would include $500,000, along with at least another $500,000 for unpaid royalties.</p><p>In a statement to <em>Polygon</em>, Gioeli said he wants to maintain his relationship with Sega and doesn’t want this to sully the memories fans have made with Crush 40’s music.</p><p>“I have no comment other than my desire to maintain the preservation of a long standing beautiful relationship with Sega,” Gioeli said in his statement to <em>Polygon</em>. “I do not want fans to draw conclusions or be disrupted from the beautiful memories we have made collectively with this music. I believe and hope we will come to a peaceful settlement that will be fair and just.”</p><p>Crush 40 have been featured in several <em>Sonic</em> games since the original <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, having contributed music to games like <em>Sonic Heroes</em>, <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>, and <em>Sonic and the Black Knight</em>. Though their contributions to the series have become more scarce in recent years, their music has been re-used in several games, including this year’s <em>Shadow Generations</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In theory, it ought to be as good a time as ever to be a gamer on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Classic console emulators have rolled out to the platform for the first time, and they work great. There are strong libraries of non-skeezy mobile games on Apple Arcade and Netflix Games, streaming via Xbox and PlayStation services is continuing apace, and there are even a few AAA console games now running natively on the platform, like Assassin's Creed and Resident Evil titles.</p>
<p>Some of those games need a traditional, dual-stick game controller to work well, though, and Apple bafflingly offers no first-party solution for this.</p>
<p>Yes, you can sync popular Bluetooth controllers from Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and 8bitdo with your iPhone, but that's not really the ideal answer—your iPhone isn't a big TV sitting across the room or a computer monitor propped up on your desk.</p>
<p>A few companies have jumped in to solve this with attachable controllers that give the iPhone a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck-like form factor (albeit a lot smaller). There's a wide range of quality, though, and some of the ones you'll see advertised aren't very well made.</p>
<p>There's some debate out there, but there's one that just about anyone will at least put up for consideration: the Backbone One. That's the one I picked for my new iPhone 16 Pro Max, which I have loaded with emulators and tons of games.</p>
<p>Since many folks are about to get iPhone 16s for the holidays and might be in the market for something similar, I figured it'd be a good time to write some quick impressions, including pros and cons. Is this thing worth a $99 price tag? What about its subscription-based app?</p>
<h2>Switching from the Razer Kishi</h2>
<p>Here's some background, real quick: I previously owned an iPhone 13 Pro, and I played a lot of <em>Diablo Immortal</em>. I wanted to try the controller experience with that game, so I bought a first-generation Razer Kishi—which I liked for the most part. It had excellent thumbsticks that felt similar to those you'd find on an Xbox controller, if a little bit softer.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That said, its design involved a back that loosened up and flexed to fit different kinds of phones, but I found it annoying to take on or off because it immediately crumbled into a folding mess. The big issue that made me go with something else, though, was that the controller worked with a Lightning port, and my new iPhone traded that for USB-C. That's a good change, overall, but it did mean I had to replace some things.</p>
<p>The Kishi I had is now discontinued, and it's been replaced with the Kishi V2, which looks... less appealing to me. That's because it ditches those Xbox-like sticks for ones more similar to what you see with a Nintendo Switch. There's less range of motion and less stability.</p>
<figure>

<p>The Backbone One has similar drawbacks, but I was drawn to the Backbone as an alternative partly because I had enough complaints about the Kishi that I wanted to roll the dice on something new. I also wanted a change because there's a version with PlayStation button symbols—and I planned to primarily play PS1 games in an emulator as well as stream PS5 games to the device instead of a PlayStation Portal.</p>
<h2>Solid hardware</h2>
<p>One of my big complaints about the first-generation Kishi (the folding and flimsy back) isn't an issue with the Backbone One. It's right there in the name: This accessory has a sturdy plastic backbone that keeps things nice and stable.</p>
<p>The PlayStation version I got has face buttons and a directional pad that seem like good miniature counterparts to the buttons on Sony's DualSense controller. The triggers and sticks offer much shallower and less precise control than the DualSense, though—they closely resemble the triggers and sticks on the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons.</p>
<figure>

      </figure>

<p>I feel that's a big downside. It's fine for some games, but if you're playing any game built around quickly and accurately aiming in a 3D environment, you'll feel the downgrade compared to a real controller.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The product feels quite sturdy to hold and use, and it doesn't seem likely to break anytime soon. The only thing that bugs me on that front is that the placement of the USB-C port for connecting to the phone is in a place where it takes enough force to insert or remove it that I'm worried about wear and tear on the ports on either my phone or the controller. Time will tell on that front.</p>

<h2>There’s an app, but...</h2>
<p>The Backbone One is not just a hardware product, even though I think it'd be a perfectly good product without any kind of software or service component.</p>
<p>There is a Backbone app that closely resembles the PlayStation 5's home screen interface (this is not just for the PlayStation version of the controller, to be clear). It offers a horizontally scrolling list of games from multiple sources like streaming services, mobile game subscription services, or just what's installed on your device. It also includes voice chat, multiplayer lobbies, streaming to Twitch, and content like video highlights from games.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>

      The Backbone One app collects games from different sources into one browsing interface.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Unfortunately, all this requires a $40 annual subscription after a one-month trial. The good news is that you don't have to pay for the Backbone One's subscription service to use it as a controller with your games and emulators.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone anywhere was asking for a subscription-based app for their mobile game controller. The fact that one is offered proves two things. First, it shows you just how niche this kind of product still is (and transitively, the current state of playing traditional, console-style games on iPhone) that the company that made it felt this was necessary to make a sufficient amount of money.</p>
<p>Second, it shows how much work Apple still needs to do to bake these features into the OS to make iOS/iPadOS a platform that is competitive with offerings from Sony, Microsoft, or even Nintendo in terms of appeal for core rather than casual gamers. That involves more than just porting a few AAA titles.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<h2>The state of iPhone gaming</h2>
<p>The Backbone One is a nice piece of hardware, but many games you might be excited to play with it are better played elsewhere or with something else.</p>
<p>Hit games with controller support like <em>Genshin Impact</em>, <em>Call of Duty Mobile</em>, and <em>Infinity Nikki</em> all have excellent touch-based control schemes, making using a gamepad simply a matter of preference rather than a requirement.</p>
<p>While Apple is working with publishers like Capcom and Ubisoft to bring some hardcore console titles to the platform, that all still seems like just dipping toes in the water at this point, because they're such a tiny slice of what's on offer for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, or even Nintendo Switch players.</p>
<p>In theory, AAA game developers should be excited at the prospect of having iPhone players as a market—the install base of the iPhone absolutely dwarfs all home and handheld consoles combined. But they're facing two barriers. The first is a chicken-and-egg problem: Only the most recent iPhones (iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 16 series) have supported those console AAA titles, and it will take a few years before most iPhone owners catch up.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      Emulators like RetroArch (seen here running on an iPhone 16 Pro Max) are the main use case of the Backbone One.

                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>The second is that modern AAA games are immensely expensive to produce, and they (thankfully) don't typically have robust enough in-game monetization paths to be distributed for free. That means that to profit and not cannibalize console and PC sales, publishers need to sell games for much higher up-front costs than mobile players are accustomed to.</p>
<p>So if mobile-first hardcore games are best played with touchscreens, and gamepad-first console games haven't hit their stride on the platform yet, what's the point of spending $100 on a Backbone One?</p>
<p>The answer is emulators, for both classic and homebrew games. For that, I've been pleased with the Backbone One. But if your goal is to play modern games, the time still hasn't quite come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/vote-for-your-favorite-games-of-2024-in-the-ign-peoples-choice-tournament<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A bracket of 64 titles will crown one ultimate winner.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">From iconic names like Indiana Jones and Final Fantasy to indie sensations like Balatro and Animal Well, 2024 has provided gamers with a variety of incredible experiences. IGN is in the process of picking our game of the year, but now you have the chance to have your voice heard too in the IGN People’s Choice Tournament.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With our partners at Truth, we’ve selected 64 of the best titles of the year to be placed in a bracket and randomly sorted into groups. They’ll go head-to-head, with the winner moving on to the next round and the loser being eliminated. As the rounds progress, the competition will get tougher, until there’s only one title left standing as the fan-voted Game of the Year. If you’re familiar with how March Madness brackets work, it’s the same concept.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Tournament Schedule and How to Vote</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Voting will take place on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/igndotcom/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IGN’s Instagram</u></a> starting today, December 18. We’ll post the matchups to our Instagram stories around 3 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. CT / 12 p.m. PT, and you’ll have 24 hours to vote. The 32 winners will move on to the next round, where the process will repeat. Here are the dates when each round will be posted (around the same times listed above), so make sure to check back on our Instagram stories to continue voting for your favorite games:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Round 1: December 18</li><li>Round 2: December 20</li><li>Round 3: December 23</li><li>Quarterfinals: December 27</li><li>Semifinals: December 30</li><li>Finals: December 31</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Which Games Are Grouped Together?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As we mentioned earlier, the bracket placements of the 64 games we selected were randomized. They were split up into four groups, like the regions of March Madness. Group 1 is led by some heavy hitters: Helldivers 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. But they’ll have to go up against breakout indie Animal Well. Plus, three popular sports games: Madden NFL 25, College Football 25, and MLB The Show 24. And you can’t look past the beautiful visuals of Unicorn Overlord and Infinity Nikki.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Group 2 is led by the excellent Silent Hill 2 remake, but it’ll face stiff competition from a trio of RPGs — Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. There’s also heralded remasters and remakes from Nintendo with Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. And we can’t leave out the technical marvel Senua’a Sage: Hellblade II, or another standout indie in Lorelai and the Laser Eyes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Group 3 ended up stacked with three games that have been cleaning up during awards season: Astro Bot, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and Black Myth: Wukong. They’re joined by an eclectic group of competitors. There’s entries from massive franchises in Star Wars Outlaws and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 (which will face off against each other in Round 1). There’s games from other long-running series in Tekken 8 and Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble. There’s the latest version of sports franchises in EA Sports FC 25 and NBA 2K25. But also some notable new IPs with Stellar Blade and Slitterhead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding things out, Group 4 is also full of some big names. First, there’s indie darling Balatro, which has also done very well for itself this awards season. But it’ll have to get through two huge RPG sequels in Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and Dragon’s Dogma 2, as well as a popular RPG remake in Persona 3 Reload. And they’ll be up against several family-friendly opponents in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, LEGO Horizon Adventures, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and The Plucky Squire. Not to mention the often overlooked Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and surprise hit Enshrouded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can see, this year is going to be a hotly contested race. So make sure you head over to Instagram to vote for each matchup and help determine which games will move on and which will be sent packing. It’ll all build to a big reveal of the fan voted Game of the Year. Happy voting!</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-features-arrives-next-week</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-features-arrives-this-week.1064874/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-features-arrives-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Official <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew support is coming. The developers of the digital TTRPG, Riftweaver, announced they would be rolling out more custom features for Game Masters earlier this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">starting with music</a>. Starting this week, making custom NPCs will be added to their tools.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC Homebrew announcement</h2>

<p>The first phase of the <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew update was announced via <a href="https://x.com/FablecraftGame/status/1869417434958205409" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) through the official <em>Fablecraft</em> account. The post was a one minute, forty-seven second video showing the feature in action.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-custom-npc-menu-image.jpg?itok=46B0licP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-custom-npc-menu-image.jpg?itok=o0FY1M-Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The video shows one of the features called NPC Copy &amp; Customize. As the name entails, it allows you to take a preexisting NPC statblock, replicate it, then add custom text and images.</p>

<p>The video demonstrates this by taking a Meadow Hound creature and making it appear as one of the developer's dogs, Skipper. Players can give the NPCs custom names, subtitles, background information, description, token size, whether they are friend or foe, and their preferred region.</p>

<p>Notably, the <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew feature allows you to import images into the game. The image in question is limited to 10 MB and a JPG or PNG at 1920x 1080 resolution is recommended. The image can be adjusted and cropped in-game once it is uploaded.</p>

<p>There is also a check box that must be hit stating the image adheres to <em>Fablecraft's</em> Terms of Service. Obviously this is in place to prevent bad actors from uploading offensive, inflammatory, or otherwise transgressive images into the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-skipper-character-sheet.jpg?itok=1VvhT2nK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-skipper-character-sheet.jpg?itok=xFxSVshY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Custom NPCs made in this way or put into their own custom character area of the NPC sidetray, allowing Game Masters to quickly find and utilize their creations.</p>

<p>The feature is one more step towards <em>Fablecraft's</em> intended goal of making a digital RPG where players can enjoy the fantasy of a tabletop experience without in-depth knowledge of a certain RPG system. It's a fantasy so appealing the professional Game Master service <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-startplaying-partnership-announced-by-developers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">StartPlaying</a> partnered with them.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025.1064841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Counter-Strike players in 2025 will have the opportunity to capitalize on an entirely new landscape. Following post-Major roster changes and new rules implemented by Valve, the competitive CS2 scene will feel drastically different compared to years past.</p>



<p>Many of the same players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who dominated the 2024 season</a> will almost certainly do so again in 2025. Obviously you should be watching established greats like donk, m0NESY, ZywOo, and others next year. But rather than highlight the best players of 2024 who will repeat success again next year, we’re going to look at players ready to break into the top echelon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-to-watch-in-2025">Best CS2 Players to Watch in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-mario-malbsmd-samayoa">Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa</h3>



<p>With long-time rifler Nikola “NiKo” Kovač set to depart for Falcons, G2 is looking to Argentinian rising star malbsMd to step up another level. malbsMd was brought in from North American roster M80 this past summer and made an immediate impact on G2. He showcased his star capabilities at some of the biggest events of the year, including the recent Shanghai Major. NiKo has big shoes to fill, but with G2 also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-will-reportedly-keep-cs2-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly holding on to superstar AWPer Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov</a>, malbsMd is in a great position to take a huge leap forward.</p>



<h3 id="h-roland-ultimate-tomkowiak">Roland “ultimate” Tomkowiak</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>There’s no shortage of incredible AWPers in CS2, and Team Liquid’s ultimate looks primed and ready to reach that top tier. Liquid grabbed ultimate from the Polish roster of Illuminar Gaming this past year, and outside of IEM Rio and the final BLAST events, he’s been splendid. At his first ever Major, he was a bright spot during Liquid’s playoff run, providing incredible value as both an AWPer and a secondary entry player.</p>



<h3 id="h-dorian-xertion-berman">Dorian “xertioN” Berman</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The current MOUZ lineup is absolutely stacked with young talent, but xertioN gets the nod here. The Israeli 20-year-old player is a prolific main entry player, with an ability to properly utilize utility in a way that’s invaluable to MOUZ. MOUZ made a number of deep playoff runs this year, and won ESL Pro League Season 19, thanks to spectacular play from xertioN. Since his return from a VAC ban, Jimi “Jimpphat” Salo has also been spectacular for MOUZ.</p>



<p>Who else is worth watching when the CS2 2025 season begins?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you’ve got spare CSGO or CS2 skins and you’re feeling lucky,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

Steam Replay includes all of your playtime between January 1 to December 14, and doesn't include any playtime played in offline mode or when disconnected from the internet.</p><p>The tool offers a bunch of different stats, including how many games you played this year, how many Steam Achievements you've unlocked, and your longest playing streak calculated by days. It also shows your favorite genres, which of your games took up the highest percentage of overall playtime, and how much time you spent between different platforms such as Windows PC and Steam Deck.</p><p>There's a timeline that shows which games you've played each month and compares your stats to the average Steam user's median. For example, the median number of achievements unlocked this year was 13 and the median number of games played is 4.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-check-out-your-playstation-2024-wrap-up/1100-6528359/" data-ref-id="1100-6528359">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-year-in-review-2024-unlocked-shows-your-most-played-game-and-busiest-month/1100-6528235/" data-ref-id="1100-6528235">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-year-in-review-for-2024-is-available-now-get-a-free-2025-calendar/1100-6528550/" data-ref-id="1100-6528550">Nintendo</a> have already released their own 2024 year-in-review tools.
