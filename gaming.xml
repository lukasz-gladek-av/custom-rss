            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-officially-gold-bioware-confirms/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, BioWare <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1842218290032111742" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> via Twitter (X) that Dragon Age: The Veilguard is officially gold. That means the game is basically finished, the physical copies are being prepared, and there is no chance of a delay (although, on extremely rare occasions, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-to-december-10th-cdpr-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that's been known to happen</a>).</p>
<p>The game will launch on October 31 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. It'll be almost ten years since the previous installment, Dragon Age: Inquisition, which debuted on November 18, 2014. Fans of the fantasy saga have been waiting for a very long time, mostly due to BioWare getting busy with Mass Effect Andromeda first and then Anthem, but the fourth Dragon Age installment also had its own development troubles. As noted in <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our roundup article</a>, Dragon Age Inquisition Game director Mike Laidlaw had prepared plans for a new game codenamed Joplin. This would have been a smaller installment focusing on a 'heist' in the region of the Tevinter Imperium magocracy. This iteration was, however, canceled in late 2017 (Laidlaw left the company around the same time) as Electronic Arts attempted to pivot the game toward a live service design. At the time, this new Dragon Age (codenamed Morrison) was described as "Anthem with dragons."</p>
<p>That wasn't the last major change of direction. After the massive failure of Anthem and the success of Respawn's single-player game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, EA eventually reconsidered its stance and allowed BioWare to drop the live service elements and resume development as a single-player title. Thus, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf was born. More recently, the title was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed</a> to highlight the main character's companions rather than the (supposed) villain.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for Dragon Age: The Veilguard are open now on PC and Xbox Series S|X, while PlayStation 5 pre-orders will open soon, according to BioWare. To dive more deeply into the game's features, check out our recent coverage from the preview event: <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-qa-no-side-quest-exists-without-contributing-to-the-narrative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Q&amp;A</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-roundtable-qa-the-conclusion-to-this-game-needs-to-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roundtable Q&amp;A</a>.</p>

    <div>
  

        <p>Progress will carry over from the demo, too</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windblown">Windblown</a> is an action roguelite much like Dead Cells, the previous game from developer Motion Twin, but it trades sidescrolling 'vania vibes for a 3D and more colourful world, and adds co-op for up to three pals. That sounds plenty appealing, and it now has a release date: October 24th. 
</p>
<p>Better still, on October 14th, it's getting a singleplayer demo as part of the Steam Next Fest.

<p>Dead Cells had fabulous-feeling combat and an exciting progression system that made each new run exciting. Despite the change in style and perspective, Windlbown seems to want to offer a similar experience as you dash and smash across floating sky islands.
</p>
<p>That dash is seemingly key, based on Edwin's impressions from seeing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dead-cells-developers-new-roguelike-windsblown-has-a-dash-so-potent-it-makes-the-game-seem-disposable">a Windblown presentation back at GDC</a>.
</p>
<p>"Windblown's dash seems expressive, at times, of deep impatience towards the rest of the game, which sounds perverse on the surface, but makes sense when you consider the roguelike's intrinsic element of repetition. It's a dash dedicated to the experienced player's desire to immediately return to the biome where they last popped their clogs," Edwin wrote. "There are some familiar elements that slow you down, however: boss enemies that must be fought to progress the story, and the basic pressure to defeat foes and gather new equipment, or else get your arse handed to you by an unskippable threat in the next biome along."
</p><p>My favourite times with Dead Cells came early in its Early Access, when it was likewise a game of dash-rolling impatience, and where most enemies could be bested via turret deployments and ladder-based cheese strats. Once the updates came, forcing me to slow and engage with its deeper systems, it was still fun but no longer freewheeling and frivolous. I'm inclined to hop on the Windblown train early, in case it charts a similar path.
</p>
<p>The demo seems a good place to start. It'll launch on October 14th, and while limited to singleplayer online, progress made will carry over to the full game ten days later. You'll find a few more details <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911610/Windblown/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So if you’re the type of person who gets a kick out of running dungeons, farming for loot, and beating down other folks in PVP, this massive Steam hit may just be right up your alley. But since it can all feel a bit overwhelming at first, we’ve got some tips for getting started on your adventure in <em>Throne and Liberty</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,195410,196299" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h169369"><a id=""></a><strong>Choose your server based on who you plan to play with</strong></h2><p>You can’t play with players from other servers in <em>Throne and Liberty</em>, so if you’re hoping to jump in with some pals, make sure you all agree to join the same server ahead of time. Of course, if you find that your friends have left you behind somehow—maybe they were distracted by a passing truck, and followed it from state to state, forgetting all about their MMO and friendships—you can always opt to pay for a Server Transfer Ticket—but that costs real money, so just get it right the first time, dammit.</p><h2 id="h169370"><a id=""></a><strong>Pick your weapons wisely, and stick with them</strong></h2><p>Part of the appeal of <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is its unique class system, that allows you to equip any two weapon types at the same time so that you can make use of each one’s passive and active skills simultaneously. But that doesn’t mean it’s a great idea to swap between a bunch of different combinations throughout the game—that is, unless you want to spend a <em>lot</em> of time grinding later on.</p><p>While you can certainly choose to swap weapon combos any time you’d like, you should be aware that the time and material investments necessary to level up each weapon type are rather extensive. As such, it’s a good idea to play around at the start, pick the combo you like early on, and stick with it until you’ve made significant progress with your initial weapons. Only then should you consider leveling new ones. Think of it like your stats are attached to the weapons.</p><p>You’ll get access to one of each type of weapon from the very beginning of the game, so it’s highly recommended that you spend as much time as you need attacking the target dummies in one of the early areas, trying out each combo until you’ve nailed down something that really works for you.</p><h2 id="h169371"><a id=""></a><strong>Every weapon combo is viable, but yes, there’s still a meta</strong></h2><p>Speaking of your weapon loadouts, you can rest assured that every combination in the game can handle <em>most</em> content, but that’s not to say that they’re all created equal. Indeed, combining these weapons is all about synergy, and not all loadouts will work as well together as others.</p><figure id="" data-id="05e757eefd69b956bb9e81f2d9bc87dc" data-recommend-id="image://05e757eefd69b956bb9e81f2d9bc87dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A frantic battle against an enormous skeletal baddun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A frantic battle against an enormous skeletal baddun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="05e757eefd69b956bb9e81f2d9bc87dc" data-recommend-id="image://05e757eefd69b956bb9e81f2d9bc87dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A frantic battle against an enormous skeletal baddun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s take, for instance, tanking. In this scenario, your two best options will be Sword &amp; Shield + Greatsword, or Sword &amp; Shield + Wand &amp; Tome. The former will let you deal more damage while tanking, and the latter will provide you with plenty of self-healing for sustainability. This doesn’t mean you can’t try other combinations—it simply means they’ll likely provide fewer benefits to you in more demanding content. Bringing something like a staff or longbow along with you as a tank really doesn’t add many useful defensive skills that will aid you in survivability, which can make your job a bit harder (as well as the job of your healer).<br></p><p>Regardless of whether you’re looking to tank, heal, or DPS, you should still absolutely play what you have the most fun with. Just don’t be shocked if you’re occasionally turned down for some of the game’s hardest dungeons and encounters by meta-focused groups.</p><h2 id="h169372"><a id=""></a><strong>Complete the early crafting and upgrade quests ASAP</strong></h2><p>Early in the game, you’ll receive a series of quests asking you to craft various accessories and upgrade pieces of gear. Do these as soon as possible. By upgrading different pieces of gear to Green quality and equipping multiple accessories, you’ll be able to increase your Combat Power (see: Gear Score), which is necessary to access dungeons and other content.</p><p>As an example, the game’s first main dungeon is unlocked at level 20, but you’ll need a Combat Power ranking of 600. If you complete the early quests that ask you to engage with this mechanic, you should easily hit that number almost immediately.</p><p><strong>You can see your Combat Power in your character screen</strong>, directly under where you level up your stats. Continue increasing it as frequently as possible by upgrading and enchanting your gear, or your improving skills.</p><h2 id="h169373"><a id=""></a><strong>Keep an eye out for a guild to join</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="a5545c2f84f870ef1e7a72fde69149db" data-recommend-id="image://a5545c2f84f870ef1e7a72fde69149db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Running toward a misty castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Running toward a misty castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a5545c2f84f870ef1e7a72fde69149db" data-recommend-id="image://a5545c2f84f870ef1e7a72fde69149db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Running toward a misty castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, joining any old guild isn’t usually a great call, but you’ll definitely want to look into finding one that suits you—<em>Throne and Liberty</em> is a very guild-focused experience. Being in a guild offers an abundance of benefits, such as access to guild contracts for earning Guild Coins, which can then be used to purchase unique items from a guild merchant. As a guild grows and levels up, you’ll also eventually be able to make use of guild skills that can offer buffs like bonus EXP or Sollant (money), decreased boss damage, or mana regeneration.</p><p>These guilds are a core component of the PVP experience, letting you form alliances with other guilds or mark an undesirable guild as hostile. You’ll be able to join together with your guildmates to try to occupy specific spots on the map for unique buffs and opportunities to fight specific raid bosses.</p><p>Alternatively, if joining someone else’s guild doesn’t appeal to you, you can always just create your own in the Guild menu—though you’ll want to be certain that you’re interested in recruiting and building a jolly band of guildmates if you want to reap the best benefits of having a guild. It’s going to be kind of hard to take on other guilds as a single person, ya know.<br></p><h2 id="h169374"><a id=""></a><strong>Fast travel to your heart’s content</strong></h2><p>Fast travel in <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is free until level 30. With that in mind, make sure you’re using the various waypoints across the map to move quickly between areas to turn in quests, or find any enemies or items you’re currently seeking.</p><p>Of course, to fast travel to a waypoint you’ll need to have interacted with it at least once previously, so don’t skip out on walking up to those suckers and saying hello with a quick button press—it’s gonna save you a hell of a lot of time.</p><p>Now get out there and see everything <em>Throne and Liberty</em> has to offer MMO fans. And if you’re curious about what’s happening in other MMOs right now, well, have you heard about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ff14-mmo-hippo-calf-price-increase-moo-deng-explained-1851661383&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ff14-mmo-hippo-calf-price-increase-moo-deng-explained-1851661383">this weird hippo obsession in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a></span>?

Placed 300 years after the story of Jin and Ghost of Tsushima, Ghost of Yotei takes us to a time of turmoil in the Hokkaido region, which was known as Ezo in 1603 and not really considered part of Japan. It was the perfect destination for fleeing Ronin and Wokou (aka pirates), who were escaping the newly appointed Tokugawa shogunate. Since the trailer released I’ve been poring over the details it contains, translating the text, brushing up on Japanese history, finding out about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsumae_clan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matsumae clan</a>, and learning all about the indigenous people called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainu</a>, because I’m incredibly hyped for Ghost of Yotei. Here’s why.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“We are beyond the edge of Japan.”&nbsp;</p></div><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Ghost of Yotei</h3></div></output><p>Let’s talk about that opening quote because knowing a bit of history helps set the stage as to why it’s important. In 1600 the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sekigahara" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battle of Sekigahara</a> took place, which was fought and won by famed warrior <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>. Following his victory he hunted down and executed those who stood against him and folded many into his shogunate if they accepted. By 1603 clans like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeda_clan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Takeda clan</a> – who may have their crest or one like it represented in the trailer – would have either joined Tokugawa or been left to their own fate.</p><p>In March of 1603,<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/ieyasu_tokugawa.shtml#:~:text=In%201600%20Ieyasu%20defeated%20the,to%20confirm%20his%20pre%2Deminence." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ieyasu was made Shogun</a> and guess which region was deemed important around that same time? That’s right, Ezo, which would explain the scene of Ronin and Pirates trying to burn down what we think might be a Tokugawa building or one teased to be like it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/04/ghost-of-ytei-announce-trailer-ps5-games-11-54-00-02-12-21-still015-1728065480721.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In addition to that turmoil, the Matsumae clan was defending the southern region of Ezo from the Ainu. Since Ezo wasn’t really considered part of Japan and the Ainu were local to the area there was friction between the two factions, which came to a head when the Ainu and Matsumae faced off in 1669 during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakushain%27s_revolt#References" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revolt of Shakushain</a> over control of the land. The Ainu are a very spiritual people believing that everything from flora and fauna to animals had a spirit. In fact they believe they were born from a union of a wolflike creature and a goddess. They also have a ritual involving bears who they consider to be gods, but more on that later.</p><p>In 1603 the conflict between the Ainu and Japanese was coming to a bit of a head. The Matsumae clan established a base on Ezo near the southern edge of the island, and would eventually build the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsumae_Castle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matsumae Castle in 1606</a>. Ezo was seen as an important point of defense from Russia, but it wasn’t until the Castle was built that trade was more well-established with the Ainu in 1606.</p><p>Also a fun fact about Mount Yotei. It’s referred to as the female mountain by the Ainu people but let’s not forget about the nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Y%C5%8Dtei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mt. Shiribetsu</a>, known as the male mountain is nearby and I believe it’s teased as a location a bit earlier.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“People will come north to disappear. But you… you are hunting.”</p></div><p>So how does our new protagonist Atsu fit into all of this? There’s a lot of Wolf iconography in the trailer, which is interesting because the now-extinct Ezo Wolf, also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido_wolf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ezo Okami</a>, are known as a god who had the power to dispel evil. They also symbolize mountain worship, which ties in nicely with Yotei’s setting. Atsu also has Wolf iconography on her hilt, which makes me wonder if she has ties to the Ainu, given their belief that many animals were gods roaming the earth, and the Wolf god's importance I noted earlier is particularly important in Ainu culture.</p><p>The Ainu loved animals, but despite this had ceremonies that by modern standards could be seen as somewhat violent. For example, the <a href="https://www.bears.org/spirit/ainumyth.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainu believed Bears</a> were gods waiting to be set free, so they would take bear cubs, raise them like they were their own children until they were about two years old, and then sacrifice them and drink their blood in a ritual they believed sent the god back to where they came from. It’s also interesting that Atsu has what appears to be a bearskin cloak for warmth. While this may not have been from the ritual itself, it could have been traded or acquired from the Ainu in some other manner related to the ritual. Sucker Punch has teased an upcoming video about the other animals we can expect in Ghost of Yotei so I’m intrigued to know more about the blood sacrifice… or maybe the Ural Owls of Ezo which would be a bit more my speed.</p><p>But beyond the bear cloak, Atsu also has several interesting traits that could paint her as having a Japanese background. Besides her stances, weapons, and attire which we’ll discuss in just a moment, her instrument, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsugaru-jamisen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tsugaru Shamisen</a>, is an interesting choice. The Shamisen was popular in the pleasure districts, highbrow theater, and even with folk music of Japan which have led some fans to wonder if Atsu may use subterfuge as a Geisha in Yotei. Her well-kept nails also lend to this theory as they looked pretty nice for a roaming Ronin who’s just committed a brutal murder. Regardless, the Shamisen is an interesting choice because while it has been depicted as a weapon in some Japanese cinema, chances are it’ll instead be a replacement for Jin's Shakuhachi (flute).</p><p>Japanese attire included a ghost mask that had been repaired with a technique known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi#:~:text=Kintsugi%20(Japanese%3A%20%E9%87%91%E7%B6%99%E3%81%8E%2C,gold%2C%20silver%2C%20or%20platinum." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kintsugi</a>. Kintsugi is the practice of fixing a break using a lacquer mixed with gold, and it was a very popular repair method of the time. The gold repair hints at the history of the item and was seen as beautiful by collectors. All this makes me wonder what story the mask seen in the trailer is hiding.</p><p>That question leaves us wondering how Atsu became a wandering Onna-musha warrior, which were basically the female version of a Ronin. Of course, there have been many well-documented Onna-musha throughout history, as it was common to train women to defend their homes and children during time of unrest. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomoe Gozen</a> one of the most feared <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onna-musha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Onna-musha</a> warriors of all time has been well documented, and while she is more of a legend who’s authenticity is debated, there are still plenty of documents about women going to battle in Feudal Japan. I imagine Atsu would be inspired by one of those stories.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/04/ghost-of-ytei-announce-trailer-ps5-games-11-54-00-01-04-17-still001-1728057550301.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Translation: "Wanted List. We have 100 Ryo rewards for this woman's head. There are rumors that she was witnessed on Mount Yoteizan. 28 or 29 years old.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For this time period, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yodo-dono" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yodo-dono</a> stands out to me as she has often been portrayed as fighting against the Tokugawa Shogunate. Yodo-dono was a concubine for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a>, and gave him two children. When Hideyoshi died in 1598, she was very powerful as the mother of Hideyoshi only heir. She declined meetings with the Tokugawa clan. Rebuilt Osaka Castle with a bell that read "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yodo-dono" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toyotomi's force will rise again</a>" and let's just say that was not received well by Ieyasu. It’s said that she resisted Tokugawa until she met her end in Osaka castle by committing suicide with her son.<strong> </strong> She’s an interesting character of the time period, who could make good inspiration for Atsu and has been portrayed many times in Japanese films, but I digress.</p><p>The bigger question for Atsu is why is she wanted? The sign we see in the trailer reads: “Wanted List. We have 100 Ryo rewards for this woman's head. There are rumors that she was witnessed on Mount Yoteizan. 28 or 29 years old.” Ryo isn’t the modern currency for Japan, but, let’s just say that’s a large bounty by today's standards.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Wanted List. We have 100 Ryo rewards for this woman's head. There are rumors that she was witnessed on Mount Yoteizan. 28 or 29 years old.”</p></div><p>Why does she have a list of names on her waist? The list reads Demon, Fox, Dragon, Spider, Snake, and Saito. Snake is crossed off with blood near the end of the trailer. Does that mean she has eliminated whomever Snake is? And who sent her and why is she on this quest?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/04/ghost-of-ytei-announce-trailer-ps5-games-11-54-00-02-16-04-still033-1728057183961.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The text reads Demon, Fox, Dragon, Spider, Snake, and what looks like the family name Saito.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Still think your the hunter?” is the final quote we hear before Atsu defeats her enemy, and it leaves me wondering… where did she get those toys? Atsu uses the niten'ichi, or two sword style, Miyamoto Musashi popularized and which roughly translates as two heavens as one. It appears that she has a Katana in one hand and a Wakizashi in the other. She also wields an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arquebus#:~:text=An%20arquebus%20(%2F%CB%88%C9%91%CB%90rk,arquebus%20is%20called%20an%20arquebusier." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arquebus </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanegashima_(gun)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tanegashima rifle</a> with a Serpentine matchlock and is shown with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusarigama" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kusarigama</a> twirling around the chain. Other weapons spotted in the trailer include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cdachi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odachi </a>teaser, indicating there will be even more to master in Ghost of Yotei.</p><p>Of course, we have other questions about the game, like if hot springs will make a return, or if the crest that we see slashed will wind up being an homage to the Toyotomi clan that was wiped out. Time will tell. For now, the history, turmoil, and drama surrounding Ezo, the Ainu and the Tokugawa Shogunate has me hyped for Ghost of Yotei. Let’s see what you’ve got, Sucker Punch!</p><p>A special thanks to...

Torishima then starts to talk about content ratings abroad, and the difficulties of getting stuff approved in the U.S. “It really came from the West; a way of approaching sex education with a religious concept exists in America, doesn’t it?” Torishima said according to <em>RPG Site.</em> “Their way of thinking on compliance is really very narrow.”</p><p>Then Horii, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-yuji-horii-new-story-1851589755&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-yuji-horii-new-story-1851589755">who is contributing new story elements to the remake</a></span>, seems to bring the conversation back to <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. “You can also choose a male or female [version] of the protagonist, but we cannot write it as ‘choose from Male or Female;’ it became ‘Type 1 &amp; Type 2.’ he says according to <em>RPG Site</em>. “I wonder who the heck are going to complain about ‘“Male and Female?’ I don’t understand.” That part of the extended conversation was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/saou0345/status/1840243748007219257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/saou0345/status/1840243748007219257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">immediately clipped out on September 29</a></span> and spread like wildfire online among critics of the <em>Remake </em>changes. </p><p>That’s when Elon Musk found it. “This is insane,” the tech billionaire, who has become like a moth to the flame for anti-woke engagement bait, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1840620975248785486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1840620975248785486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X (formerly Twitter) September 30</a></span> in a quote of the clipped conversation. It was unclear which part specifically he was referencing, but it helped the soundbite break containment. Two elder statesmen of manga and video games (both Torishima and Horii are in their 70s) seemed to be vindicating the quiet outrage on certain forums and YouTube channels about the <em>Dragon Quest III</em> cuts, and a broader conspiracy about quiet censorship of Japanese games and entertainment. </p><p>So far, all of this was as predictable as the sun. It’s what happened next that got weird. Naz Chris, the original interviewer, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NazChris_dj/status/1841688282746519843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NazChris_dj/status/1841688282746519843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on October 2</a></span> accusing the clips of mistranslating part of the conversation and taking it out of context.

I deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused to all parties involved.”</p><p> The Twitter account for the radio program Horii and Torishima host together also responded, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/KosoKoso_hoso/status/1841681747786006615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/KosoKoso_hoso/status/1841681747786006615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">putting out a statement</a></span> calling on people to stop spreading clipped parts of the conversation and suggesting the content had been mistranslated and misconstrued. The substance of the dispute seemed to hinge on the use of “sex education” instead of “Puritan.” It’s unclear what meaningful difference that would have made to the overall meaning, however, especially Horii’s remark about the remake changing the gender labels. </p><p>For anti-woke gaming conspiracists, this reaction is the best of both worlds. The initial conversation seems to validate their original criticisms of the changes while the apparent damage control efforts after the remarks escaped into the wider internet are now being treated by some as evidence of some kind of coverup. What does Square Enix think of all this? The publisher declined to comment. </p><p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake </em>is out on console and PC on November 14.

            <p>
Larian is in another of its celebratory moods, applauding the barnstorming - and apparently record-smashing - success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> mods on consoles just a week after their arrival.
</p>
<p>
While Baldur's Gate 3 has had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings">official mod support on PC</a> since August - giving players access to a new Mod Manager and a range of official modding tools - it's only been available to console and Mac players since the beginning of October.
</p>
<p>
And it looks like players have been going wild following their arrival on new platforms, with an <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1842245853307650426">infographic shared on Larian's social media channels</a> revealing over 1.7m mods were downloaded in the first 24 hours of release on consoles. That is, admittedly, just a fraction of the 22m mods that have been downloaded since Baldur's Gate 3's Patch 7 launched for PC in August, but it's an impressive start all the same.

<p>
According to Larian's figures, that means over 40 percent of Baldur's Gate 3 players have now dabbled with mods since their official arrival, with over 2,000 mods having been uploaded by 768 mod creators in that time. Granted, the overwhelming majority of Baldur's Gate 3 mods are currently PC-exclusive, with a little over 70 available on consoles right now as part of Larian's curation process, but the developer does say more will continue to release.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you to the mod authors who have been bringing their creations to life with the BG3 Toolkit," Larian concluded, "and thank you to all of the players now causing chaos in Faerûn."

Last month bought the news Baldur's Gate 3 was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-a-step-closer-to-real-time-combat-thanks-to-very-rough-early-mod">step closer to getting the series' classic real-time with pause combat</a> thanks to one enterprising modder, but there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-baldurs-gate-3-mods-to-make-or-break-combat">plenty to chew through</a> even before official modding became a thing.

						<h5>Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred</h5><p><span>October 8, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred is set to launch just about sixteen months after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the debut of the base game</a>. It's a much quicker timeframe than we've seen with Reaper of Souls, the first and only Diablo III expansion, which only materialized almost two years after the base game's launch.</p>
<p>This speaks to a much greater commitment to the continued support of Diablo IV, as promised by Franchise Director Rod Fergusson, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/annual-diablo-4-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> around a year ago that players would get annual expansions. However, such an aggressive content plan inevitably has some drawbacks, particularly for the story.</p>
<p>The plot of Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred's campaign continues directly from the end of the base game. After choosing to trap the Prime Evil Mephisto in the Soulstone, Neyrelle has left on her own in the desperate hope of finding a more permanent solution to contain the Lord of Hatred. Her research brings Neyrelle to Nahantu, a jungle-themed region previously seen by fans in Diablo II's third Act (although back then, it was referred to as Kehjistan, the bordering region). As teased by the pre-release trailers, Neyrelle is already being corrupted by Mephisto's evil even as she enters the region, and the situation only gets worse from there.</p>
<p>The main character (addressed as the Wanderer, like in the base game) has been trying to learn about Neyrelle's whereabouts ever she since left with the Soulstone. That suddenly changes at the beginning of the expansion, and they set out to follow her tracks, eventually reaching Nahantu. There, they come in contact with the local Spiritborns, which is a way to introduce the new class from a lore standpoint.</p>
<p>From that point onwards, the story of Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred largely unfolds as you would expect, except for a major twist toward the end. The storytelling quality is, I would say, comparable to that of the base game; that is to say, very high for a game of this genre. The main difference is that it is way shorter (it was compared by Blizzard itself to an Act, of which there are six in Diablo IV). Moreover, as mentioned above, it is also somewhat of a stopgap in what inevitably needs to be a story told year by year; Reaper of Souls felt far more significant and meaty of a follow-up to Diablo III, whereas Blizzard already <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-launch-roundtable-qa-blizzard-dives-into-every-aspect-of-the-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> this is far from the latest we've seen of Mephisto, teasing future appearances in later expansions.</p>
<p>The same largely goes for the Nahantu region itself. It is around the size of Scosglen, with six Waypoints and twenty new Dungeons, not to mention several side quests, but Scosglen was just one of five regions in the base game. On the upside, it is rather gorgeous and definitely adds a biome that was fairly lacking in Diablo IV, increasing the variety in the environments.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/diablo-4-spiritborn-spirit-guardians-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Like Reaper of Souls with its Crusader class, Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred also adds a new class, only this time it's something franchise aficionados have never seen: the Spiritborn. Native to Nahantu, the Spiritborns undergo a coming-of-age ritual that tests them to survive in the jungle for days on end by learning to open their "sight". They subsequently go through a metamorphosis in which they shed their former existence for their Spirit Realm self and believe their spirit will be reborn as a powerful animal guardian.</p>
<p>At its core, the class was designed around fluid combat, acrobatic movement, and a martial arts weapon fighting style. It offers four powerful spirit Guardians that allow players to fully customize their playstyles. The Jaguar is a warrior-like Spiritborn that uses repeated aggressive/fire attacks that increase in lethality. The Incarnate skill is Ferocity, a stacking buff that increases attack speed and provides a reduction to skill cooldowns.</p>
<p>The Gorilla is a defensive Spiritborn that excels at physical skills, fending off incoming damage and focusing mainly on damage reduction and blocking. The Gorilla's Incarnate skill is Resolve, which can be stockpiled and provides additional damage mitigation. The Eagle is the most agile of the Spirit Guardians, providing lightning-focused strikes while moving swiftly across the battlefield and increasing the evading capabilities. Finally, the Centipede focuses on debuffs, draining enemies of their energy with poison damage over damage over time and excelling at crowd control.</p>
<p>All Spiritborns have their own class feature called Spirit Hall, which lets players customize the build with Spirit-based bonuses. The catch is you have to decide whether to set a Guardian as a Primary or Secondary Spirit Animal, which provides different bonuses. For example, setting the Jaguar as Primary Spirit Animal has the following effects: <em>every 4th time you deal direct damage to an enemy with a Jaguar Skill, unleash additional slashes dealing 100% of the damage of the 4 hits. All Skills are now also Jaguar Skills.&nbsp;</em>On the other hand, as a Secondary Spirit Animal, the Jaguar increases Maximum Ferocity by one and lets you gain one stack of Ferocity whenever you kill an enemy or damage a Boss.</p>
<p>As a massive fan of melee combat, I landed on a build largely centered on the Jaguar with a couple of Eagle skills for good measure. It felt a lot like playing the Barbarian, albeit with its own twist. There's definitely much experimentation that can be done by mixing the Spirit Guardians, and overall, the Spiritborn is a great addition to the game's class roster.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mercenaries-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred also adds AI companions through the Mercenaries system. You'll unlock the first one, Raheir, very early in the expansion's campaign. Raheir is the former leader of the Pale Hand band of mercs, and he'll eventually offer the Wanderer to set up camp in the Pale Hand's now deserted underground haven. Then, he'll provide pointers to the other three Mercenaries: the half-demon child Aldkin, the berserker and former cannibal Varyana, and the disgraced bounty hunter Subo. It's a ragtag group of misfits, each one introduced with a short but very interesting quest that provides plenty of background on the character.</p>
<p>From a mechanics standpoint, you can pick one Mercenary to bring with you at all times (unless you've got a full party) and another to use as a 'Reinforcement.' This is the big innovation: you can select a specific skill of one of the Mercenaries to be triggered whenever you perform a particular action. In my case, I linked Aldkin's Fireball-like skill to the activation of the Spiritborn's Vortex; they are a perfect fit since Vortex pulls in groups of nearby foes and Aldkin's Fireball deals area of effect damage and stun. For the active Mercenary, I picked Raheir, who is a very traditional tank with taunts, buffs and debuffs that are very handy.</p>
<p>As you defeat enemies throughout the game, the selected Mercenaries gain Rapport, leveling up to offer more bonuses and skill customization as well as valuable rewards and bartering currency. As you build Rapport, you can even Barter with your mercs and enter trade agreements for a chance at powerful loot and other items. One thing should be clarified: Mercenaries do not make the game any easier. Blizzard clearly worked hard to rebalance the difficulty, and if anything, Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred felt a tad more challenging than the base. As such, their purpose is not to make your life easier but rather to offer more customization to your preferred playstyle. You'll have to try out different combinations to find out the best way to complement your build with Mercenaries.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/d4-runeword-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred features yet another major new system: Runewords. Longtime franchise fans may recall it from the days of the revered second installment, although this version is a bit different. Runewords are mainly about accessing the skills of other classes or augmenting your movement or attack speed. At launch, there are 17 runes of Ritual and 28 runes of Summoning Runes available. To create a Runeword, players must combine a rune of Ritual with one of Invocation. The Ritual rune sets which action will trigger the effect, while the Invocation rune lets you select the effect. For example, the first Runeword I crafted provided a critical hit chance bonus after my character performed the Evade (dodge) action.</p>
<p>Runes operate on a resource system called Offering, which is generated by Ritual runes when their listed condition is met. Conversely, Invocation runes consume this offering to activate their effects. The more demanding a condition is, the more Offering the Ritual rune will generate. On the other hand, the Offering requirement to activate an Invocation rune scales with the strength of its effect. Generating more Offering than required results in 'overflow', which provides a bonus to the effects of a Rune of Summoning.</p>
<p>Runewords are crafted at the Jeweler NPC. Since you need two runes, a Runeword can only be added to an item with two sockets, like chest, leg, and two-handed weapon. The developers have also added an extra socket to helm items, so they may also host a Runeword. Last but not least, Runes come in three rarities: Magic, Rare and Legendary. The higher the rarity of a rune, the more powerful its effect will be, exactly as you would expect. Needless to say, you will be sacrificing the option to insert gems into those sockets. However, from what I've seen, it should generally be worth it. Runewords are another interesting way for players to complete their build with something they were perhaps lacking, and Blizzard can surely add a lot more depth to it over time.</p>

<p>For endgame players, Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred introduces a new cooperative dungeon experience called Dark Citadel. Whereas the regular dungeons are perfectly playable solo, the same is not true of the Dark Citadel, which expects players to have a group of at least two. Blizzard also promised complex boss fights that require coordination (thus the addition of a new Marker system) and situations where the party has to split forces and traverse separate paths for a while.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't check out Dark Citadel during the few days of pre-release access. That's partly because Blizzard decided not to provide any preset characters, so we had to level up from the beginning. It's also the main reason this review is currently not final yet.</p>
<p>For now, though, Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred is a solid expansion that is perhaps not heavy on content but more than makes up for it with many systemic changes that will elevate the whole game for years to come.</p>
<p>One last tidbit about the PC version. As listed in the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24140808/diablo-iv-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a>, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation and Ray Traced Foliage do not work right now. While the loss of Ray Traced Foliage is trivial, the same cannot be said about DLSS Frame Generation, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-boosts-diablo-iv-low-frame-rate-by-nearly-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided a sizable performance boost</a> (especially to frame rate lows) to owners of the GeForce RTX 40 GPU series. Hopefully, it will be fixed soon.</p>

            <p>I'm on a one-man mission to destroy your productivity. Yesterday I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piece-together-a-jigsaw-of-city-streets-in-this-browser-based-daily-puzzle-game">offered you Scrambled Maps</a>, which is good for fifteen minutes of not working. 
</p>
<p>Today I offer Alphaguess, a once-a-day browser puzzle game in which you must guess a word. With every incorrect guess you make, the game tells you whether the correct answer comes before or after it alphabetically.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It took me 26 guesses and eight minutes to find today's answer, which is not a result I'm proud of. You can <a href="https://alphaguess.com/">head here to see if you can do better</a>, and I'd wager you can.
</p>
<p>My first guess today was "muddle", because I figure it's better to open with a word somewhere in the middle of the alphabet and immediately split the possibility space in half. When I struggle it's normally because I have correctly identified the first letter or two and begin to lose sight of what's in and out of the realm of possibility. But then I am both addled and dotty.
</p><p>I regularly refer to works like Alphaguess and Wordle and Scrambled Maps as puzzle games, but I'm not sure that quite communicates their appeal. There's no lateral thought required to complete a round of Alphaguess, no deeper understanding of its rules to be gained. It's fundamentally easy, your success inevitable, and the outcome is only initially obscured because there are so many possible answers. It's no different than a friend asking you to guess what number they're thinking of between 1 and a thousand, and we wouldn't call that a puzzle.
</p>
<p>Yet I find the process of finding the correct word utterly diverting all the same, like playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_numberplate_game">numberplate game</a> on a long car journey, without the need to leave your home.</p>

With that news, Osment had this to say about potentially getting ready to say goodbye to Sora:</p><blockquote>"You know, I'm sure that [Nomura] has great plans to wrap it up in a satisfying way. And I think that sometimes that's the best thing to do, even if you have something that you love and you feel like you want to play it forever, to tie it up in a nice way and not let it drag out beyond where the creator wants it to go. I think that's the way to go. And clearly there's many, many hours of gameplay for people to go back and revisit."</blockquote><p>Osment first voiced Sora in the 2002 original Kingdom Hearts and has since reprised the role in a whopping 11 games since then, in addition to providing voicework for the character in Super Smash Bros.

        <p>It's in early development</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Avatar: The Last Airbender hasn't had much luck when it comes to adaptations, whether to film or to video games. Now Paramount Game Studios and Saber Interactive are going to take a new swing at it. The pair have announced an action RPG set in the "Avatar Legends universe", the broader world and timeline that The Last Airbender and Legend Of Korra take place within.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game, which is early in development, is said to be "the biggest video game in franchise history", which wouldn't be hard, and it's being made in collaboration with Avatar's original creators.
</p>
<p>It doesn't sound like players will necessarily take control of a known character, but information <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-is-getting-a-aaa-rpg-with-saber-interactive-and-paramount-game-studios-exclusive">shared with IGN</a> said that you will "master all four elements, engage in dynamic combat alongside companions, and experience the challenges and decisions that come with being the keeper of balance in the world."
</p>
<p>Avatar: The Last Airbender was a Nickelodeon cartoon which began airing in 2005. It's set in a world where certain people from different nations can telekinetically control one of the four elements - water, air, fire, and big rocks. The protagonist is Aang, who as the Avatar is the only person with the potential to manipulate all four. 
</p><p>It's a fantastic show, particularly for the careful way it builds its character arcs, and the clear structure of its world and magic system make it ideal fodder for a video game adaptation. Despite that, it's had some underwhelming action games, an underwhelming MMO, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avatar-the-last-airbender-skins-coming-to-smite-in-weird-crossover">some Smite skins</a> (pictured above). Legend Of Korra faired better with a Platinum-developed action game, but it as Platinum games go it was some extremely mid work-for-hire stuff.
</p>
<p>Fingers crossed this next attempt is better. Saber seemingly did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">a good job recently in adapting Space Marine 2</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-fans-dare-to-hope-as-david-hayter-teases-return-to-role-ive-not-played-since<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
David Hayter, the gravelly voice of Metal Gear protagonist Solid Snake, has fans pondering an apparent return to the role after posting an enigmatic new tweet.
</p>
<p>
Hayter was famously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kiefer-sutherland-is-the-new-voice-of-snake-in-metal-gear-solid-5">ousted from the role in 2013</a>, after Metal Gear creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> - always one to be swayed by a celebrity - controversially decided to replace him with Sutherland for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 5: The Phantom Pain. Long-time fans, it's fair to say, were not particularly happy with the move, and Hayter has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/solid-snake-voice-actor-david-hayter-throws-shade-on-hideo-kojima">made no secret of his disappointment</a> in the years since, saying the switch was handled "pretty badly and I've got no particular love for Kojima."
</p>
<p>
Now, though, Hayter has sparked renewed excitement among fans with a fresh <a href="https://x.com/DavidBHayter/status/1841994392896442768">post on social media</a>, teasing, "I was in the booth today. Playing a role I’ve not played, since..." And just to make sure no-one was in any doubt where he was going with that particular wink, Hayter <a href="https://x.com/DavidBHayter/status/1842129046991417481">followed the post up</a> with an animated gif of a dagger-wielding Snake.

<p>
Kojima, of course, has long parted ways with the Metal Gear series after an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-left-konami-earlier-this-month-report">acrimonious split</a> with publisher Konami, clearing the way for Hayter's return. Obviously, a recording booth appearance doesn't mean Hayter is returning for anything like a brand-new Metal Gear game, and fans over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/">series' subreddit</a> aren't daring to dream quite that big just yet. Instead, most are speculating he's warming up the vocal cords to record supplementary or promotional material for Konami's upcoming Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, which is already confirmed to be using the original game's audio. It's also possible he could be recording a handful of new lines to accomodate new release formats.
</p><p>
It's also been noted (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/solid-snake-actor-david-hayter-sparks-metal-gear-speculation-by-teasing-return-to-role">IGN</a>), Hayter will cameo as Snake in the upcoming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuEUts1Zvuo">Sonic the Hedgehog fan movie Sonic Villains</a>, but recording for that will have been completed long ago given it's out this month - and it seems unlikely he'd be doing much in-character promo work for a fan film.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say, the purpose for Hayter's recording booth visit remains inconclusive. But with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater still set to release this year, it shouldn't be too long before we'll know what we can and can't start crossing off the speculation list.

            <p>Ubisoft has had a rough year or more, losing almost half its share value in 2024 due to the underwhelming performance of Star Wars Outlaws and the delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows, among other issues. Now Tencent and Ubisoft's founders, the Guillemots, are considering buying out the publisher, reports say.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A report <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tencent-guillemot-family-said-consider-134712316.html">by Bloomberg</a> cited "people familiar with the matter," saying Tencent and Guillemot Brothers Ltd were considering their options. Both parties are currently minority shareholders of Ubisoft, with Tencent controlling around 9% of shares and the Guillemots owning around 20.5%. 
</p>
<p>Other minority shareholders have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">speaking out against the Guillemots' leadership of the company in recent months</a>, pushing for the board to "take Ubisoft private or allow it to sell to strategic investor". 
</p>
<p>Shareholders' frustrations had been growing for some time, but peaked following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">"softer than expected" performance of Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Ubisoft took the unusual decision in its wake to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows, their tentpole release in Q4, despite the game being ready to ship, in favour of adding new features and story quests designed to bolster its reception when it now launches next February.
</p>
<p>Ubisoft's shares rose around 33% in the wake of Bloomberg News' report of the buyout being considered.
</p>
<p>There has been recurring chatter about someone buying Ubisoft for years, whether private equity sniffing around in 2022, which is when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-are-working-in-concert-with-ubisofts-founding-family-after-300m-investment">Tencent got involved</a>, or long-running efforts by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vivendi-buying-ubisoft">Vivendi to take over the company</a> in the 2010s. Guillemot has previously maintained <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-say-theyd-consider-being-bought-if-someone-offered">they'd consider selling if someone offered</a>; maybe now we'll see if other shareholders would consider selling to him.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bloober has a spotty track record with scary games, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is one of the most beloved horror games ever made, and Konami has done a horrible job supporting the franchise over the last decade. So the idea of modern Konami ordering a <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake from Bloober Team seemed like a recipe for a trainwreck. Once again, I assumed <em>Silent Hill</em> fans would be left disappointed and frustrated.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192716" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Horror Game You've Never Heard Of Is Scientifically The Scariest Ever" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="174" data-playlist="192716,196013,196805" data-current="192716"><div><p>Horror Game You've Never Heard Of Is Scientifically The Scariest Ever</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18169.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But that’s not what happened. After playing about 11 hours of the remake I can confidently say that Bloober Team has created something special that even <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>newcomers will enjoy, assuming they love oppressive atmospheres, creepy monsters, and scary situations.</p><p>The <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake tells the same story as the original PS2 classic. James Sunderland gets a letter from his supposedly dead wife and travels to Silent Hill, aka the worst town in America, to find her or at least find out what’s going on. Within minutes of arriving in the fog-filled town, James is fighting for his life against disturbing monsters while meeting bizarre people who have seemingly lost their minds. Or maybe James is slowly losing his mind?</p><p>Bloober Team’s remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> doesn’t look to shake up the plot or characters of the original too much, which is a smart move. Like most elements of the remake, <em>Silent Hill 2</em>'s narrative is faithful and respectful of the OG. Some might complain that at times Bloober Team is being <em>too </em>conservative with how strictly they adhere to the classic survival horror game and its characters, narrative, and world. Yet, I get it. <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is one of the genre’s most lauded games. If it ain’t broke, why fix it? And Bloober Team, rightfully so, doesn’t assume it can perfect or outsmart the original story and instead mostly recreates it with great care and higher production values.</p><p>All the unnerving dialogue, strange quirks, and oddball writing are still here, it just sounds better than ever and is delivered by photorealistic recreations of the characters who now exist in gorgeously lit and intricately detailed areas.</p><p><em>Silent Hill 2 </em>doesn’t just look different (and amazing), the remake also plays very differently than the original game. The camera is brought in closer to James and combat has been expanded and modernized a bit, with gameplay and a control scheme that feel closer to the recent <em>Resident Evil</em> remakes. It’s a smart move, as while<em> Silent Hill 2 </em>is a classic that people still talk about fondly in 2024, even its most diehard fans admit that its combat and controls feel clunky at times.</p><p>Oh, and if you were worried that Bloober Team might cut out all the esoteric and impossibly silly puzzles, don’t be concerned. All of that stuff is still here, just once again rendered at a higher resolution.</p><figure id="" data-id="dc860b45e1e77dc6e434ba5087ce99c8" data-recommend-id="image://dc860b45e1e77dc6e434ba5087ce99c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Silent Hill 2 remake's photorealistic streets.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake also effectively recreates the same oppressive and dreary atmosphere that so many horror fans love in the OG. Creeping around the foggy streets of the remake reminded me of when I first played the original <em>Silent Hill</em> on PS1. I was nervous about what would come out of the fog and the world felt dangerous at all times. When I entered buildings or visited the other side of the town in <em>Silent Hill 2</em>'s remake, I felt claustrophobic and scared. I would have to take breaks after playing for a bit so that I could let my heartbeat slow down and my eyes blink again.<br></p><p>I play a lot of scary games and it’s been a while since one has spooked me as much as <em>Silent Hill 2</em>. And it does so without constant jumpscares, either. Instead, it relies on an overwhelming sense of dread and makes you feel trapped in a nightmare. So yeah, the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is very scary and will be a treat for fans of horror games.</p><p>Bloober Team has truly delivered on the assignment of updating and modernizing a classic horror game without changing what made it special. The question is: Did the world need a <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake? The original is still worth playing and fans have made it easier than ever to experience that classic game in 2024. So I’m not sure we <em>needed </em>a remake. But I’m at least happy to report that the remake we got is a genuinely well-made, faithful adaptation of the OG classic developed by people who seem to not only love<em> Silent Hill 2</em> but who also understand it and know when to tweak and when to stand back and let the original moments shine.</p><p>Remaking <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>always seemed like an impossible task, and I imagine it wasn’t easy, but Bloober Team has done it and in the process created one of the best scary games of 2024. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The downsizing cast doubt on the launch and support of both Zombie Army VR and Starship Troopers: Continuum, but in a statement issued to IGN, XR Games insisted both would still release later in 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here’s the statement, from Bobby Thandi, Founder and CEO of XR Games:</p><blockquote>“I’m heartbroken that we’re going to be losing some of our incredibly dedicated, talented and valued colleagues. We’ve spent many months carefully exploring alternative solutions in the face of a challenging VR gaming market and a tough broader gaming landscape, and this is one of the hardest business decisions we’ve faced.</blockquote><blockquote>“Our priority during and after this consultation process is to treat all team members with the utmost respect and care. We are committed to helping those affected by this through outplacement support, such as CV clinics, portfolio advice, interview preparation and practice, and signposting available jobs in the industry. We also have mental health support available for our staff.</blockquote><blockquote>“I’m so very proud of our teams for their hard work on Hitman 3: VR Reloaded, which will continue to receive patch support, as well as Zombie Army VR and Starship Troopers: Continuum, both of which are due for launch this year. We want to be able to develop innovative titles for many years to come, and we’ll work to navigate this transition and shape the future of XR Games.”</blockquote><p>Hitman 3: VR Reloaded, developed by XR Games in partnership with Hitman owner IO Interactive, is a standalone port of Hitman VR for the Meta Quest 3 that was supposed to address some of the biggest criticisms of the PC game, like the lack of dual wielding. But it launched to negative reviews from players as well as press, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-thought-hitman-3-vr-was-bad-on-pc-just-wait-until-you-see-hitman-3-vr-reloaded-in-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> calling it “about as grim as VR games can get.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The VR market has struggled. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-vr2">PSVR2</a>, for example, lost momentum soon after launch despite its technical prowess, though Sony hasn't shared figures since revealing it sold 600,000 within six weeks of its February 2023 launch.</p><p>Sony Interactive Entertainment's head of global business Eric Lempel told the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3b89e9f7-e3cf-4e60-bfa4-987af24efa75" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Times</a> in December 2023 that VR was "a bit of a challenging category right now."

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review.1000995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Diablo 4 was one of my favorite games last year, so I’ve had high hopes for Vessel of Hatred, the first expansion to developer Blizzard’s demonic ARPG. Fortunately, this action-packed crusade through the muck and mire of Nahantu’s forests and swamps is exactly what the plague doctor ordered, even if there isn’t as much meat on the bones as I’d hoped. In fact, the truncated campaign, unfinished story, and modest amount of endgame content make this expansion feel more like a prologue in some ways. But the quality of life improvements, changes to the meta, debut raid activity, and fantastic new character class are all so dang good that I’m happy to continue grinding XP and claiming shiny loot for several hundred more hours.</p><p>Vessel of Hatred picks up right from the maddening cliffhanger the base campaign left us dangling at, with the Daughter of Hatred now dead and a young adventurer having spirited away a soulstone that contains one of heaven’s most wanted demons: Mephisto. Throughout this roughly six-hour story, you’ll watch the dominos fall as the manifestation of pure evil inches ever closer to what seems like an inevitable resurrection… but things wrap up well before reaching any kind of climax, leaving us with yet another cliffhanger (one it seems we’ll be stuck with for some time). That makes the campaign the weakest part of the expansion, and although the lore, characters, and few substantial plot developments we <em>do </em>get are all extremely compelling, there are simply too few of them with precious little payoff to boot.</p><p>Thankfully, the stuff you’re actually doing during and beyond what scraps of story we’re served up are as exhilarating as Diablo 4 has ever been. Just about everything – from the changes to leveling and the loot system, to the added dungeons and side quests – is beyond fantastic. Rune words, a returning feature that lets you put special enchantments on your equipment, adds yet another layer to buildcrafting that I adore, and smashing through the Kurast Undercity, a time-attack dungeon that’s infinitely replayable and great for farming endgame loot, easily devoured my evenings. Not every task hits the mark, like the seasonal Realmwalker activity that has you slowly follow around a big, dumb monster while you wait for him to reach his final destination before you can finally kill him, but hacking and slashing through the compelling Nahantu region of Sanctuary that’s been stapled onto the southern part of the map is rarely dull.</p><p>I especially enjoy the changes to the leveling system, which now caps out at 60 instead of 100, then gives you 300 levels of overleveling to invest in insanely complex paragon perk trees. The result of this shortened climb is that you get into the endgame much sooner, which will be very nice when making new characters each season. You get to spend more time engaging with endgame buildcrafting while creeping your way up higher world tier difficulties, earning and upgrading ever more powerful loot as you go. Whereas the previous Diablo 4 ladder-climbing journey had the occasional slow point, this streamlined version feels good all the way through to 300, and I am much more inclined to repeat that step on multiple characters and through multiple seasons as a result – something that’s likely to dramatically improve my long-term commitment to fighting off the hordes of hell.</p><div id="diablo-iv-classes-tier-list-overall-rating" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Diablo IV Classes Tier List - Overall Rating</h3><h3>Diablo IV Classes Tier List - Overall Rating</h3></p></div><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Spiritborn has quickly become one of my favorite classes.</p></div><p>My favorite added mechanic is the mercenary system, which lets you recruit NPC heroes to join you on your adventures. This allows solo players to even the odds a bit with co-op groups by having a computer-controlled friend or two tag along on adventures, including Subo, the long-ranged bounty hunter who provides backup with his bow, and Aldkin, a demon child who uses her demonic powers to send your foes to the shadow realm. Not only do these faithful companions each have their own introductory quests where you learn about their history, but the longer you spend time with them, the more XP they’ll gain to unlock new abilities and other rewards. </p><p>But the most substantial new thing to dive into is the delightfully customizable character class: the Spiritborn. After spending nearly all of my time in the expansion as this class, it’s quickly become one of my favorites. This tribalistic magical warrior relies on their connection with guardian spirits, ghostly animals who imbue them with godlike power, all of which have their own memorable, unique style and set of strengths and weaknesses. The gorilla spirit is all about making you an invulnerable tank, then punishing your enemies for daring to attack you with thorns, while the wonderfully offensive jaguar will turn you into a lightning-fast, melee-swinging DPS machine (who is quite squishy). The eagle is all about mobility, and allows you to teleport around the map and make yourself incredibly hard to hit, while my personal favorite, the centipede, lets you cover large areas in poison and make yourself nigh invulnerable with life-stealing abilities. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The really cool part is, although you’re best off focusing on one or two spirits, you can mix and match any combination of the abilities each of the phantom beasts offers. So instead of having a specific set of things your class excels at, like berserking and bleed damage with the barbarian or crowd control and AoE damage with the sorcerer, you have a whole lot more options with the Spiritborn. This modularity is especially great when one build isn’t working out for you, because instead of switching to a different character, you can just respec your skills, swap out a few pieces of equipment, and instantly transform from a cautious tank into a belligerent glass cannon. Playing as the old classes still has plenty of advantages, like the fact that you can get way deeper into the weeds with those more focused playstyles, but for those who want a bit more freedom to change their mind and try different approaches, the Spiritborn is an absolute godsend.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dark Citadel is one of the biggest highlights of Vessel of Hatred.</p></div><p>One of the biggest highlights of Vessel of Hatred is the new endgame co-op activity called Dark Citadel. This challenging gauntlet requires you and three friends to best devilish bosses while completing raid-like puzzle mechanics in three different wings of a deadly fortress, fighting off countless high-level enemies along the way. This is the first activity of its kind for the series and, while it definitely has all the signs of being an early attempt, is easily the best endgame activity Diablo has ever had. It makes Nightmare Dungeons and the Uber Lilith boss fight from the base game feel underwhelming by comparison. </p><p>Dividing our group between two realities and coordinating a way to take down a boss’ immunity shielding was some of the most fun I’ve had in Diablo 4, and reveling in the high-end loot made me want to run it all again. There’s plenty of room for improvement, though, as all the raid mechanics are so straightforward that our group was able to push through to the end with minimal coordination and no more than a few failed attempts at each wing. Still, it’s an extremely impressive first draft that I’m eager to see Blizzard build upon in future expansions, and it’s already without question the most fun activity to be found in an already excellent action-RPG.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>TieGuyTravis' Favorite Isometric Action Games</h3></p></div><p>With such an exemplary co-op activity to delve into, it’s very nice to see Vessel of Hatred finally bring matchmaking functionality (called Party Finder) to Diablo, allowing you to easily find a group of fellow wanderers to smash through demons with. Like you’d expect, you’re able to post or search for groups that are playing on specific world tiers, tackling certain activities, who want to talk in a party chat, and all that bog standard goodness. For folks like me, who tend to run around Sanctuary solo unless given an activity that really requires co-op, this is a really neat feature that probably should have been available long ago, but which comes at a perfect time since Dark Citadel makes partying up more of a necessity.</p><p>A year and a half into its lifespan, it’s a bit surprising that Vessel of Hatred is the most unstable version of Diablo 4 so far. It’s nothing so bad it ever made me want to rage quit, but with multiple crashes, quests that wouldn’t complete, important NPCs multiplying and hilariously running around the map together, bosses becoming permanently invulnerable for no reason, and more, it was enough to occasionally throw a wet blanket over an otherwise good time. I’m sure many or all of these issues will be addressed in the weeks and months to come, but my time in Nahantu was a lot less polished than I’d anticipated. That said, not all bugs were too awful, like one where my friends and I were able to get exponentially more XP than we were supposed to and powered through 50 levels in a matter of minutes… that was actually pretty fun.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred is an awesome expansion that adds an excellent new area to explore, a gloriously modular character class that I can’t stop playing, an impressive debut raid activity, and lots more. But while just about everything it adds is awesome, it definitely doesn’t do enough where the somewhat flaccid campaign and story is concerned, and numerous bugs can occasionally drag it down. Thankfully, the changes to the meta, a greatly improved progression system, the resurrection of rune words, and NPC companions are all major wins for Diablo 4, even when it seems we’ll be waiting a bit to see where this interlude expansion leads.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While it's more expensive at $1,100, the 27-inch M10S does have a lightning-quick 480Hz refresh rate, up to 0.03ms response time, and an adjustable stand inside of its 1440p design, making it a very attractive monitor for competitive gamers specifically.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378781-sony-gen-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378781" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378781-sony-gen-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378781"></a><figcaption>Sony Inzone M10S and M9 II monitors</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378781-sony-gen-2.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Compatible-DisplayHDR-Anti-Glare-DisplayPort/dp/B0D9R7HCVG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone M10S</a> -- $1,100 | Releases October 18</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Monitor-DisplayHDR-Speakers/dp/B0D9R8YPK3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone M9 II</a> -- $800</li></ul><p>Sony hasn't just released its own line of gaming monitors, it's also dabbled in some other tech like headsets and earbuds for the InZone line.

            <p>
A month on from Eurogamer's previous report, GAME customers say they are still waiting to receive games they paid to pre-order, without the ability to cancel these orders online.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer continues to be contacted by customers who handed over money for games due to launch weeks ago that are still waiting to receive their orders.
</p>
<p>
And now, with the autumn season of big game launches set to kick off properly with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> and Metaphor ReFantazio, there's concern that pre-orders for these games will also fail to materialise.
</p>
<p>
GAME customers tell Eurogamer that questions about outstanding pre-orders - some now more than a month late - are falling on deaf ears, with queries to the brand's customer support on social media and its website going unanswered.
</p>
<p>
The problem appears to originate with GAME switching over to systems owned by its parent company, Frasers Group, at the end of August. As a result, any pre-orders made on or before 19th August no longer show in customers' online accounts. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-acknowledges-website-issues-as-customers-await-missing-pre-orders">Eurogamer reported previously,</a> this also means customers have no way to cancel orders that are weeks late, or pre-emptively cancel orders for upcoming releases to purchase a product elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Head to GAME's customer service website and there's an update, dated to September, acknowledging "some" orders are now late.
</p>
<p>
"Following some important system changes, customers are currently experiencing delays with some of their orders," GAME's website notes. "These delays also affect some of the recent video game releases. 
</p>
<p>
"We're working closely with our fulfilment teams to get the outstanding orders out as quickly as we can and apologise for the current delays."
</p>
<p>
The website also notes that contacting its customer service team is also experiencing delays due to a high volume of issues.
</p>
<p>
"We're a little busier than usual right now, so it's taking us longer to reply," a warning message on the site states. "Our Customer Services team are working hard to reply as quickly as possible. Thanks for your patience, and we apologise for the delay."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contacted Frasers Group about customers' continued wait today, but has not heard a response.
</p>
<p>
A month ago, a spokesperson for the company told Eurogamer that the GAME website was "currently undergoing upgrades" which it was working to resolve "quickly".
</p>
<p>"We are aware that some customers are experiencing issues accessing their GAME accounts and order details," a Frasers Group representative told us in September. "We are working to have these resolved quickly and encourage customers to get in touch with our customer service team if they are experiencing issues. We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused." 
</p><p>
This year has seen GAME end the ability to trade-in products and buy pre-owned games, pre-order games in stores, end its GAME Reward and GAME Wallet offerings, and halt support for Xbox All Access. The chain has, however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-to-stop-selling-physical-games-other-than-fulfilling-pre-orders-report">denied a report online that claimed it would stop selling physical games outright</a>.
