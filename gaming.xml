<p>Capcom has done it again</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has done a great job with the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, but if you're still debating about it and the PlayStation 5 release, you've come to the right place.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://youtu.be/8izgK3xQHWY">shared a side-by-side comparison</a> of the game running on the Switch 2 and the PS5 Pro, and as you can see, the wizards behind other Switch 2 ports like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> have done it again!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/dlss-is-the-game-changer-for-resident-evil-requiems-impressive-switch-2-port?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">Digital Foundry</a> mentioned in its own technical analysis, the Switch 2 is running a low internal resolution in docked but this version and the PS5 release actually end up comparing "fairly equivocally", and it's all thanks to DLSS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Digital Foundry:</strong> On paper, a 540p image blown up to 1080p on a modern flat panel display doesn't sound great. However, DLSS looks surprisingly competitive. Fine detail like wires and fences can actually appear more temporally stable on Switch 2, while PS5's spatial upscaling solution (likely FSR1 or similar) looks noisier and less refined in motion. PS5 still wins overall on clarity, aided by its higher internal resolution and 4K UI (Switch 2 uses a 1080p UI), but the gap is much narrower than raw pixel counts would suggest."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of cutbacks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/digital-foundry-delivers-its-tech-analysis-of-resident-evil-requiem-on-switch-2-capcom-deserves-kudos-for-this-port">as previously noted</a>, geometry is pared back in the Switch 2 version and there are lower-quality textures. Capcom has also taken a "different" approach to the character hair design on Nintendo's new hardware, but overall it's a solid effort.</p>

<p>Game Freak is moving on from the original Switch hardware</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="8367be104bdbb"><a title="Pokémon Winds And Waves" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8367be104bdbb/pokemon-winds-and-waves.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the arrival of the Switch 2 generation last year, certain first-party titles have received cross-platform releases. Trainers saw this with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, but this won't be the case for the new mainline entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-winds-and-waves">Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves</a>.</p>
<p>In case you somehow missed it, The Pokémon Company has clearly stated in official press materials and the new webpage how these next-generation entries developed by Game Freak are "exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2". In other words, Nintendo's existing hybrid platform isn't part of the plans.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fxmovzg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Developed by GAME FREAK exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2, these new titles feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a glance, this new generation is already looking quite promising, and Game Freak potentially has over a year to polish the experience, with the titles currently scheduled for a 2027 release.</p>
<p>So, this means <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> and Legends: Z-A are likely the last "major" new entries that will be released on Nintendo's original Switch hardware.</p>
<p>Nintendo previously said it would continue supporting the original Switch as long as there's an audience, but also understands "exclusive games are crucial when launching new hardware" and intends to shift support to its new hybrid system as the fan base grows.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers</strong></em><em> for Resident Evil Requiem. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem finally sees the series return to Raccoon City, so it’ll surprise no one that it’s campaign is loaded with Easter eggs and references to the past. From deep cuts referencing 1998’s Resident Evil 2, to nods to more modern games in the franchise, here are 28 brilliant little details we’ve spotted in Resident Evil Requiem so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For veteran fans, the unquestionable highlight of Requiem is Leon’s return to the RPD. Well, its ruins – it definitely didn’t look like this last time. As expected, the dilapidated department is packed with references to the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>1. </strong>Before you enter the doors of the Raccoon City Police Department, you'll notice the streets around you feel very familiar. Look behind you, and you’ll see the <strong>tanker</strong> that separated Leon and Claire, and then subsequently exploded, still in the exact same position it was 28 years prior.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/sakura-1772205559303.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>2. </strong>Right next to the tanker is a building with <strong>ARUKAS</strong> written on it, which is a reference back to the original 1998 game, which in turn referenced Street Fighter Alpha 2’s Sakura. Arukas is Sakura spelt backwards. Perhaps surprisingly, that isn’t the only Street Fighter reference you can find, but there are a couple of steps before we get there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once Leon is finally reunited with the RPD, he’s flooded with memories of his traumatic experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>3. </strong>In Resident Evil 2, just before you’re introduced to the Licker, you find a dead police officer with its jaw sliced almost completely off. 28 years later, <strong>that police officer</strong> (well, his skeleton) is still in that exact same position, now notably sans jaw.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/weird-puzzle-1772205622401.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>4. </strong>Also still in the RPD are the remnants of all the strange puzzles Leon and Claire had to solve, frozen in time and covered in dust. The <strong>Lion statue puzzle</strong> in the main hall is declared by Leon to be the oddest of them all when he says, “This puzzle was weird”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>5. </strong>A trip to RPD wouldn’t be complete without a snoop around the <strong>S.T.A.R.S office</strong>, and although you can find lots of cool details in there, such as Jill’s beret, it’s Barry’s scavenger hunt that’s the most fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After following the two clues, you’ll find a hidden key for a locker. This key has the word Jojo written on it, and for those who don’t know, Jojo is a reference to the Japanese manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, which was also written on a locker in the original 1998 version of Resident Evil 2.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/joj-1772205685222.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>6. </strong>The Jojo key opens a locker that contains a whole host of goodies, including Barry’s gift of two tickets to the <strong>Raccoon City Zoo</strong>, a location that appears in the Resident Evil Outbreak series, which also happens to be the game our hero Grace’s mom, Alyssa, is from.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/ps1-1772205655087.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>7. </strong>At the base of this locker, though, is a wealth of PS1 nostalgia, which includes boxed copies of the <strong>original Resident Evil, Street Fighter Alpha 2 and Mega-Man 8</strong>. There’s also a poster for Street Fighter Alpha and what looks to be a TEMU PS1 that looks more like a Sega Saturn than a classic PlayStation.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/tofu-1772205723794.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>8. </strong>Later on, on the ground floor of the RPD, you can spot random appearances through the cracks in the wall of everyone’s favourite edible hero, <strong>Tofu</strong>, who was an unlockable playable character in the original Resident Evil 2. Tofu, beret and all, peeks out to say hello. And yes, if you’re quick enough, you can pop a shot at him to do some damage to his squishy consistency.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not sure what the exact trigger is for Tofu, but it feels like it’s just after you pick up Barry’s To Do List, which also appears to be the trigger for the next detail.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/rebecca-1772205744242.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>9. </strong>Wesker’s desk drawer is now an infamous location in the history of Resident Evil 2. In the remake, it contains a weapon component; in the original, after hitting the action prompt 50 times, you were “rewarded” with an inappropriate photo of Rebecca Chambers. In 2026, after looking at Barry’s to-do list, you’ll find a note about a book called ‘Medicinal Benefit of Herbs’, showing that it’s been returned to the library by Wesker. Make your way over to the library to find this book, look inside, and once again you’ll find <strong>the photo of Rebecca</strong>, with a note referring to her as “Rising Rookie Rebecca”. RRR then happens to be the code for Wesker’s briefcase, in which you find a charm of his iconic sunglasses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>10. </strong>Once you’ve left the RPD, make sure to head left, and you’ll be able to revisit the <strong>parking garage</strong>, the location where Leon first met love interest/frenemy, Ada Wong. In here, you’ll find a <strong>cute bear charm</strong>, the same one seen on the keys that Ada hands to Leon in Resident Evil 4.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/mr-x-1772205784653.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>11. </strong>In the RPD, you’ll once again come face-to-face with <strong>Mr. X</strong>. But did you notice that Grace actually bumps into him, too? Well, not really, but the guy that she brushes against the streets of Wrenwood at the very start of the game sure does look like he’s wearing Mr.X's outfit…complete with the fedora hat he wears in the RE2 remake.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/hunk-1772205801324.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>12. </strong>Like Tofu and Mr. X, there’s also another returning Resident Evil 2 legend, who, although never outright named, is quite clearly everyone’s favourite no-nonsense mercenary, <strong>Hunk</strong>. This unlockable character from the original Resident Evil 2 (and many games that came after) turns up as a boss in Requiem’s final act, and somewhat lives up to his legacy, with Leon declaring him to be a tough bastard after they duke it out to the death. RIP Hunk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 2 isn’t the only game from the series referenced in Requiem, though, with the previous entry, Resident Evil Village, also getting a couple of nods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>13. </strong>Just after you reach the helipad, you enter a room full of items to examine. One of these is a <strong>wine bottle</strong> which has the name Dimiterscu written on it, clearly referring to everyone’s favourite goth mummy from Resident Evil Village. The bottle is labelled “Sanguis Virginis”, which is the same wine used to solve a puzzle in Village’s castle location.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/mother-m-1772205831801.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>14. </strong>Later on, in Spencer’s study, you can see a picture of a lone woman with the letter M on it. This refers to <strong>Mother Miranda</strong>, the big bad of Resident Evil Village and (as we find out at the end of that game) Ozwell E. Spencer’s idol and inspiration.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/rings-1772205849284.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>15. </strong>One of Requiem’s big bads is Victor Gideon, who sports some significant jewellery. Look close and you can see a <strong>snake motif</strong> on his ring. The same snake motif is seen on Krauser’s knife in RE4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>16. </strong>Requiem also has a reference to the silliest of Resident Evil’s puzzles, with Grace pointing out the <strong>ludicrous systems of opening doors</strong> in these zombie-infested mansions. When inserting the Red Gem into a door at the Rhodes Hill Care Center, Grace rightly states, “How do normal people get in here?” </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>17. </strong>But perhaps no door in Resident Evil is more iconic than the <strong>original game's loading screen animations </strong>between rooms, something that is referenced near the beginning of the game with a slow zoom on the door before the chainsaw-wielding Doctor attacks Leon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That battle is complete chaos, with a host of cool interactions with the chainsaw. There are a couple of brilliant details you might miss, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>18. </strong>The chainsaw is unwieldy at the best of times, spinning wildly when on the floor. If you manage to kill a zombie while they’re still holding it, <strong>the chainsaw will end up dragging the fallen flesh eaters</strong> along for the ride.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/chainsaw-1772205889416.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>19. </strong>A zombie can also be impaled with a still-operational chainsaw, the revving blade protruding straight through their rib cage. Don’t let them get too close, though, because if they grab you, then <strong>they’ll drive their chest with the chainsaw directly into yours</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>20.</strong> It’s quite clear that many of the other zombies roaming the halls of the Rhodes Hill Care Center have their own personalities, but there are also <strong>medical records </strong>you can find that share their names and defining traits, with a personal favourite being Eileen Zimmerson, one of the singing zombies whose personality disorder is described as “main character syndrome”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>21.</strong> Meanwhile, the enormous mass grinding its way through the hallways who we know as “Chunk” is actually called <strong>Thomas K. Jackson</strong>, and the version Leon takes on is called <strong>Timothy B. Jackson</strong>. So they’re actually brothers, both with irregular eating pattern disorders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>22. </strong>Interestingly, several zombies still retain traits from their mortal existence, like the <strong>cleaning zombie</strong>, who is super focused on scrubbing the blood out of the mirror. She will, however, also move locations to clean up the gore you create by killing other zombies.  </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/helicopter-1772205936816.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>23. </strong>Later on, when Grace and Emily meet Harry Reed, most would progress on with the story while Emily is safe in the helicopter. If you’re a psycho, though, Capcom has prepared <strong>custom dialogue</strong> for Harry should you, for some reason, decide to unload on the whirlybird.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/learn-to-stter-1772205964214.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>24. </strong>Capcom has also layered subtle instructions into the environment when Leon first takes to the motorbike in Raccoon City, with a billboard appearing very early on that says <strong>“Learn to Steer”</strong> just after the player takes control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>25. </strong>Leon is a master with his equipment, as shown when using a flashlight with his handgun. When you go to reload, Leon will smoothly <strong>tuck the flashlight into his shoulder</strong>, making for a very slick and detailed animation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>26. </strong>Also interesting: when reloading, both Grace and Leon will <strong>retain the magazine</strong> if there are still rounds in it. If it’s empty, they’ll discard it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final details are, at the time of writing this, part of an unsolved mystery, so answers might be out there by the time you watch this, but they’re super cool nonetheless.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/just-ignore-a-1772205981770.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>27. </strong>After taking out the Tyrant, you’ll notice a basketball court with a <strong>suspicious-looking head</strong> in the middle. Shuffle kick that head along until it goes through the hoop, and you’ll get a new action prompt that tells you “There’s no time for playing around”. Instead of pushing forward to the orphanage, head back to Kendo’s gun shop, and you’ll now find a prompt on a headless Toy Uncle bobblehead that reads “just ignore A”. Our first theory was that this was a reference to the ending choice, since the first option (or "A" ending) isn’t the canon one, but we’ve since stumbled on something else that might explain it further…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>28. </strong>The <strong>final mystery</strong> is a doozy that we’ve yet to solve, but here are the hidden clues we have so far. After your escape from The Girl in the elevator shaft, her arm will be severed and available to pick up. It didn’t appear to serve any purpose until we decided to run it through the analysis machine you use to upgrade your crafting recipes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After solving this puzzle, you’re shown a black screen that says ‘Let’s Play’, and a sequence of letters: G,A,U, and C. Based on the prior clue, I think it’s safe to ignore A. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/lets-play-1772206008985.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Hidden in the game are some clues to what these letters mean. In an hourglass you can find and rotate, U is revealed to be linked to the number 380,000. In Grace’s blood analysis report, C is 4.2 LY, and on the side of the blood analyser device, there’s a sticker that says G = 15,000,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does all this mean? Well, our guess was that it’s the distance to the moon, sun, and nearest star, which also happens to be the sequence buttons for the puzzles in the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center. After using the G, U, C sequence and translating them into moon, sun, and star inputs for the machine, entering that code triggers a creepy laughter sound effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does that mean? That’s where we’re stumped! Hopefully, you’ll already have the answers and can drop it in the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s everything we’ve spotted so far in Resident Evil Requiem. Did we miss any cool Easter eggs, or are there small gameplay details we missed? Let us know in the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dale Driver is an Associate Director of Video Programming at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">From <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review"><u>ARC Raiders</u></a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/escape-from-duckov-is-a-tarkov-parody-thats-going-quackers-on-steam-with-500000-sales-and-big-concurrents"><u>Escape From Duckov</u></a>, extraction shooters seem to be enjoying something of a renaissance right now, to the delight of shooter fans like myself. But of all the newcomers to that space, none have captured my attention more than Marathon since I first played its early alpha over a year ago. Even through some of Bungie’s recent lows, the idea of taking the high-stakes looting deathmatch that is an extraction shooter and combining it with the unparalleled shooting for which the studio is known has always been an awesome idea. Now, after playing Marathon for the better part of a day as it kicks off its server slam ahead of launch next week, that rad concept seems to have turned out about as well as I was hoping it would, with absolutely stellar gunplay, some interesting characters and lore, ands a a loot grind that’s made it hard to step away long enough to even write this initial review. It’s still way too early for me to say if any of this will have staying power all the way through my 100th run, but it’s left a very strong first impression.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve always had a difficult time describing exactly what makes a Bungie gun feel so damn good, but whatever it is, Marathon’s got it. Maybe it’s the deliberate musicality to weapons, like that crisp snap from a rifle report, the metallic clink of a trigger, or those amazing hollow thuds when you land a shot. Maybe it’s the way recoil feels rhythmic, with pulse rifles kicking like a heartbeat and handcannons bucking theatrically. Maybe it’s the way the world reacts to your shots, with shields crackling and splintering, and enemy NPCs staggering in place as you riddle them full of holes. Maybe it’s invisible qualities, like the almost perfectly tuned bullet magnetism and finessed projectile speeds, all working together to make you feel slightly better than you actually are. An old Bungie dev once told me that the secret to making a great shooter is in making four seconds of gameplay that feel perfect, then repeating those four seconds as many times as you can. I don’t know if this remains a guiding philosophy of the current team, but in any case, they really seem to have nailed just that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who adores PvP, one massively refreshing aspect of Marathon so far is how far it deviates from the group hug energy of ARC Raiders’ PvE-friendly community. Don’t get me wrong, cooperating with other players can be a hell of a time, but one of the major drawbacks is that you don’t get to see the PvP shine when it rarely happens. In a game like Marathon, with Bungie’s legendary FPS chops on full display, I’d be pretty disappointed if PvP encounters were as rare as they’ve become in ARC Raiders, because those gunfights are without question the best part of any match. The pressure of two teams squaring off in claustrophobic, dark hallways as you try to outmaneuver one another makes for some of the most tense encounters I’ve ever had, and the loot reward you get for winning those firefights is worth the stress (after all, the best way to loot is to let someone else do it for you and take it from their cold, dead hands).</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The mark of a great extraction shooter is that “one more run” feeling, and a big part of that lies in how fun the long-term loot game is. That relies on both the badass weapons and gadgets you’ll find, as well as the quest items you’re asked to collect if you want to unlock an upgrade or complete a mission you’ve been given. In the early hours, I’ve been completely glued to my screen, poring over dense menus and trees to figure out which map I’ll need to play to complete this quest or loot that item, then going into battle with a specific set of objectives in mind – only for it to all go to hell when I run into a rival gang and the shrapnel starts flying. I’m really impressed by how fast the progression feels so far, and even during failed runs, I’ve seemed to make at least some kind of progress despite losing valuable loot along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, acquiring a new weapon on the battlefield, like a long-distance rifle capable of one-shotting poorly-armored characters, then customizing said weapon with neat mods you’ve found along the way feels awesome. But there’s also little ways you can progress, like unlocking the ability to buy a larger backpack if you’ve lost all of yours in the battlefield, or gaining access to better shields in the store instead of having to rely purely on your ability to loot them out in the world. So far I’ve never felt like any of the progress lost on failed runs has hindered my desire to immediately jump back in, even when a particularly devastating loss left me with only white-rarity weapons.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Extraction Shooters</h3><p>For those who like risking it all on loot that's well worth it, these are your best bets.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/Tieguytravis/lists/tieguytravis-favorite-extraction-shooters" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also been great to see the story play a larger role than I expected it to. After each mission, I’ve had some new faction to meet, a few quick lines of dialogue thrown my way, or some lore unlock for me to read, and I find myself really interested in learning more about this world and its inhabitants. I haven’t had nearly enough time to actually dive in here, as it can be tough to find reading time when your crewmates are waiting on you to launch the next match, but the vibe of these cutscenes and the spooky cyberpunk aesthetic is so damn interesting. I’m eager to know more. Here’s hoping the pace of lore continues as strongly as the first day has, and that it actually leads to some kind of payoff, since Bungie notably isn’t always great at this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Server Slam alone doesn’t paint a full picture, but it has got me excited to play more as we approach the full launch next week. I’ll be diving deep into every aspect of Marathon and be back with a final review once I’ve fully put it through its paces.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-review]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="27101ee173e6e"><a title="Pokémon FireRed Version" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27101ee173e6e/pokemon-firered-version.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>One of the joys for many trainers during the earlier generations of Pokémon was giving the main character and their rival a rude or downright inappropriate name. In the Switch eShop versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a>, it seems there have been some updates to this.</p>
<p>As reported by Kotaku, you'll either have to get <em>really</em> creative now, or there's a good chance the game will override whatever you've input and instead give you a generic name. Here's a sample of some of the words that won't fly:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fxmovzg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Kotaku</em> has verified that some words, such as “d**k,” “p***y,” “s**t,” and even the f-slur are replaced by names like “Gary” or “Janne.” This doesn’t seem to extend to some milder words, however, as “hell” and “damn” were not replaced."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This update appears to impact Pokémon names as well. One obvious theory suggests the update is to prevent users from flooding social media with screenshots and footage containing offensive language. This also wouldn't be the best look, as Pokémon is meant to be a family-friendly experience for all ages.</p>
<p>As many trainers have highlighted, this confirms these classic Game Boy Advance releases have actually been edited for this special release. There have also been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/psa-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-switch-version-gives-you-the-mystic-ticket-and-aurora-ticket">some other updates...</a></p>

<p>It’s a we, Mario!</p>



<p>March 10 has become Mario Day (Mar 10) for many gamers. This year, a New York City GameStop is to celebrate the day by attempting to break a record for the largest gathering of people dressed as Mario. The current record for the largest gathering of people dressed as Mario is 230 participants. This was set on August 18, 2010, in Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia, China.</p>



<p>It will be an entire Mario-themed event. There will be prizes and many photo ops. The best Mario cosplayer will receive a free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. All who participate will also receive $5 in bonus store credit to use on any item in the store. You’re free to come dressed as Luigi, but you won’t get the store credit.</p>



<p>Qualifications for the costume are simple. All you need is a red shirt, blue overalls, a red hat, and a mustache.</p>







<h2 id="h-mario-is-still-celebrating-his-40th-anniversary">Mario Is Still Celebrating His 40th Anniversary</h2>



<p>Through April, with the release of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/" id="3170">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, Mario continues to celebrate his 40th anniversary. As part of the anniversary, Nintendo has released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mario-tennis-fever-2/" id="170927">Mario Tennis Fever</a>. There’s also an upcoming Yoshi game, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. However, most are wondering when the next 3D Mario experience will be released.</p>



<p>It has been almost 9 years since Nintendo released<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/super-mario-odyssey/" id="165895"> Super Mario Odyssey</a> on the original Nintendo Switch. This is easily the longest timeframe between brand-new 3D Mario releases. Nintendo released a port of Super Mario 3D World on the Nintendo Switch, which included a secondary mode in Bowser’s Fury. However, they have not released a full 3D Mario game since 2017.</p>







<p>With the latest Mario movie celebrating the legacy of one of the best-reviewed 3D Mario games of all time, many are dying to get back to the Mushroom Kingdom in a brand new experience. For now, maybe you can go to New York City and dress up like Mario and hope of winning a free Nintendo Switch 2 so that you’ll be ready whenever that new game does come.</p>



<p>RSVP for the gathering <a href="https://partiful.com/e/BhTQ2ZaAdQaLoiqX0Fb2">here.</a></p>

<p>Would you participate in an event like this? When do you think the next Mario game will be announced?</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/raven-software/" id="1897">Raven Software </a>has revealed <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2026/02/call-of-duty-bo7-warzone-season-02-patch-notes">patch notes</a> for the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" id="147395">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> Season 2 update. The patch includes an update to Killstreaks in multiple modes and other bug fixes.</p>



<p>Regarding Killstreaks, several updates have been made. They have adjusted the spawn rates of Killstreaks in loot. Resurgence modes have received a 50% reduction from Supply boxes and a 25% reduction from ground loot. This adjustment also counts for Ranked Play. Battle Royale modes have received a 10% reduction in Killstreaks overall.</p>



<p>They’ve also made specific adjustments to Precision Airstrikes, Napalm Strikes, Cluster Strikes, and Bunker Busters. The radius for Killstreak call-ins has gone down to 150 meters. It was originally 255 meters. They’ve also adjusted the limit from three to two. Additionally, they’ve made a change to where only one type of Killstreak is allowed in any given radius.</p>



<p>“Individually, you can deploy one Killstreak of a specific type every 20 seconds. Your squad is limited to one active Killstreak of that type as well. Once used, this allows opponents a window to retaliate. We will continue monitoring Killstreak usage and performance across all modes and make adjustments as needed,” the notes state.</p>







<h2 id="h-additional-bug-fixes-in-the-latest-call-of-duty-warzone-patch">Additional Bug Fixes in the Latest Call of Duty: Warzone Patch</h2>



<p>Additional bug fixes include a fix to an issue that prevented players from properly progressing the “Absolute Zero” mastery camo challenge for the NX Ravager. Also, an issue that allowed players to fall through maps in certain areas has been fixed. </p>

<figure><figcaption>Starring role. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Poodle Cabooble Timed Research during Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos is focused on Furfrou, offering the chance to obtain trims that are not usually available in your region.</strong></p>



<p>While some Furfrou designs are available worldwide, others are locked to a specific region, like the Kabuki Trim in Japan and the Debutante Trim in the Americas.</p>



<p>The tasks are relatively simple, requiring 1km of exploration at each level and changing a Furfrou’s trim, with the rewards being XP boosts. All the details are in the table below.</p>

<p><strong>The A Beautiful Day To Celebrate Timed Research Tasks during Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos are based around the three starter Pokémon</strong> <strong>from the region.</strong></p>

When the door opens, two other Pikachu are waiting outside dressed and ready for vacation. One, a male Pikachu (based on the tail shape) is wearing a floral polo shirt, sunglasses, and a big white sunhat with a flower. The other, a female Pika, has on a blue and pink floral sundress and a blue baseball cap also with a flower. Her cheeks are pink instead of red.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are, apparently, Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu, and no, I'm not making those names up.

Pikachu is no stranger to being dressed up – heck, there was even an obtainable Cosplay Pikachu in Pokémon OmegaRuby and AlphaSapphire, and Pikachu has been dressed up in all sorts of outfits for merchandise and in spinoffs like Pokémon GO.  But these two seem to be important NPCs who will be involved in the story somehow. Perhaps each one is version exclusive? Maybe we'll be able to obtain them as a trainer? Maybe they belong to the game's professor? Who knows?

            <guid>1449271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO and Pokémon were my childhood (well, those and TMNT, but that’s for another time). I grew up building everything from simple cars and unrealistic houses to whatever amalgamation my creative mind could imagine. Never, as a kid, did I expect to see a fully licensed Pokémon set like the one we have now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was a child, Pokémon was a game that, even now 30 years later, still has its claws in me with no sign of letting up. My younger siblings and I spent hours as kids, sitting with our Link Cables and GameBoys, trading Pokémon back and forth while we restarted one of our games enough times so we could each start with all three starter Pokémon. I knew I was hooked after spending an afternoon at my grandfather's house manually typing out my own Pokémon guide listing every Pokémon, their evolution levels, and what level they learned each move.</p><div id="234362"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234362" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pikachu and Poké Ball - LEGO Pokemon</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no Pokémon more iconic to the franchise than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Pikachu">Pikachu</a>, and while this set's first images weren’t as impressive as I’d hoped, I've changed my mind after building it and seeing it up close. As I gaze at it sitting on my shelf surrounded by other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-plushies">Pokémon plushes</a>, statues, and numerous other Pokémon collectibles, I have to admit that it looks great! Is it perfect? No, but man, it’s a very welcome addition to my collection.</p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>With Pokémon celebrating its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/pokemon-presents-30th-anniversary-livestream-watch-party-post-show">30th anniversary</a>, it’s the perfect time to build this latest collaboration and go back to the series' roots, even though Pikachu wouldn’t be a selectable starter until Pokémon Yellow’s 1997/1998 release. LEGO provided IGN with a review set for a test build, and I was excited and fortunate enough to be the one to put it together. This 2,050-piece build took me around six hours to complete, which was long enough to revisit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/pokemon-the-first-movie">Pokémon: The First Movie</a> (that big final moment still brings tears to my eyes), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/detective-pikachu-the-movie">Detective Pikachu</a>, and a couple of other Pokémon movies that were available to stream. </p><p>In the earlier steps, I was confused as to why our favorite little yellow mouse had so many vibrant pinks, teals, and other non-Pikachu-specific colors while building. However, as I finished the steps and his torso began to take shape, I realized all the additional colors would be hidden in the final build, and were there to make piecing together the inside easier. </p></div><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Lego Pikachu Build Slideshow</h3></div></span></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It showed me how far LEGO has come in reducing complications and making larger builds faster to complete. I couldn’t help but smile after hitting major milestones in the build, and had the biggest one of them all when I settled Pikachu into his final resting position surrounded by the plastic lightning, making his action pose even more dynamic.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest drawback to this LEGO Pikachu set is the $199.99 price tag; it's not much larger (size-wise) than its more affordable counterpart, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-pokemon-eevee-set-72151">Eevee</a>, and it doesn’t feel as epic as the much more expensive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-pokemon-venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-set-72153">Kanto starters set</a>. Pikachu’s set comes with 16 bags. The first nine build the electric mouse #25 (National Pokédex) himself, while the remaining seven build his Poke Ball and the base to attach him to. The instruction manual is the same as the other Pokémon sets and comes with a Pokédex entry for Pikachu, as well as a look back on his history with the franchise, which was fun to remind myself of how far he and this franchise have come. Steps are well organized throughout the building process, and while the first few steps may look nothing like Pikachu, they quickly take shape as you move into the middle steps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the Eevee build, as you progress, you will assemble sections, leaving small pockets open to eventually attach its articulable arms, legs, ears, and tail. Pikachu’s build starts with the internal portions of his torso, neck, and head, then adds the external rounded pieces to give him his iconic look. His lightning bolt-shaped tail and base were the highlights of the build for me, and they look great in LEGO form, accentuating Pikachu’s design. These steps were the simplest parts of the build, but they were also the most satisfying for me. Pikachu also features a few fun, swappable parts that can easily be adjusted for a new look. Swapping a hinge inside the pokeball converts it from open to closed. Pikachu can stand on his own or attach to his slanted stand (my preference), and you can swap the endcap pieces on Pikachu’s tail, swapping between heart-shaped (female) and pointed (male). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not perfect, Pikachu’s feet are surprisingly pose-able to help with balancing him. Just take precautions during the build, because mine did take a tumble or two. His arms, however, are limited to vertical mobility and are prone to detaching if you try to adjust them too far outside that range. The good news is they are extremely easy to reattach should that occur, as it did to me a few times while rotating to attach new pieces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">His ears are also fantastic for articulation, as they can be rotated and angled freely, allowing you to quickly change his look. I only wish the set had a few more alternate pieces, like his mouth, to change his expression. There were only a few steps throughout the build process that gave me some trouble, and one of them was attaching the single round pieces to the center of another round piece. This made sense as one of the last words that comes to mind for me when I hear the word LEGO is round, which made these complications understandable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final portion of most steps is adorning Pikachu with pieces that help distinguish him from any other pile of yellow bricks. Thankfully, Pikachu’s eyes and mouth are printed on pieces, so no worries about ruining a set with a slightly misplaced sticker or anything of that nature. The eyes and mouth are both singular pieces to attach while his cheeks are a simple combination of pieces to give them their rounded appearance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After completing Pikachu himself, the last things to build are his Poké Ball and lightning bolt-shaped stand, which made up the last seven bags of pieces. Though that's 40% of the bags, it's also filled with lots of larger flat pieces and was the quickest part of the build. This was great because I built it in two sittings, making getting to the finish line easier and all the more enjoyable. </p><p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"><div data-cy="poll-content-block"><form action="#" data-cy="poll-content"><fieldset role="radiogroup" aria-labelledby="poll-question"><legend><span><h2 data-cy="poll-question" id="poll-question">What generation of Pokemon Starters should get a Lego set next? </h2></span></legend><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64792" id="answerId64792-label"><span>Gen 1 (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64793" id="answerId64793-label"><span>Gen 2 (Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64794" id="answerId64794-label"><span>Gen 3 (Treecko, Torchic, Mudkip)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64795" id="answerId64795-label"><span>Gen 4 (Turtwig, Chimchar, Piplup)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64796" id="answerId64796-label"><span>Gen 5 ( Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64797" id="answerId64797-label"><span>Gen 6 (Chespin, Fennekin, Froakie)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64798" id="answerId64798-label"><span>Gen 7 (Rowlett, Litten, Popplio)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64799" id="answerId64799-label"><span>Gen 8 ( Grookey, Scorbunny, Sobble)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64800" id="answerId64800-label"><span>Gen 9 (Sprigatito, Fuecoco, Quaxly) </span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64801" id="answerId64801-label"><span>Gen 10 (Browt, Ponbon, Gecqua) </span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div></fieldset><span></span></form></div></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pikachu may not be my favorite Pokémon (Bulbasaur, you know, I had to include him in here at least once), but it was still an incredibly fun build and a wonderful addition to my collection.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Go fans have an action-packed weekend ahead with Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos, including an important decision on whether to opt for the X or Y path of Special Research.</p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-go/" id="1345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a> Tour continues the passage through the generations of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> by focusing on the Kalos region, the sixth generation, landing in a period where the region has received a wealth of attention after Lumiose City’s return in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a-2/" id="3627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re unsure of whether to choose the X or Y path in Pokémon Go, Insider Gaming can help you to decide.</p>







<h2 id="h-should-you-choose-x-or-y-in-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">Should You Choose X or Y in Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Choices to make. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The decision on whether to choose the X or Y path during Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos ultimately comes down to which Legendary Pokémon you want to encounter.</strong></p>



<p>Completing all of the Special Research Tasks from the event provides an encounter with one of the two major Legendary Pokémon of the Kalos region, Xerneas or Yveltal. Both are extremely powerful and handy additions to your squad.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-tour-kalos-an-x-ceptional-yarn-special-research-tasks-rewards/" id="181117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All Pokémon Go An X-Ceptional Yarn Special Research Tasks &amp; Rewards</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If you have already caught one of the Pokémon, but not the other, the best choice is to opt for the one that is missing from your Pokédex. If you already have both, it might be worth checking the stats to see which is weaker and trying to get a stronger version.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-x-amp-y-version-reward-differences">All X &amp; Y Version Reward Differences</h2>



<p><strong>Encounters with Xerneas and Yveltal are the headline rewards for completing the Special Research Tasks during Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos, but they’re not the only reward that varies based on your choice.</strong></p>



<p>The rewards are extremely similar, with the main differences being the Pokémon encounters you will earn, including two different forms of Unown.</p>

</ul>



<p>Opting for the Y path provides slightly more Stardust and XP, but the difference is minimal. During the Research Tasks, one specific Stardust and XP reward is based on the Pokédex numbers, with Yveltal’s, 717, being one higher than Xerneas at 716.</p>



<p>The table below shows the rewards that are exclusive to the choice you make during Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos.</p>

    <article>
      <p>For the ten year anniversary of farming simulator <em>Stardew Valley</em>, developer Eric Barone <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-10-year-anniversary/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>revealed two new marriage candidates for the upcoming 1.7 update</u></a>. One of them is a fan favorite that people have wanted to date for years. The other is about as far from that as you can get.</p><p>Let me tell you about Clint: he sucks. He is the blacksmith in Pelican Town, he has a weird goatee, and he is extremely obsessed with another woman in town in a way that creeps me out. If you befriend him, you’ll soon realize that he doesn’t really think about women as people, and has no regard for the feelings of the woman he keeps pursuing. When you get his relationship meter up to three hearts, you’re able to tell him that he just needs to treat women the same as he treats men in his life. Maybe this is a little extreme, but the idea of voluntarily having a friendship with a person who needs to be told that makes me want to throw up.</p><p>The other new marriage candidate, Sandy, is a shopkeeper in the desert area of the game. She’s cute and has pink hair. As friend of Aftermath Nico Deyo put it on Bluesky, “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3mfubbht5g22m?ref=aftermath.site"><u>here are the two new marriage options in <em>Stardew Valley</em>: Town Sweetheart and Dr. Pervert.</u></a>”</p><p>While it’s likely that Barone is about to reveal a storyline that redeems Clint’s character, he will have a long way to go. Personally I look forward to continuing to not date Clint as I pursue my new pink-haired wife.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/treyarch-games/" id="52220">Treyarch </a>has revealed patch notes for the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" id="2795">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> Season 2 update. The patch includes an update to the XM325 Titan Wield, along with changes to gameplay, UI, and more.</p>



<p>The weapon’s updates include adjustments to reduce some of its power. It’s said that the TTK should still be extremely competitive, but now with a heavier falloff that can be felt when missing shots at range. They say they went this route rather than hitting the spread “in order to maintain the viability of the ‘turret’ build that comes from combining this with the Prestige Attachment.”</p>



<p>Treyarch announced plans for another damage adjustment targeting scorestreaks to better balance this weapon with other anti-streak builds. The weapon’s maximum damage range has decreased from 23 to 13. The medium damage range has decreased from 18 to 11. Lastly, the minimum damage range has decreased to 10. It’s down from 16.</p>







<h2 id="h-additional-updates-in-the-latest-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-patch">Additional Updates in the Latest Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Patch</h2>



<p>Multiplayer features an update to Safeguard mode that slightly reduces speed and increases the robot’s health. An Overload mode issue has been addressed. The issue previously allowed weapons other than a pistol to be carried while the device was held.</p>



<p>There are also Ranked Play updates. Gameplay-wise, Treyarch has reduced the Trophy System’s charge rate to match normal multiplayer gameplay. Also, they have adjusted the “Forfeit” vote text to specify that the input must be held.</p>







<p>Check out the full patch notes <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2026/02/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-02-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-winds-waves-region-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new adventure in the world of Pokémon is on the horizon following the reveal of Pokémon Winds and Waves, and questions are already being asked about the inspiration for the title and the region it is based on.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Winds and Waves will release exclusively on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2027, marking the tenth generation of the Pokémon franchise.</p>



<p>If you’ve got questions on the region and inspiration for Pokémon Winds and Waves, Insider Gaming has shared everything known so far.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-region-is-pokemon-winds-and-waves-based-on">What Region Is Pokémon Winds And Waves Based On?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Volcanic. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The region that Pokémon</strong> <strong>Winds and Waves is based on has not been officially announced, but it’s widely understood to be based on Indonesia and the surrounding islands</strong> <strong>of Southeast Asia.</strong></p>



<p>Winds and Waves looks set to be a sprawling adventure across multiple islands, lush jungles, and the depths of the ocean, with the trailer offering a hint of what fans can expect from the game.</p>



<p>Additional details on the Winds and Waves official website confirm this, stating that the titles “feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves that ebb and flow.” The description also states the region has a “lush environment” that has seen Pokémon “develop their own unique ecosystems.”</p>

</ul>



<p>That description also connects to Indonesia and Southeast Asia, which have a variety of animals and creatures that cannot be found anywhere else in the world.</p>



<p>Although Pokémon may never officially confirm the region as the inspiration for Winds and Waves, the real world has always served as inspiration for Pokémon games, including Scarlet and Violet being based on Spain, Sword and Shield based on England, and Sun and Moon based on Hawaii.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-other-inspiration-is-in-pokemon-gen-10">What Other Inspiration Is In Pokémon Gen 10?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>often appears to take inspiration from real-world creatures, mythicalogically beast, and elements of nature when developing games, which again seems to be present in Winds and Waves.</strong></p>



<p>Although the reveals so far have been limited, the starter Pokémon all have strong resemblances to familiar creatures.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>Pombon, the Puppy Pokémon, has striking similarities to a Pomeranian, while Gecqua’s basis is clear with the category of the “Water Gecko Pokémon.” Finally, Browt is clearly based on a baby bird.</p>



<p>Given the names of the titles, the legendary Pokémon that headline Winds and Waves could well be tied to the sky and the sea. While there have already been Pokémon that fit those areas, Gen 10 could delve deeper into the world of Legendary Pokémon, tying the wind and the waves specifically to these new creatures.</p>

But he doesn’t want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [49,687 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> team would respect his wishes.”</p><p>The original&nbsp;<em>Demon’s Souls</em> was also developed by FromSoftware. Miyazaki, speaking to Edge magazine in 2022 (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/miyazaki-says-elden-rings-graphics-team-felt-extra-pressure-due-to-demons-souls-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGC</a>), said that while he had not played the remake by Bluepoint Games, he was happy to see it renewed for a new generation—supporting Yoshida’s theory that <em>Bloodborne</em> may be a special case.</p><p>“As you say, I was not directly involved in it, and I haven’t actually played the <em>Demon’s</em> remake,” Miyazaki said at the time. “But this is because I just don’t enjoy playing the games that I’ve made in the past. It brings up a lot of old emotions, a lot of old memories, and this gets a little bit overwhelming, and it doesn’t feel like playing any more. So I have not played the <em>Demon’s</em> remake, but I am very glad to see it get this fresh look, these brand-new current-gen graphics.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“It was an old game, so to see it get remade in this way and have new players playing it was obviously something that made me very happy.</p><p>“It was a rough game back in the day, with a relatively rough development, so I was anxious that new players would not enjoy it in that same way. That was a cause of concern for me when it was re-released but, you know, in the end, I’m just happy to see the reaction and happy to see people enjoying it.</p><p>“One thing that was really fun was seeing [Bluepoint Games] come up with things we didn’t consider and to approach certain elements of the game its visuals and its mechanics in a way that we either couldn’t or didn’t back in the day. So to see them researching and applying these new thought processes and new techniques, this was something that was really exciting and interesting for me.”</p><p>Unrelated to Bluepoint Games, Brandon Sheffield, director at <em><a title="Games > Demonschool [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/demonschool">Demonschool</a></em> developer <a title="Companies > Necrosoft Games [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/necrosoft-games">Necrosoft Games</a>, said his studio also pitched a <em>Bloodborne</em>-related project to Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p><p>“I could find you 10 companies that have pitched a <em>Bloodborne</em> sequel, spinoff, or remake, including my own,” Sheffield said on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/post/3mfumxivzgc2t" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>. “It’s just not going to happen unless [FromSoftware] decides they want to do it.”</p><p><strong>Bluepoint Games’ Closure</strong></p><p>The <em>Bloodborne</em> pitch is a small part in a larger report surrounding Bluepoint Games’ closure. According to Bloomberg, following its acquisition by Sony Interactive Entertainment, Bluepoint Games continued its work assisting <a title="Companies > Santa Monica Studio [191 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/santa-monica-studio">Santa Monica Studio</a> on <em><a title="Games > God of War Ragnarok [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a></em>.</p><p>After 2022, the studio began work on a live-service game set in the <em><a title="Games > God of War (2018) [176 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-2018">God of War</a></em> universe, in which the character Atreus falls into Hades. A loose idea was for players to control different versions or aspects of Atreus as they battled through Greek hell, and to include some form of <a title="Genres > Co-Op [379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative game</a>play and ongoing support, but much of the game’s design was still in flux.</p><p>Bluepoint Games struggled to develop a live-service game, being a small team mostly skilled in art and engineering rather than design. Some Bluepoint Games staff wanted to work on a traditional <a title="Genres > Action [3,445 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> rather than a live-service project.</p><p>After several years of struggling development, even with help from Santa Monica Studio, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/sony-interactive-entertainment-cancels-live-service-games-from-bluepoint-games-and-bend-studio">canceled</a> the <em>God of War</em> live-service project in January 2025.</p><p>It was around then that, in searching for its next project, Bluepoint Games pitched a remake of <em>Bloodborne</em>. After that was turned down, it spent some time pitching an updated version of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, the <a title="Platforms > PS2 [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps2">PlayStation 2</a> game it had previously remade in 2018, but that was also turned down. It also pitched other studios under the Sony Interactive Entertainment umbrella about developing new projects in other franchises, such as a spin-off of <em><a title="Games > Ghost of Tsushima [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a></em>, but nothing was greenlit.</p><p>By February 2026, Bluepoint Games had gone more than a year without securing a new project. After Sony announced plans on February 12 to remake the original <em>God of War</em> trilogy without Bluepoint Games’ involvement, some employees at the studio grew uneasy. One week later, it was announced that the studio was shutting down.</p><p>According to people familiar with Sony Interactive Entertainment’s thinking, the company no longer believed Bluepoint Games was equipped to make its own game and was unable to find a partnership that made sense.</p><p>Recently, as Bluepoint Games’ former staff look for jobs—including opportunities to apply for positions at other studios within Sony Interactive Entertainment— other companies were making phone calls to see if there might be a way to salvage the studio, according to people familiar with the situation, as unlikely as the prospect may be.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/bloomberg-bluepoint-games-pitched-a-bloodborne-remake-but-was-turned-down]]></content:encoded>

<p>Well, Nintendo kindly sent one over to Nintendo Life Towers and we can confirm that it is indeed a Switch 2 Pro Controller — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">a pad we absolutely love</a> — now with some pleasantly subtle RE-detailing. What's not to like?</p>
<p>Back in the day, sure, we were <em>all about</em> the gorily OTT RE chainsaw controller for GameCube, but two decades on? We're a little more sophisticated than we used to be, perhaps. We don't <em>need</em> blood splatter over every prong of our pad, and this new one could sit on the side quite comfortably without alarming pets or family members.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at those little details, courtesy of our lovely video chap Alex, shall we? First, some close-ups, then a handful of moody shots that may well have been snapped in a Raccoon City warehouse! Or possibly Alex's garage:</p>


<p>Tasty, no? Itchy, right?...</p>
<p>If you're interested in seeing how it compares to the regular Pro Controller colour-wise (it <em>is</em> a little different), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hjhZXoQ8OhI">check out Alex's short below</a>, and our review of the non-Evil version.</p>
<p><em>Let us know below if you've picked up one of these pads.</em></p>
