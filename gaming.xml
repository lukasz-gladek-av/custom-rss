			<p>Blood of Mehran wears its influences on its sleeve. Part God of War, part Assassin’s Creed, and borrowing from various other action games from a bygone era, there is definitely a passion to create a game that captures the highs of a linear action game, but Blood of Mehran has issues that do not allow it to elevate above average.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blood of Mehran | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iPTk65s7SWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game follows Mehran, a warrior turned farmer, who has to pick up the sword again when tragedy strikes, sending him down a path of revenge. This journey is split into linear levels in which you go down a path while taking out waves of enemies that get in your way, until you reach the boss at the end of the level. Mehran starts with a sword, eventually unlocking a bow &amp; arrow, double scimitars, and a sword and shield combo. Each of these are good at dealing with different situations, and can be upgraded at the occasional shops you happen upon, and your abilities augmented through experience points.</p>



<p>Combat in Blood of Mehran does have a bit of depth to it, requiring you to switch weapons to deal with different threats. Archers can be a pain, so using the shield to block their arrows and then switching to the bow and arrow to hit back shows there has been thought put in. However, the combat is also a core issue in Blood of Mehran. Feedback is almost non-existent and if it wasn’t for the health bars above enemies you wouldn’t be able to tell if you were doing damage.</p>

<p>The hit boxes don’t seem to be based on your actual weapon placement either. Get in close enough to an arbalester, for example, and you might get a hit in, but they will then flip away from you. If your sword is still swinging and it slices through the arbalester while they are flipping, no damage is done. That isn’t the only situation where sword swings seem to do no damage, but it is one of the more noticeable. Parrying also feels off. When it works it is great to give openings, but other times parrying just seems poorly timed, where it looks like you are parrying at the right time but it does not register.</p>

<p>What Blood of Mehran has got is looks, at least in the environments of the levels. Each level has a lot of detail to it, and the water in some levels looks particularly good. But, you then notice the pop-in, the frame rate drops, the character models that look very smooth and a wide eyed, and the lip movements not matching what is being said. That great look in the general environment is undone by the smaller details when it comes to character models and actions.</p>
<p>There’s also how things sound. The voice acting is serviceable, with the emotions not necessarily lining up with the situations. Mehran also has a habit of addressing his enemies saying things like they are punks, while nowhere near them, like he is psyching himself up for the fight ahead. There’s no real hint of anger which you would expect, the lines instead being recited quite calmly. The line delivery from secondary characters is a bit worse, and comes across as annoying in one particular character.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Blood of Mehran is a bit of a throwback, taking its inspiration from games a couple of generations back. The foundation has been put in place, but Blood of Mehran is a distinctively average eight hour experience with combat not reaching the levels it could, voice acting that could be better, and various performance issues that need addressing.	</p></div>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/digital-foundry-delivers-a-technical-breakdown-of-switch-2s-dlss</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/digital-foundry-delivers-a-technical-breakdown-of-switch-2s-dlss.1317451/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We've known that Nvidia's custom-built Switch 2 chip would bring some DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) magic to the new console for a good while now, though specifics around how the technology is actually working under the hood have been pretty slim. Fortunately, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> are here to shed some light on the whole thing.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDvf1gsMgmY">new video</a> (above), DF's Alex Battaglia gets into the weeds of the Switch 2's DLSS and explains how it works compared to other models on PC. There's been no official word from Nintendo or Nvidia on the matter, but this is pretty much as comprehensive a breakdown as you'll get.</p>
<p>There's a lot of technical language to get to grips with in the above video, and we'd highly recommend watching it in its entirety for all of the details, but the long and the short of it is as follows: there are <em>two</em> different forms of DLSS available on Switch 2.</p>
<p>The first is what we see used in the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on Switch 2. According to Digital Foundry, this DLSS model shares many of the same characteristics found in the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which was commonplace on PC prior to the introduction of DLSS 4. This provides more consistent image quality at 1080p resolutions and working anti-aliasing on both movement and camera cuts.</p>
<p>However, this isn't the same as <em>all</em> DLSS models found on Switch 2. Examining the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/touryst-deluxe">The Touryst</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> on the console, Digital Foundry concludes that there is another, "tiny" DLSS model at work for games trying to achieve resolutions above 1080p.</p>
<p>This secondary model boasts a sharper image resolution, but far worse anti-aliasing on movement and camera cuts — the DF analysis even states that it looks like it's not working in motion. The big perk is that this model could operate at nearly half the cost of the beefier version, putting less stress on the Switch 2's GPU for upscaling.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all based entirely on DF's analysis for the time being, without any official word from Nvidia or Nintendo (as unlikely as it would be to get anything from the latter). That said, Digital Foundry has had word from a developer, who remains anonymous, that the theory is correct, and there are indeed two DLSS models at play for the system.</p>
<p>Battaglia concludes his analysis by stating that he understands why developers might want to use the less-taxing model in handheld mode, though its visual downgrades mean that he struggles to see its use in docked play.</p>

            <p>When Sega and Creative Assembly's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> launched in 2014, I was deputy editor at Official Xbox Magazine. I remember getting the review copy from our contributor Alex "Game Over, Man" Dale, and asking him how long the game was. 35-40 hours, he said. WTF, I said. I can't remember how Alex responded - possibly his transmission ended with a jangling scream and a burp of static, or possibly he agreed with me that 35-40 hours is indecently hefty for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/I'd%20definitely%20shorten%20it">horror</a> game, even with the qualification that you can get through the main campaign in around 20. 35-40 hours? That's a farking Final Fantasy, mate!</p>
<p>Over 10 years later, we finally know who to blame. Surprise surprise, it was the xenomorph all along. According to Alien Isolation writer Dion Lay, the Gigerbeast's increasing capability during development made certain areas more time-intensive than they were originally supposed to be. There's probably a relevant Alien quote to invoke, here, but I'm going to settle for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3j9muCo4o0">that Jeff Goldblum line</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-park">Jurassic Park</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>Speaking to FRVR in <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/alien-isolation-writer-says-the-horror-game-is-too-long-because-its-clever-xenomorph-was-dumber/">a recent interview</a>, Lay conceded that "in a perfect world, yeah, I'd kind of shrink it down a bit, get down its core".

</p><p>"The Alien really evolved as we were making it," he went on. "By the time it was perfect, it was like, 'Oh, wow, everything takes a lot longer!' So, it would be really nice to pare it down to its core, make it a lot shorter. At the time, it didn't seem that long, and then you suddenly go, 'Oh my God.' So, yeah, I'd definitely shorten it, you know. But, yeah, at the time, there was some stuff where we were like: 'Yeah, we can't take that out now, that would kind of upend everything.'"</p><p>I'd like Lay to go into more detail about which particular aspects of Jack the Ripley-killer's behaviour had the biggest impact on completion times. The xenomorph's vaunted evolving AI was one of the game's major marketing McGuffins before release. I remember devs telling me campfire stories about how distractions such as flares might gradually lose effectiveness. The third time you lob a flare, the Alien may deduce the presence or even the likely position of a flare-thrower. Eek!</p>
<p>Back in 2014, I tried to map out all the AI permutations in a big double-page magazine flowchart for OXM, which probably got a lot of launch day players killed. I can't remember how this pre-release hype stacked up to the reality. Ten years is a long time, and my Isolation memories are mostly locker interiors, at this stage. Mostly.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's credible that the creature's smarts are one reason Isolation is such a marathon. Perhaps that's something Creative Assembly will address in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-isolation-is-getting-a-sequel-10-years-later">the forthcoming Alien: Isolation sequel</a> - it's not clear how many of the old Isolation team are still there. In terms of persistent, unkillable munsters, I'd say the perfect organism's biggest competition right now is the Beast from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker">Amnesia: The Bunker</a>.</p>

              <p>If you’ve been looking for a way to share your Formula 1 enthusiasm with your kids while keeping them entertained with quality building toys, LEGO has created exactly what you need. The <strong>LEGO F1 collectible race cars pack</strong> brings the excitement of the racing circuit straight to your living room and right now, Amazon is offering this set at a record low price during Prime Big Deal Days: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/">Down from $30 to just $20, this mystery box collection has climbed into the top 10 best-selling LEGO sets</a> on the site.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Twelve Teams, Virtually Limitless Possibilities</h2>
<p>The allure of this set is its mystery box structure: <strong>Six randomly picked mini F1 race cars out of a total of 12 varying models</strong> are received, which makes for a different combination with each purchase. The available roster consists of <strong>RB20, Mercedes-AMG, Ferrari, McLaren, Aston Martin, Alpine, Williams, VCARB, Sauber, Haas, a generic F1, and an F1 Academy car</strong>. Each model is incredibly small (being a few inches in length) which makes them ideal for little hands to hold on to and operate for creative race scenarios. The<strong> randomness provides for a surprise that children dearly enjoy</strong>&nbsp;and creates a fuss around the unboxing alone as children see which teams ended up in their individual collection.</p>



<p>LEGO did not skimp on details here: Each car comes decorated in <strong>genuine team colors with actual team logos emblazoned</strong> directly onto the bodywork so that young supporters will have the opportunity to recognize their favored teams at a glance. A <strong>team helmet occupying each cockpit</strong> adds another note of realism which F1-fixated youngsters will love.</p>
<p>The wheels spin smoothly, too, which makes these from passive display pieces into dynamic racing toys. Children can push them around the floor, prepare racing grids on the table top, or devise elaborate race scenarios pitting disparate teams against one another for the championship crown. At a total of 174 pieces divided between six cars, individual assemblies, which take between 10-15 minutes, remain small enough for little ones but still encounter enough challenge to be satisfying.</p>



<p>They’re compact enough that you can toss a few into a purse for restaurant waits, road trips, or flights when you’d like something to amuse kids without wasting valuable luggage space. They’re ideal birthday party favors when you’re hosting a racing-themed party, too. Instead of gaudy-cheap pieces of plastic that snap off after a few hours, guests depart with actual LEGO constructions they’ll be able to use repeatedly and treasure.</p>
<p>At $20 for a six-car pack, you’re out about $3.33 per model, which is extremely cheap considering each one is a complete buildable set complete with actual F1 branding. Because there are 12 distinct cars overall, acquiring two 6-packs provides a good likelihood of assembling a majority or all of the released models. As built, the little racers look great lining a shelf in your child’s bedroom, on a starting grid layout, or assembled into team alliances.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingmakers%E2%80%99-early-access-release-has-been-delayed-no-new-release-date-in-sight.1317424/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Kingmakers, the third-person action time-travelling game that gives you a truck and an assault rifle against legions of medieval-era knights with nothing but swords and horses, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingmakers-the-medieval-based-third-person-action-game-that-pits-assault-rifles-against-swords-launches-in-early-access-this-october/">initially meant to release in early access on PC later this week,</a> on October 8, 2025. Now, that's no longer the case, and the game's release has been delayed with no new release date in sight.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1974144040942625003">In a long statement posted to the X (formerly Twitter) account</a> for the game, developer Redemption Road Games confirmed it needs more time to polish the game, rather than "<em>cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door</em> <em>earlier</em>." What will be coming soon, is a half-hour gameplay deep-dive digging into the gameplay, and updating players on what the team has been working on. </p>



<p>"<em>After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled Kingmakers launch on October 8 will no longer be possible</em>," the studio confirmed at the top of its statement. "<em>We want to apologize to all the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Why is Kingmakers being delayed? In short: it's an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don't want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door</em> <em>earlier.</em> <em>Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that's nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity</em>.</p>



<p><em>With Kingmakers, we set out to push the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60fps to midrange PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80% engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers. We currently</em> <em>have tens of thousands of soldiers,</em> <em>each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you'd expect from a AAA third-person shooter. When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6-story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it's a real place that can be entered, or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena...</em></p>



<p><em>...We set out to do all of this, with full drop-in/drop-out 4 player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Kingmakers is one of the few indie games that, when it first gets announced, <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1759943842466582568">has a viral moment and is suddenly in front of millions of eyes</a>. It has <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1868768562388910113">over a million wishlists on Steam</a> thanks to that first burst of virality, but hype fades as easily as it builds.</p>



<p>Whenever Kingmakers does release, we'll see if it is any deeper than the viral mix of driving a truck through hundreds of knights that can't do anything about it. Perhaps the coming gameplay deep-dive will begin to do away with those concerns, and of course, with it being an early access title, there will likely be plenty of time for it to develop and get better based on community feedback.</p>

"A Civ-like with neat ideas, but half-formed fundamentals and messy execution make your decisions feel less than impactful," wrote contributor Ian Boudreau in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/millenia-review">our Millennia review</a> from March 2024. Sounds like the kind of thing updates might fix, but alack, there shall be no more. Paradox have announced that the 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">strategy</a> Civ-like's eighth patch, out now, will be its last.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"With this patch, we are sadly coming to the end of an age," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1268590/view/518599830010857584?l=english">a Steam blog post</a> from former Paradox Interactive community manager Katten. "This will be the final patch for Millennia, thanks to C Prompt for their work and support of this game. We at Paradox will no longer be active on community platforms for Millennia, but you can continue counting on us for support needs, and the game will remain available to play indefinitely."
</p>
<p>
You can read the full patch notes <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/millennia-update-8.1853194/">here</a>. I wouldn't say it's going out with a whimper, but this definitely isn't a bang. The update spans some general fixes for stuff like borked unit healing and visual errors, together with fixes for localisation. They've also added mod support for custom Age Paintings, and made modded Action Cards more consistent when loading save games.
</p>
<p>
I'm not a Millennia player, but I don't think there's anything on offer there that magically makes the game essential. The recent Steam user reviews are mostly disappointed faces, but Millennia does have a few defenders. 
</p>
<p>
In our review, Ian was both enticed and frustrated by the game's branching alternate-history format, which lets you unlock wacky epochs such as steampunk and aquatic ages by researching the right techs. This sits alongside more familiar 4X anachronisms, such as kingdoms making it all the way to the Renaissance without discovering horse-riding. I love the sound of it all, but as Ian explains, the system's drawback is that only one player can unlock the next age for all of other players, so if you pile research into a particular Age and somebody beats you to the punch, you're screwed. 
</p><p>
It should be a source of hectic competition, with sessions kept lively by the pressure to switch approaches when somebody rudely initiates the Age of Beehive Hairstyles or whatever, but in practice, it just seems to have annoyed a lot of people. Though possibly not as much as some more pervasive issues with the UI and graphics, or core systems such as diplomacy.
</p>
<p>
Millennia launched before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> - also rather a divisive game, with age mechanics redolent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/humankind">Humankind</a>. Seems like doing age progression better has been on the minds of a lot of 4X designers lately. If you're looking for a new empire builder to sponge up the leisure hours/keep you from your annoying family, maybe try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend-2">Endless Legend 2</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legend-2s-early-access-launch-is-a-triumph-of-asymmetrical-4x-design-but-i-do-wish-it-were-even-stranger">recently entered early access</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a>, which recently received one of those bombastic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untolds-big-revolutions-v20-update-is-out-now-aims-to-improve-nearly-every-area-of-the-game">2.0 updates</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-tp-link-wifi-7-router-is-300-off-now-selling-for-pennies-if-you%E2%80%99re-a-prime-member.1317415/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon has formally rolled out <strong>Prime Big Deal Day</strong>&nbsp;which makes tens of thousands of special deals available for Prime members alone. This is one of the primary membership perks: you get sale prices at all-time lows on hottest items across the board. If you have been waiting for a Wi-Fi 7 router from a world-class manufacturer, this is the deal that you simply cannot pass up.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4520/">TP-Link Archer BE800 has gone on sale at $299 (original $599), which is a stunning 50% off one of the best routers available</a> on the market today. This tri-band giant solves the growing problem of bandwidth saturation common in homes nowadays where dozens of devices compete for connectivity, phones, laptops, smart TV and gaming devices being some examples.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4520/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>WiFi 7 Technology That Redefines Your Network</h2>
<p>The Archer BE800 takes Wi-Fi 7’s revolutionary capabilities and combines them<strong> for a total of 19 Gbps across three bands</strong>: 11,520 Mbps on the 6 GHz band, 5,760 Mbps on the 5 GHz band, and 1,376 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. These translate to real-world performance that <strong>handles several 4K and 8K streams at once</strong> without buffering, supports VR-AR gaming without lag and keeps video calls going smoothly even when other members of the household are downloading large files.</p>



<p>The 320 MHz channel bandwidth doubles the pipe compared to Wi-Fi 6’s highest 160 MHz channels and allows for more information at once. Combined with 4K-QAM modulation which encodes more information per transmission, the router provides much better throughput compared to previous generations. Multi-RU functions allow the router to support many devices at once on the same channel without creating the bottlenecks that occur when many devices contend for attention.</p>
<p>The physical connectivity choices are just as solid: <strong>Two 10 Gbps ports support future-proofed wired connections</strong> for high-end users such as NAS setups, desktop workstations, or ISP connections above the standard gigabit rates. One is a combo SFP+ fiber and RJ45 port and allows flexibility should you have your fiber broadband setup or wish to upgrade at a future date. The remaining four 2.5 Gbps ports support devices requiring faster-than-gigabit speeds but not necessarily the full 10 Gbps, such as Wi-Fi 6E access points or high-performance gaming PCs. A USB 3.0 port exists for network-attached storage or shared printing throughout your network.</p>



<p>The <strong>eight strategically mounted antennas</strong> operate with beamforming tech which emits the wireless signal straight at devices instead of broadcasting it omni-directionally. That directional method provides range extension along with stability of connections and shows a particular advantage for large homes or homes on interference hotspots.</p>
<p>TP-Link’s HomeShield security suite includes network scanning, IoT device identification, parental controls, and quality of service management in the free tier. The separate IoT network feature lets you isolate smart home devices on their own protected Wi-Fi network, preventing potential security vulnerabilities in cheap smart bulbs or cameras from compromising your main network. EasyMesh compatibility means you can expand coverage by adding compatible TP-Link extenders that create seamless roaming throughout your home.</p>
<p>For $299 on Prime Big Deal Day, you’re getting enterprise-class networking tech that will last your home networking needs for years into the future.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bye-bye-bose-airpods-max-are-selling-for-peanuts-on-amazon-right-now-2000631785</link>

              <p>When Prime Day rolls around at Amazon, even Apple gets on board with their biggest deals of the year. It’s no coincidence that the last time Apple offered the AirPods Max, their premium over-ear headphones, for only $429 was during the last Prime Day event back in July. But Prime Day’s back, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/">and so are the $429 AirPods Max (down from $549)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>This <strong>21% deal is big stuff for Apple</strong>, especially for their top-of-the-line wireless headphones. And the one tried and true fact about Apple is, you get what you pay for – their tech goods might run higher in price than much of the competition, but the performance backs up every penny of it. The AirPods Max are just another bit of proof.</p>

<h2>Amazing Engineering</h2>
<p>The <strong>Apple H1 chip is the secret sauce</strong> that makes the AirPods Max just that much better than much of their competition. There’s also the dynamic driver that tracks your head position in real time, instantly adjusts the sound, and all the while intelligently optimizes the output after analyzing your unique ear shape. It’s very likely as close to a live listening experience as you can get from a pair of wireless headphones.</p>



<p>When it comes to the <strong>all-important noise cancellation performance</strong> — because, honestly, what good are headphones if the sound has to compete with the noise around you? — the AirPods Max are among the very best on the market. It’s active noise cancellation that adjusts on the fly and, if you like, can almost completely isolate you so all you hear is what you want to hear from your smartphone, tablet, or laptop. But you also have the ability to take control and switch the AirPods Max to transparency mode, allowing exterior sounds and conversations to be heard while still delivering primo sound.</p>



<h2>All-Day Comfort</h2>
<p><strong>An all-day battery life</strong> is pretty much useless without the ability to wear your headphones comfortably, and vice versa. Thankfully the <strong>robust 20-hour battery life</strong> of the AirPods Max is backed by exceptional comfort with the lightweight AirPods Max sporting a knit-mesh canopy band that is breathable yet holds the phones firmly in place, and memory foam ear cushions that form a perfect seal over your ears for optimal sound, but also optimal comfort.</p>
<p>There’s certainly no guarantee that Apple will drop the price of the AirPods Max as low as $429 again come Black Friday or during Cyber Week, and do you really want to wait for the next Prime Day event in 2026 to score a pair of pro-level wireless headphones? This Prime Day deal looks like a solid winner.</p>

Its choice of setting, picturesque scenery, and expansive map seem to be resonating with local residents, with the developers receiving plaudits for their detailed research and sense of style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch’s standalone sequel to 2020’s award-winning Ghost of Tsushima moves the action to Ezo on Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido.

The best events are ones that require a little more time playing the game, such as exploring new areas outside of the main garden.

Generally, it’s an excuse for Jandel or one of the other admins to wreak havoc on the servers. During this time, specific Admin-only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-weather-events/2900-7058/" data-ref-id="2900-7058">Grow A Garden weather</a> effects will occur, shops will replenish with the rarest items, and minigames will trigger, rewarding those who finish with cosmetics and other valuable prizes. Sometimes you'll even get a free ultra-rare pet such as the Chicken Zombie or Junkbot.</p><p dir="ltr">We highly recommend playing this hour on a private server, or at least one with few players. This is because other players may have plants that escape the boundaries of their plot, so they may cover up valuable information or even impede your progress in giveaways. For example, in the Find the Pet weather effect, you need to search for a specific critter before time runs out. If that pet is trapped inside someone’s overgrown Briar Rose, you’re potentially missing out on a free and rare pet. We also suggest sticking around a little bit after the Admin Abuse just in case there is an encore, with more giveaways and new weather effects.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The October 2025 update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a> has arrived for PS5, PS5 Pro and Xbox Series X|S, bringing long-awaited support for HDR, unlocked frame rates, and adding previously exclusive mission content for all platforms and players.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/11/control-update-will-add-hdr-and-ps4-exclusive-mission-for-all-platforms/">First announced and released for the PC version of the game back in March</a>, it’s taken over half a year for Remedy to bring these changes and update to the console versions of the game. But it could be worth the wait, as the update addresses some key graphical and performance improvements that were built into the game back in its original form.</p>


<p>Both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S now have the ability to turn on HDR support, adding greater vibrancy to the colour palette and greater contrast between light and dark. Additionally, SDR rendering is now in 10-bit colour space, so there should be less colour banding.</p>
<p>For a smoother game experience with modern displays and TVs, there’s also the addition of an unlocked frame rate, and support for VRR and 120Hz outputs, to make the most of the current generation of consoles. PS5 Pro support enables the use of PSSR (optionally), and brings better quality reflections, texture and shadow resolution filtering for the higher powered console.</p>
<p>Additionally, all players will now have access to the mission Dr. Yoshimi Tokui’s Guided Imagery Experience, which features voiceover by Hideo Kojima. Previously exclusive to the PS4 Digital Deluxe version of Control, anyone can now play it by picking up the first Dr Tokui Tapes collectible in&nbsp; the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector.</p>

<p>Here’s the full patch notes:</p>
<h3><strong>OCTOBER 2025 CONSOLE UPDATE (1.30) RELEASE NOTES&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>OUTFITS</strong><br>
The following outfits are now available to all players. The outfits can be accessed and equipped from the Control Point in the Central Executive Sector area.</p>
<p>• Astral Dive Suit (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br>
•&nbsp;Tactical Response Gear (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br>
• Urban Response Gear (formerly a pre-order exclusive)</p>
<p><strong>MISSIONS</strong><br>
All players will receive the mission Dr. Yoshimi Tokui’s Guided Imagery Experience, featuring voiceover by Hideo Kojima. The mission is playable when you pick up the Dr Tokui Tapes collectible in the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector. (This mission was previously exclusive to the PlayStation 4 Digital Deluxe version of Control.)</p>

<figure data-uuid="89d09427da961"><a title="lego game boy designer interview" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/89d09427da961/lego-game-boy-designer-interview.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've already been chatting excitedly about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/gallery-legos-new-game-boy-set-is-a-mini-masterpiece">Lego's very lovely Game Boy set</a>. It's absolutely one of the best things they've put out in a while and, to celebrate the launch, two of Lego's designers, Carl Merriam and Simon Kent, have been chatting with those fine folks over at <a href="https://gizmodo.com/lego-game-boy-review-the-designers-share-all-the-secrets-to-the-fun-nostalgic-set-2000667492">Gizmodo</a> about the process of recreating an iconic piece of gaming history.</p>
<p>Now, we can tell you that the most exciting thing about the Lego Game Boy is just how close it manages to get to the look, feel, and weight of the original console just right. In fact, it gets them so right that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/random-legos-new-game-boy-set-has-been-modded-to-play-games-after-just-one-day">someone has already modded the thing</a> to play actual Game Boy games.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6wjgkvq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>It really does hit all those nostalgia buttons, and in order to get it so close to the OG, the designers say they worked closely with Nintendo itself throughout development. “Nintendo was very involved,” explained Lego design director Kent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have a team that works in Japan… they basically allow us to connect to different IP teams or hardware teams or even creative teams within Nintendo to get the right information to make the product as best as it can be. We also met with the hardware designer that I think may have worked on the original or certainly was connected to the original.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With Nintendo's seal of approval, and with input from someone who was seemingly connected to the design of the original (the Game Boy's original designer, Gunpei Yokoi passed away in 1997), the next challenge for the team behind the set was just how little room they had to work with if they wanted to keep the 1:1 scale - which, of course, was essential.</p>
<p>“We don’t really have a lot of room to do a lot of stuff, and we played around with all kinds of different functional ways to make you be able to do something with the games,” Merriam, who's also worked on Super Mario Lego sets, told Gizmodo.</p>
<p>For what little room they did have — and it's one of the best things about the build as you make your way through its five bags — they certainly got down to some ingenious designing. With little touches such as how the D-Pad sits on a rubber piece to give it a perfect bouncy and responsive feel, or how the 'A' and 'B' buttons have been set to feel exactly like those on the console. Nevermind the fact that they're shoehorned in some awesome lenticular screens and carts that "click" in exactly the right way when you insert them into the back.</p>

<p>Indeed, with this in mind, Mirriam says that he designed some 30 to 40 of the D-Pad and various switches to work on how they felt. Oh, and those Start and Select buttons? They're Lego tyres from all the way back in the 1960s!</p>
<p>As good as the finished product is, it's also revealed that there were discussions about adding more, as Kent continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We wanted to sort of incorporate everything that was mobile about the Game Boy...We had discussions on whether we should add any peripherals that can plug into it. Should it come with some headphones? Should it come with a little light? But, in the end, we wanted to keep it simple and focused very much on… taking fans’ favourite games and playing them anywhere.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In discussing how to work on the company's second shot at a Nintendo console (after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/08/video_see_the_amazing_lego_nes_built_from_start_to_finish_in_our_block-busting_timelapse">the superb NES set</a> in 2020) without being influenced by the endless fan-made versions of the Game Boy in Lego that are already out there and online, Kent said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you search for anything related to intellectual property, there’s probably a Lego version of it out there somewhere...we are very careful for that exact reason. We deliberately don’t look at fan-related material because we want to focus on the actual real thing and do what we think is the right thing with the partner who we are collaborating with.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Merriam adds that, “One of the most interesting differences between being a Lego fan and the Lego designer is that we’re designing a product for people to build at home, and to make the experience of building the product fun is a totally different challenge than just making something look like the source material." Indeed.</p>
<p>Pushed on whether there were any further Nintendo consoles or sets en route, neither designer gave up any details, but on the strength of both this and the NES console set, we can't wait to see what comes next.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest first-party PlayStation exclusive game, Ghost of Yōtei, is off to a strong start, at least in the United Kingdom. Former GI.biz editor-in-chief Chris Dring <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1974886331445903775?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on X</a> that Sucker Punch's latest game managed to reach number 1 in the weekly UK physical sales chart, beating EA Sports FC 26's second week on the market, a massive feat considering how popular the football game is in the country. Dring then clarified that there was a 40% drop compared to the predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, but this should be put in perspective.</p>



<p>First of all, Ghost of Tsushima dropped in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, when practically everyone was stuck at home playing games. Moreover, it came at the very end of the PlayStation 4 lifecycle, only a few months ahead of the PS5 launch. This also means that Tsushima could count on a PS4 global install base about 20 million units larger than PS5's base now that Ghost of Yōtei has launched. Lastly, digital sales have slowly but surely gained ground on physical sales with every passing year, so we'll only know the full picture once digital sales data is also available.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I explained in my review of the open world action/adventure game</a>, Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to Tsushima in practically everything that matters. Those who loved the studio's previous entry will no doubt enjoy the new title as well.</p>



<p>Sucker Punch Production hasn't shared any info about a potential DLC, although we only learned about Iki Island, the only Ghost of Tsushima DLC, much later than the base game's debut. We do, however, already know that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legends co-op multiplayer mode will debut at some point in 2026</a>. The studio hasn't discussed the PC port yet, but it would make sense for Legends and the PC version to launch at the same time with cross-play enabled.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-indefinitely</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambitious-action-strategy-game-kingmakers-delayed-indefinitely.1317385/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Redemption Road and publisher tinyBuild have announced that their highly ambitious action-strategy game&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>has been delayed indefinitely in order to ensure players feel like their money was "well spent" when they buy it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/543369627969783348" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message</a> on Steam, Redemption Road says that&nbsp;the game, which was originally slated to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">launch in Early Access on Wednesday</a>, needs some additional time in the oven before the studio "feel[s] good about charging money for it".</p>

<p>The developer says it doesn't want to cut any of&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers</em>' planned features in order to get the game "out the door earlier", and that the game's many ambitious systems mean it's pushing Unreal Engine 4, on which it's based, to its "absolute limits".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingmakers-delayed-again-battle.jpg?itok=z7PzPHiW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingmakers-delayed-again-battle.jpg?itok=CRI5JHRI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>has been delayed indefinitely.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Redemption Road,&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>will simulate battles with "tens of thousands of soldiers", each of whom has "AI and pathfinding that rivals what you'd expect from an AAA third-person shooter".</p>

<p>Additionally, walking away from a battle doesn't stop the carnage; the developer says the fight "continues to play out", and that each mission in the game happens on "a massive map that each player on the server is free to explore".</p>

<p>All of this is to say that&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers</em>' ambition is big, and so Redemption Road says it wants to spend "a bit more time on content polish" before the game is released, even as an Early Access title.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>has been delayed. The game was originally due to launch in 2024, but in December of that year, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025" rel="nofollow">pushed back to 2025</a>. Whether or not it's still able to launch this year isn't clear right now, but I wouldn't put my money on that happening.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is, in a quite literal sense, the end of an era. Paradox has announced that the latest update for 4X strategy sim&nbsp;<em>Millennia&nbsp;</em>will serve as the game's final patch, but don't worry - it's not actually going anywhere.</p>

<p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1268590/view/518599830010857584" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Update 8, which is, as the name suggests, the eighth major update for&nbsp;<em>Millennia</em>, will be the last major update the game will receive.</p>

<p>Despite its momentous nature, it's not bringing anything particularly huge; Paradox says it's packing "a host of bugfixes, localization updates, and some added mod support". You can check out the update's <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/millennia-update-8.1853194/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes here</a> if you want to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paradox-millennia-final-update-map.jpg?itok=xdn3h4PT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paradox-millennia-final-update-map.jpg?itok=8olHFfUW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Paradox's&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em>-esque 4X game&nbsp;<em>Millennia&nbsp;</em>will receive no further updates.</figcaption></figure><p>In its Steam post, Paradox thanks&nbsp;<em>Millennia&nbsp;</em>developer C Prompt for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/millennia-roadmap-2024" rel="nofollow">work on the game</a> since launch last year, and it also confirms that&nbsp;<em>Millennia</em>'s social channels will go dark, so don't expect any further chatter from the devs on those platforms.</p>

<p>However,&nbsp;<em>Millennia&nbsp;</em>will remain available to play "indefinitely", according to Paradox, and the publisher will also continue to support the game in terms of game-breaking bugs or glitches, so things should still be ticking along nicely if you do intend to head back in at any point.</p>

<p>The publisher closes its statement by saying it hopes to see players again "in a future era", but given that&nbsp;<em>Millennia</em>'s support is ending, I wouldn't bank on a followup anytime soon.</p>

<p>You may just have to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">make your peace with&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">Civilization VII</a>&nbsp;</em>if you want your 4X fix, or revisit an earlier game in the series. Then again, I suppose, since&nbsp;<em>Millennia&nbsp;</em>will still be getting support patches every now and then, you could just keep playing that.</p>




<p>If you do want to check out&nbsp;<em>Millennia</em>, you can do so right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268590/Millennia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more on all things Paradox-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The AirPods Pro 3 have just been released a few weeks ago (check out <a href="https://gizmodo.com/airpods-pro-3-review-skating-to-where-the-puck-is-going-not-where-it-has-been-2000658726">Gizmodo’s review here</a>), but here is a fact: the improvements from them to the AirPods Pro 2 are negligible but the price difference is rather high. Amazon is clearing out its stock for <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">the AirPods Pro 2 at a new all-time-low price of $169 (previously $249), but you can have them at that price until stocks last</a>. This is the best deal available, and there is no logical reason you should pay a dime more for the AirPods Pro 3 when the second-generation ones have nearly the same experience at a much lower price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite AirPods Pro 2</h2>
<p>The H2 chip is a major increase in processing power over the original AirPods Pro. This proprietary <strong>Apple silicon allows for Active Noise Cancellation that eliminates up to twice as much background noise as the original</strong>, and creates a great isolation bubble even on busy trains or noisy city streets. The low-distortion driver, paired with the H2 chip, produces clear high-end frequencies and robust bass and gives audio fidelity on par with Dedicated audiophile earbuds. Voice Isolation significantly enhances call quality through the use of computational audio and isolates your voice from background noise so your colleagues or friends hear you distinctly even when you’re calling from noisy environments.</p>
<p>The Adaptive Audio mode needs a special mention here because it automatically combines Active Noise Cancellation or Transparency mode according to what you’re experiencing around you. As you don’t have to choose between modes, you don’t have to constantly flip between them which is a common complaint amongst older wireless earbuds.</p>



<p>Conversation Awareness takes it a step further, automatically recognizing when you initiate a conversation with someone close to you and automatically reduces audio volume while increasing voices, then automatically switches back when the talk ends. These intelligent features eliminate the need for continual adjusting of controls, a common complaint with older wireless earbuds.</p>
<p><strong>Personalized Spatial Audio produces a three-dimensional soundstage</strong> through custom audio calibration based on a measure of your individual ear shape using the iPhone camera, along with dynamic head tracking. This tech makes audio from music and films sound like it is occurring at you, not inside your head. The trick is highly effective on Dolby Atmos content, creating a true immersion that changes the way you experience media on your devices.</p>



<p>The AirPods Pro 2 introduced something fantastic: a <strong>complete hearing health ecosystem that goes beyond standard earbuds</strong>. The scientifically validated Hearing Test walks you through a clinical-grade assessment right from your iPhone which measures your hearing sensitivity across different frequencies to create a personalized audio profile. This isn’t just a gimmick; it’s genuine hearing science packed into consumer tech. The clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature then amplifies environmental sounds and conversations in real time for people with mild to moderate hearing loss, essentially functioning as an FDA-authorized over-the-counter hearing aid.</p>
<p><strong>The IP54 rating means both the earbuds</strong>, and the MagSafe charging case are dust-, sweat-, and water-resistant against splashes. Wear them on exercise, light rain, or dusty events without a second thought. <strong>Four sizes of silicone tip</strong> ensure the proper fit for different ear shapes, a must for both comfort for being worn for a long period of time and for the acoustic seal needed for good noise cancellation.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that deal, it might run out of stock soon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-quietly-offloads-the-waterproof-flip-5-speaker-now-listed-for-pennies-on-amazon-2000631979</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl-quietly-offloads-the-waterproof-flip-5-speaker-now-listed-for-pennies-on-amazon.1317370/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable Bluetooth speakers aren’t just summer essentials for beach trips and backyard barbecues. As winter settles in, these compact powerhouses become your soundtrack for cozy indoor gatherings, holiday dinner parties where you want music flowing through every room or even those brave souls who enjoy winter hiking and need motivation on snowy trails.</p>
<p>JBL has built an incredible reputation in the audio world, and <strong>their Flip 5 remains our favorite pick in the portable speaker category</strong> for its balance of sound quality, durability, and portability. For Prime Big Deal Day,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4518/"> this bestseller has dropped to a new record low price of $89 (down from $99)</a>, which makes it an ideal time to grab one before the holiday season kicks into full gear.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4518/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Strengths and Ability That Translate into Something Tangible</h2>
<p>The <strong>Flip 5 has 20 watts of output power</strong> housed within its cylindrical body, so you’re getting true room-filling sound instead of cheap portable speaker sound that is often tinny. That 20 watts adds up to clear vocals and surprising deep bass for a portable speaker of its compact nature and enables it, for instance, to deliver acoustic sessions or thumping electronic beats without distortion at loud volumes.</p>
<p>The frequency response goes all the way up to 20 kHz which is the entire range of the human ear so you experience every nuance of sound within your tunes, from the bright ring of cymbals to the throb of the bass guitar. JBL’s distinct sound signature is on clarity and punch which makes for a dynamic listening experience that makes people want to get up on their feet instead of simply filling the background with noise.</p>



<p>The <strong>IPX7 water resistance rating warrants special attention</strong> due to its extension beyond splashing resistance. This rating signifies that the speaker is capable of being submerged for 30 minutes within a span of up to three feet of water without being compromised or malfunctioning at all. In practice, you don’t have to be concerned about using it poolside, take it inside the shower for your morning regimen, or have it playing at some impromptu rain shower at a live event outdoors.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life is 12 hours on a single charge</strong> which is sufficient for the majority of day-long activities without scrambling for a plug outlet. This battery life is based on moderate volume usage, so turning the sound up full blast will reduce the battery life, but for routine home or camp usage, you should have several playback sessions prior to needing a recharge. The speaker is <strong>charged through a USB-C,</strong> which is fast becoming the standard across devices, so you should be able to share the charging cable with charging your smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>The PartyBoost functionality opens up creative uses by enabling you to <strong>wire up a number of Flip 5 speakers wirelessly for stereo or extra volume</strong>. This works flawlessly with other PartyBoost-enabled JBL speakers and creates a cohesive sound experience between a number of rooms or expanding the coverage area for a broader gathering.</p>
<p>For $89, you’re getting dependable JBL engineering that has garnered <strong>more than 82,000 customer reviews with a 4.8-star average</strong>. For anyone assembling their audio collection or upgrading a worn-out speaker, this Prime Big Deal Day deal amounts to good value on a tried-and-true performer that takes daily usage in stride.</p>

              <p>Over the last year, two trading card games have received levels of attention never seen before in their decades-long histories. Both&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> and&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em> have become more popular than ever, with both franchises selling out of new product so routinely that it’s become normal to not be able to find any packs in any stores. Rather than attempting to ramp up production to meet these additional demands, both companies appear to be leaning in, encouraging the scarcity with ever-more-desirable and underproduced sets, for significant short-term gains. However, I contend this focus on the frenzy has a massive cost: the regular players. And when a generation of kids simply cannot buy the cards they need to build a deck, the long-term losses could be brutal.</p> <p>If you’ve got some disposable income and are a collector of pretty cardboard, times are great. Those able to afford scalpers’ fees or the booming secondhand market can pick up some all-time best-looking cards in both series, with <em>Pokémon’s</em> ever-more-beautiful full-art cards routinely fetching $500 in resales and <em>Magic</em>‘s waterfall of tie-in expansion sets from some of the most popular properties in entertainment selling out before most people even learn they’re on sale. You know who this isn’t helping? People who actually play <em>Pokémon TCG</em> or&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>.</p>

 <p>Right now, where I live in the UK, the only way I can get a pack of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>cards released in the last 12 months is by <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-pull-rates-2000629165">making it my job to write about them</a> and having them sent to me directly by The Pokémon Company. This is clearly not a path open to all. At the same time, I routinely pop into both specialist card stores and larger retailers to see if I can get anything from November 2024’s Surging Sparks onward, let alone the most recent sets, and usually find they have nothing at all. In the last week I’ve noticed justifiably unloved Temporal Forces packs from March ’24 showing up here and there, and that’s my lot. If I wanted to be playing in live games with the current meta, I’d now have to resort to buying even bulk cards from resellers.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, over at Wizards of the Coast’s&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-universes-beyond-lotr-reprints-1851664815">it’s no better</a>. Where once the game would release occasional spin-off sets based on other media properties for a fun treat, the card game is now dominated by an ever-growing number of “legal” cards from other universes, not least the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em> sets. And boy oh boy, <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-x-secret-lair-mtg-sold-out-ebay-reprint-1851784230">they’ve been a scalper’s paradise</a> too. Then there was <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-magic-gathering-secret-lair-card-pre-order-drop-1851786245">July’s Sonic-themed debacle</a>, as well as the impossibility of finding <em>Lord of the Rings</em> packs. This is only going to get weirder, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/aligning-the-universes-making-all-our-sets-legal-in-all-our-formats">now that Universes Beyond sets will be legal in all Constructed formats</a>. This is going to include such exceptionally un-<em>Magic</em> licenses as <em>Spider-Man</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"><em>Star Trek</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"> and, er, Dwight from&nbsp;<em>The Office</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">?</a> The result of this is obviously that the sets are attracting collectors over and above players, bringing in the people looking to pull the rarest, most interesting art to put in a binder. And good on ’em—I rarely play&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> any more now that my kid’s lost interest, but I still love my binders. But there’s a consequence.</p>

 <p>I worry for the players. If you can’t just buy the packs, you can’t play the game. And given both companies appear to be not only doing nothing to improve the situation, but going out of their way to make it worse, this will surely have a long-term impact on the products in the future? Your adult collectors today were likely kids or teenagers playing in the past, and when those adults cut out the next generation of kids, that pipeline springs a very significant leak.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000632027" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632027"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632027">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In <em>Pokémon</em>‘s latest set, Mega Evolution, the company has chosen to include <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-gold-cards-pull-rate-2000630564">two cards so rare they only appear in one out of every 2,520 packs</a>, which of course is driving even more frenzied interest toward the cards when they’ve already been <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">close to impossible to buy for nearly a year</a>. Repeated <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">promises from The Pokémon Company to increase production</a> either haven’t been honored or haven’t made a meaningful difference, and a move like this really underlines just how uninvested it is in making things any better. Meanwhile, Wizards of the Coast appears to be chasing the same results with its Secret Lair drops that sell out in minutes and leave so many people disappointed, with the company adding more spin-off sets this and next year than in multiple previous years combined.</p>

 <p>And yes, absolutely, these companies don’t care! If it’s a scalper or a five-year-old buying the products, the money fills up their bank just the same. But I suspect they <em>are</em> going to care when interest drops off considerably in the next five to ten years, after a generation who was cut off from being able to access the games reaches an age when they’ve got spending money. It’s what my friend Paul describes as “Funkopopping” their brands. They’re forgetting that all the little words written on those cards have a purpose beyond making the pictures harder to enjoy.</p> <p>Who knows, maybe time will prove me wrong, and both companies’ emphatic leaning on driving short-term buzz will work out for them, and I’ll look like a big old idiot. But I do suspect otherwise.&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900">disappearance into a scalper-driven secondhand market</a> is a&nbsp;<em>terrible</em> look for the company, even if it pushes up their profits in the moment, while&nbsp;<em>MtG</em>‘s watering down of its own universe to become some&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-like mash-up of contemporary culture seems like such a short-sighted cash-grab. And none of it benefits the group of misfit kids who find company and kindness in sitting around a table, playing the games. And that sucks.</p>

As of October 5, however, <strong>the beta is now free and open to everyone on all platforms</strong>. The beta runs through October 8.</p><p>All you have to do is find the game client from your preferred platforms--PC, PlayStation, or Xbox--and you should be all set.</p><h2><strong>A non-SBMM playlist has finally arrived</strong></h2><p>Skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) is a hot-button issue in a lot of multiplayer games, including Call of Duty. Some portion of the audience enjoys and embraces SBMM because they say it helps place them into matches with people more aligned with their skills. Other people want to see less SBMM and more "open" playlists in Call of Duty, and that's now available.</p><p>An "open" playlist in the Black Ops 7 beta debuted over the weekend, and people have responded enthusiastically to it. Developer Treyarch, for its part, <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1974591695141704012" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it was "excited to see the response" to the introduction of the playlist, which the company says is "classic matchmaking where skill is minimally considered."</p><p>"As a reminder, we're always listening to our community. As many of you have noted, we continue to prioritize updates (and why we're making them) based on player feedback.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-15%E2%80%B3-fhd-portable-monitor-doubles-your-display-size-and-it%E2%80%99s-now-going-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-for-prime-day.1317337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking to boost your productivity without cluttering your desk or weighing down your backpack? A portable monitor opens up a world of possibilities: extend your laptop screen for seamless multitasking at the coffee shop, transform your phone into a mini workstation during travel, enjoy console gaming on a crisp display anywhere or catch up on movies during long commutes.</p>
<p>The beauty of these displays is that they take up less space than a standard notebook while doubling your screen real estate. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">the KYY 15.6-inch portable monitor has dropped to a new record low of $69 (down from $99) for Prime Big Deal Day on Amazon</a>, and the good news is that this deal is <strong>available to non-Prime</strong> members as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This makes it one of the cheapest ways of adding a second monitor to your setup but what counts is what you’re getting for your money. The KYY monitor <strong>provides Full HD 1920×1080 resolution on a 15.6-inch IPS panel which means clear text and high-quality colors from almost any angle due to the 178-degree viewing angle</strong>. The IPS setup provides true color consistency even when you’re not looking directly at the monitor. The addition of HDR tech provides greater contrast and colour depth, creating more realistic images that make both work documents and entertainment media more interesting to watch.</p>
<p>The monitor includes <strong>blue light reduction tech and flicker-free backlight</strong> which helps reduce eye fatigue when sitting for prolonged periods or staying up for gaming sessions. The side menu control wheel gives fast toggling for brightness, contrast and color temp without digging through convoluted button combinations. The <strong>monitor allows both landscape and portrait modes</strong>, which allows it to be flexible for varying uses such as coding for instance.</p>



<h2>Premium features worth the extra cost</h2>
<p>The connectivity choices warrant a special mention since they dictate how easily you’ll be able to truly employ this monitor across your devices. The KYY features a couple of full-function <strong>USB-C ports</strong>&nbsp;which is a big plus point. This allows you to power the monitor and send video out of a single cable when plugged into laptops or phones sporting USB-C with video output (Thunderbolt 3 or USB 3.1). The real-world advantage here is getting rid of cable clutter and streamlining your portable setup. For devices that lack USB-C, there exists a <strong>Mini-HDMI port that guarantees backward support for older laptops</strong>, gaming consoles such as PS4 and Xbox and the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p><strong>Thin and light at 0.3 inches thick and just 1.7 pounds</strong>, the monitor fits into a backpack without adding discernible bulk. The smart cover, which is included, has several uses: it protects the display from scratches when being carried around with its tough PU leather covering, magnetically attaches to the display for a frameless experience, and doubles into a stand with two rotating grooves for varying viewing angles. This makes carrying a separate stand or holding the monitor against some arbitrary object unnecessary. The dual stereo speakers built-in, along with a 3.5mm audio jack, make sound options available without needing external speakers, although the speakers are more geared towards casual usage than audiophile-quality sound.</p>
<p>For this all-time-low $69, you’re getting a full portable display solution with the<strong> Protective Cover and Screen Protector bundle included</strong>. For remote workers or gamers requiring portability for their setup, this bundle gives huge value for expanding your visual workplace.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Turtle Beach Atlas 200 Gaming Headset Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/06/turtle-beach-atlas-200-gaming-headset-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/turtle-beach-atlas-200-gaming-headset-review.1317319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Though they’ve diversified into every type of peripheral known to man, beast and AI construct, Turtle Beach’s legacy is still more for creating gaming headsets. The Atlas 200 is the latest to build on years of knowledge while taking clear aim at the budget-savvy buyer. It’s a winning formula, and they’ve potentially brought us the best budget headset of the year.</p>
<p>The main selling point for this wired headset is absolutely, categorically, irrefutably, the quality of the audio. Turtle Beach have had their drivers and audio delivery nailed down for years at this point – my go-to wired headset remains the seven-year-old original Turtle Beach Elite Pro – and this sounds as utterly fantastic as those do. The difference is that it was, at the time, the pinnacle of their product lineup, whereas you’re now getting all that audio quality in a £60 headset.</p>



<p>That’s being delivered by 50mm Nanoclear Drivers, which are the same as you’ll find in the top-tier £200+ <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/26/turtle-beach-stealth-pro-gaming-headset-review/">Stealth Pro</a>. They are powerful, loud and provide an excellent amount of detail alongside a hefty dose of depth and bass. They’re versatile too, taking the epic sci-fi soundtrack of Star Wars Outlaws and enveloping you in the world of Kay Vess, or making the grid-iron audio of Madden 25 feel direct and visceral.</p>
<p>Thanks to the 3.5mm connection, they’re compatible with a wide range of devices, from plugging into a PlayStation or Xbox controller, to the top of your Nintendo Switch 2, or into your PC. Our review unit came in PlayStation 5-matching blue and grey, and it’s a smart looking piece of kit, though if I’m being honest, I was disappointed that it doesn’t exactly match the PS5’s colour scheme.</p>

<p>The body of the Atlas 200 is wholly built from plastic, and there’s a lot of flex in the body and arms, which bodes well for its longevity. I was able to twist and pull it into a wide variety of extreme situations, and it simply sprang back into shape. If you’re the kind of careless headphone owner who sits down on their headset multiple times a week, this could be the answer.</p>
<p>The plastic used here manages to straddle the line between thin and cheap-feeling and solid and heavy, and the Atlas 200 is pleasingly light in your hand and on your head, coming in at only 280g. It’s broken up by the different fabrics that have been used. The floating blue headband ties through to the external surfaces of the headset, with each end proudly adorned with a PlayStation logo.</p>

<p>The headband is then further cushioned and protected by grey webbing, though I’m not entirely sold on what purpose it serves. It does feel as though, over time, this fabric portion could eventually wear, but there’s been no sign of that through our month-long testing.</p>
<p>The ear cushions are fabric-covered memory foam, and there’s Turtle Beach’s patented ProSpec tech here as well – those are imperceptible notches in the earpads that make wearing glasses comfortable while wearing the headset. Fundamentally, I’ve been able to wear the Atlas 200 all day without any discomfort, and they’ve continued to deliver time and time again.</p>
<p>I do appreciate the fact that there’s no charging involved. They’re ready to go whenever you are, and with all of the mainline console controllers now featuring a headphone socket, there’s less need to seek out a wireless headset, while you can reduce latency by going wired from your console to your controller as well. Admittedly, that might be more cables than some people want to live with, but on the plus side, you’ll never run out of power (unless your gamepad does).</p>

<p>That simplicity follows through to the controls. The left earpiece plays host to a single volume dial, which is smooth to operate and easy to locate. Beyond that, there’s the flip-down mic arm, which is muted when vertical and live when down. It’s a startlingly clear uni-directional mic as well – so much so that other players commented on it – and everyone could hear my extremely important thoughts as we jumped around in King of Meat or slayed another Lagiacrus in Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>At this £60 price point, Nacon’s RIG headsets would be my other consideration, whether that’s wired with the RIG 500 Pro range or with the wireless RIG 600 Pro for a little more cash. They both offer similar build and excellent sound quality, but I do think the Atlas 200 is the more attractive option, simply in terms of visuals. That said, the RIG 600 Pro HS comes in some seriously wild colour schemes if that’s more your thing, and is somehow lighter at 240g while also bringing wireless tech to the party.</p>

<p>Do you need anything more for your gaming audio than the Turtle Beach Atlas 200? It might be a budget headset, but it sounds excellent, with a sound profile that more expensive headsets would lust after, and it’s incredibly easy to live with, thanks to its simplistic controls and universal connection. If you can accept wires in your life, then look no further than the Atlas 200.</p>

            <p>You there, fumbling around in the dark darkness of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-deep-of-night-is-nigh-so-heres-a-big-patch-with-more-balancing-tweaks-than-a-tightrope-walker">Deep of the Night</a>. A new mod offers you the chance to channel your inner gladiator and test your strength in a dedicated boss arena.</p>
<p>I know, I know, you've spent at least 80% of your time with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> thus far battering and being battered by bosses. But come on, you know you need to roll around more big blokes, with the chance to customise each bout of rolling exactly to your liking.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"A standalone game mode focused entirely on fighting bosses" is the promise of modder PositronCannon with their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/449?tab=description">Nightreign boss arena</a>, which has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5645?tab=description">popular</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/1854">siblings</a> for base <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>. It adds a boss selection menu to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-how-to-get-to-roundtable-hold">Roundtable Hold</a> featuring "almost every boss in the game, from Nightlords to minibosses".</p>
<p>Before hopping into a fight, a bunch of options let you tune both your character and aspects of the fight exactly how you fancy. Loadout-wise, there's "full access to the sparring grounds weapon selection menu, the ability to apply/remove passive buffs, set your character's level, set the amount of healing flasks, equip talismans, buy relics and other items for free", as well as cheats if you fancy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the stats and characteristics of each boss can be tweaked, with the chance to specify if you want to take on a foe of a specific depth, a certain variant, or one of Deep of Night's mutated enemies. All ideal if the goal's getting in some lower-stakes practice for a certain expedition scenario or simply messing around with Nightreign's roster of would-be night-ruiners. The likes of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/141?tab=description">Free Reign</a> also let you warp straight to certain boss battles from Roundtable Hold, but to my eye PositronCannon's creation goes a lot more in-depth in terms of options to set up the exact fight you want.</p>
<p>The modder also has some ambitious expansion plans for it, in the form of an "Expedition Boss Rush" mode that'll see players "progress through a series of semi-random boss fights, obtaining items, buffs and runes as you go, culminating in a Nightlord fight." Sounds cool, if you're after a trip out in the evening that's a bit more heavy on slap-fests with serious supervisors.</p>
<p>All of that said, PositronCannon makes clear that their work's aimed solely at solo players, meaning it's not designed for seamless co-op enjoyers and likely won't work with that. So, if you're aiming to fight with friends, you're best off sticking with another boss battle mod or just the base game with seamless.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving this boss arena a whirl, you'll first need to grab <a href="https://github.com/garyttierney/me3/releases">Mod Engine 3</a>.</p>

              <p>If you’re not already one of the hundreds of millions of people who own an Alexa speaker at home, then <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> could be a good time to join the ride. Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">discounted its Echo Dot at a record-low $34, down from the usual $49</a> (and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4515/">the Echo Pop to $24 from $39</a>), and there’s a reason this tiny speaker has become so popular: It removes that daily friction of foraging for your phone when setting timers when cooking, changing thermostats manually or searching for the correct playlist when your hands are full.</p>

<h2>Audio That Finally Keeps Up with the Convenience</h2>
<p>Earlier Echo Dots won their success on the strength of functionality over audio quality, but that changes with this new model: <strong>Amazon entirely rebuilt the internal audio design to produce tighter vocals, more robust bass response, and richer sound</strong> that fills a room rather than just crowding a corner. The speaker includes a new custom full-range driver that addresses high-end reproduction and low-end reproduction much more effectively than older, smaller drivers. That results in your morning news updates coming through with sharp clarity and music streaming through Spotify or Amazon Music with enough richness for casual enjoyment.</p>



<p>Integration with a smart home makes the <strong>Echo Dot a universal remote for your entire home</strong> for all your devices that are compatible. If you have bulbs, plugs, thermostats or cameras that are smart, voice commands replace physical switches or smartphone apps. The motion sensor and internal temperature sensor incorporate another form of automation with routines.</p>
<p>Several Echo devices per home allow whole-home audio so your music accompanies you wherever you go from kitchen through living room to bedroom. Pairing with Fire TV creates a home theater setup with playback managed by Alexa, searching for titles, and volume adjustment. Echo Dot also extends wifi coverage when paired with appropriate eero mesh wifi systems and does away with connectivity dead spots causing streaming stoppages and lost connections.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy features also include a physical off button for the mic that electronically disables the mics</strong>, and gives you complete control over when the unit is permitted to listen. The button glows red when the mics are disabled for obvious visual feedback. Amazon built some layers of privacy into the infrastructure, and the company does not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p>At $34 for Prime Day, the Echo Dot is the least expensive way into a voice-activated home automation and daily convenience features that quickly become a necessity once you experience them.</p>
