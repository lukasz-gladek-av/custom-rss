              <p>The head of the biggest gaming site in the world is leaving the company at the end of August, <em>Kotaku</em> has learned. John Davison, who has been <em>IGN</em>‚Äòs publisher since joining back in 2019, told staff on Monday it was time for ‚Äúthe next chapter.‚Äù The high-profile departure comes shortly after a big round of layoffs that saw multiple departments across the company impacted.</p> <p>Arriving just months before the start of the 2020 pandemic, Davison‚Äôs tenure at <em>IGN</em> saw the site expand into events like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-and-sega-among-publishers-appearing-at-ign-live">IGN Live</a> and a market analytics platform called <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-launches-gaming-trends-platform-shedding-light-on-how-mobile-roblox-and-more-are-reshaping-the-industry">Gaming Trends</a>. Under parent-company Ziff Davis, <em>IGN</em> also made a massive acquisition last year in the form of the Gamer Network, a suite of European-facing gaming sites like <em>Eurogamer</em>, <em>VG247</em>, and <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em>. Many of those sites were hit with mass layoffs at the time of the deal, and <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> was gutted. One of the most valuable parts of that package, <em>Digital Foundry</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/digital-foundry-df-direct-ign-patreon-retro-games-media-2000616308">announced just last week</a> that it had purchased all outstanding equity to allow it to leave<em> IGN</em> and go fully independent.</p> <p>Davison, whose 25+ years in games media include stints at <em>EGM</em>, <em>Official PlayStation Magazine</em>, and <em>GameSpot</em>, will be leaving<em> IGN</em> at a time when its future trajectory has never been more uncertain. A reporting, news, and features operation that expanded under previous EIC Tina Amini has suffered cuts in recent years due to multiple rounds of layoffs and buyouts. Amini, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-editor-in-chief-tina-amini-steps-down">who left in 2022 and now works at Xbox</a>, was never replaced. Davison reported to Ziff Davis president of gaming and entertainment Yael Prough, and it‚Äôs not yet clear if the parent company plans on backfilling his role.</p>

 <p>Davison and <em>IGN</em> did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p><em>IGN</em> laid off over a dozen staff earlier this month, which included approximately 12 percent members in its editorial union. ‚ÄúThe company has told us that the reason for this layoff stems from a Ziff Davis mandate to cut costs despite several quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue increases, to which IGN Entertainment responded by coming for our members‚Äô jobs,‚Äù <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvm4rhup5k2a">the IGN Creators Guild wrote at the time</a>. ‚ÄúThis is perplexing to us, as we are told again and again that IGN Entertainment has had a tremendously successful year thus far thanks to their hard work.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been an honor to work alongside such talented, passionate people, and I‚Äôm deeply proud of what we‚Äôve accomplished together,‚Äù Davison wrote in a message to staff today. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited for what comes next.‚Äù</p>

Players were finding their progress halted by invisible walls as they climbed the new clime.

Now, though, developer Team PEAK and publisher AggroCrab have released a new update to fix the issue.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1955012512732287202" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We're working on a fix for the invisible walls in the mesa‚ÄºÔ∏è Keep an eye out for a patch soon üíÄüôè Thanks for the patience yall <a href="https://t.co/m1PgWF8qAM" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/m1PgWF8qAM</a></p>  ‚Äî AGGRO CRAB üí• (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1955012512732287202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Less than an hour after they acknowledged the issue, though, an end to our long nightmare was in sight.</p><p>Peak hit Steam in July to critical and fan acclaim, marrying the silly goofs of games like R.E.P.O. with some seriously fun cooperative climbing. This new update adds the "Mesa" biome to the game, which temporarily replaces the Alpine biome, and will eventually go into rotation alongside it. Where the Alpine level was a chilly place with freezing winds and icy rocks, the Mesa is a sun-baked little world where sunscreen and umbrellas aren't just a suggestion but a requirement to survive. This new biome has it all: cactuses, tumbleweeds, a deadly sun, and tornadoes that will send you flying.</p><p>This new update has more people playing today than any time since Peak launched (per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3527290/charts/#1m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>), so this quick fix will be appreciated by many fans and newcomers.</p>

              <p>A <a href="https://kotaku.com/league-legends-riot-games-worlds-23-interview-1851071665"><em>League of Legends</em></a> player who claimed to have built a career around boosting accounts and selling them replied angrily on social media to a developer at Riot Games. He was worried about how he would make money now. The dev‚Äôs response was a link to McDonalds‚Äô careers page.</p> <p>On August 11, <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-banning-bots-boosters-and-more-in-2025/?_gl=1*dgamq1*_gcl_au*MTU3NTAxOTczNy4xNzU0OTQ2Nzkw*_ga*MTM2MDIzODkzMS4xNzU0OTQ2Nzkw*_ga_FXBJE5DEDD*czE3NTQ5NDY3OTAkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTQ5NDY3OTEkajU5JGwwJGgw">Riot Games announced plans</a>&nbsp;to ramp up its efforts to fight back against smurf and alt account misuse in <em>League of Legends,</em> one of the biggest MOBAs on the planet. These new plans include banning and punishing people who grind on accounts owned by other players, boosting their rank in the process, and charging a fee for doing so. These services have <a href="https://insaneboost.gg/">become quite common online.</a> Even <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">Elon Musk admitted to using one such service</a> in <em>Path of Exile II.</em> But Riot is cracking down and banning accounts associated with the practice. These changes will begin in <em>LoL</em> update 25.18 and will likely lead to players being far more cautious about paying others to boost their rank in<em> League of Legends</em>. That will lead to fewer customers for those offering such ‚Äúservices,‚Äù and one of these people wasn‚Äôt happy about that news.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://x.com/cat1_alex/status/1954924168245358742?">Twitter user SLS replied to Riot‚Äôs Director of Product Drew Levin</a>, and explained that their ‚Äúmain income‚Äù comes primarily from boosting other players‚Äô accounts in <em>League of Legends</em>. They also coach players in the free-to-play MOBA, but admitted that this only earned them about 15 percent of what they make boosting in a month. They wrapped up their comment with: ‚ÄúWhat I do after? [sic] Just chill at McDonald‚Äôs?‚Äù Levin reshared the post and included a link to McDonald‚Äôs careers page, seemingly joking that it was time for SLS to find a new job.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/Ku080U0fB4">https://t.co/Ku080U0fB4</a> <a href="https://t.co/7JgyjgOpJF">https://t.co/7JgyjgOpJF</a></p> <p>‚Äî Drew Levin (@drewlevin) <a href="https://twitter.com/drewlevin/status/1954931160469114915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>‚ÄúBro, you do understand that you have built a business off of ruining other people‚Äôs games, right?‚Äù <a href="https://x.com/drewlevin/status/1954926308049494207">replied Levin</a>. ‚Äú[I] have no desire to preserve that at the expense of whatever lobbies you‚Äôre boosting accounts through.‚Äù</p> <p>When SLS replied to that message with a complaint that the boosting industry wasn‚Äôt hurting the game and that boosters take specific orders related to very high ranks, Levin replied again, this time pointing out how absurd it was that SLS was describing breaking how the game ranks players as an ‚Äúindustry.‚Äù</p> <p>‚Äú‚ÄòThe industry?‚Äô ‚ÄòTaking orders?‚Äô Bro you are paid to trick our skill evaluation systems, and you are talking to the person leading the effort to improve their integrity,‚Äù <a href="https://x.com/drewlevin/status/1954930709510168878">said Levin on social media</a>.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Riot Games about the response.</p> <p>While some players who relied on boosting or liked smurfing‚Äìwhich is when a high-level player creates a new account to use their skills against low-level players‚Äìwere upset about the changes, the vast majority of the replies to Levin were happy to hear Riot Games was taking alt account abuse seriously in 2025. Of course, it remains to be seen if Riot Games can actually weed out all the boosters and smurf accounts from <em>League of Legends</em> and how quickly people find ways around their new efforts.</p> <p>Also, it should be noted that working at McDonald‚Äôs, like any other fast food joint, is a very hard job that requires incredible amounts of patience and stamina. It would be nice if we could all stop acting like people who work at these places are lazy teens working a summer job for beer money or whatever. If that cultural shift were to happen, perhaps they‚Äôd have a better shot at getting paid more. And don‚Äôt you think the people making your food deserve more money? I do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh no, the latest World of Warcraft patch has us teaming up with an evil cosmic void being who has tried to kill us many times already and will <em>definitely</em> stab us in the back later...but we're all kind of okay with it? Partially because we have no choice but also because she's hot and sarcastic?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm talking about Xal'atath. You know, this lady. <strong>Heads up, I'm going to talk in this article about spoilers for World of Warcraft: The War Within leading up to the events in Patch 11.2, Ghosts of K'aresh that dropped last Tuesday.</strong> If you haven't started playing the patch yet and don't want to know what's happening, maybe don't keep reading.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/the-war-within-official-cinematic-shadows-beneath-world-of-warcraft-2-17-screenshot-1754926715062.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you're a lapsed World of Warcraft player, you might know this lady if you've dipped in as recently as World of Warcraft: Legion. Xal'atath first appeared in that expansion in the form of a dagger artifact weapon wielded by Shadow Priests, which would occasionally whisper creepy evil stuff to them about N'Zoth and the Old Gods and all that malarky. At the time, <em>some</em> folks grew rather fond of her unsettling whispers, even affectionately referring to her as "knaifu". The dagger, with the rest of the expansion's artifact weapons, was used to drain the corruption from the giant sword that Sargeras stuck in the planet at the end of the expansion. Normal stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we naively thought we wouldn't hear from Xal'atath ever again, what was once one weapon among a giant stack of them turned out to be hugely plot-relevant. Xal'atath was passed around from place to place in the interim expansions, finally regaining her power and emerging from the dagger in the form of a void-infused high elf, all the better to corrupt people with. She bopped around Azeroth for a while, manipulating the underground giant bug people and some dragons before she finally made herself known as something called the "Harbinger of Dimensius," basically a herald of a super powerful void lord bent on destroying reality. Again, normal stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the start of our current expansion, The War Within, Xal'atath appears to be the main villain. She opens the expansion by causing the destruction of Dalaran (again), and she's responsible for the events that lead us to fighting both the Nerubians and the goblin Gallywix. She's spent a lot of time popping up here and there and taunting our ally Alleria Windrunner, she nearly kills Khadgar, and she's obsessed with this void artifact she's been carrying around called the Dark Heart, which she keeps using to corrupt and empower and manipulate. All of this is to say, she seems pretty evil to me! She serves the void and is clearly very interested in destroying us, our buddies, and probably all of Azeroth! Nothing she has done so far seems good, at all!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>And yet.</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In patch 11.2, Xal'atath <em>joins us.</em> The short explanation is that she actually betrayed Dimensius in the past, but he's coming back, and he's probably pissed off at her. If he shows up, she's done for. Out of a sense of self-preservation, she's been trying to beef up the Dark Heart to <em>stop</em> his return rather than accelerate it, and was messing around with the Nerubians and the Goblins in an effort to get that done. But at the end of patch 11.1, she accidentally (and sort of stupidly) loses the Dark Heart, forcing her to team up with Alleria and the player as a back-up plan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this actually means, in practice, is that Xal'atath follows us around while questing and occasionally proposes we do things that sound horrible and dangerous, like turn ourselves into an energy being and fill someone with void energy so they can hear the planet sing to them (normal stuff!). But, you know, we can't stop Dimensius without her. She knows his weaknesses, and is pretty much the only path to getting close enough to him to do something about his encroachment. So the murdery knife-elf gets to come along.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/capture-1754938789710.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkdb1y/tone_matters_magni/">https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkdb1y/tone_matters_magni/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing is, Blizzard has done such a lovely job writing Xal'atath, and Claudia Christian does such a great job voicing her, that most players are...kind of enjoying her presence. The first few days of the new patch last week saw the community subreddit flooded with cheeky, obsessive posts about Xal'atath. Sure, she's evil, but apart from being gorgeous, she's also clever, funny, powerful, and dare I say, kind of sultry? Her banter with the player is almost flirtateous at times, referring to us again and again as "my champion", while simultaneously reminding us that she could snuff us out on a whim. She spends a <em>lot</em> of time needling Alleria Windrunner and, as the ever-wise Ve'nari puts it, "floating around and making sarcastic remarks." And irritatingly enough, she's also correct a lot of the time about the behaviors and motivations of the other people who claim to be Alleria's allies (looking at you, Locus-Walker) and the ways in which they aren't exactly behaving righteously, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Love for Xal'atath has reached such a point that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkv7jh/mommy_xalatath_addon/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">someone even made a mod (add-on) for World of Warcraft</a> that has Xal'atath whisper praise to the player every time they exit a combat scenario...though notably in these messages, Xal'atath refers to herself as "mommy". So download that at your own risk, I guess.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this lady is <em>definitely</em> going to turn on us. And while plenty of players are enjoying the twist of her temporary allegiance and the opportunity to get to know her a little better, others are (rightfully!) recognizing that Xal'atath is definitely a hot mess we're going to regret partying with sooner or later:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/capture-1754939255090.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj3014/the_story_so_far/">https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj3014/the_story_so_far/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an interesting move by Blizzard to build Xal'atath up for, technically, five expansions, introduce her as the <em>seemingly</em> big bad of this one, only to form an alliance of convenience in the final act of The War Within with the promise that she's definitely going to keep on being evil in future expansions. With Xal'atath's dark and void theming, it seems likely she might play a major role in the next expansion, Midnight, which will be fully revealed at Gamescom in just a few weeks. The long game Blizzard's playing here is especially potent given that some of its other storylines that similar took several expansions of setup did not go over so well, such as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23015539/world-of-warcraft-sylvanas-windrunner-story-explainer-battle-for-azeroth-shadowlands-novel/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whatever was going on with Sylvanas and the Jailer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, trust Knaifu at your own risk, and enjoy her while you can. Manaforge Omega, the new raid, opens tomorrow and will bring with it another chapter of The War Within's story as we inch closer to the Midnight reveal and what I can only assume is Xal'atath's inevitable re-betrayal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

However, you first have to know what buttons to press to be able to celebrate and which celebrations you have access to, depending on what kind of play you made.</p><p>Below, we'll go over all of the available celebrations in Madden 26, how to perform them, and when you can perform each one.</p><h2>How to perform celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Before we get into each celebration offered in Madden 26, how do you perform one after you make a big play? Fortunately, it's fairly simple.</p><p>After you score a touchdown, intercept a pass, or make a first down, look at the bottom left corner of your screen. You'll see a "Celebrate" icon appear, and you can press a specific button combination after it appears to perform a celebration. You want to make sure you press the celebration buttons quickly, though, as the icon doesn't stay on the screen for too long.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548149" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548149"></a><figcaption>The Celebration icon appears in the bottom-left corner of the screen</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg"></figure><p>Once the icon disappears, your celebration window has passed, and you'll have to wait for the next big play to celebrate.</p><h2>All celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Now that you know what to look for before you celebrate, let's go over all of the celebrations and the buttons to press to perform each one.</p><p>As we mentioned before, you can celebrate after scoring a touchdown, intercepting a pass, or making a first down. There are specific celebrations you can perform after each of these big plays. This means you can only use certain celebrations after scoring a touchdown, and those celebrations aren't available after intercepting a pass or making a first down.</p><p>All three of the big play types in Madden 26 have their own celebrations with unique button combinations, so you have to remember which celebrations correlate with each play. You'll also have to remember the buttons to press to perform the celebration you want.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548150" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548150"></a><figcaption>Some of the TD celebrations in Madden 26</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg"></figure><p>Below, we've separated the different categories of celebrations and listed the button combinations for each one in Madden 26:</p><p><strong>All Touchdown celebrations </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Point to Fans</td><td>Right Stick (RS) Up</td></tr><tr><td>Step Back on Em</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Griddy</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Salute</td><td>RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Reach Low Flex</td><td>L2/LT + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Shake With It</td><td>L2/LT + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Wavy Walk</td><td>L2/LT + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>He's a Dawg</td><td><p>L2/LT + RS Left</p></td></tr><tr><td>Stand on Biz</td><td>L1/LB + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Afterburners</td><td>L1/LB + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Spike</td><td>L1/LB + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Two-Step Shuffle</td><td>L1/LB + RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Headstand</td><td>R2/RT + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Run Up Flex</td><td>R2/RT + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Fancy Flip</td><td><p>R2/RT + RS Down</p></td></tr><tr><td>All Together Now</td><td>R2/RT + RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Candy Karate</td><td>R1/RB + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Wait For It</td><td>R1/RB + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Shake Em Up</td><td>R1/RB + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>At the Y</td><td>R1/RB + RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>All Interception celebrations</strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wave Goodbye</td><td>RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Why You Throwing My Way</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Strapped</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Head Swag</td><td>RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>All First Down celebrations </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Signal It</td><td>RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Touch Em Up</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Jacked</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Shake It Off</td><td>RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can view all of these celebrations by pressing pause during the middle of a game or training session and selecting the "Celebrations" tab.</p><h2>How to perform Hot Spot Celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Finally, Madden 26 has also introduced Hot Spot Celebrations, which give you more freedom in how your player celebrates after a touchdown.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548151" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548151"></a><figcaption>Performing a touchdown celebration</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg"></figure><p>Hot Spot Celebrations work by giving you time to move your player after they've scored a touchdown. During this time, you can move your player to certain parts of the endzone to have them interact with specific elements of the field. There are a few different zones throughout the endzone, and moving to each zone will result in a new celebration.</p><p>For example, running to the field goal post will make your player interact with it, while running to one side of the endzone sees your player get the crowd involved. You only have a few seconds to move your player after they've scored a touchdown if you want to use a Hot Spot Celebration, so make your movements count.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>OpenAI launched its long-awaited <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/">AI update, GPT-5,</a> on August 7. It made lofty promises like ‚ÄúPhD‚Äëlevel intelligence.‚Äù But within 24 hours, the tool‚Äôs most devoted users were cataloging its many bugs, errors, and shortcomings on Reddit. The ChatGPT fandom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkobei/openai_just_pulled_the_biggest_baitandswitch_in/">started melting down</a>. CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1953893841381273969">responded</a> by promising to let customers start using the older GPT models again. By August 11, Altman was in <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1954703747495649670">full screencap apology</a> mode trying to cauterize the flow of bad vibes.</p> <p>‚ÄúIf you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models,‚Äù he posted on X earlier today. ‚ÄúIt feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology (and so suddenly deprecating old models that users depended on in their workflows was a mistake).‚Äù</p> <p>The tenor of this self-inflicted debacle should be familiar to anyone who‚Äôs played <em>Destin</em>y, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, or dozens of other online multiplayer games. It‚Äôs the same mix of developer hubris, corporate profit motive, hyper fandom, and ‚Äú<a href="https://x.com/dril/status/660644922744262656?lang=en">Sorry. Im sorry. Im trying to remove it</a>.‚Äù An upcoming expansion is sold with lofty promises. It arrives full of half-baked ideas and stealth nerfs. Players encounter a surprising number of bugs. Meanwhile the prices in the microtransaction shop are going up and the places where you can earn rewards for free are disappearing.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúThis guy communicates in a way that is indistinguishable from a community manager of a live service video game having a botched expansion release,‚Äù <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/catharsis23.bsky.social/post/3lw5jvotgfk2s">wrote</a> one Bluesky user in response. ‚ÄúSeems kind of humiliating.‚Äù Vocal AI critic Ed Zitron, who pegged GPT-5 as <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittification-of-generative-ai/">generative AI‚Äôs enshittification moment</a>, was more direct. ‚ÄúThis is the ultimate folly of OpenAI: they engaged gamer-like hype, got gamer-like fandom, and now face the wrath of gamer-like hate,‚Äù he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edzitron.com/post/3lw5k3nkztc2r">wrote</a> today.</p> <p>The GTP-5 fiasco <a href="https://gizmodo.com/it-took-just-24-hours-of-complaints-for-openai-to-start-bringing-back-its-old-model-2000640912">revolved around a few main issues</a>. While it was promised as another big leap in the model‚Äôs capabilities, what really seemed to be going on was that it was just routing queries to lots of different models to save time and money. There was also a very limiting cap on the number of queries users outside of the most expensive plans could make each week. Finally, there was the disappearances of GPT-4o, one of OpenAI‚Äôs most popular models which also <a href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/">had a reputation for being</a> ‚Äúsycophantic.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúChatGPT psychosis‚Äù is one of the biggest concerns with the billion-dollar cash-burning enterprise right now. Chat bots can suck users into ‚Äú<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html">delusional spirals</a>‚Äù with them. People are reportedly being <a href="https://futurism.com/commitment-jail-chatgpt-psychosis">involuntarily committed or jailed</a> after becoming obsessed with their GPT interactions. One guy thought he had trained his AI to become self-aware and that <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/">it was talking to God for him</a>.</p>

 <p>Altman clearly thinks this aspect of ChatGPT can be harmful in the wrong hands. But many of the people currently paying for ChatGPT also clearly prefer it. And he‚Äôs spent so long packaging OpenAI‚Äôs platform-shift moonshot as a grand cosmic journey everyone‚Äôs on together that dialing down the snake oil is no longer an option. After years of hyping AGI (artificial general intelligence), Altman told Wall Street last week that it‚Äôs actually ‚Äú<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/sam-altman-says-agi-is-a-pointless-term-experts-agree.html?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=689a05a3778386000185beda&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky">not a super useful term</a>.‚Äù</p> <p>This is the part in the live-service hype cycle where studios usually go from talking about how their game is completely transformative and unlike anything else you‚Äôve ever played before to offering very in-the-weeds explanations of why patch notes that are impossible for outsiders to parse will overhaul the game into the best version of the thing you already love. The players, who have invested not just their money and free time but also no small chunk of their identity in how your product makes them feel will now become like the dinosaurs at Jurassic Park. They are not trapped in your hyper-complex, infinitely monetizable skinner box. You are trapped in whatever they insist on perverting it into. Even if that‚Äôs <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/i-feel-like-im-going-crazy-chatgpt-fuels-delusional-spirals-ae5a51fc?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiqx4e9RsfPVEG8-vSVaF26bdgC8kiLYXSykv1hX5M3kzc2lNInkty8wQyYn5o%3D&amp;gaa_ts=689a6287&amp;gaa_sig=w891GxyjybddGBhS316rMpTsfH3domwnKveQDIM4DMGXW47JE1c4U4x30cETuWVawzdNGNzebYIZi-hOBA5Rcw%3D%3D">an expensive rabbit hole full of apocalyptic conspiracies</a>.</p>

                <p>From the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises to the 2K sports titles, Take-Two Interactive has some of the most-desirable games in the industry. However, the company has largely kept its marquee titles away from Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. Now, Take-Two President Karl Slatoff has explained why the company hasn't embraced lending more of its games to subscription services.</p><p>"We do put our titles occasionally into some of the subscription services," Slatoff said earlier this month during a Take-Two investor call (via <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/08/07/take-two-ttwo-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Motley Fool</a>). "They're great partners for us. And in many cases, they're great ... We wouldn't do it unless it was a good economic deal. The platforms wouldn't do it either. So we do take advantage of that, and it's been compelling much from an economic standpoint. As it relates to NBA, we have done it in the past. We don't really talk about whether we're gonna do anything in the future. But when you do put something into a channel like that, it generates obviously, engagement. It generates income for us. And it's something that we consider, and we do it if the time is right, if the math makes sense."</p><p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has previously weighed in on the subject by stating that it doesn't make sense <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-want-new-games-on-game-pass/1100-6494686/" data-ref-id="1100-6494686">to put any of the company's new titles on Game Pass or PS Plus</a>. He also said that high-profile day-one games like Call of Duty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">will only drive up Game Pass subscriptions for a short period of time</a>.</p><p>Raccoon Logic studio head Alex Hutchinson recently argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-who-launched-game-into-game-pass-warns-against-launching-games-into-game-pass/1100-6532306/" data-ref-id="1100-6532306">launching titles day one on Game Pass can devalue games</a> and hurt the industry. Hutchinson has first-hand experience with the subject: Raccoon Logic launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/revenge-of-the-savage-planet/" data-ref-id="5000-640444">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> as a day one title earlier this year, and the company didn't get the response it hoped for.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-anime-critics-at-ign-navigate-the-complex-score-obsessed-discourse.1267494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><figure><figcaption><span>IGN/David Production/Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure></p></div><div><p>Colloquially, an IGN review has become more than just a critique‚Äîit‚Äôs a meme, a lightning rod for online discourse, and a battleground. This is especially true in the anime space, where numerical scores are treated less as subjective assessments and more like declarations of war, with fandoms accusing them of rage engagement clicks.&nbsp;</p><p>For the critics who decide these scores, the backlash often spills into their mentions and DMs on social media platforms. In 2025, reviewing anime isn‚Äôt just about evaluating a show‚Äôs artistic merit; it‚Äôs about weighing whether a writer can survive the fallout of a fandom‚Äôs fury should a show‚Äôs premiere and season finale not vibe with them. I spoke with stalwart IGN freelance reviewers <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/rgmotamayor/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rafael Motamayor</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/SiddhantAdlakha/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siddhant Adlakha</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/kircarey/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirsten Carey</a> to debunk misconceptions about reviews of popular anime and animated works for one of gaming‚Äôs biggest publications.&nbsp;</p><h2>What makes a 10/10 anime?</h2><p>IGN is quite transparent about the criteria that determine its numerical scores. The site has <a href="https://corp.ign.com/review-practices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">examples of its review scale</a> and what qualifies a video game, TV show, or movie as unbearable, painful, awful, bad, mediocre, okay, good, great, amazing, or a masterpiece. Since the scores range from one to 10, people online often compare them to school grades out of 100, where a seven‚Äîcommonly joked about as a typical pub score‚Äîis seen as a C-grade, failing to realize it still indicates a good rating.&nbsp;</p><p>Other readers have taken it upon themselves to use the rubric to compare IGN‚Äôs scores to each other, aiming to determine whether one work is better than another. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/ddwqbj/ign_has_never_rated_a_mystery_dungeon_game_above/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most popular meme </a>involves people comparing new reviews to <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/most-hated-game-imagine-party-babyz-meme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN‚Äôs score for <em>Imagine Party Babyz</em></a>.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It‚Äôs also difficult to give something a 10 that isn‚Äôt over.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Contrary to the idea that IGN randomly selects writers to review superhero shows and anime, writers must pitch to IGN‚Äôs editor, explaining their expertise and familiarity with the medium or source material, to let editors know their critique comes from an informed place.</p><p>I asked Motamayor, Adlakha, and Carey what they look for in the rarely awarded masterpiece, or 10, IGN review score.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúWhether or not it accomplishes what the show is trying to do from the beginning,‚Äù Motamayor said. ‚ÄúDifferent shows are trying to do different things. Not every show is trying to be serious, dramatic, [or] epic. But whether or not the goal of the show is&nbsp; accomplished and whether or not it does something unique for the tone, genre, or the space in which the show occupies.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs a combination of how ambitious something is versus how well it executes that ambition,‚Äù Adlakha said. ‚ÄúIf a particular episode has a high bar for what it‚Äôs going for‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs visually, emotionally, or thematically‚Äîand if it‚Äôs able to stir up emotions in a successful way using the tools of the medium, that for me makes it a successful episode.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúA 10 out of 10 anime would be gorgeously animated, and this is my own bias, preferably 2D animation, and if it‚Äôs CG, <em>Spider-Verse</em> levels with immaculate artistic choices with a good story, characters,‚Äù Carey said. ‚ÄúNo weird sexism or anti-LGBTQ stuff happening that makes little flags go up in my brain. The difference between a nine and a 10, for lack of a better word, is an X factor. When people look back on that review 10 years from now, if the internet is still around, that will age well.‚Äù</p><p>Save for the final season of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/attack-on-titan-series-finale-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Attack on Titan</em></a>, which Motamayor reviewed, contemporary anime has yet to get a masterpiece, or 10, rating.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also difficult to give something a 10 that isn‚Äôt over,‚Äù Carey said. ‚ÄúMost anime coming out right now, you‚Äôre just reviewing the first couple of episodes. How can you give the beginning of something a 10 unless it's the most incredible opening to a thing you‚Äôve ever seen? I guess I would give the first episode of <em>Attack on Titan</em> a 10 because that‚Äôs an iconic hook. But it‚Äôs tough to give the beginning of a thing, or an unfinished thing, a perfect score because we don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs gonna end.‚Äù</p><p>IGN is often misperceived as a hegemonic entity when it comes to its numerical review scores, especially in the anime genre, rather than focusing on individual reviewers with varying tastes. While using a numerical score is, for better or worse, a convenient summary and a core part of <a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/ign-review-tees?srsltid=AfmBOooTf0jAEjS9bFZHJap628H--WUgDG5rLi8yNgfQMR1AhEO6K0XY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN‚Äôs identity</a> as a media outlet, reviewers are divided on their opinions of these scores and whether they capture or oversimplify the nuances of an anime.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúI start by figuring out the number, and then write the review in a way to justify it. That helps me structure things,‚Äù Carey said. ‚ÄúThe way that I worry about it flattening is if the number review is gonna make it seem like I like [a show] less than I do. Even if something is a six, that‚Äôs still ‚ÄòOkay.‚Äô I enjoy the structure of how the number comes at the end, so you‚Äôre working up to the reveal, even though I know a lot of people who just scroll down to see what the number is. I‚Äôve done that on other people‚Äôs reviews.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI have mixed feelings on numerical scores because I think on one hand they can be a representative shorthand of what someone feels about something that can be a helpful guide,‚Äù Adlakha said. ‚ÄúBut I think the way it‚Äôs interpreted a lot of the time‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a score out of 10 or five stars on a film-centric website, I think people see that as the end-all of criticism. [Readers will] look at what the score is and not even read what you‚Äôve written and treat it as an attempt at objectivity, and then they tend to clash with you on that.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI do not like numerical scores at all,‚Äù Motamayor said. ‚ÄúIt definitely boils [a review] down. It makes it a shortcut for people to just read a score and ignore everything else.‚Äù</p><p>Granted, IGN provides numerous ways for readers to access short versions of reviews, accompanied by verdicts and blurbs that characterize its numerical rating, but even still, Motamayor finds that people ‚Äújust ignore that and go straight for the score.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Charlie Goes Into An IGN Anime Review Rabbit Hole | MoistCr1tikal" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dAGvgWGJuCY?start=434&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Adlakha pointed out that readers often blame a single reviewer as the scapegoat for poor reviews of shows whenever online discussions become heated. In their frustration, audiences frequently overlook that their ‚Äúthis you‚Äù quote retweets of recent IGN reviews come from completely different reviewers. Even when confronted with this, some audiences will counter, believing that IGN has a mandate from on high dictating reviews be contrarian.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I‚Äôve received gore for not liking one episode of a show.</p></blockquote></figure><p>This misperception appears to stem from an idea about how YouTube works, where a positive or negative review depends on whether the creator's check clears, implying that it is akin to a paid advertisement. This assumption ignores the fact that review writers are paid a <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fixed rate</a> regardless of whether the review is positive or negative.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúThe idea that there are [pay difference between a positive or negative review] is straight up conspiratorial, and it's such a prevalent thing when it comes to the mistrust of critics and journalism at large that I don't really know what to do about it,‚Äù Adlakha said. ‚ÄúEven addressing it seems to lead to even more pushback, but it's also one of many conspiratorial accusations.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúPeople have told me ‚ÄòYou're just trying to be contrarian,‚Äô but usually when I review something, there is no overarching opinion for me to be contrarian towards. There is no public opinion. There's no critical opinion just yet because usually the stuff is reviewed in advance,‚Äù Adlakha continued. ‚ÄúEven if I have these amazing psychic powers to predict what the public opinion on something is going to be, being contrarian in that sense would just lead to me being harassed nonstop, which has happened many, many times over reviews. Being intentionally contrarian has no advantages for me, and I don't know what people think [negative reviews] do.‚Äù</p><figure><figcaption>Demon Slayer<span></span><span>ufotable</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Rocking the fandom boat</h2><p>Writing reviews for highly anticipated anime often sparks controversy when a critique doesn't portray a beloved source material‚Äôs adaptation positively for fans. This is especially true in shonen anime and superhero shows. IGN‚Äôs tendency to exclusively cover big-name anime in a given season‚Äîall typically shonen‚Äîalso comes with more eyes on its anime coverage as well as more scrutiny from audience expectations of a writer reviewing one of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-harassment-comes-with-the-territory-of-translating-popular-manga-2000556430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anime‚Äôs most popular (and toxic) genres</a>. Although Adlakha reviews superhero and superhero animated shows, he encounters a similar phenomenon with backlash on his reviews for popular shows, similar to what Carey and Motamayor experience with their reviews of popular shonen anime.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine to have an opinion that runs counter to what a critic is saying, but in the particular case of superhero stuff, especially superhero animated stuff, it‚Äôs people who will track you down on any and every possible social media‚Äîincluding LinkedIn‚Äîand will just send you the nastiest stuff unprompted,‚Äù Adlakha said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve received gore for not liking one episode of a show. It tends to get really uncomfortable.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>The writers I talked to have become public enemies in IGN readership circles for writing less favorable reviews, which consistently make them the main characters of anime Twitter discourse for several days after their reviews are published. Adlakha and Motamayor are more infamous within IGN‚Äôs pool of freelance critics whenever they appear on IGN‚Äôs masthead because of their past review scores for popular series like <em>Demon</em> <em>Slayer</em>, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>, and <em>Invincible</em>. For clarity, Motamayor rated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/demon-slayer-season-4-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Demon Slayer</em> Season 4</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jujutsu-kaisen-season-2-part-2-review-shibuya-incident-arc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> Shibuya Incident Arc</a> a four and a six, respectively. Meanwhile, Adlakha rated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-3-review-prime-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Invincible</em> Season 3</a> a seven.</p><p>‚ÄúSpecifically, when it comes to shonen anime, my reviews on<em> Demon Slayer</em>‚Äîand to be fair‚Äîyou can <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/demon-slayer/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see my reviews going down with time</a> as, in my opinion, the show got progressively worse,‚Äù said Motamayor.</p><p>Just like how a series can fluctuate from season to season, the same can happen with its coverage‚Äîespecially when different reviewers take the reins. That was the case with <em>Demon Slaye</em>r, which Carey initially reviewed at the beginning of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-to-the-hashira-training-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hashira Arc</a> before Motamayor stepped in.</p><p>‚ÄúI disagree hard with the final review, which goes against anyone thinking that IGN reviewers are a monolith,‚Äù Carey said.</p><p>‚ÄúThere is a tendency, specifically with IGN, to generalize not only a reviewer's opinion based on a single review but the entire website and the entire staff as a singular mindset or opinion,‚Äù Motamayor said. ‚ÄúIn my case, when things like my <em>Demon Slayer</em> review become a point of discourse among certain groups, then they start looking at my reviews to prove their point. Other than those specific cases, ideals seem to be generalizing IGN as a single entity.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIt comes down to people seeing a score and then working backwards from there as to what your opinion might be or what your intentions might be without actually reading what you have to say. There‚Äôs not much I can do about that if someone‚Äôs unwilling to engage with what I‚Äôm saying in good faith,‚Äù Adlakha said.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Attack on Titan<span></span><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p>Adlakha compared the phenomenon to a kind of cult within the readership that would message him about qualifying a show with a seven or eight IGN score as a ‚Äúmeme score.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna unpack what that means,‚Äù Adlakha said. ‚ÄúYou live in your own world where a number out of 10 tells you something more than just what someone‚Äôs opinion might be. I think it‚Äôs gone to this almost fringe point. I can‚Äôt even begin to reverse engineer what any of it might mean,‚Äù Adlakha said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the GIF of Donald Glover in <em>Community </em>walking into that room that‚Äôs on fire. It feels like I‚Äôve walked into something that there‚Äôs some kind of ongoing conversation within this in-group who, through confirmation bias, convinced themselves that reviews on IGN are specifically designed to piss them off. If they‚Äôve collectively decided that nothing I say is going to penetrate that, then I don‚Äôt see a point in engaging with it.‚Äù</p><p>Much of the discourse backlash that comes Motamayor‚Äôs way comes from manga readers rather than anime watchers. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to generalize all anime fans, but a lot of the louder commenters, specifically on IGN‚Äôs website and social media, very much focus on a show being good because of the source material,‚Äù Motamayor said. Although many commenters end up agreeing with what Motamayor might say in a review, especially on points he‚Äôs less enthusiastic about, like fights in <em>JJK</em> being too long and convoluted, they eventually return to the consensus that he‚Äôs wrong because the anime and manga are popular.</p><p>‚ÄúA lot of the engagement seems to be based on reputation rather than the actual artistic value of a show or a movie,‚Äù Motamayor said. ‚ÄúAnother big part of it is boiling down the show to the fight scenes. If a reviewer finds issues with things other than the fight scenes, it doesn‚Äôt matter because the fight scenes, in some anime fans‚Äô opinions, are the only thing that matters.‚Äù</p><div><p>Because of this shonen rule of cool, Motamayor says some groups of viewers can excuse almost anything in a critique, but once the focus shifts to an anime‚Äôs action‚Äîand the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/netflix-animation-anime-interview-power-house-sam-deats-adam-deats-david-how-2000517324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difference between special effects compositing and animation</a>‚Äîreaders tend to have issues with reviewers. That or they assume a reviewer doesn‚Äôt understand the subject because they didn‚Äôt read the source material‚Äîanother odd sticking point for anime, which reviewers either avoid mentioning in their reviews (because they‚Äôre not reviewing the source material) or emphasize because they also read the manga and comics.</p><p>‚ÄúEven if I have read it, I don‚Äôt normally mention the source material in my reviews unless it‚Äôs a big part of something specifically worth mentioning,‚Äù Motamayor said. ‚ÄúOtherwise, I‚Äôm not reviewing a manga [because] you‚Äôre watching a show.‚Äù</p></div><p>‚ÄúFor me, it helps because it‚Äôs about striking a balance in a review, looking at something as both an adaptation and as its own thing,‚Äù Adlakha said. ‚ÄúOf course, some people might be looking for complete fidelity to the story and the structure, but for me that‚Äôs not what adaptation is all about, especially in an animated medium where you can use things like movement, rhythm, and music to enhance or subvert things that were already done in the source material.‚Äù</p><p>When hate comments appear, reviewers say IGN mainly steps in if they‚Äôre extremely vitriolic by moderating the comments section on its website. Still, because reviews are blasted onto social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, it‚Äôs unfortunate but common for reviewers to go no-contact on social media or block people for uncharitable responses.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It‚Äôs the actual critique in the conversation that is far more important. </p></blockquote></figure><p>While neither of the three have considered walking away from anime review writing because of online discourse, they have weighed whether it is worth putting up with the backlash that spills outside of IGN‚Äôs moderation onto their personal social media.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúI have considered whether there is enough of an upside if the downside is being harassed for weeks and months on end across every single social media place that I am available online‚Äîemail, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, BlueSky, Threads, LinkedIn‚Äîall at once, sending not just insults but death threats,‚Äù Adlakha said. ‚ÄúI have to consider whether this is worth it from a mental health standpoint. I haven‚Äôt gone to the extent of walking away, but the thought has come up.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThe zeroing in on IGN numerical scores comes from the effect that the internet is having on our brain, that we have shorter attention spans. That <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/#:~:text=Google%20users%20who%20encountered%20an,on%20pages%20without%20a%20summary." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one percent of people now click on links at Google</a> because <a href="https://aftermath.site/google-ai-idioms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everyone‚Äôs just reading the AI overview</a>‚Äîthat is the focus on the numerical score,‚Äù Carey said. ‚ÄúWe could take away the numerical score, and that would allow more nuance in the review, perhaps, but IGN‚Äôs whole model is thrown into the sea... I feel it‚Äôs almost less of an issue with IGN and more of an issue with how social media is training us to think. I would love to write reviews where I don‚Äôt have to assign a thing and just talk about something, but increasingly few outlets are allowed to do that.‚Äù</p><figure><figcaption>Jujutsu Kaisen<span></span><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Hype-driven online culture be damned; traditional criticism is still essential&nbsp;</h2><p>In the New Yorker‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-lede/in-defense-of-the-traditional-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Defense of the Traditional Review</a>,‚Äù writer Richard Brody quoted Pauline Kael‚Äôs 1971 article<em> ‚Äú</em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1971/01/23/notes-on-heart-and-mind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Notes on Heart and Mind</a>,‚Äù in which she writes that ‚ÄúWithout a few independent critics, there‚Äôs nothing between the public and the advertisers.‚Äù Brody‚Äôs use of the quote highlighted his argument that traditional reviews serve as an essential buffer between audiences and commercial influence, preserving artistic integrity and encouraging informed engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of anime reviews, the buffer of traditional review writing is as crucial as in any other medium. In a media landscape increasingly molded by algorithmic promotion, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/new-media-circuit-hollywood-publicity.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influencer culture supplanting press interviews</a>, criticism that engages and challenges should be valued. This level of scrutiny can keep conversation alive and help a medium evolve. Review writing that risks discomfort for fandoms and creatives alike is far more valuable than one that reads like a press release angling for a back-of-the-box quote or an accolade trailer shout-out.</p><p>While the hate comments and baggage that come with being an IGN anime reviewer haven't deterred Motamayor, Carey, or Alaksha from continuing to work for the publication, that doesn‚Äôt mean IGN as an institution doesn‚Äôt have room to grow in legitimizing anime reviews within the mainstream. Motamayor suggested IGN and traditional media coverage as a whole should expand its anime coverage beyond shonen-centric content as a way to make reviews of action-oriented shows less of a polarizing echo chamber and to highlight shows that aren‚Äôt solely focused on power levels and aura farming.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúMy dream world would be one where IGN is reviewing enough anime consistently, where the big show, and specifically the reviewer writing about the big show, is not seen as representative of their whole career or the entire website's reputation. As it is now, the fact that we are mostly just running about the big shows makes it so that the reviews can be boiled down to ‚Äòwhat, do you not like shonen anime in general, because of one show you didn‚Äôt like?‚Äô Or ‚ÄòI guess they like writing negative reviews for the engagement.‚Äô‚Äù</p><p>In addition to expanding what kind of anime the site covers, there‚Äôs also the question of review scores overshadowing the nuance of a critique.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúThe prominence of scores, these numerical figures, tends to be very overemphasized because art is not something you can approach objectively. It‚Äôs not what criticism is about, ‚ÄúAdlakha said. ‚ÄúA score or a star rating can be a gateway to a deeper and more fulfilling criticism. But the intense focus on these things reduces what criticism is capable of and skews what the conversation around a piece of art even is in this very thumbs-up, thumbs-down sense. Art and our response to it is a little more complicated than just a yes or no, or a 7 or 8, because I don‚Äôt feel that strongly about the numbers themselves. It‚Äôs the actual critique in the conversation that is far more important. To only get messages and responses just about a number is like we‚Äôre having two completely different conversations.‚Äù</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions"><h3>Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop</h3></a><p>Forget The Lorax, kid; it's time for classic architecture</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-best-video-game-boats"><h3>Let‚Äôs Remember Some Good Video Game Boats</h3></a><p>"Assassin‚Äôs Creed is reinventing interest in sea shanties.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>For months now, rumors of a Lego <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars</em></a> Death Star set have been floating around Reddit, Instagram, and other places where Lego nerds (like myself) hang out. Now we finally have our first real look at the massive upcoming Lego set, and it seems to confirm the previous rumors, which also claimed the price for this 9,000+ piece set might be $1,000.</p> <p>I first heard about a massive <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867">Lego Death Star</a> set that could cost as much as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoStarWarsLeaks/comments/1lq9y5m/death_star/">$1,000 back in May</a>. At the time, the only supposed details that had leaked were its set number, piece count, October release date, and estimated price, as well as some tiny details on possible minifigs that would be included. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoStarWarsLeaks/comments/1kj36y8/my_speculation_and_analysis_on_the_1000_death/">There was also speculation</a> that it wouldn‚Äôt be a full orb, but instead a half-orb that would serve as more of a large diorama piece. Now some new leaked images seem to confirm many, but not all, of those previously rumored details.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1mm3ecd/75419_ucs_death_star_full_box_source/">On August&nbsp; 9, three photos</a> of what appears to be the (still officially unconfirmed) Lego Death Star set were shared on Reddit. The photos show the massive set‚Äôs equally massive box and confirm the previously leaked set number and piece count. Well, actually, the piece count of 9,023 is a few bricks more than what was leaked, but it‚Äôs close enough that I‚Äôm confident that the source of the details had advanced information.</p>

 <p>The new leak also confirms <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-season-2-review-discussion-so-good-1851777959"><em>Rogue One </em>and<em> Andor‚Äôs</em> Orson Krennic</a> is one of the many included minifigs. Others include Ben Kenobi, Luke Skywalker in his Stormtrooper disguise, R2-D2 and C-3PO, the Emperor, a bunch of Imperial higher-ups seen in <em>A New Hope</em>, and Darth Vader. Oh, and I think I spotted a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sim_Aloo">Sim Aloo</a> figure in the images included on the back of the box. (Though a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoStarWarsLeaks/comments/1m8ys0s/part_2_for_death_star_mini_figures/"><em>different</em> leak</a> simply refers to him as an ‚ÄúImperial Dignitary.‚Äù Boo!)</p> <p>Of course, the big news from this leak is that if all these previously rumored and speculated details are accurate, then it‚Äôs very likely Lego is about to set <a href="https://www.brickeconomy.com/sets/top/most-expensive-lego-sets">a new record for the most expensive official Lego set ever.</a></p> <p>Currently, the highest retail price the toy company has ever placed on a single set is $850 for the very big Millennium Falcon. <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/millennium-falcon-75192">That 7,500+ piece set was released in 2017</a> and is still for sale as of August 2025. The rumored price point of $1,000 for the new <em>Star Wars</em> Death Star would shatter the old record. However, the new Death Star won‚Äôt break the biggest set record, which is held by the Eiffel Tower set released in 2022. It contains 10,001 pieces and costs $630.</p> <p>And if you‚Äôre curious, the old Death Star set released in 2016 cost $500. At the time that seemed like a lot, and it still is a lot of money in 2025 to most people. I can‚Äôt imagine how many people will be able to afford double that when the new set arrives in October, assuming the rumored price is accurate. <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">And as tariffs continue to be a growing problem</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">in the United States thanks to President Trump</a>, expect Lego sets and other toys to become more expensive, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Woochi the Wayfarer is a new single-player action-adventure game developed by LoreVault Studio, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-the-first-descendant-death-relives/">The First Descendent</a> developer, Nexon Games, signed on as its publisher. Similar to how <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> leaned on a famous Chinese story, Woochi the Wayfarer leans on a famous Korean story, as a press release reveals the game is a depiction of 'The Tale of Jeon Woochi,' a famous Korean novel.</p>



<p>Nexon Games and LoreVault Studio debuted a nearly two-and-a-half-minute cinematic trailer, which set up the grandeur that the Unreal Engine 5 game is certainly going for, but didn't provide any real insight into the gameplay or what the final product will look like when it arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future. A release date, or even a release window, was not provided.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Woochi the Wayfarer | Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHH6xQT2-dw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a press release, Nexon Games chief executive officer, Park Yong-hyun, said "<em>Woochi the Wayfarer will provide a fresh and unique play experience that is based on traditional Korean materials while also having an emotional resonance that anyone around the world can relate to. We plan to present a game that will appeal to gamers of all cultures, telling an amazing story that fully showcases Nexon Games' development capabilities and accumulated experience</em>."</p>



<p>The game's soundtrack is inspired by traditional Korean music and is being composed by Korean composer Jung Jae-il, whose work you might recognize from the film Parasite or the Netflix series, Squid Game.</p>



<p>Between the storytelling, the visuals, and the music, it'll be cool to see Korean culture on display in Woochi the Wayfarer. Hopefully, the game is able to stick the landing with its gameplay on top of what already seems to be a strong setting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A retail release of the Welcome to Night Vale RPG is on the way. After a successful <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-comes-to-backerkit-this-october" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Backerkit campaign</a>, Night Vale Presents and Renegade Game Studios will be bringing a box set of their licensed TTRPG to hobby shops this September.</p>

<h2>The <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> Retail Release Date</h2>

<p>In an official newsletter, Renegade Game Studios has confirmed that the <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> boxed set will be coming to retail stores on September 9. This is roughly one month after the game's Backerkit supporters have received their copies of the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-town-artwork.jpg?itok=1nxG-Dl- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-town-artwork.jpg?itok=vKUlZ-B- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the name implies, the RPG has players explore the titular desert town from the beloved podcast series.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Paper Mario N64" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e558bc1801db/paper-mario-n64.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>25 years ago today, 11th August, Mario jumped into a whole new dimension.</p>
<p>Today marks the anniversary of the N64 turn-based RPG, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/paper_mario">Paper Mario</a> ‚Äî which is a pretty big deal, because that means the entire series is <em>also</em> celebrating its quarter-century anniversary. Feeling old yet?</p>
<p>Originally planned to be developed by Square ‚Äî who previously teamed up with Nintendo to make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_rpg_legend_of_the_seven_stars">Super Mario RPG</a> on the SNES ‚Äî Intelligent Systems took the helm for what became the first of many papercraft adventures for Mario. And for many, the original (or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Thousand-Year Door</a>) are the high watermark for the series.</p>
<p>Taking a leaf from Mario's previous RPG outing, Paper Mario uses similar reaction timing-based combat but, instead of a party of three, Mario only has one other companion join him both in battle and in the overworld.</p>

<p>Throughout the story, Mario has various different companions join his team, each with different skill sets. Each companion represents a different type of enemy within the Mario universe ‚Äî fan favourite Lady Bow is a Boo, for example, while Sushie is a Cheep Cheep.</p>
<p>Those skills aren't exclusive to combat, as every character has an ability that Mario can use to explore. Goombario's skill is that he can tell you all about the location you're in. Parakarry, the Paratroopa, allows you to cross large gaps, and Sushie gives Mario the ability to swim.</p>
<p>The game also introduced Badges, equipable items that give Mario boosts, effects, and sometimes new moves.</p>
<p>Plus, don't forget that amazing magazine ad from before the game's release:</p>

<p>Much of Paper Mario's spirit and skills would carry on in The Thousand-Year Door, the GameCube sequel that got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">a remake on Switch in 2024</a>, but the series gradually moved away from traditional turn-based combat, experimenting with gameplay gimmicks beyond the standard RPG ones.</p>
<p>Still, the franchise wouldn't exist without the charming N64 original, which you can play on the N64 Nintendo Classics (formerly NSO) service if you have the Expansion Pack tier. The latest entry in the series is 2020's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_origami_king">The Origami King</a>, which is available on Switch - hopefully it'll get a Switch 2 upgrade at some point!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A small store in California was <a href="https://kotaku.com/card-shop-pokemon-robbed-100k-hammer-rare-cards-thief-1851786241">robbed earlier this month</a>, and the thieves focused primarily on taking thousands of dollars‚Äô worth of Labubu dolls. The owner says this happened only two months after opening her shop.</p> <p><a href="https://abc7.com/post/thousands-dollars-worth-labubu-dolls-stolen-la-puente-resale-shop/17465366/">As reported by ABC7,</a> Joanna Avendano‚Äôs One Stop Sales, located in La Puente, California, was burglarized on August 6 at around 2:00 a.m. local time. The owner explained that she was hit with a ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù to check her phone and noticed there was motion and sound coming from the store‚Äôs surveillance camera. Nobody was supposed to be there at the time. It was clear at that point that the place was being robbed. Four masked suspects entered the store after smashing in a window and proceeded to grab over $30,000 worth of inventory.</p> <p>‚ÄúThere was a lot taken, maybe like around $30,000 or more of inventory,‚Äù Avendano told the outlet.‚ÄùWe worked so hard to get to this point, and for them to just come in and, like nothing, take it all away, it‚Äôs really bad.‚Äù</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Thieves ransack LA County resale shop for its Labubu dolls" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PUD3A0EDHo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>ABC7 reports that the suspects didn‚Äôt steal cash or high-end electronics in the store and instead focused on grabbing Labubu dolls and other collectible merchandise. Labubu dolls have become quite popular over the last year or so, thanks to TikTok and celebrities posting about the bizarre monster plushies with big eyes that come in various colors and designs.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúI was watching everything, from when they got in, what they were taking,‚Äù said Avendano. ‚ÄúI was panicking because I was just‚Ä¶I couldn‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù</p> <p>Avendano told ABC7 that she believes the robbery was planned, explaining that a suspicious truck was parked near her store as she closed up before the robbery. She also thinks the thieves were watching the shop‚Äôs social media posts and were waiting for her to share news of a Labubu restock. The dolls are currently very hard to find as their popularity continues to grow, mostly pushed by the algorithm.</p> <p>In fact, it‚Äôs entirely possible you‚Äôve never heard of these hard-to-find dolls, and if so, you aren‚Äôt alone. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-11/tiktok-trends-are-driving-random-consumer-spending-spikes">As reported by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, many younger people are posting on TikTok about how many odd trends have gone viral recently, including Labubu, and how confusing it‚Äôs all becoming. It almost feels like these trends aren‚Äôt coming about organically, but instead are a symptom of pop culture becoming dominated by dopamine hits and corporate-controlled algorithms. Monoculture is dead and its replacement sucks.</p> <p>On August 8, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNFH1hTOOKV/?hl=en">Avendano shared a post on Instagram</a> claiming that police had recovered some of her stolen goods, including some Labubu dolls. However, she and local law enforcement are still asking residents in the area to report anything they might know to the Los Angeles County Sheriff‚Äôs Department City.</p> <p>‚Äî‚Äî</p> <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff‚Äôs Department City of Industry substation is investigating the burglary.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a> can be enjoyed right out of the box, but it‚Äôs even better with the right accessories. Some of these add-ons are more crucial than others, especially if you‚Äôre deciding what to buy early on. For example, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Carrying-Nintendo-Odorless-Protective-Portable-Protection/dp/B0DT48LYLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">case</a> and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Auto-Alignment-Protector-Accessories-Installation-Anti-Scratch-Ultra-Clear/dp/B0DRCKDWD1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">screen protector</a> can keep your console safe from scuffs, scratches, and drops, so both are what I‚Äôd consider to be essential.</p><p>On the other hand, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DFQKQ9CB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">microSD Express card</a> lets you add even more digital games to your library, although the console‚Äôs somewhat generous 256GB of internal storage means you may not need one right away. Some others don‚Äôt add enough to the gaming experience to be worth it. Those Joy-Con 2 steering wheel accessories? You can pass on those.</p><p>The Switch 2 and its games are expensive enough, so we‚Äôve assembled this guide with picks that are a great value. You don‚Äôt need to spend hundreds on accessories ‚Äî many of us at <em>The Verge</em> certainly aren‚Äôt. No matter your budget, we‚Äôve included numerous categories, beginning with a starter kit of recommendations we think everyone should consider.</p><div><p id="our-seven-must-have-switch-2-accessories"><h2>Our seven must-have Switch 2 accessories</h2></p></div><div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->9</span></p><div><p>This two-pack of glossy screen protectors is a great value.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->33</span></p><div><p>A slim, durable case that comes in multiple color schemes.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->89</span></p><div><p>The Switch 2 wireless controller with the most features, but it‚Äôs not cheap.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->19</span></p><div><p>Grab this to be able to use your Xbox or PS5 controller on your Switch 2.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->54</span></p><div><p>Once you‚Äôve filled up the Switch 2‚Äôs built-in 256GB SSD, add some extra storage.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->13</span></p><div><p>Switch 2 Wi-Fi download speeds are painfully slow. This can help speed things up in handheld mode.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->20</span></p><div><p>A great accessory for households with original Switch Joy-Con laying around.</p></div></div></div><div><p id="best-switch-2-controllers"><h2>Best Switch 2 controllers</h2></p></div><div><p id="nintendo-switch-2-pro"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro</h3></p></div><p>The Switch 2 Pro is Nintendo‚Äôs latest flagship wireless controller. It‚Äôs similar in several ways to the excellent Pro controller that debuted alongside the Switch, especially in design, with its analog stick layout, and because it‚Äôs the most replete with features you won‚Äôt find on other Switch 2 gamepads.</p><p>Its motion control support isn‚Äôt a novel feature (many third-party controllers offer that), but its Amiibo NFC support is still something that almost no alternatives offer. Another feature that makes this one worth considering despite its high price is its 3.5mm headphone jack, in case you want to plug in a set of wired headphones for private listening. Additionally, it can wake the Switch 2 from standby via Bluetooth (only a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716763/gulikit-elves-2-controller-wake-switch-2">select few wireless models</a> possess this ability), so you don‚Äôt have to get off your couch to hit the console‚Äôs power button. Lastly, this model has two additional buttons that can be mapped to mimic almost any other button. (some cheaper alternatives, including the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 and Pro 3, feature four extra buttons).</p><p>The Switch 2 Pro is very comfortable, and it‚Äôs the controller that I always want to use when given the choice between the options below. But it‚Äôs not perfect. For one, it‚Äôs pricey at $89.99, and you‚Äôd think for that price Nintendo might have opted for drift-resistant sticks. Alas, you owe $5 to your buddy who bet that Nintendo would doggedly opt again for potentiometer sticks that are proven to tear down over time. Its sticks haven‚Äôt caused issues so far, but it‚Äôs possible that they might not fare as well ‚Äî and as long ‚Äî as models below that feature more durable Hall effect or TMR joysticks.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->89</span></p><div><p>The Switch 2 Pro Controller features new remappable ‚ÄúGL‚Äù and ‚ÄúGR‚Äù rear buttons, the ‚ÄúC‚Äù button to access in-game chat features, and a headphone jack.</p></div></div><div><p id="8bitdo-pro-3"><h3>8BitDo Pro 3</h3></p></div><p>8BitDo‚Äôs Pro 3 is a good alternative to the Switch 2 Pro controller: it‚Äôs slightly cheaper, yet better in some ways (and a bit worse in others) that might matter to you.</p><p>Starting with the good, the company upgraded its joysticks to the even more durable <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR</a> sensors. The two back paddles are carried over from the first iteration, though there‚Äôs a new pair of buttons (L4 and R4) near the triggers that can be customized. Also of note are new toggle switches around its backside (similar to what we saw on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">DualSense Edge</a>) that let you alter the travel distance of its two triggers. Toggling a switch makes the corresponding trigger feel more like a mouse click.</p><p>It‚Äôs also worth noting that this controller is significantly more customizable than the Switch 2 Pro, as well as most other controllers out there. Its face buttons are magnetically attached, and can be removed to let the Pro 3 flip between the Switch layout and the Xbox layout.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>While the Pro 3‚Äôs TMR sticks might make it last longer, there are some trade-offs compared to the pricier Nintendo alternative ‚Äî none of which are deal-breakers if saving money is a top priority. For example, its attempts to replicate the subtle blips and buzzing of Nintendo‚Äôs impressive HD haptics in the Switch 2 Pro controller are just not good. Its attempts at replicating the smallest, nuanced vibrations of Donkey Kong walking in <em>Bananza</em> makes it go full boar. I‚Äôd sooner turn off the vibration entirely than deal with how jarringly intense it feels, and thankfully you can in the app.</p><p>Other downsides are more minor, but are still worth knowing about. It lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, and it doesn‚Äôt have the C button to launch GameChat. However, you can easily assign the feature to one of the Pro 3‚Äôs buttons via the Switch 2‚Äôs OS ‚Äî but not to its additional buttons (the two R buttons near the triggers, and the two rear paddles). If you‚Äôd prefer to use the controller‚Äôs built-in button combo to reassign in-game commands to any of its buttons, that‚Äôs easy to do, per the instructions in its <a href="https://download.8bitdo.com/Manual/Controller/Pro3/8BItDo-Pro-3-Bluetooth-Gamepad-for-EN.pdf">PDF manual</a>.</p><div><p id="8bitdo-usb-adapter-2"><h2>8Bitdo USB Adapter 2</h2></p></div><p>It‚Äôs technically not a controller, but I‚Äôm a broken record when it comes to recommending 8BitDo‚Äôs USB Adapter 2 for households already with more than one console. In the case that you have an Xbox or a PS5 and would rather not buy a bespoke Switch 2 controller, just buy this $20 adapter instead, and use it to connect a wireless controller you already own.</p><p>This adapter goes into the Switch 2‚Äôs dock (or directly into the console, if you have a <a href="http://amazon.com/UGREEN-Adapter-MacBook-Thunderbolt-Samsung/dp/B0DSK82JK8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">USB-A to C adapter</a>). Connecting your controller is as easy as putting it into pairing mode, then ensuring that the ‚ÄúPro Controller Wired Communication‚Äù option is turned on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-gb%2FSupport%2FNintendo-Switch%2FHow-to-Enable-Disable-Pro-Controller-Wired-Communication-1516284.html%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooQDh9bo5-2gBbiTFt9tjp2FhOWMvMjDCetyx00DLITBir2u2Z4" rel="sponsored">within the console‚Äôs settings</a>. Click and hold the adapter‚Äôs coin-shaped button to initiate pairing, then you should be good to go. The DualSense‚Äôs rumble and motion controls work seamlessly, and you can remap buttons as you please within the console‚Äôs OS, just like you would an official Switch controller.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->19</span></p><div><p>The 8BitDo‚Äôs latest adapter resembles a flash drive, but once connected to your Switch‚Äôs dock, it allows you to wirelessly pair it with a variety of PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo controllers.</p></div></div><div><p id="best-switch-2-cases"><h2>Best Switch 2 cases</h2></p></div><div><p id="dbrand-killswitch"><h3>Dbrand Killswitch</h3></p></div><p>The Killswitch is a great Switch 2 companion, whether you‚Äôre someone who primarily uses the console in handheld mode or while it‚Äôs docked. It‚Äôs a case that wraps around the Switch 2‚Äôs back, with detachable components that snugly grip onto each Joy-Con 2, adding some extra bulk that makes them more comfortable to hold. Above all else, it‚Äôs a great way to protect your console from scratches and slightly more significant damage. What‚Äôs also great is that it doesn‚Äôt limit its flexibility as a hybrid console.</p><p>Each Killswitch ships with a USB-C dock adapter that is inserted into the Switch 2 dock. Since the case-equipped console can no longer fit in Nintendo‚Äôs dock, this adapter lets you connect it to your TV without taking off the case. It‚Äôs tougher to correctly align the Switch 2‚Äôs USB-C jack with this adapter than it is to put it in the dock, but it gets easier with practice.</p><div><p id="tomtoc-fancycase-slim-zip-up-case"><h3>Tomtoc FancyCase Slim zip-up case</h3></p></div><p>The best, slimmest zip-up case you should buy is made by Tomtoc. Compared to the Belkin hard zip-up case that I got my hands on before the Switch 2‚Äôs launch, the Tomtoc FancyCase slim case feels more durable; anecdotally, it holds up much better to being squeezed by hand. It even has more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2 sticks, so it‚Äôll never press them in on accident. Like most zip-up cases, it features a screen cover that doubles as cartridge storage. This one can hold 12 cartridges.</p><p>I‚Äôm confident that it‚Äôll absorb more potential damage over time than other cases I‚Äôve tried. Plus, it just looks cooler, with low-profile designs for gamers who don‚Äôt want to draw attention to their console. That said, its ‚ÄúFroz Edition‚Äù has ice cream-inspired looks that are a lot more expressive.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->33</span></p><div><p>This hard case has a soft touch and a slim fit, and includes a flap that can hold up to 12 cartridges as it protects the console‚Äôs screen.</p></div></div><div><p id="belkin-fabric-zip-up-case"><h3>Belkin fabric zip-up case</h3></p></div><p>Belkin‚Äôs $29.99 zip-up case is another competent, good-looking option that‚Äôs slim and lightweight. It‚Äôs worth considering over the Tomtoc for one reason only: its built-in pocket, which is great if you need to stow a charging cable or any other small doo-dads. Not to mention, this pocket contains another pocket for an AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, so you can track this case‚Äôs location should you lose track of it.</p><p>Belkin makes a thicker, pricier version of this case that has a 20,000mAh 20W battery inside. It‚Äôs nearly identical until you open it. A cutout fits this (and only this) Belkin battery perfectly, and it lets you charge your Switch 2 at top speeds while it‚Äôs protected.</p><div><p id="best-switch-2-cameras"><h2>Best Switch 2 cameras</h2></p></div><p>The best webcam that you can get for your Switch 2 should be the cheapest one you can find that‚Äôs guaranteed to work with it. So far, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/694565/logitech-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">Logitech has confirmed</a> that almost all of its webcams support the Switch 2, and <a href="https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/25019224596877-Elgato-Facecam-MK-2-Firmware-Update#:~:text=As%20of%20July%2029%2C%202025%2C%20the%20firmware%20for%20the%20Facecam%20MK.2%20updated%20to%20version%202.00.%20This%20update%20can%20be%20used%20to%20make%20Facecam%20MK.2%20work%20with%20the%20Nintendo%20Switch%202.">Elgato has updated its Facecam MK.2</a> to support it, as well. Elgato‚Äôs model is pricier than we recommend most people spend, but it‚Äôs a solid option if you also have a PC to use it with. It‚Äôs worth knowing that the Switch 2 displays low-fidelity video feeds during gameplay, so unless you plan to use the webcam with your PC as well, it‚Äôs not worth spending a lot for a model that promises great video quality.</p><div><p id="best-switch-2-portable-batteries"><h2>Best Switch 2 portable batteries</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 is more powerful than the original Switch. However, it doesn‚Äôt require all that much more power to charge, even while you‚Äôre playing games. While new phones and tablets are breaking new ground with fast charging speeds, getting a power bank that can deliver at least 20W is totally sufficient to get the fastest-possible charging speeds with the Switch 2 in handheld mode.</p><p>By using a display-equipped USB-C cable with a wattage reading, I was able to see that the Switch 2 usually pulls a maximum of about 15-17W of power (sometimes less) from a USB-C battery during gameplay. When the system was asleep, the rate went down to between 8-13W, fluctuating at different points during the charging process. From a totally dead state, the console took almost 90 minutes to reach 69 percent with a 20W battery plugged into it. You‚Äôll likely drain your USB-C battery more quickly if you‚Äôre playing as you charge.</p><p>Thankfully, your options for compatible batteries are plentiful. You‚Äôll likely be paying for more power than you‚Äôll need with the Switch 2, but more power (and especially more ports) are never a bad thing to have too much of.</p><div><p id="best-microsd-express-cards-for-switch-2"><h2>Best microSD Express cards for Switch 2</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards of up to 2TB, even though models with that amount of storage aren‚Äôt yet available for purchase. Most brands make cards in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB configurations, and some offer 1TB cards as well. I‚Äôd suggest grabbing the cheapest microSD Express card you can find, as so far they all offer similarly fast read/write speeds.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/buying-guides/720160/best-switch-2-accessories]]></content:encoded>

Those missed expectations have left fans wondering what the future of the series looks like while <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/08/new-mass-effect-5-trailer-teases-original-trilogy-andromeda-and-maybe-a-new">BioWare works on the next Mass Effect game</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back on the franchise, however, we've recently learned BioWare, at one point, softly pitched a trilogy remaster of the first three Dragon Age games, but it was turned down by EA. That's according to Mark Darrah, former Dragon Age series producer and BioWare executive, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0">a new interview with MrMattyPlays on YouTube</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-has-there-never-been-a-dragon-age-origins-remaster-bioware-exec-explains-past-plans-and-continued-difficulties"><em>IGN</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I honestly think they should do ‚Äì I don't think they will, but they should do ‚Äì a remaster of the first three [Dragon Age games]," Darrah, who left BioWare in 2020 but consulted on last year's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, said to MrMattyPlays. "One of the things we pitched at one point ‚Äì pretty softly, so pitched is a massive overstatement ‚Äì was to retroactively rebrand the first games as if they were a trilogy, call it the Champions Trilogy, so you have these larger-than-life heroes... maybe you do that as a first step."</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-MRprT3Fnk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-MRprT3Fnk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As for why this trilogy remaster, which would consist of Dragon Age: Origins (2009), Dragon Age II (2011), and Dragon Age: Inquisition (2014), never came to light, Darrah places the blame on EA.&nbsp;</p><p>"EA's historically been ‚Äì and I don't know why, but they've even said this publicly ‚Äì they're kind of against remasters," he told MrMattyPlays.

			<p>Horror comes in many different flavours, with Folk Horror being particularly popular in recent years. Defined by a connection with and threat from the land beneath our feet and the beliefs that surround our involvement with it, this form of horror can offer fascinating insights into different cultures. Such is the case with One-Eyed Likho, a dark first person adventure based on a Slavic fairy tale. According to the tale, Likho is the embodiment of misfortune, a one-eyed ogress who haunts the margins of nightmares. Unfortunately for you, the protagonist of the game, you must track her down and find a way to escape her baleful eye.</p>
<p><iframe title="One-Eyed Likho - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W6YvgF_oIug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Likho is a window into another time and another culture. The 19th century Russian setting is one that was unfamiliar to me but also one that fits the eerie monochrome aesthetic perfectly. The lack of colour throughout the game gives the whole atmosphere the feel of a classic film, a mood only furthered by the Russian dialog. This combination of visuals and narrative reminded me greatly of 2021‚Äôs Mundaun, another folk horror game with a unique European setting.</p>


<p>While the black and white visuals seem limiting at first, the skilful use of light and shade throughout the game make details really pop in a way that they wouldn‚Äôt in full colour. The mixture of religious iconography and horror staples such as caves and dungeons creates a constant feeling of claustrophobia and there are some terrifying chase sequences that make full use of this tone.</p>


<p>You play as a smith who foolishly agrees to leave the safety of society to search for his fortune in the Mysterious Forest. Accompanied by a tailor, you soon find yourself embroiled in a nightmarish world of darkness and madness. The tailor seemingly dies at Likho‚Äôs hands early on but manages to remain a conscious companion in a freakish new form, the details of which I won‚Äôt spoil here. The original tale of Likho revolves around a smith blinding the ogress in order to escape her and one of the most memorable aspects of the game is the way in which it highlights the uncanny repetition found throughout folk stories from different cultures.</p>
<p>Early on in the game you find a strange book that at first appears to be empty. Scattered throughout the various locations are puzzle boxes that hold extra pages for this book ‚Äì pages that contain a range of stories from across the world that all seem to contain the same basic elements of Likho. The most famous of these is, of course, the tale of Odysseus and the Cyclops and those who are familiar with this version will find some clear overlaps with the events depicted in Likho.</p>

<p>While there is no combat in Likho, you are not completely helpless in your adventure. Equipped with a seemingly bottomless box of matches you‚Äôll frequently find the need to burn dry grass, wooden effigies and other obstacles to progress. This mechanic is your primary way of interacting with the world, but it‚Äôs not always about destruction. Lighting your path is often essential with many pitch black areas whilst other times puzzles require you to use light to your advantage.</p>
<p>The puzzles in Likho are mostly environmentally based with statues needing to be moved, keys found, and riddles to be solved. Alongside the main narrative path, there are the aforementioned storybook pages to be found, as well as birch manuscripts that give deeper lore details into the world of the story, and collectable dolls to burn hidden around the various locations. Trying to collect all of these provides some replayability which is welcome as the main story only takes around 4 hours to complete.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		One-Eyed Likho belongs in that rare category of games that take such a dark narrative and setting and manage to infuse it all with a surrealism that often verges on the comic. Even the epic conclusion of the story raised a smile at its presentation and effect. While not a long game and one that follows a very linear path, there are more moments and images here that will stay in your memory than many far longer games can muster.	</p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[Tencent has been Caught Making Changes to the Steam page for Horizon Rip-Off Light of Motiram after Sony‚Äôs Lawsuit]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-has-been-caught-making-changes-to-the-steam-page-for-horizon-rip-off-light-of-motiram-after-sony%E2%80%99s-lawsuit.1267350/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Tencent first announced Light of Motiram, everyone, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">Wccftech</a>, immediately saw it as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-shown-in-new-gameplay-trailer/">clone</a> or rip-off of Sony's Horizon series. Which is why no one was surprised when, at the end of last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/">a copyright lawsuit from Sony attacked Tencent</a> for Light of Motiram. The lawsuit cites the multiple headlines that drew the same connections we did, and goes as far to call Light of Motiram a "<em>slavish clone</em>" of Guerilla Games' series.</p>



<p>Now that Sony has pulled the lever on a lawsuit, Tencent has been caught making a few potentially legally-significant changes to Light of Motiram's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/">Steam page</a>. Spotted by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/">The Game Post</a>, the key art for Light of Motiram has been changed, the game's description has been rewritten, and multiple screenshots, including ones featuring Light of Motiram's own red-haired player character, have been removed.</p>



<p>The game's original description on Steam read as such: </p>



<p>"<em>In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses. Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy machination, survive with mechanimals</em>."</p>



<p>The new description for the game now reads: </p>



<p>"<em>Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land</em>."</p>



<p>A much more generic game description that doesn't reference the Mechanimals that look directly styled after the robotic dinosaurs featured in Horizon.</p>



<p>Will these changes and removals have any significant impact on the lawsuit? Who knows, it's too early to tell which way things will sway, no matter how obvious the case might seem on the outside. Especially when considering details that the lawsuit revealed, like how Tencent apparently went to Sony asking if the two companies could partner on making a Horizon game. Sony declined, according to the lawsuit, and Tencent followed up that encounter with Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>It might look open-and-shut, and like Tencent decided to copy as much as they could from Horizon in order to leverage the similarities to create a new hit title, but copyright suits are rarely open-and-shut, especially ones where two massive companies are going head-to-head. Whichever way it swings, we can be sure that it will set an interesting precedent for the future.</p>
