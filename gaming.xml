            <p>
With Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion now here, officially bringing the ten-year Light and Darkness saga to a close, developer Bungie has turned its attention to the future, sharing more on what's next for its live-service shooter - including a tease of the mysterious Codename: Frontiers, whatever it may be, coming next year.
</p>
<p>
When Bungie revealed The Final Shape last August, it announced 2024 would bring a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-the-final-shape-heads-into-the-travellers-infinite-vast-unknowable-pale-heart">significant shake-up</a> to the way Destiny 2 content is delivered. Instead of four yearly Seasons, it said it would release three "larger, content-packed" Episodes, each featuring standalone stories split into three six-week-long Acts.
</p>
<p>
The first of these, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/dev_insights_episode_echoes">Echoes</a>, launches tomorrow, 11th June, picking up immediately after the events of The Final Shape. It all unfolds on Nessus, where there are ancient secrets to unearth and a mysterious new enemy to encounter. Echoes will then be followed by Revenant later this year (Bungie's previous roadmap said between July and October), and comes with a vampire-hunting theme as players, in the role of a Slayer Baron, take on the Fallen. There's also a new potion crafting system - featuring combat and loot potions - alongside the new story elements, quests, and rewards set to feature in all three Episodes.

<p>
And finally for the announced Episodes, there's Heresy - likely arriving between November and February next year - which promises to be a real blast from the past, taking players back to the Dreadnaught from Destiny's The Taken King expansion. So far, so mostly expected - but it's what comes next that sounds most intriguing.
</p>
<p>
Destiny 2's 2025 seemingly kicks off in earnest with a mysterious something Bungie is so far only referring to as Codename: Frontiers. As to what it is, that's currently unclear, but the fact Bungie didn't just write 'more Episodes' in its announcement has some speculating it might be a new expansion, perhaps getting Destiny's <em>next</em> big story arc properly underway.

<p>
It's unlikely we'll learn more about Codename: Frontiers anytime soon, of course, given Bungie has three Episodes to release before its arrival - so, for now, all eyes are on Echoes, to see if the switch in Destiny 2's content delivery strategy is something worth getting excited about.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-clearly-still-cares-about-game-pass-exclusives-not-so-much.897564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/xbox/24175612/xbox-showcase-2024-game-pass-exclusives-analysis<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="DPJEY7">Last week, I posited that the Xbox showcase on June 9 would be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171899/xbox-showcase-2024-preview-analysis">the most important</a> in the history of Microsoft’s gaming division. If it wasn’t, that could be because this slick prerecorded show couldn’t possibly compete for historical impact with, for example, the garbage fire that was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-reflects-on-what-went-wrong-with-the-/1100-6468802/">2013 Xbox One reveal event</a>, or the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/19/4446060/xbox-one-drm-used-games-online-restrictions-180">bungled E3 show</a> that followed it. It was confident and smooth in its orchestration, impressive in a way that was almost calming after the awkward anticlimax of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173215/summer-game-fest-announcements-trailers-2024">Summer Game Fest</a> two days earlier. But it was still immensely significant: for its indication of the seismic publishing power Microsoft now holds, for the questions it answered about Xbox’s future, and for the questions it didn’t.</p>

<p id="hSOTT6">In fact, the two most telling bits of news emerged outside the boundaries of the show itself. The first was the confirmation, more than a week before the show, that <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166198/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">will be released on Game Pass on day one</a>. The second, which was not mentioned by Microsoft during its showcase but slipped out in a press release alongside it, is that <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> (one of the biggest first-party reveals of the event) <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171213/doom-dark-ages-microsoft-xbox-games-showcase-sequel">is also coming to PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p id="MzwKj6">Between them, these two facts spell out Microsoft’s strategy quite clearly: Game Pass is everything, and Xbox consoles aren’t. Microsoft is doubling down hard on its subscription service, and bringing its new, almost terrifying might as a game publisher to bear on the Game Pass catalog. But the company had little to say about Xbox hardware, and its attitude to console exclusivity for Microsoft-owned games remains ambivalent at best.</p>

<p id="EOk7yu">After the shock release of four former Xbox exclusives on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24063938/microsoft-xbox-exclusivity-playstation-5-nintendo-switch">earlier this year</a>, many Xbox fans were looking to Sunday’s showcase for explicit reassurance that Microsoft was still investing in Xbox consoles by getting its vast army of first-party studios to make exclusive games for them. That reassurance did not come. In fact, Xbox console exclusivity was not mentioned once. The words “coming to Xbox Series X and PC” appeared as much at the end of trailers for games in storied Xbox franchises like Fable and Gears of War as they did for multiplatform releases from third-party publishers like <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. There was no attempt at differentiation on this score.</p>
<p id="mHkIqc"><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond">Reports indicate</a> that Microsoft has “no red line” internally when it comes to which of its games it will consider for release on other platforms, and the wording (or lack of it) used on Sunday shows that the company is keen to keep its options open. It’s striking that Microsoft chose to open the showcase with two heavy hitters that’ll be available on PlayStation: <em>Black Ops 6</em>, which was already slated for PS5 (per <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797265/microsoft-sony-xbox-playstation-call-of-duty-deal">Microsoft’s Call of Duty deal with Sony</a>), and <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, which wasn’t.</p>
<p id="P2K0IV"><em>The Dark Ages</em>’ PS5 release is a clue to how Microsoft intends to handle exclusivity in the short term, at least as far as games from Bethesda, Activision, and Blizzard are concerned. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-briefly-explains-the-decision-to-bring-doom-the-dark-ages-to-playstation-5-ign-live-2024">Speaking to IGN</a> after the showcase aired, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said, “Doom is definitely one of those franchises that has a history of so many platforms. It’s a franchise that I think everyone deserves to play. When I was in a meeting with Marty [Stratton, id Software studio director] a couple years ago, I asked Marty what he wanted to do, and he said he wanted to sell it on all platforms. Simple as that.”</p>
<p id="eei6Az">Spencer’s explanation — as well as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/11/6/7167349/microsoft-owns-minecraft-mojang-acquisition-closes">Microsoft’s handling of <em>Minecraft</em></a> — suggests that Microsoft does not intend to make previously multiplatform game series exclusive. It’s a strong indication that Bethesda’s <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>, for one, will get a PlayStation release. For everything else, it’s an open question. It might seem unthinkable that <em>Gears of War: E-Day </em>or <em>Fable</em> will come out on PS5, but nothing said (or unsaid) on Sunday indicates that that’s off the table.</p>

<p id="Lm9ZnO">As far as Game Pass goes, however, Microsoft could not have been more emphatic. “Play it day one with Game Pass,” boomed the stinger on the end of trailer after trailer after trailer. Of the 30 games, expansions, and updates featured in Sunday’s showcase, 20 will go straight to Game Pass. Of those 20 Game Pass titles, 13 come from Microsoft-owned studios; nine are scheduled to debut in 2024, eight in 2025, and three have no release windows yet. </p>
<p id="5XumSq">Call of Duty, Doom, Gears of War, State of Decay, <em>Perfect Dark</em>, <em>Fable</em>, Indiana Jones, STALKER, Flight Simulator, <em>Avowed</em>... all coming to Game Pass as soon as they’re released. There are blockbuster shooters and role-playing games, strategy and sim games, wistful indies, and, thanks to partnerships with companies like Kepler Interactive and Rebellion, a good helping of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDyqGZy78Ng">AA Eurojank</a> (perhaps the ideal kind of Game Pass game).</p>
<p id="tvKdIy">In a way, it’s more illustrative to look at what from the showcase <em>won’t</em> be coming to Game Pass. Those 10 titles include big third-party franchises like Metal Gear Solid and Assassin’s Creed; a handful of smaller third-party games; and expansions for <em>Starfield</em>, <em>Diablo 4</em>, <em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, and <em>World of Warcraft</em>. Selling DLC for Game Pass-included titles like <em>Starfield</em>, <em>Diablo 4</em>, and <em>TES Online</em> is a big part of the Game Pass business model, so you could still consider those titles under the Game Pass umbrella. (<em>World of Warcraft</em> is the outlier here as the only Microsoft-owned game featured that isn’t on Game Pass at all — and indeed, the only one not available on Xbox consoles.)</p>
<p id="it2ZDg">If Microsoft has doubts about the commercial viability of console-exclusive releases in the long term, it certainly doesn’t seem to have those doubts about Game Pass. With subscriber numbers seeming to have plateaued (according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/23570040/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscriber-numbers-34-million">Microsoft’s rarely released figures</a>), and with the presumed considerable loss of revenue resulting from rolling a guaranteed seller like <em>Black Ops 6</em> into a subscription service, many were wondering if Microsoft’s “Netflix for games” approach made economic sense. It’s possible that this debate has been ongoing in Microsoft until recently: <em>Black Ops 6</em> developer Treyarch told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-focuses-on-impressive-games">Game File’s Stephen Totilo</a> “it wasn’t that long ago” that the studio was informed that the game would launch on Game Pass. But taken as a whole, the showcase was a resounding vote of confidence in the service, and an indication that it will go on to provide great value to subscribers through 2025 and beyond. </p>

<p id="BO8i0m">After its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is now the third-biggest gaming company in the world by revenue — and arguably the biggest in terms of intellectual property and publishing might. Sunday’s showcase demonstrated quite convincingly how it intends to fill those massive boots: dozens of solid-looking games in famous, fan-favorite franchises, stretching far into the future. Quality <em>and</em> quantity. The surprise inclusion of a few long-gestating titles that had reportedly been stuck in development hell, like <em>Perfect Dark</em> and <em>State of Decay 3</em>, seemed like a pointed message that Microsoft can be trusted to keep all these projects on track, despite its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/29/11537392/lionhead-studios-closed">spotty record in studio management</a>.</p>
<p id="gNQRgS">But Xbox hardware only got the briefest mention, in the form of three new console configurations and a promise that “we’re hard at work on the next generation.” The rumored <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108660/xbox-handheld-console-phil-spencer-interview">handheld announcement</a> did not materialize. And exclusivity remains a glaring open question. </p>
<p id="ZjBQSc">Regarding Microsoft’s position in the broader game industry, it seems we have our answer: It’s now a publisher first, a subscription platform second, and a console hardware platform a distant third. </p>

That show, along with a wealth of previews and interviews that have sprung up in the past few days, have given us a pretty clear picture of all the massive changes and returning features that <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will bring to <em>Call of Duty </em>later this year. Here’s a rundown of some of the biggest details we learned about the upcoming shooter:</p><h2 id="h33469"><a id=""></a><strong>The kids are calling it omnimovement </strong></h2><p>Omnimovement is perhaps the biggest addition <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is bringing to the franchise. As part of Treyarch’s push to turn players into full-on action movie heroes, the studio is pushing its animations and radically changing how movement works in <em>Call of Duty</em>. For example, omnimovement will seamlessly grant players a full 360 degrees of movement at any time. That means that they will be able to slide and dive in any direction they want, in a way that’s somewhat reminiscent of <em>Max Payne</em>, though more versatile. Players will be able to do things such as dive forward, turn around in midair and shoot behind them without a labored animation. During the Direct, a player could be seen turning to their side while diving through the air to line up a shot, which could not be done before.</p><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196909,195840" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>In <em>Black Ops 6</em>, players will also be able to sprint in any direction, which is a radical change from how movement has worked in the franchise before. In other words, you can face forward while sprinting left, right, or backwards, whereas previously you could only sprint in the direction that you were facing. According to Treyarch, this is inspired by the actual movement of operators and soldiers, and the studio felt it had to be included once that was discovered.</p><p>Treyarch also looked outside of the realm of shooters for inspiration, and came away from that with a suite of radical new accessibility features that the team’s calling Intelligent Movement. According to Matt Scronce, an associate director at Treyarch featured in the Direct, the motivation behind the system was the team wanting “all players to focus on what they want to do and not how to do it.” To that end, there are three options in menus (sprint assist, mantle assist, and crouch assist) that will reduce the number of inputs needed for the associated actions. </p><p>All of these innovations in <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s movement system will be available across every mode in the game, including multiplayer and Zombies.</p><h2 id="h33470"><a id=""></a><strong>We’re taking back the 90s</strong></h2><p>It has been confirmed that <em>Black Ops 6</em> single-player campaign (which will, unfortunately, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-single-player-internet-1851529371&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-single-player-internet-1851529371">need a constant internet connection</a></span>) will take place in the 90s against the backdrop of the Gulf War and increasing lack of trust in the government. Frank Woods, the tortured legacy character that the <em>Black Ops</em> subseries absolutely refuses to let die, will be back in <em>Black Ops 6 </em>along with a new cast of characters who will be compromised after a mission gone wrong, which prompts them to go rogue and unravel a conspiracy entirely on their own.</p><p>Speaking of conspiracy theories…</p><h2 id="h33471"><a id=""></a><strong>No, there will not be a 9/11 mission</strong></h2><p>As reported by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-not-depict-911-treyarch-confirms/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-not-depict-911-treyarch-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span>, Treyarch shot down the widespread speculation about <em>Black Ops 6 </em>featuring a playable mission taking place during the events of 9/11 earlier this week. Though the <em>Call of Duty </em>franchise has garnered shock and criticism in the past for controversial levels and retellings of certain historical events, it seems like <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will be steering clear of the September 11 attacks, though some believe that they will be alluded to in the game in other ways.</p><p>Given the nature of the <em>Black Ops </em>series’ conspiracy-theory-driven stories, you can understand why players and fans might’ve suspected 9/11 would figure into the game. There’s no shortage of conspiracy theories around the events of that day—”jet fuel can’t melt steel beams” originated not as a meme or a joke but an actual belief some voiced in earnest—and I suspect some folks will never really let it go.</p><h2 id="h33472"><a id=""></a><strong>Prestige is back</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="e250a8bfb71e2010b832636e884acf63" data-recommend-id="image://e250a8bfb71e2010b832636e884acf63" data-format="jpg" data-width="2592" data-height="1458" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a character in uniform in Black Ops 6.

Their get up also consists of a gas mask." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Call of Duty </em>abandoned its traditional progression systems a while ago, but <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is bringing them back, including the prestige system. Players will be able to rise through the ranks until they eventually reach the max level, at which point they can stay there or reset their progress and embark on the path to prestige. There will be ten prestige ranks to climb through, making for a lengthy progression path, and once players reach the final level of the tenth prestige, they will unlock another 1000 ranks of master prestige to ascend. The most diehard multiplayer fans of <em>Call of Duty </em>will have a lot of levels to burn through when <em>Black Ops 6 </em>releases.<br></p><p>There will be a full multiplayer reveal at <em>Call of Duty </em>Next on August 28, 2024.</p><h2 id="h33473"><a id=""></a><strong>Fidelity and detail</strong></h2><p>Treyarch is broadly upping the fidelity of the series with <em>Black Ops 6</em>, and this includes features such as updated damage models. Previously, character models would take and react to damage across four distinct regions of the body, but <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is upping that number to <em>nine </em>regions now, all with their own bespoke damage and death animations based on the region and the direction from which the damage is being taken.</p><p>Players will also dynamically alter the position of their weapons automatically as they are rounding corners. Guns will be pointed in the direction that you are already headed in, making it easier and more seamless for players to acquire their targets without having to manually shift themselves.</p><h2 id="h33474"><a id=""></a><strong>Zombies is going back to the basics</strong></h2><p>Treyarch’s beloved cooperative Zombies mode has been a hotbed for experiments over the years, but <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is bringing things back down to earth. It’s picking back up on the Dark Aether storyline that has driven the mode for the last several installments, and the action will once again be round-based. Zombies in <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will launch with two maps, Liberty Falls and Terminus, and will have a slew of returning mechanics, though the team is hesitant to share too much too early. </p><p>According to an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-returning-round-based-confirmed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-returning-round-based-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with <em>Gamesradar+</em></a></span>, Liberty Falls will be set in a small Appalachian town and is leaning into the Americana feel that the name conjures with “abandoned bowling alleys, ‘90s diners, and comic book shops.” Meanwhile, Terminus will take place on a “deep and complex map” set on a prison island, and the two maps will be linked by a storyline occurring simultaneously across both settings.<br></p><p>In the past, the Zombies mode had ditched its specific set of characters for generic operators but <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will be reversing course on this. One of the things I loved most about the traditional Zombies experience of my youth was the rich characters and how distinct the mode felt compared to everything else in the <em>Call of Duty </em>package, and it seems like <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is trying to recapture some of this feeling. I’m actually excited to hear as much.</p><p>There will be more information around the full multiplayer reveal taking place at Call of Duty Next.</p><h2 id="h33475"><a id=""></a><strong>Emphasis on choice and alternative gameplay decisions</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="2dd619bfb9a3286424451eb5efac3e03" data-recommend-id="image://2dd619bfb9a3286424451eb5efac3e03" data-format="jpg" data-width="2592" data-height="1458" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of characters in Black Ops brandishing rifles, presumably to engage an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of characters in Black Ops brandishing rifles, presumably to engage an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Treyarch / Raven Software / Activision</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2dd619bfb9a3286424451eb5efac3e03" data-recommend-id="image://2dd619bfb9a3286424451eb5efac3e03" data-format="jpg" data-width="2592" data-height="1458" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of characters in Black Ops brandishing rifles, presumably to engage an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As has become a bit customary of the <em>Black Ops </em>subseries, the latest installment is once again emphasizing choice in its gameplay scenarios. As <em>Call of Duty </em>continues to attempt to buck linearity, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is introducing some open-ended levels (as we last saw in the widely panned <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>campaign) as well as light role-playing aspects. Players will be able to converse and barter with characters throughout the campaign in order to unlock alternative routes through missions. There will also be more traditional choices, such as going in guns blazing or quietly.</p><h2 id="h33476"><a id=""></a><strong>Customizable HUD</strong></h2><p>For the first time in the history of the <em>Call of Duty </em>franchise, the HUD will be completely customizable. The minimap can be placed in different locations on the screen and you can even put your ammo counters in the middle in case you don’t want to look away from your targets. Players have long wanted ways to customize HUDs to best compliment their own playstyles or stream setups, and <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is taking a major step in the right direction with this move.</p><h2 id="h33477"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Black Ops 6 </em>will be a “fresh start for everyone”</strong></h2><p>Trying to keep track of which <em>Call of Duty</em> games (across the mainline entries every year as well as the constant updates to Warzone) are connected and have crossover feels next to impossible. For example, weapon and operator skins were carried over from <em>Modern Warfare 2 </em>to <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> the last few years, but none of that will be making the jump to <em>Black Ops 6</em>, according to an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-and-3-content-does-not-carry-forward-into-black-ops-6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-and-3-content-does-not-carry-forward-into-black-ops-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with IGN</a></span>. The team doesn’t want there to be confusion that could “break that immersion in that narrative we want,” and will instead focus on bringing new, unique skins tied to the <em>Black Ops </em>universe into the game post-launch.</p><hr><p><em>Black Ops 6 </em>is predictably massive, and there’s still more to talk about, especially how it will factor into <em>Warzone </em>when it launches later this year, and how Treyarch and Raven Software are innovating the multiplayer experience. So far though, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is making a decent first impression, and might just get me back into the fold.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For starters, Mos Eisley and the surrounding area around the Tatooine port look big.

Nix also seems to have a ping ability that lets you mark enemies through walls, sort of like Eagle Vision in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.</p><p>Later, she is spotted and fights her way out.

                <p>GameStop has posted what appears to be the release date for the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-589435">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. The remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 doesn't have an official release date at the moment, but a recent post from GameStop implies that the game will be out on November 17.</p><p>In a now deleted post on X (formerly Twitter), the video game retailer wrote, "Prepare to slay in Metal Gear Solid [Delta]: Snake Eater. Where stealth &amp; survival meet savagery! Coming 11.17." That release date of November 17 hasn't been posted anywhere else and GameStop's own website has a placeholder date of December 31, 2025, listed as the game's release. The post was up for over an hour before being deleted.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4316702-mgstweet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316702" data-ratio="0.85426356589147" data-width="645" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4316702-mgstweet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316702"></a><figcaption>GameStop has since deleted the post.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4316702-mgstweet.jpg"></figure><p>It's not immediately clear if this is an unintentional leak or if the date in the post is a mistake. It's important to point out that November 17, 2004 was the release date of the original Metal Gear Solid 3, so either the date is an homage to the original, or someone accidentally pulled the old date for the post. November 17 falls on a Sunday this year, which would be abnormal for a video game release, as they typically release on Tuesday or Friday.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater did make an appearance at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-demos-just-how-much-anguish-youll-see-on-snakes-face-this-time/1100-6524070/">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on Sunday, where it got a new gameplay trailer, but no date was given at the event. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-preorders-now-live/1100-6524133/">Preorders for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, both the normal version and the collector's edition, also went live recently.</p>

Max served as the protagonist of the original Life is Strange, and this time she's trying to (literally) turn back time and stop the death of one of her friends. It looks to be another impressive narrative-driven game from Deck Nine, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6885NB9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders</a> are now open ahead of its October 29 release.</p><p>Three different versions are up for grabs, with two offering tons of in-game goodies.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24175632/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-delta-konami-future-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="0vIj53"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23351764/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-release-date-trailer-announcement">Konami’s remake of <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em></a> sounds like it will be the beginning of a series of new projects in the franchise created by a “new team,” according to comments from producer Noriaki Okamura.</p>
<p id="Re5ZqS">In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p-dbSJ2MK8">new video released Monday for <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></a>, the name of Konami’s upcoming <em>MGS 3</em> remake, Okamura tells longtime Snake voice actor David Hayter that his team, which includes “plenty of people on the team who were part of the original games,” has “been entrusted with the future of Metal Gear.”</p>
<p id="N2W6gV">“We want the players to be able to judge for themselves whether this new team is right for the job of keeping Metal Gear going,” Okamura said, referring to the team’s work on <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> and the recently released <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23939010/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-review-scripts-lore"><em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection</em></a> compilation. </p>
<p id="lBpSnW">In his discussion with Hayter, Okamura opaquely addressed the departure of former Metal Gear creatives, like Hideo Kojima and Yoji Shinkawa. While he does not explicitly name them, he says, “Everyone who is no longer working on Metal Gear is pursuing their own path now, and that’s going to remain the case for these titles.” That’s a pretty solid indicator that Konami plans on (re)making more Metal Gear without the involvement of its original creator.</p>
<div id="LIzvbc"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1p-dbSJ2MK8?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="KunoEP">Okamura previously worked with Kojima and team on games like <em>Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/18/5519578/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-review"><em>Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes</em></a>. He was also a producer on the poorly received 2018 game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/1/17067982/metal-gear-survive-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>Metal Gear Survive</em></a>, the only original Metal Gear project released after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/12/15/10220372/hideo-kojima-new-studio-leaves-konami">Hideo Kojima left Konami</a>. </p>
<p id="2gBfKX">The <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em> remake could represent a fresh start for the franchise at a post-Kojima Konami. The 2024 game was selected to be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23931980/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-snake-eater-unreal-engine-5-konami">lavishly remade in Unreal Engine 5</a> due to its place in the overall Metal Gear timeline, <a href="https://jp.ign.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/68128/news/mgs3metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-konami">Konami told IGN last year</a>; <em>Snake Eater</em> is an origin story for Naked Snake/Big Boss, and the first game chronologically in the franchise. In other words, it’s a smart place to start to bring in new fans who may not be well-versed in the MGS series’ era-jumping sequels.</p>
<p id="ABtSGT">If <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> is a success, and Konami does continue to remake games, <em>Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops</em> and <em>Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</em> would be next in line chronologically. Those two early Cold War-era follow-ups to <em>Snake Eater</em> also star Big Boss — not Solid Snake — and would be able to build on the foundation of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>, using characters and assets from <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>. </p>
<p id="vJWFId">When future Metal Gear remakes will come to pass is still unknown, as is the release date <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24025475/silent-hill-2-remake-metal-gear-solid-3-release-dates">remake was originally pitched as a 2024 release</a>, but Konami hasn’t said anything this past week about <em>Delta</em> arriving this year, even as it sets pre-orders live. A 2025 release is starting to look more likely.</p>
<p id="qCFVN7">For now, Metal Gear fans will have to pass the time poring over new gameplay details released on Sunday in a new trailer for <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> at the Xbox Games Showcase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-just-had-its-best-showcase-ever-and-at-the-perfect-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Amid multiple <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/state-of-decay-3-trailer-to-debut-at-xbox-showcase-according-to-leak"><u>leaks</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-showcase-rumors-gears-of-war-and-doom-look-likely-with-one-potentially-on-ps5"><u>rumors</u></a>, we had a decent idea of what was going to be at this year’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced"><u>Xbox Games Showcase</u></a> with seemingly plenty to get excited about. But when the Showcase finally aired, Microsoft did the near-impossible for any company in a fickle social media-fueled age: they exceeded expectations and drew almost universal acclaim. Eighty-four percent of the 10,000+ voters in <a href="https://x.com/DMC_Ryan/status/1799887129058938940" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>my X poll</u></a> graded it an ‘A’ on the academic scale. Ninety-five percent gave it an ‘A’ or ‘B’. </p><p>A home run like this would be welcome at any time, but it’s an especially fortuitous one now for both Xbox fans and, no doubt, Xbox employees alike. Confidence had been shaken in recent months, with dedicated fans rankled by Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-hi-fi-rush-confirmed-for-ps5-release-date-announced"><u>decision</u></a> to bring some previously exclusive games to other platforms. Worse, Microsoft joined the tragically long list of gaming and tech companies to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>lay off thousands of employees</u></a> early in the year and, more recently, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda"><u>shut down four development studios</u></a> it acquired as part of a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-bethesda-zenimax-aquisition"><u>$7.5 billion deal</u></a> just four years ago. Two of those were household names in core-gaming circles: Arkane Austin, who, their recent Redfall <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/redfall-review"><u>misfire</u></a> aside, had an incredibly impressive track record; and the one that really stuck in the community’s craw, Tango Gameworks. They were not only Xbox’s lone Japanese developer, but they’d had an unquestionably good run, highlighted by their most recent and arguably <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review"><u>best</u></a> game, Hi-Fi Rush. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While Xbox’s best showcase ever can’t erase the human impact on the laid-off developers nor reignite the creative embers that have been snuffed out at the shut-down studios, it is the best way for fans who remain invested in the Xbox ecosystem to move forward with confidence and excitement for the future of the platform. And my goodness did that top-to-bottom brilliant showcase give me confidence and excitement for Xbox.</p><p>Call of Duty debuted on Xbox’s stage for the first time since the Xbox 360 era, with Black Ops 6 already looking like it could be one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-website-says-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-weighs-in-at-an-eye-watering-30985-gb"><u>biggest</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-first-campaign-and-zombies-details-first-multiplayer-impressions"><u>best</u></a> releases for the series in a half-decade – since Infinity Ward’s excellent Modern Warfare reboot in 2019. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer could barely contain his excitement on stage in announcing Doom: The Dark Ages, a bold, more melee combat-intensive prequel in id Software’s brilliantly revived and historically iconic first-person shooter franchise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And speaking of prequels, Xbox President Sarah Bond introduced the “one more thing” game for this Showcase: the long-anticipated new entry in the Gears series, which itself was not a surprise. What shocked everyone, though – which the trailer slowly made more apparent – was that we wouldn’t be picking up Kait’s story in Gears 6, but instead we’ll be going back to Emergence Day and the formation of Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago’s Delta Squad in a Gears of War prequel – complete with a most-welcome (by me, at least) restoration of the “of War” part of the name. </p><p>But the 2024 Xbox Games Showcase didn’t just start big with Black Ops 6 and Doom: The Dark Ages and end big with Gears of War: E-Day – it kept cooking for almost the entire runtime. A new gameplay trailer for Fable floored me, as not only was I not expecting to see any more of it after getting our first tiny glimpse at gameplay at last year’s Showcase, but we got to see quite a bit of Playground’s gorgeous new rendition of Albion. The cherry on top was Microsoft committing to a 2025 release window, which means we can already pencil in Doom: The Dark Ages and Fable for next year – my gut says the former will drop in the Spring, and the latter in the Fall. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Oh, but South of Midnight belongs on that 2025 list too! We got a proper gameplay trailer for Compulsion’s first game since joining the Xbox family after it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-new-game-from-we-happy-few-developer-unveiled-at-xbox-showcase"><u>announced</u></a> with a cinematic piece last year, and the art style is incredibly beautiful and wholly unique. </p><p>Meanwhile, it didn’t get a release year attached to it (meaning, assume 2026 for now), but the game that stole the fantastic show for me was Perfect Dark. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-perfect-dark-announced-from-the-initiative"><u>long-gestating</u></a> reboot of the beloved Nintendo 64 classic (and decently liked Xbox 360 launch title) has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-years-away"><u>reportedly</u></a> endured a <a href="https://in.ign.com/perfect-dark-next-gen/206374/news/xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot-is-reportedly-in-a-rough-state-since-years-according-to-industry-insider" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>troubled development</u></a>, but the co-developers at The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics blew me away by showing off a gameplay-packed trailer that showed off gadgets, first-person shooting, and parkour, leaving me optimistic that we might have a slick combination of Mirror’s Edge, Deus Ex, and the original Perfect Dark on our hands. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even the inevitable mid-show lull that every showcase like this goes through yielded compelling reveals: the ‘90s-set adventure Mixtape feels like it was made for me specifically, Metal Gear Solid: Delta appears to be both a gorgeous and incredibly faithful remake of the classic Metal Gear Solid 3, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle only “disappointed” me with an otherwise A+ story trailer because we didn’t get a more specific release date than “2024.” But it does reaffirm that within six months I’ll be playing the next effort from MachineGames, a studio that has never missed.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The game that stole the fantastic show for me was Perfect Dark.</p></div><p>In fact, Xbox’s 2024 Games Showcase was so spectacular and packed with huge first-party games that I didn’t even notice that two of their biggest pillars were missing: Halo and Forza. Granted, I wasn’t expecting anything from Halo, as we’re still only 2.5 years past Halo Infinite’s release. But Forza? Surely a new Forza Horizon – arguably Xbox’s most <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/25/forza-horizon-4-review"><u>consistently</u></a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-review"><u>brilliant</u></a> franchise – is in the works! If you’re Microsoft, you know you’ve had a heck of a showcase when Halo and Forza can stay home and nobody seems to mind.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I suppose there was one rumored thing that ended up not being included: an Xbox handheld. Fortunately, I got a chance to ask Phil Spencer about that directly afterwards, and I’d say he came as close as he could to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-xbox-handheld-rumors-being-able-to-play-games-locally-is-really-important-ign-live-2024"><u>confirming its existence</u></a> without formally announcing it.</p><p>If this stellar showcase reaffirmed anything for both Microsoft and Xbox fans alike, it’s that a powerful console is great, and Xbox Game Pass offers a nice value option, but a consistent diet of top-shelf games is what matters more than anything else. More of this please, Microsoft.</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

On the other hand, it <em>would</em> be fitting, considering it would mark exactly 20 years after the original Metal Gear Solid 3 released. It's in line, too, with a previously announced release window, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-seemingly-confirmed-for-2024-release-in-playstation-trailer">PlayStation had it listed as a 2024 game</a> in a trailer at the beginning of this year. </p><p>IGN has reached out to Konami for comment.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta was one of the many games to get a spotlight <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase">at yesterday's Xbox Showcase</a> but, much to the disappointment of fans, a release date was not revealed with the new trailer then. We first learned about Metal Gear Solid Delta <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-announced-playstation-showcase">in May 2023</a>.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is said to be a faithful remake of MGS3, so much so that Konami isn't <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-reportedly-isnt-recording-new-voice-acting-for-metal-gear-solid-3-remake">even planning on recording new voice lines for it</a>. Despite that, the Delta symbol in the name of the remake (stylized as Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater) is meant to highlight "'change' or 'difference' without changing structure," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-explains-why-theres-a-symbol-in-metal-gear-solid-3-remake">Konami previously explained</a>. </p><p>For more, check out everything that was announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">at yesterday's Xbox Showcase</a>. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p>Xbox's 2024 Showcase came and went without any mention of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite</a> or Halo in general, but the official <a href="https://x.com/Halo/status/1800243795503546868" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Halo X account</a> did share a month-old Halo Infinite trailer a day later.</p><p dir="ltr">This year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/" data-ref-id="2900-5460">Xbox Showcase</a>, the first since Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, was without a doubt one to remember, featuring new installments from heavy-hitting franchises like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/" data-ref-id="1100-6524072">Call of Duty</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-coming-2025/1100-6524073/" data-ref-id="1100-6524073">Doom</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-trailer-shows-first-gameplay-coming-2025/1100-6524087/" data-ref-id="1100-6524087">Fable</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-e-day-a-new-gears-of-war-prequel-revealed/1100-6524074/" data-ref-id="1100-6524074">Gears of War</a>, and the reboot of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-gets-first-gameplay-trailer/1100-6524084/" data-ref-id="1100-6524084">Perfect Dark</a>. What wasn't shown or mentioned was Halo, the franchise whose lead character, the Master Chief, has long served as a mascot for the Xbox brand and, until Microsoft's acquisition of Call of Duty, has arguably always been its most recognizable game franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">That made Halo's absence during the showcase even more noticeable. Not even Halo Infinite was mentioned, further solidifying the writing on the wall that the 2021 title, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-dev-shifting-to-unreal-engine-no-halo-infinite-story-content-planned-report/1100-6511013/" data-ref-id="1100-6511013">not receiving story DLC</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-is-moving-away-from-seasons-doubling-down-on-free-operations-instead/1100-6520471/" data-ref-id="1100-6520471">future multiplayer seasons</a>, is reaching the end of its life. Developer 343 Industries has said nearly as much, having already publicly said the studio is changing priorities and looking to ramp up development on future Halo projects.</p><p dir="ltr">Adding to the oddness surrounding Halo's absence was the fact that the official Halo X account shared what at first glance seemed like a new trailer for Halo Infinite, not on the day of the showcase, but a day later at the same time as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ubisoft-forward-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5462/" data-ref-id="2900-5462">Ubisoft Forward</a> press conference was taking place. Even stranger was that the trailer wasn't in fact new, but a month-old trailer that had already been posted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz0PdDiZR8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, highlighting all the various features, improvements, and community-made Forge creations that had come to Halo Infinite in recent months. Many of the replies to the Halo account's post asked why the trailer wasn't part of the showcase, while others wished there was more to look forward to in regards to the franchise's future.</p><p dir="ltr">If there is a silver-lining, it's that there are at least some rumors of future Halo projects. Halo support studio Certain Affinity was long said to have been working on a Halo spin-off, though that has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-halo-battle-royale-project-seemingly-canceled/1100-6520335/" data-ref-id="1100-6520335">reportedly been canceled</a>. A recent report from The Verge stated a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-halo-game-is-reportedly-being-considered-for-ps5/1100-6523999/" data-ref-id="1100-6523999">remake of Halo: Combat Evolved is also in the works</a>, but that it's still in early development and could potentially release on PlayStation 5 as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-comments-on-xbox-games-coming-to-playstation/1100-6522971/" data-ref-id="1100-6522971">Xbox's new multiplatform strategy</a>, in what would be a strange fate for the series that was once held as Xbox's most important console exclusive. What the future holds for Master Chief and the Halo franchise is still unclear, but what is clear is that fans are ready to learn what's next, sooner rather than later.</p>

The series’ first foray into first-person arrives first on July 2, while the RE2 port is "currently in development."</p>

<p>Both entries will be playable on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. Both games will feature enhanced controls and a new Auto Fire feature, a more approachable option that causes guns to automatically fire when aimed at enemies. RE7 will also include the Not A Hero story DLC starring Chris Redfield. You can also purchase the Gold Edition that includes additional DLC such as the End of Zoe, Vol. 1 and 2. of Banned Footage, the Madhouse difficulty mode, and more.&nbsp;At launch, players can try a slice of each game via a free download before making a purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard launched in 2017 and introduced fans to Ethan Winters, who travels to a terrifying house in the backcountry in search of his missing wife. The game kicks off the current storylines for the mainline series, which continued in Resident Evil Village. Speaking of Village, that game, along with the Resident Evil, were<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/25/resident-evil-4-remake-re-village-and-assassins-creed-mirage-announced-for-iphone"> ported to Apple platorms last year</a>.

            <p>It’s been almost a decade since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rebel-galaxy">Rebel Galaxy</a> ably picked up the sci-fi trading and exploration mantle handed down by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/freelancer">Freelancer</a>, but it looks like a successor to the serene galaxy-venturing vibes of both is finally upon us. Star Trucker is exactly what it sounds like, transplanting the chill A-to-Z courier journeys of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator">Euro Truck Simulator</a> to the interplanetary, uh, roads of space. It’s out this September, and it looks wonderful.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Unlike Rebel Galaxy and Freelancer, Star Trucker keeps its galaxy nice and peaceful, doing away with any threat of combat in favour of focusing on the hauling of your cargo to your destination.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean there won’t be the chance of some drama, mind - the burning heat and light of nearby suns mean you might need to drop the cab’s windscreen shield, while taking too much damage from collisions and the harsh conditions of space means you’ll have to strap on a spacesuit and conduct some repairs on a spacewalk or risk needing a tow across the cosmos. As well as delivering your legit cargo to earn cash, unlock new jobs and upgrade your rig, you’ll also have the option to stop off and sell smaller goods - and even flog contraband - for some bonus money.</p>

<p>For the most part, though, it looks to be a game to sit back and relax to, plotting your route before turning on the radio and firing up your rocket-powered lorry. The radio will infuse plenty of that good ol’ Americana feel into your deep-space trucking with a choice of genres that’d feel right at home on a Top Gear driving music compilation - “starburst blues, galactic rock and asteroid-infused americana” - as well as the ability to chat with fellow space truckers (all fully voiced) for gossip, request docking to a station or issue an emergency SOS if you need it.</p>
<p>Alice B (RPS in Peace) seemed impressed by Star Trucker’s bonafide simulation credentials <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/egx-highlights-8-great-games-from-the-rezzed-zone-you-need-to-play">when she checked it out at EGX last year</a>, along with the fact you get a glove compartment and a call sign for the CB radio.</p>
<p>Star Trucker <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2380050/Star_Trucker/">already has a demo on Steam</a> you can go and try yourself if you’re curious, ahead of its newly-revealed release date on September 3rd. It’ll also hit Game Pass on day one, so you’ll be able to give the full thing a go for free then too.</p>

  <p id="6LHmIN"><strong>Wondrous Tails</strong> (commonly abbreviated as <strong>WT</strong>) is one of the most important weeklies in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a>, giving you rewards for doing duties and helping you clear new content. It’s kind of like bingo and you’ll get more rewards for getting more lines in a row.</p>
<p id="4ktFkU">Below we detail how Wondrous Tails works in <em>FFXIV</em>, how to unlock Wondrous Tails, the rewards you can get, and how to get three lines.</p>
<hr id="EhJms6">

<p id="fT2Qk0">Every week, Khloe Aliapoh, a young Miqo’te in Idyllshire, will give you a book to fill out. In exchange for tales of your triumph, she will give you <strong>stickers</strong>. Line up four stickers in a row on the four-by-four grid and you’ll get a special prize. You can get nine stickers total, so if you get more lines, you’ll get bigger prizes.</p>
<p id="zWsrZZ">The Wondrous Tails book is a <strong>key item</strong>, and you can use the item to open the book. You can earn stickers by completing the duties displayed on the left side of the book and you can see the stickers you have on the right side.</p>
<p id="ZRampO">For every assigned duty you complete, Khloe will give you a <strong>sticker in a random spot on the grid</strong>. Ideally, you want at least one line before the book expires during <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24118981/reset-daily-weekly-times-server-time">weekly reset</a> (it says when the book goes bad on the top left), to get some good rewards.</p>

<p id="WwTI5W">If you are in a party with anyone clearing any content for the first time, you’ll get a “<strong>Second Chance</strong>,” as displayed below the grid of duties. For example, you’ll get a second chance if you queue in Trials Roulette and get a new player completing “The Striking Tree” for the first time, even if it’s not on your list of Wondrous Tails duties for that week.</p>
<p id="plfAEh">You can use Second Chances to “<strong>retry</strong>,” marking a cleared duty as uncleared (making it so you can earn another sticker from completing that same duty) and moving the clear to a different duty. You can also use two Second Chances to “<strong>shuffle</strong>,” <strong>rerolling where your stickers are on your grid</strong>. This is super important if you’re going for a specific amount of lines.</p>
<p id="MIwp71">Once you have nine stickers in your book, return it to Khloe to get your rewards. If your book expires before you do this (even if it’s complete), you will not be able to claim any rewards.</p>
<hr id="OyczY7">
<h2 id="D4VWeA"><strong>How to unlock Wondrous Tails in FFXIV</strong></h2>
<p id="sT0avz">To unlock Wondrous Tails, you need to complete the level 60 quest “<a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/1e9e056a547/">Keeping Up with the Aliapohs</a>” (lol). You can pick this quest up from the <strong>“Unctuous Adventurer” NPC in Idyllshire</strong>.</p>
<p id="dHXxGP">The NPC will have the blue quest marker with the plus sign above their head, so you should be able to find them on your map.</p>
<hr id="h4TihC">
<h2 id="lyZpjn"><strong>Wondrous Tails rewards</strong></h2>
<p id="01KKbU">Khloe will offer the same rewards for lines, though the type of Tomestones rewarded vary depending on the patch. There are some exceptions, as some rewards will change to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24125345/tomestones-poetics-what-to-spend-cap">Poetics</a> if a new patch that changes tomestones is about to come out. You’ll also only get certain Tomestones if you have at least one job at max level. You will have to pick one reward from the following, depending on how many lines you got:</p>
<ul>
<li id="heOQ7G">
<strong>9 Seals</strong>: 500 Allagan Tomestones of Poetics, an Allagan Platinum Piece, or a treasure map from the current expansion</li>
<li id="znBO6p">
<strong>1 line</strong>: 1 MGP Gold Card (worth 30,000 MGP, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24067651/gold-saucer-unlock-side-quest-location-manderville-mgp">Gold Saucer</a> currency), 1 Khloe’s Bronze Certificate of Commendation, or 300 high-value tomes</li>
<li id="LYBgAf">
<strong>2 lines</strong>: 2 MGP Gold Cards, 1 Khloe’s Silver Certificate of Commendation, or 1,000 lower-value tomes</li>
<li id="uYDUS8">
<strong>3 lines</strong>: 20 MGP Gold Cards, 3 Khloe’s Silver Certificate of Commendation, or 1 Khloe’s Gold Certificate of Commendation</li>
</ul>
<p id="lVhQLt">If your book is complete with nine seals, you’ll also get <strong>50% of a level’s worth of EXP on whatever job you turn the book in with</strong>. That said, you should make sure to turn in the book on a job that isn’t maxed to make the most of the rewards.</p>

<p id="bdmyZr">Each of Khloe’s certificates have their own item exchange when you talk to Khloe. The rewards for each type are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="uQWknh">
<strong>Bronze Certificates</strong>: Clusters for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24124503/materia-location-how-to-get-meld-overmeld-pentameld">materia</a>, minions, and magicked prisms</li>
<li id="RL1LuP">
<strong>Silver Certificates</strong>: Glamour accessories, older ornate armor, clusters for materia, minions, and a framer’s kit</li>
<li id="dmXY2I">
<strong>Gold Certificates</strong>: Sabotender de la Luna Whistle, Magicked Children’s Bed, Wondrous Lanner Whistle, Troll Horn, Calydontis Horn, Incitatus Whistle, clusters for materia, and ornate armor</li>
</ul>
<p id="w5dmpZ">Keep in mind that almost everything that Khloe will trade you can be bought from the marketboard, though at a high price. (The mounts you get from the gold certificates can sell for nearly 10 million gil, depending on your server!)</p>

<p id="eT9PJ7">That said, you should keep shuffling your stickers until you get your stickers lining up into this shape. After you have your seven stickers lined up in one of these orientations, you’ll just need to pick a god and pray that your remaining two seals slot into where they’re supposed to go.</p>
<p id="3bMBjY">To make the most of your duties, Second Changes, and stickers, you should do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li id="86aIKo">Do as many of the duties as you can <strong>until you have seven stickers</strong>.

You can also check party finder for people looking for unsynced first-time clears of raids or trials.</li>
</ul>
<p id="MTZFgS">The rest is all just luck. There are tons of players who have been completing Wondrous Tails for years and haven’t gotten three lines, so don’t get discouraged. You can always shell out 10 million gil for that elusive mount (or grind out Faux Hollows, as previously mentioned).</p>

Here’s what we learned.</p><h2 id="h34890"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em> goes back to the source</strong></h2><p>Searcy tells us that The Coalition continued to work on <em>Gears 5</em> for well over a year after its 2019 launch, and that shaped their decision to pivot to <em>E-Day</em>. ‘When we finished all that stuff we were actually pretty far into the [covid] pandemic. So, a lot of people at the studio were saying we’re just gonna take a beat and reflect.” The natural progression might seem to be toward <em>Gears 6</em> (especially considering the cliffhanger at the end of <em>5</em>). But, the team instead found inspiration in an iconic, but relatively unmined, aspect of <em>Gears </em>lore: Emergence Day, or E-Day, when the bad-guy Locusts first emerged from underground on the planet Sera.</p><p>“We wanted to make something that really went to the heart of what people have in their heads when they play <em>Gears</em>,” Faucette said. “We spent a lot of time listening to how fans talk about <em>Gears</em>.” The Coalition settled on four main pillars: the brutality inherent in this universe, the melancholic vibes (exemplified in the marketing both then and now, which loves to needle drop somber versions of  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18YvjD9oH38&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18YvjD9oH38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Mad World”</a></span>), the brotherhood shared by the members of the COG army, and big, bold action sequences.</p><p>“E-Day is where we landed [after discussing those franchise pillars],” Searcy said. “We felt like we could get the most out of the theme, the vibe….it’s the most important day in the entire franchise and there’s never been a game set there. It’s a ‘what if’ story. What if monsters came out of the ground in Los Angeles?”</p><p>Faucette said that the team wants the Locust to feel scarier than they have in a while, especially the Drones, who have become a kind of cannon (and meme) fodder as the <em>Gears</em> series has progressed. We want to “go back to those horror vibes,” Faucette said. “[We want the Locust to be] actually monsters that scare the shit out of you.”</p><h2 id="h34891"><a id=""></a><strong>Bros of war</strong></h2><p>Aside from the chainsaw gun, <em>Gears</em> <em>of War</em> is probably best known for its bond between Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago. The two hulking manly men have plenty of tender moments throughout the original trilogy, and Dom’s death at the end of <em>Gears of War 3</em> remains to this day one of the most emotional things I’ve experienced in a game. <em>E-Day</em> takes place 14 years before the events of <em>Gears 1</em>, during a time in which Marcus and Dom aren’t yet the best bros.</p><p>“They’re not the same Marcus and Dom that you know from the original trilogy,” Faucette said. Dom’s older brother recently died in the Pendulum War, and he and Marcus  were best friends, so there’s “tension, they’re struggling with grief and loss.” For The Coalition, <em>Gears of War E-Day</em> is an origin story of both Emergence Day but also of the bond that “defines the franchise.”</p><p>I love Marcus and Dom just as much as everyone else, but I still had a momentary pause after seeing the trailer. Until Anya (the Lieutenant in your ear in <em>Gears 1</em> and <em>Gears 2</em>) became a playable character in <em>Gears</em> <em>3</em>, the franchise always felt incredibly masculine—especially if you played online like I did. With Kait Diaz becoming a central character in the second trilogy, it felt like the franchise was spreading its wings a bit more. Now, we’re back to the bros—during a time of great strife in the industry where, perhaps, a female-focused <em>Gears</em> game would be met with derision from some bad actors.</p><p>I asked Faucette and Searcy about this, if <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em> would feel like a bro-down session, a sort of backtracking, and they assured me it wouldn’t. They couldn’t tell me about them, but they promised there’d be other characters central to the story. “Those are just the two people in the trailer,” Faucette pointed out. “<em>Gears</em> has always had a commitment of [showcasing] a wide array of humanity on this planet up against these monsters. That’s our studio values and our franchise values. We are 100% committed to unique and interesting characters in all walks of life.”</p><p>Here’s hoping I get to cut a Locust in half as a bad-ass bitch whenever <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em> drops. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft has unveiled Anno 117: Pax Romana, a new entry in Ubisoft Blue Byte's long-running economic city builder series, which is set to whisk PC and console players back to ancient Rome and the Roman Empire when it launches next year.
</p>
<p>
"It is the year 117 AD," Ubisoft explains, "as a Roman Governor of twin provinces of the Empire, your choices matter to your citizens. Build, trade, expand. Seize opportunities and harness the unique advantages and challenges that Albion and Latium provinces present."
</p>
<p>
"Will you encourage economic growth or expand your rule through dominance?," it continues. "Lead with rebellion or unite a diverse culture? The cost of peace is yours to decide."

<p>
Details are limited at present, but the <a href="http://anno117paxromana.com/">Anno 117 website</a> makes mention of a "challenging narrative journey... where alternative paths beckon", and it'll all unfold across the the twin provinces under players' stewardship - those being the aforementioned Albion and Latium.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, there're no screenshots and no gameplay footage to be scrutinised (although Ubisoft <em>has</em> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJNzvo3UJb8">live-action teaser trailer</a> to set the mood), so all we can do is await further information ahead of Anno 117: Pax Romana's eventual arrival on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year.

            <p>For me, sandbox games are never better when there’s an inherent chaos about to erupt at any given second. In a literal sandbox that might be anything from a kid burying a freshly-laid turd like a mischievous cat ready to be stepped on by an unsuspecting trespasser, gathering handfuls of grit to lob in a another kids’ eyes or swallowing a bunch of sand (hopefully turd-free) in pursuit of alchemising diamonds in their stomach. There don’t seem to be turds of any kind in upcoming sandbox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Streets of Fortuna, but that’s about the only thing that this ambitious “megasim” appears to be missing in its sprawling go-anywhere, do-anything <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Streets of Fortuna sets the player loose into an original historical-ish city inspired by Constantinople around 500 AD. After that, it’s up to the player what they do - there’s no class or job system to speak of, a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims">The Sims</a>, but you can improve in specific individual skills that might help you become, say, a blacksmith, or cook, or trader, or priest, or thief. Or instead of seeking a vocation or crafting goods, you could simply try to shag your way around the city or do whatever else you need to do to survive on the streets as a penniless nobody.</p>
<p>Reacting to your hijinks will be a procedurally-generated city full of a thousand individually simulated citizens and communities, whether they’re guards ready to chase you down if you’re caught nicking goods, potential customers to ply your wares - however legal - to, or targets for you to woo with romance or assassinate as you see fit. That might even include the city’s ruling Overlord, if you can find a way to try and take over the city yourself.</p>

<p>If a ridiculously detailed world created with procedural generation simulating the lives of hundreds of people sounds a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>, there’s a good reason. Developer-publishers Kitfox Games previously brought Dwarf Fortress to Steam and Itch.io, and tapped up co-creator Tarn Adams at Bay 12 to help design, polish and playtest their own ambitious sim game.</p>
<p>Kitfox say the vibe is “emergent chaos” and seeing stories play out as the world reacts to your various actions, which sounds like plenty for me to lose dozens of hours to given the plethora of possibilities seemingly on offer.</p>
<p>Revealed over the weekend during the PC Gaming Show, Streets of Fortuna has already been in development for two years, but Kitfox say there’s a “lot” left to do before it’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2946850/Streets_of_Fortuna/">released on Steam</a> - with no release date yet. Beyond that, the devs have plans for regular updates on top of the basic framework to delve even deeper into elements of the fictional world, such as politics, going beyond the “default” player experience of surviving on the streets as a thief.</p>

			<p>The latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ubisoft-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft Forward</a> showcase just wrapped up, and while it was light on new game announcements, we did get a reveal of a new entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/anno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anno series</a>. While most entries in the Anno series have taken place in or around the European Age of Discovery, and there was even a couple set int the sci-fi future, the latest game in the series is going back much earlier in history. Anno 117: Pax Romana will put players in the sandals of an Ancient Roman governor, overseeing either a province in what’s now Italy or amongst the Celts in what’s now the United Kingdom. No gameplay of Anno 117 has been revealed, but Ubisoft did provide the following liver action teaser trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana - Live Action Teaser: Governors Wanted | Ubisoft Forward" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJNzvo3UJb8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Obviously, I’d like some actual gameplay, but the concept of Anno 117: Pax Romana is certainly intriguing. Here’s some <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/ca/anno-117--pax-romana/6638e5dcaa201a2d55bcc772.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more official info about the game</a>…</p>
<p><em>“Aiming to be the biggest, most detailed Roman simulation to date, Anno 117: Pax Romana follows the Anno franchise's traditional emphasis on construction, not destruction. As governor, you'll be able to build up a province in Latium or the Celtic land of Albion as you see fit, managing everything from aqueducts to naumachia naval battles in your coliseum, and whether you spread Roman culture or adopt Celtic traditions will be up to you.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Become a Roman governor</strong> - You are a Roman Governor in the year 117 AD. Follow the path laid before you, or boldly question the status quo of the empire. Embark on a challenging narrative journey to build your cities where alternative paths beckon.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Discover Rome’s uncharted provinces</strong> - Journey through the little-known territories of the Roman Empire. Uncover the allure of Latium and Albion, the twin provinces under your stewardship as governor.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Build, Trade, Expand</strong> - Your choices as a governor matter to your citizens! Will you encourage economic growth or expand your rule through dominance? Lead with rebellion or unite a diverse culture? Choose your path wisely, your decisions will guide them through the era of Pax Romana.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana is coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Amazon Luna sometime in 2025. What do you think? Ready to do as the Romans do?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24175517/animal-crossing-aquarium-how-it-works<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="pjLYK6">Fans of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/animal-crossing-new-horizons/40565"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a><em> </em>likely know the tedium and joy that comes with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/22759538/fish-locations-times-month-day-list-critterpedia">assembling an aquarium of their own</a> and fishing season after season, but the fun doesn’t have to stop in the game. Nintendo announced that the company will be bringing its <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> aquarium <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/events/play-events/animal-crossing-aquarium-tour/">tour nationwide on Monday</a>. The event started  with a partnership between Nintendo and the Seattle Aquarium that brought specially themed Animal Crossing exhibits to the aquarium. On Monday <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/events/play-events/animal-crossing-aquarium-tour/">Nintendo announced</a> that it would be expanding the event and tour several locations across the United States. </p>
<p id="5NPts9">The <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>Aquarium Tour will come to seven U.S. cities in total. It includes a nice spread of events across several regions. Here are all the locations and dates for each aquarium Nintendo has announced so far: </p>
<ul>
<li id="1u1PuC">Ripley’s Aquarium of Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina — June 14-Aug. 11</li>
<li id="N9mSUk">Audubon Aquarium in New Orleans, Louisiana — June 21-Sept. 14</li>
<li id="6ZBaWo">Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, Georgia — Aug. 1 - Sept. 26</li>
<li id="J6X9Cm">Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon — Aug. 26-Oct. 20</li>
<li id="RUDV8d">New England Aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts — Sept. 21-Dec. 14</li>
<li id="ZChkFV">Sea Life Arizona in Tempe, Arizona — Oct. 4-Nov. 17</li>
<li id="BDYJGN">Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, Tennessee — Dec. 21-Feb. 28</li>
</ul>
<p id="JN7SQR">The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/events/play-events/animal-crossing-aquarium-tour/">official FAQ on the event</a> describes the tour as an “aquarium experience inspired by the <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> game.” The participating aquariums will host events “and more with an Animal Crossing twist.” However if you want to get a stronger idea of what the official Animal Crossing aquarium experience could actually be like, it’s helpful to look at the aquarium tour hosted at the Seattle Aquarium. </p>
<p id="XTeBmW">A TikTok video from the user May showed what it was like to attend the event. The aquarium had giant Animal Crossing-themed backdrops to take photos. Visitors can look for cutouts of characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook in the aquarium, and get a card stamped as they find each character. Exhibits within the aquarium contain additional placards courtesy of Blathers, who will teach fans more about the fish they have caught in the game. Additionally, it looks like the event at the Seattle Aquarium contained adorable merch as well. If you want to see more, you can see the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mayplaystv/video/7327370544066612512">full video below</a>. </p>

<p id="HLcISP">Overall, it doesn’t look like anything overly fancy, but it doesn’t really need to be. The aquarium is already pretty dang fun — even without Tom Nook there — and it looks like the event could be the perfect excuse for an Animal Crossing fan to go and see some cool critters and fish. </p>

Ubisoft notes that while in the midst of missions, you won’t be able to switch between the two, though I’m still hoping a late-game set piece will require playing through an assassination as both. The gameplay trailer shows how killing the same assassination target can be approached from entirely different ways by the two, as each offer a unique style of play: Yasuke is a hulking, strong warrior and Naoe is a stealthy ninja.</p><p>The gameplay trailer begins with Yasuke wandering the countryside and happening upon a village. Immediately inhabitants of the village take notice of him due to his samurai status and his hulking figure—and the fact that he’s Black. Yasuke is a historical figure, the first Ubisoft has made a main protagonist in the series’ 17-year history, and&nbsp;he’s basically a celebrity in this land. NPCs bow as Yasuke walks by and it serves as an interesting twist on how past games have typically forced protagonists into the seedier corners of society.</p><p>Yasuke’s combat style feels like the RPG-heavy entries in the<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> series—think along the lines of <em>Odyssey</em> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-the-kotaku-review-1845615415&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-the-kotaku-review-1845615415"><em>Valhalla</em></a></span>. We see Yasuke enter combat with skills available on the right trigger in tandem with face buttons. Yasuke can wield multiple weapons that players can swap between using the d-pad. During the trailer we see a polearm and a katana do some serious damage. </p><p> Yasuke is all impressive force and intense brutalities: his kanabō can remove enemies’ heads from their bodies, his strength allows him to impale them with his sword and lift them high up into the air. He can break down doors or thin walls by running through them. He’s a tank.&nbsp;</p><p>Naoe, however, plays like a mix of an original, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175">stealthier <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> </a></span>experience and a proper shinobi: she can use a grappling hook to reach faraway spots or to assassinate a mark, is more lithe and sneaky so that she can blend into the shadows, and has a few kunai she can throw from the safety of a high-up perch. Whereas Yasuke stormed through the front entrance of a castle and killed everyone in sight within minutes, Naoe gets in undiscovered, and silently assassin’s the men guarding her mark who is sulking in a beautiful courtyard. She uses a discarded reed to breath underwater, her entire body submerged just feet away from the target.&nbsp;</p><p>During the preview, Naoe and Yasuke both successfully assassinate the corrupt village leader in wildly different ways, but both times we’re treated to a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/23/21333631/ghost-of-tsushima-kurosawa-films-samurai-japan-abe-politics&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/23/21333631/ghost-of-tsushima-kurosawa-films-samurai-japan-abe-politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kurosawa-esque assassination animation</a></span>—color saps away until the scene is entirely in black and white, save for the bright red blood splatters that spurt off of his body. The first time the crowd sees this animation, a hum of awe rumbles through the room. </p><p>Other announcements during the gameplay reveal included the introduction of a year-long season cycle. That means the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-map-size-region-arg-puzzle-1851521223&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-map-size-region-arg-puzzle-1851521223">expansive map</a></span> (which will be big but not as big as <em>Valhalla</em>) will change between winter, spring, summer, and fall.

Sometimes seasons may impede players, such as water being frozen. Also, you can pet the dog. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> releases on November 15 for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the more interesting upcoming projects, alongside a whole slew of exciting-looking video games from the Xbox Games Showcase, was an action-adventure game called South of Midnight. It’ll explore the mysteries of the Deep South, delving into folklore and ancient powers. But do we know the South of Midnight release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-south-of-midnight-coming-out">When is South of Midnight Coming Out?</h2>



<p>While the South of Midnight gameplay trailer gave us an in-depth look at how the game mechanics play out, it didn’t reveal much about the release. As such, we know South of Midnight is coming out sometime in 2025, but that’s about all we know. The trailer didn’t offer a better release window, and there are currently no leaks surrounding the date.</p>

<p>We’re definitely keeping an eye on this, however. The moment we know more about the game’s release date or even a better release window, we’ll update this piece to ensure you know!</p>

<h2 id="h-is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-game-pass">Is South of Midnight Coming to Game Pass?</h2>



<p>Thanks to the gameplay trailer shown above, we know that South of Midnight will launch on the following platforms:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC (Steam)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Xbox Series X|S</strong></li>



<li><strong>Game Pass</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Whether it launches simultaneously with PC and Xbox Series X|S, however, remains to be seen. It seems more than likely, considering Xbox’s recent approach to day-one releases on its subscription platform!</p>

<p>Following an incredible showing during the Xbox Games Showcase, we now know a bit more about the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta. More specifically, we saw plenty of story details and gameplay. But do we know the Metal Gear Solid Delta release date?</p>







<p>Based on the Metal Gear Solid Delta trailer we saw recently, we know the stealth-action remake is coming sometime in 2025. Unfortunately, we don’t yet have a precise release date, but considering the quality of what we saw at the showcase, we imagine it’ll be sometime in early 2025.</p>



<p>Of course, that’s not a guarantee. It might wind up being summer or even fall, so we’ll have to wait for more information.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - Official Trailer #1 - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTVaEPHa9Bc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta is a full-blown remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater from 2004. It features a modern control scheme, all-new graphics, and better audio. At the same time, it will retain the storyline and world we know and love!</p>











<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks that we previously reported on</a>, we have a good indication as to the total cost of Metal Gear Solid Delta. Supposedly, the stealth-action game is priced at:</p>



<ul>
<li>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater – Standard Edition
<ul>
<li>$69.99</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater – Collector’s Edition
<ul>
<li>$199.99</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s unclear precisely what the collector’s edition includes, but we imagine it’ll include many fun physical items. At that price, we may even end up with a Snake statue!</p>

Activision has published a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions" rel="nofollow ">massive blog</a> on the official Call of Duty site to explain how it all works, but we've boiled it down for you in a few sentences below.</p><p dir="ltr">Basically, Game Pass subscribers will be able to access Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at launch on October 25 if they are actively subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, or Game Pass Console. As you might expect, Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have access to both the PC and Xbox versions of the game, as well as Multiplayer and Zombies modes on both platforms. However, those with a Game Pass Console subscription must also have a Game Pass Core pass in order to play Black Ops 6's online modes like Zombies, as well as general multiplayer. Subscribers can further upgrade to the game's Vault Edition (MSRP of $30 US) to receive benefits like a Mastercraft Weapon Collection and the Hunters vs. Hunted Operator Pack.</p><p dir="ltr">To access preorder bonuses like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">Open Beta Early Access</a> and the Woods Operator Pack, Game Pass subscribers must log in to Modern Warfare 3 or Warzone on the platform where they hold their subscription at some point before October 25. It's not clear when this open beta will take place, but subscribers should look out for concrete dates at some point soon. Additionally, if you unsubscribe to Game Pass, you naturally lose access to Black Ops 6 unless you resub or buy it outright.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Call of Duty news revealed at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, we recently learned that Black Ops 6 will require all players to have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-will-require-players-to-be-online-across-all-modes-including-campaign/1100-6524100/">continuous internet collection</a> to enjoy the game, including the campaign.</p>

		<p>The Crew Motorfest’s second year will be kicking off with two major additions to the game. The first will be the addition of Maui island to the game, which will be 100 square kilometers, adding a whole new location for players to explore. The other addition is the premium PvE called The Chase Squad.</p>

<p>Ubisoft have also given some detail about The Chase Squad, saying <em>“Maui will also be among the settings for The Chase Squad, in which players will join with an elite team of drivers who want to shake up conventional ideas about racing as they take down rival drivers. The Chase Squad will challenge players to track, outsmart, and outmaneuver racing rivals in high-speed nighttime pursuits across the islands. Season 5 will also bring more of the Made in Japan playlist, with new races, events, and locations.”</em></p>
<p>Ubisoft will be hosting a The Crew Showcase this September, where more details about Made in Japan Volume 2 and The Chase Squad will be given.</p>

Another year, another Ubisoft Forward livestream without any reference to Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, the long, long-awaited sci-fi sequel that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-ubisoft-insists">Ubisoft still says it has in the works</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-overtakes-guinness-record-holder-duke-nukem-forever-as-game-longest-in-development">BGE&amp;E2 overtook Duke Nukem Forever as the game with the longest-ever development period</a>, back in 2022. 18 months later, we've heard little since. 
</p>
<p>
In January 2023, Ubisoft told Eurogamer that "Beyond Good and Evil 2's development is under way and the team is hard at work to deliver on its ambitious promise."
</p>

<p>
But its development has been hit by numerous setbacks, including the departure of Ubisoft veteran Michel Ancel in 2020. 
</p>
<p>
In 2023, its developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-studio-reportedly-under-investigation-for-unprecedented-burnout-and-sick-leave">Ubisoft Montpellier was the subject of a labour investigation into "unprecedented" levels of employee stress and sickness</a>, and the departure of its managing director.
</p>
<p>
While it's been ages since we've had a proper update on the long-in-development project, fans had really hoped for some kind of update this year, after Ubisoft previously said a new version of the original Beyond Good &amp; Evil would launch in 2024. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft is yet to comment further on the frankly bizarre situation with its still officially unannounced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-now-playing-ubisofts-still-unannounced-beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</a> that some fans were able to play last year "due to a technical error".
</p>
<p>
That project was "set for early 2024", Ubisoft told Eurogamer in November last year. It's perhaps unecessary to state that it's no longer early 2024 and no longer Beyond Good &amp; Evil's 20th anniversary year either.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-it%E2%80%99s-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024.897417/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-its-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Avowed was <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-gets-new-trailer-but-still-has-no-final-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> with a new story trailer at yesterday's Xbox Game Showcase 2024, and an Obsidian blog post briefly <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-release-date-revealed-by-obsidians-game-director-but-quickly-gets-pulled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> a November 12 release date before being corrected.</p>
<p>However, the real meat in terms of new info came today via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfEdLugnpuo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest special episode of the Official Xbox Podcast</a>, which hosted Avowed Game Director Carrie Patel. She brought some new footage (though unfortunately it is only available in Full HD) and revealed plenty of new information, starting with the fact that the game will indeed feature a third-person camera option, in stark contrast to all the footage released so far. That will certainly be welcome news for all those players who can't stand first-person view due to motion sickness issues.</p>
<p>Patel also demonstrated how Obsidian aims to make it very clear for players when one of their equipped weapons is ineffective due to its lack of upgrades. Besides just not doing enough damage, you'll also get very obvious visual and sound cues that you need to gather enough resources to enhance the weapon.</p>
<p>The footage then showed some pretty nighttime (Avowed features dynamic time of day) scenes and a glimpse into the party camp, which is where the player character and their companions will rest, recuperate, and most importantly chat about what's happened.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox Games Showcase Deep Dive | Avowed" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bfEdLugnpuo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moreover, we got another look at the character progression. On certain level milestones, players will get to increase their attribute points: Might increases damage and carry weight, Constitution increases health and poison/bleed resistance, Dexterity improves attack and action speed, Perception increases critical hit chance and max range, Intellect augments Essence and elemental resistance, and Resolve increases stamina and reduces the cooldown of Second Wind.</p>
<p>On every level up, the character will gain one ability point to spend on skill in the Fighter, Ranger, Wizard, and Godlike trees. Avowed is classless, so you can freely choose to spend everything in the Wizard (or any other tree) or just make a jack-of-all-trades character. Some of the skills will also be helpful in traversal, such as Fan of Flames making quick work of the brambles that blocked a certain path. A respec option is available for those who may regret spending points in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Throughout the podcast, Obsidian provided a look at how to resolve a quest in two opposite ways. The player character needs to acquire the heart from an ancient forest creature, and the user can opt to slay her brethren (which will lead to a confrontation once the creature realizes you've killed them all) or use stealth to avoid the guards and obtain the item with a diplomatic approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-believe-in-living-in-fear-obsidian-talks-avowed-release-date-prospects-and-xbox-studio-closures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In an interview with Eurogamer</a>, Carrie Patel also expressed confidence in the studio's ability to release Avowed this year.</p>
<p><em>I'll say, just having come from the studio last week, the game is looking fantastic. The team is putting a lot of love into the polish. So we feel very good about 2024.</em></p>
<p>It also may be the case that Obsidian and Microsoft are waiting to see the release window of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which may be revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tomorrow</a> alongside the first look at gameplay. After all, they're both fantasy action RPGs likely headed toward a November launch.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Avowed will be available for PC and Xbox Series S|X, and it'll be on Game Pass from day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-13-minutes-gameplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has released 13 minutes of extended <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-official-title-for-assassins-creed-red-reveal-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> gameplay, showing off the game's updated stealth mechanics, exploration, environments, and more.</p>
<p>The new footage was released during the publisher's Ubisoft Forward event. In addition to the extended gameplay footage, Game Director Charles Benoit and Art Director Thierry Dansereau also presented a deep dive into the game's combat and stealth. "The Gameplay Walkthrough mission shown at the conference takes place in the castle town of Fukuchiyama in Tamba Province, where Naoe and Yasuke are hunting down a corrupted daimyo", the press release from Ubisoft reads. "The gameplay illustrates the complementary dynamic between the two playable heroes: Naoe,<br>
the agile and stealthy Shinobi, and Yasuke, the combat-focused Samurai."</p>
<p>Both new videos have been included below. We've also included some additional info about the gameplay walkthrough mission, as provided by Ubisoft.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Extended Gameplay Walkthrough | Ubisoft Forward" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjAzNpMYTxw?start=183&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Official Gameplay - Combat and Stealth Evolved | Ubisoft Forward" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2crLch9Mb8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<ul>
<li>Naoe embodies the essence of a Shinobi Assassin. From a versatile grappling hook that<br>
allows for stealthy in-air assassinations and greater mobility, to kunai and her custom<br>
Hidden Blade for swift eliminations, she has access to a diverse arsenal of tools to strike<br>
from the shadows. While more vulnerable in close combat, she can skillfully deflect,<br>
dodge enemy strikes, and retaliate with lethal precision, using light, her surroundings,<br>
and structures around her to topple her foes.</li>
<li>Yasuke is tailored for direct confrontations, relying on his exceptional combat skills and<br>
mastery of Samurai weaponry. Whether wielding the Katana for decisive strikes, opting<br>
for raw power with the Kanabo, or engaging opponents from a distance with lethal flint<br>
rifle called Teppo, he can handle multiple enemies at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is slated for a release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC, Amazon Luna, and Macs with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store on November 15, 2024. The game is also coming to iPad later on.</p>

  <p id="PliY6h">Ubisoft’s big games showcase, Ubisoft Forward, kept the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164106/summer-game-fest-2024">Summer Game Fest</a> hype train rolling on Monday with fresh details on new and upcoming games like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, <em>XDefiant</em>, and a plethora of Prince of Persia projects — including the long-awaited return (sort of) of Ubi’s <em>Sands of Time</em> remake.</p>
<p id="MoEbYa">Here’s everything that Ubisoft had to share during Ubisoft Forward 2024.</p>
<h2 id="RPObN1"><strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong></h2>
<div id="G0zxEV"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QP_wXv2ErgI?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="rpewAR">Star Wars fans will live out their bounty hunter fantasies this summer in a brand-new open-world galactic adventure, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24175099/star-wars-outlaws-preview-impressions-stealth-gameplay"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>. At Ubisoft Forward, developers from Massive Entertainment walked players through what they can expect from scrappy scoundrel Kay Vess’ adventure. She’ll wrangle criminal cartels, engage in battles both in space and on planet Tatooine, and travel to locations familiar and new in the Star Wars galaxy. The 10-minute gameplay showcase was full of gameplay variety and plenty of blaster fire to get players hyped for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>’ Aug. 30 release date.</p>
<div id="xpUxoj"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kwo41nUwyeo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="zDAtw0">Not content to release just <em>one</em> new trailer for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, Ubisoft released a second game overview trailer that highlights the title’s diversity of locations, alien species, and gameplay styles. </p>
<h2 id="BcJsPa"><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></h2>
<div id="eknQsQ"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjAzNpMYTxw?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="lxI4uO">Ubisoft is taking the Assassin’s Creed series to Japan for the first time with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156633/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-codename-red"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>. Players will be able to take on dual roles as either the stealthy shinobi Naoe or the powerhouse samurai Yasuke. At Ubisoft Forward, we got a deep dive into how those protagonists will play in a 13-minute gameplay walkthrough. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is out on Nov. 15.</p>
<h2 id="6WIGNG"><strong>Prince of Persia</strong></h2>
<p id="JZ3SLD">Ubisoft came with not one, not two, but three Prince of Persia-related announcements for the franchise’s 35th anniversary. Here’s what it showed at Ubisoft Forward.</p>
<div id="pARfML"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ke-pi068EXg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="deFzBr"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> will get a free content update with revised bosses, puzzle challenges, new amulets, new outfits, and more. There’s also story DLC coming in the form of <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown: Mask of Darkness</em> this September.</p>
<div id="rOzyOr"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZcC8TPRCpU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="bLpcl9">Evil Empire and Ubisoft also have an update coming for roguelite platformer <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia.</em> It’s called the Temple of Fire and it will bring even tougher challenges to the early access game.</p>
<div id="YutHBk"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdhrdKu1SCA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="2CWWYg">But that’s not all. Ubisoft even brought out a trailer for its long-awaited <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em> remake and... you’re going to have to wait a lot longer. Ubisoft announced a 2026 release window for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171532/summer-game-fest-2024-e3-xbox-showcase-ubisoft-forward">the troubled game</a>.</p>

<p id="mmWphI">Ubisoft’s free-to-play shooter, <em>XDefiant</em>, is getting its first season. That debut season will include new maps, a new Capture the Flag mode, new weapons, and a new faction: GSK from the Rainbow Six series. <em>XDefiant</em> season 1 launches July 2.</p>

<p id="SZmmr2"><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana</em>, the next entry in Ubisoft and Blue Byte’s 25-year-old economic sim real-time strategy game, is coming in 2025, letting players take on the role of Roman governor overseeing their growing empire. At Ubisoft Forward, we got a pretty silly live-action trailer that highlights the challenge of governing an ancient province when your most loyal subjects are goats. </p>

But what is surprising is that Harding will have “unexpected magical powers,” so there’s still plenty more to learn about our old friend this time around.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2361b0bbee2b7663a90a41346be070a4" data-recommend-id="image://2361b0bbee2b7663a90a41346be070a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Neve: The Detective." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Neve: The Detective." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2361b0bbee2b7663a90a41346be070a4" data-recommend-id="image://2361b0bbee2b7663a90a41346be070a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Neve: The Detective." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next, we have Neve, a human mage operating out of the Tevinter capital Minrathous. Neve is a detective who appears in the <em>Tevinter Nights </em>anthology book, as well as the comic book series <em>The Missing</em>. Neve has been investigating the extremist mage faction called the Venatori, which puts her in the sightlines of the Inquisition. She helps the group investigate Solas, the <em>Inquisition-</em>party-member-turned-<em>Veilguard</em>-antagonist, and it seems her involvement is only going to continue in the game when it launches this fall. BioWare describes her as a “cynic,” but she is fighting for a better future as part of the Shadow Dragons faction that fights to end slavery in Tevinter.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c3ba66a17cd4af35752af1b78bcdab9e" data-recommend-id="image://c3ba66a17cd4af35752af1b78bcdab9e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis: The Mage Killer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lucanis: The Mage Killer" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c3ba66a17cd4af35752af1b78bcdab9e" data-recommend-id="image://c3ba66a17cd4af35752af1b78bcdab9e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis: The Mage Killer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lucanis Dellamorte is a human rogue who works with the assassin’s organization the Anitvan Crows. The faction has been operating in the background of the <em>Dragon Age</em> series since <em>Origins</em>, but we haven’t had one in our party since Zevran in the first game. Lucanis appeared in the <em>Tevinter Nights</em> anthology in which he is set on a contract to kill a wigmaker and Venatori agent in Tevinter. The mission goes bad and Lucanis is presumed dead by the Crows. But death clearly suits him.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="abab42a78aa7db10c5078fa408f42cb1" data-recommend-id="image://abab42a78aa7db10c5078fa408f42cb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bellara jumps out of an Eluvian." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bellara jumps out of an Eluvian." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="abab42a78aa7db10c5078fa408f42cb1" data-recommend-id="image://abab42a78aa7db10c5078fa408f42cb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bellara jumps out of an Eluvian." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Bellara is one of the newcomers in <em>The Veilguard</em>. She’s an elven rogue “Veil Jumper,” part of a group introduced in <em>The Missing</em> comics who formed to protect the Arlathan Forest in the Tevinter Imperium. BioWare describes her as “creative and romantic” and “obsessed” with discovering secrets of the universe. She’s seen jumping through an Eluvian mirror’s portal in the cinematic trailer with a smile on her face, even as she gets pulled back in by some kind of tentacle monster.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="df78a26fed7e1975e3b821cbd6fdeaae" data-recommend-id="image://df78a26fed7e1975e3b821cbd6fdeaae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emmrich surrounded by magic lights." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Emmrich surrounded by magic lights." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="df78a26fed7e1975e3b821cbd6fdeaae" data-recommend-id="image://df78a26fed7e1975e3b821cbd6fdeaae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emmrich surrounded by magic lights." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Emmrich, the human Tevinter mage, is giving “Dorian Pavus’ grandpa.” The mustache-sporting necromancer was also featured in the <em>Tevinter Nights</em> anthology in which he’s shown to be a master of the dark arts of life and death. He’s part of the Mourn Watch, a group that are essentially keepers and maintainers of the dead. He’s so skilled in resurrecting and controlling the dead that he has a skeleton assistant named Manfred.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="38d883b95c215a5787859a466b415d35" data-recommend-id="image://38d883b95c215a5787859a466b415d35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin: The Warden." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Davrin: The Warden." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="38d883b95c215a5787859a466b415d35" data-recommend-id="image://38d883b95c215a5787859a466b415d35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin: The Warden." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Another newcomer in <em>The Veilguard </em>is Davrin. He’s brand new to the series, but his faction isn’t. Davrin is a member of the Grey Wardens, the Darkspawn-killing order that has been a figurehead in <em>Dragon Age </em>since <em>Origins</em>. BioWare says he’s “bold and charming” and is apparently a notable monster hunter. He’s also my new husband, probably. Maybe. If Lucanis doesn’t steal my heart.

She hasn’t appeared in any other <em>Dragon Age </em>media, but if the character trailer is any indication she’s clearly an adventurous fighter who is willing to take on whole-ass dragons by herself. Taash is part of the Lords of Fortune, a group of treasure hunters from the country of Rivain.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f117ad4ae44b3ec8765be97df639be59" data-recommend-id="image://f117ad4ae44b3ec8765be97df639be59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric and Scout Harding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Varric and Scout Harding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f117ad4ae44b3ec8765be97df639be59" data-recommend-id="image://f117ad4ae44b3ec8765be97df639be59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric and Scout Harding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While Varric doesn’t seem to be a party member, the fan-favorite companion from <em>Dragon Age II </em>and <em>Inquisition</em> appears to be in some kind of leadership role in <em>The Veilguard</em>. He’s shown talking to Harding about recruiting all of these chucklefucks, so odds are he’ll play a major part in wherever the story goes. This guy’s been on the frontlines for two games now, so maybe it’s good that he gets out of the scrap for once.<br></p><p>That’s what we know about this new crew so far. Whether they live up to the highs of the past games remains to be seen. It’s gonna be hard to live up to characters like Dorian Pavus and Morrigan, but after ten years, I’m eager to see BioWare rise to the occasion.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-assassins-creed-shadows-blends-new-and-classic-ideas-with-dual-protagonists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Deadly stealth and brute force working in tandem.</h2></div><section><p>16th-century Japan is ripe with fascinating historical context for an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-assassins-creed-games">Assassin’s Creed game</a> to thrive, which is one aspect that makes the upcoming Assassin’s Creed Shadows so enticing. The way the series bends history for its fiction has me hyped to see its version of feudal Japan, but it’s also a setting that lends itself well to the kind of combat options that have been encompassed by the entire franchise.</p><p>In a hands-off preview demo of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, I was able to see roughly 30 minutes of gameplay that showcased both Naoe and Yasuke – the two protagonists – and their combat styles in action. They represent both worlds of the series’ combat: Naoe, a stealthy shinobi wielding the iconic Hidden Blade, and Yasuke, a force of nature with pure power and masterful swordsmanship. </p><p>At the start of the demo, I saw Yasuke pulling up to a town where everyday people are squeezing out an existence under the boot of a corrupt shogunate that enforces a caste system. It’s a common dynamic in stories set in this era of Japan, but it’s also ripe for Yasuke to do right by the people who revere him. He has a commanding, respected presence, and the first combat encounter was against a group of samurai who were harassing a villager that shows off Yasuke’s swordsmanship. The challenge is to dodge or counter enemy attacks (indicated by blue and red glints on their blade) in traditional melee combat. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/ac-shadows-1718037568488.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t hold back when it comes to the brutality of its combat. Yasuke has finishing moves where he either slices enemies’ heads off clean or stabs them in the gut before lifting them up just to slam them back down. These finishers are also highlighted with black-and-white frame cuts with blood splattering, giving it a bit of the samurai cinematic flair. What’s just as brutal is Yasuke’s spiked club, which is a heavy blunt-force weapon that pounds armored foes. Seeing them take a swing straight to the dome brought a little, “Oooooh!” out of me. The point being that Yasuke is purely focused on melee, so while he won’t be doing a lot of climbing rooftops and jumping between buildings, he’ll hold it down by taking all his enemies head on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t hold back when it comes to the brutality of its combat.</p></div><p>After this introductory combat encounter, a cutscene shows Naoe burst onto the scene to help Yasuke by leaping onto an enemy and executing them with her Hidden Blade. Naoe and Yasuke have this sort of chummy dynamic as they decide how to take on their next mission: assassinate the daimyo at Fukuchiyama Castle. From here, you have to choose to either control Naoe or Yasuke, and this will determine your playstyle and how you navigate the mission to kill your target.</p><p>Playing as Naoe, you then have access to scaling walls, hiding in foliage, and stealthy kills. She’s not solely working with a Hidden Blade either; she has throwable kunai for ranged kills and a set of short swords to get her hands dirty up close and personal, should things go loud. But my favorite weapon of hers is the chained blade she can swing around in a circle to chop down crowds of enemies, which even slices through environmental objects. So while she is more focused on being nimble and staying out of sight, she still has some viable options as backup.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/acs3-1718037606123.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>But of course, slipping past guards to nab those satisfying stealth kills seems to be worth the effort. Being able to move through the environment with tools like a grappling hook to get up on higher ground in a jiffy and assassinate unsuspecting guards almost reminded me of Tenchu, since it’s more about smartly using tools than just hiding in grass and waiting for patrol patterns to play out. Naoe channels traditional Assassin’s Creed energy, and her options definitely lean into the Splinter Cell fantasy that hasn’t really been fulfilled in the years since we last saw Sam Fisher in action.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Naoe channels traditional Assassin’s Creed energy.</p></div><p>If you play this same mission as Yasuke, you literally bust down the front door and provoke all enemies into combat. Watching him tear through guards almost reminded me of For Honor, another Ubisoft game, for how methodical it all seemed to play, even though it isn’t quite that in depth of swordfighting. Since this is the era of Japanese history that first introduced firearms via Western import, Yasuke also wields a single-shot rifle, and it's pretty wild to see a hulking samurai pull off headshots just before whipping out his katana to slice down the rest of the foes in front of him.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/screenshot-2024-06-10-093248-1718037644299.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Whether you play as Naoe or Yasuke, the end result seems to be the same: you kill the daimyo and keep it moving. I’m not sure what the story implications will be depending on your choice, if any. But it’s nice to see two characters with fully realized playstyles with a number of weapons and tools so as to not get stuck into monotonous combat encounters. Granted, that will be determined by how quests are designed. Infiltrating Fukuchiyama Castle showed promise in this regard, but I would love to see if, or how, Shadows can mix and match the two protagonists in more natural ways.</p><p>I’m more curious now to get my own hands on Assassin’s Creed Shadows because I always appreciate how different weapons and gear create a distinct flow, especially for a series that’s recently been bouncing between different identities. For me, the most interesting aspects of this game will come from the creative freedom Ubisoft flexes when playing with its historical fiction. Yasuke is a fascinating figure in Japanese history and having a covert shinobi in Naoe contrast the ideals of highly regarded samurai sets my expectations quite high. At least now, I know I’ll be getting a more interesting gameplay dynamic than what I’ve seen from Assassin’s Creed’s recent past.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Assassin's Creed: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>From 2007's debut title to the upcoming console, PC, mobile, and VR projects, here is the entire Assassin's Creed series in one list.
