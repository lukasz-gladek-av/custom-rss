                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>At the top of the attention-seeking tree at this year’s Game Awards was Larian—the massive independent studio behind 2023’s most fantastic game, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3—</em>with their <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">silly statue in the desert</a> and then the most <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714">astonishingly unpleasant trailer</a> for their next RPG project, <em>Divinity</em>. I couldn’t be more thrilled about the prospect of returning to Rivellon, but given there will be years left to wait for that, I’m instead delighted to notice that the previous game in that series, <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em>, is now officially updated for Switch 2.</p> <p>2017’s release of&nbsp;<em>DOS2</em> was the moment Larian really established itself as one of the all-time leading RPG developers. The&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> series began with the decent enough action-RPG <em>Divine Divinity</em> in 2002, followed by the decidedly mediocre <em>Beyond Divinity</em> in 2004, which was slammed for its crappy story and lack of originality. Things didn’t improve enormously in 2009 when <em>Divinity II</em> came out riddled with bugs, dragged down further by a poor Xbox 360 version, but they started to look up a year later when an improved and much-fixed re-release appeared and won people over. Things went quiet for a fair while, with the peculiar but successful decision to release a real-time strategy game set in the same universe in 2013, but it was in 2014 that <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> appeared and blew everyone’s socks off.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:4bbrhyv7c6do5ppnm2x45erw/app.bsky.feed.post/3m7zy4hmc2s2f" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreibgjrqtfuedbh6x6aewtxnpfmqmd37vuihsdms747dglpcx6mfm4e"> <p lang="en">The plot thinnens.</p> <p>With a 93 Metacritic score, the award-winning Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now yours to play on Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5!</p> <p>Upgrade for free or begin your adventure today and prepare for what lies ahead.</p> <p>youtu.be/_K_vKMo7DEI?…</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4bbrhyv7c6do5ppnm2x45erw?ref_src=embed">Larian Studios (@larianstudios.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4bbrhyv7c6do5ppnm2x45erw/post/3m7zy4hmc2s2f?ref_src=embed">2025-12-15T15:46:30.537Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Suddenly this studio known for somewhat generic action-RPGs appeared with an epic, old-school, party-based RPG that was delighting crowds. Its story was still its weaker area, but this was like a butterfly compared to Larian’s previous caterpillars. However, it would be three years later than every single element would come together into one glorious whole with the release of&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em>, one of the all-time best RPGs ever released.</p>

 <p>Funded by Kickstarter and released into Early Access in September 2016, a year’s development followed in communication with its community, and this seemed to be the magic ingredient Larian needed. That, and releasing a beefed-up, improved and lengthened Definitive Edition a year later.</p>

 <p>The game was so good that it allowed hundreds of thousands of people to feel extremely smug when <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> broke through to the wider mainstream in 2023 (following its own Early Access), knowing they were there before it was cool. But now, with the announcement of Larian’s next project&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em>, an awful lot of people are going to want to go back and fill in the gaps.</p>

 <p>If you’re one of those people, you really don’t need to worry about anything before <em>DOS.&nbsp;</em>You can pick that up on PC, Xbox and PlayStation. But honestly, if I were you, I’d just dive straight into the sequel. It’s a standalone story, and it’s a superior game. It’s one of <em>the</em> superior games! And now it’s been given a sprucing up to shine on modern consoles, including the Switch 2.</p>  <p>I’m absolutely psyched for an excuse to play it all over again. I’m going to pick this up for Switch 2, and I’m going to remember to get the trait for speaking to animals from the very start. (Seriously, if you don’t, you’ll miss out on&nbsp;<em>so</em> much.)</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tp-link-wi-fi-7-adapter-drops-to-an-all-time-low-making-the-upgrade-from-wi-fi-6-cheaper-than-ever-2000653345</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If your current laptop or PC lacks built-in wireless capabilities or only supports outdated Wi-Fi standards, adding a dedicated adapter to the setup can get you the speeds you’re looking for. TP-Link makes some of our favorite wireless connectivity solutions out there, and right now, you can grab a solid adapter by the brand without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6398/">The TP-Link BE6200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 7 wireless USB 3.0 adapter archer is currently available for $80 at Amazon, after a nice 38% or $50 discount.</a> This is the lowest it’s dropped to in the last 90 days, which means it’s one of those leftover Black Friday deals that survived the chaotic event. Such deals, however, tend to wrap up fast, so it’s best to grab yourself a solid adapter while the discount is still live. Getting your orders in today should help them arrive before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to stream or game with friends during the holidays and don’t want slow internet speeds ruining the experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6398/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Reliable Signals</h2>
<p>This USB 3.0 adapter comes with two bifurcated high-gain antennas and a detachable cradle with a 1.2-meter cable. The beamforming technology helps direct the Wi-Fi signal towards your router for incredible reception and more reliable signals, even from farther away. When it’s paired with a Wi-Fi 7 router, you can enjoy the 6 GHz band that further improves wireless performance with 160MHz, Multi-RUs, and 4K-QAM. The 6 GHz band offers speeds of up to 2,882 Mbps, while you’ll get 2,594 Mbps on the 5 GHz band, and 688 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. These translate into ultra-fast downloads, smooth gaming, and better 4K/8K streaming.</p>
<p>The powerful combination of OFDMA and MU-MIMO technology lets you connect a bunch of devices to your router at the same time, without compromising on the speeds on any of those. Setting everything up couldn’t be any simpler. You can plug the adapter directly into the USB port of your device, or place it nearby using the cradle. The Archer TBE401UH is compatible with Windows 11/10, plus it comes with a preloaded driver, meaning you won’t have to worry about following any complicated installation processes to get started.</p>



<p>Those who take cybersecurity seriously (as everyone should) will appreciate how TP-Link is a signatory of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) Secure-by-Design pledge. The adapter is built and maintained with advanced security. On top of that, the latest WiFi security protocol improves encryption to protect your Wi-Fi passwords and defend against online attacks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6398/">This tiny but mighty device is now down to $80, and is sure to solve all your PC-related internet issues for good.</a> We’d recommend grabbing it at its retail price, too, but the current deal makes it a no-brainer. Be sure to grab it before the retailer decides to push the price back up for good.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Has Acquired The Developers Of March Of Giants]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-acquired-developers-march-of-giants/</link>
            <guid>1383706</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has acquired a new studio. In a press release on Monday, the France-based company announced that it was bringing in the developers of March of Giants. </p>



<p>Terms of the agreement weren’t made public, aside from the fact that Ubisoft will gain the rights to March of Giants and Amazon will provide marketing for the game on Twitch.</p>







<p>March of the Giants is an upcoming 4v4 tactical&nbsp;MOBA that has players fight in lanes and command groups of “comparatively pint-sized enemies”. According to Ubisoft, the gameplay <strong>“combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat with large-scale coordination and mastery of the giant heroes that make up its roster.”</strong> When it launches, the game will be free to play. </p>



<p>With the deal for the Montral team, Ubisoft sees the <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6TYgLsRkVYP97hVH0Rhzn7/ubisoft-acquires-march-of-giants-from-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">former creative director</a> of Rainbow Six Siege, Xavier Marquis, return to the company after seven years.</p>



<p><strong>“Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle,</strong>” Marquis said via release. “<strong>We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level.</strong>“</p>







<p>Also returning to the company is Ubisoft Toronto’s former managing director Alex Parizeau. </p>



<p><strong>“My thanks go to Amazon for their commitment during the first chapters of March of Giants,”</strong> Parizeau said. <strong>“Our closed alpha was an important milestone and showed a glimpse of the game’s real promise. Now, by joining Ubisoft, we’re uniting behind a shared vision to build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs.”</strong></p>



<p>Aside from March of Giants, there’s no word on what the plans are for the former Amazon Games Montreal team with Ubisoft. As the weeks and months go by, those plans are likely to be made known.</p>

Now, by joining Ubisoft, we’re uniting behind a shared vision to build <em>March of Giants</em> into one of the next great, enduring [multiplayer online battle arena games].”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game and team, via Amazon Games:</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Last month, Matthew McConaughey became one of the most prominent actors to endorse artificial intelligence by signing a deal with AI company ElvenLabs that will allow it to utilize his voice. McConaughey is also lending his voice to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/exodus/" data-ref-id="5000-612193">Exodus</a>, an upcoming sci-fi title from BioWare veterans at Archetype Entertainment. But given the timing of McConaughey's new deal, Archetype co-founder Chad Robertson wants players to know that the actor really is lending his voice to the game.</p><p>"Everything that's in Exodus ... is bespoke VO recording just for us," Robertson told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-ai-voice-generation-but-sci-fi-rpg-exodus-authentically-him" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> EXODUS Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Robertson went on to note that Archetype is not using generative AI in the production of its game, but added that using it in the future is a possibility under the right circumstances.</p><p>"So if we ask what our long-term studio stance [on AI] is, we want to be smart technologists, and we want to make great games," said Robertson. "And if for cost reasons or quality reasons, that becomes something that becomes more acceptable and becomes more commonplace, I think we're gonna have to be smart and intelligent about how we adopt it ourselves. But currently we don't have plans."</p><p>Exodus was originally announced at he title at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exodus-announced-a-new-time-bending-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-veterans/1100-6519782/" data-ref-id="1100-6519782">2023's The Game Awards</a>, and it casts players as The Traveler, a character who is tasked with dangerous missions in space to steal technology and weapons from an alien race called the Celestials. McConaughey is lending his voice to a character called C.C. Orlev, but more information about his role is being held back for now.</p><p>A previous trailer for Exodus revealed some of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exodus-gets-a-new-trailer-featuring-cosmic-horrors-and-matthew-mcconaughey/1100-6527187/" data-ref-id="1100-6527187">the horrifying Celestials</a> that the Traveler will encounter. The game also plays with time dilation, as events in space or on an alien world can take place in days and hours while decades pass on Earth--a similar narrative thread used in the McConaughey-starring film Interstellar.</p><p>Exodus is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but it doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

The RPG centers on a band of heroes, hailing from five playable races, to save the world of Rivellon from evil. The game can be played alone or alongside up to three other players in co-op.</p><p>Now, Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition, a 2018 enhanced version featuring an expanded storyline and improved gameplay, has arrived to current gen platforms for $49.99. &nbsp;The game is a free upgrade for existing owners of the last-gen releases across PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.</p><p>Additionally, the last-gen versions of the game are currently on sale at a significant discount for a limited time. On PlayStation, you can pick it up for $14.99 instead of its usual $59.99. On Switch, the game is on sale for $24.99. Xbox owners can pick it up for $17.49.</p><p>We scored Divinity: Original Sin 2 a 9.75 out of 10.

            <p>The second season of Amazon's Fallout adaptation is due to air in just a couple of days time, but don't expect to see Bethesda studio head <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> popping up as a cameo.</p>
<p>Many creators have enjoyed appearing in adaptations of their work, with the likes of Stan Lee often cameoing in Marvel films and shows during his time. Fans would look out for Lee cropping up, with his cameos becoming a rather charming addition to the Marvel cinematic universe and beyond.</p>

<p>But Howard isn't interested in doing something similar for Bethesda in Fallout, though he's been asked several times. "They've offered me a whole bunch, even in season one," Howard told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-explains-why-he-has-turned-down-all-the-offers-to-cameo-in-the-fallout-tv-show-so-far">IGN</a>, explaining he was "going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things."</p>
<p>However, the studio head thinks he is best placed "behind the camera" rather than in front of it. "I said no to all of them so far," Howard furthered, when asked if would perhaps consider being a victim of The Ghoul's. "I don't want to distract," he said. "Everyone goes, 'Oh, there's Todd!'"</p>
<p>But, can he ever see himself being the Stan Lee of Bethesda, even one day? "Not at this time," Howard replied.</p>

'Tis the season to be jolly, even if you happen to be ankle-deep in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Yup, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> 2 is getting into the seasonal spirit of giving with a completely free update promising "hours" of new quests and more - all arriving on Tuesday, 16th December.
</p>
<p>
It's been a busy 2025 for Stalker 2, with developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> having released numerous significant updates for the well-received open-world shooter - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-roadmap-for-2025-includes-a-life-updates-and-an-upgrade-to-a-new-version-of-unreal-engine-5">major fixes for its troublesome A-Life system</a> - alongside a version for PlayStation 5. And it's now wrapping up the year, with a massive new storyline featuring "hours" of gameplay.

<figcaption>Here's a look at Stalker 2's Stories Untold update.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KCLiw3e-b8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"Strange things start happening near the Malachite on the western part of the map," GSC explains <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>. "The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations... You may hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Pay close attention to the Red Forest Region on your map, and from here on, your intuition, rationality and choices will lead you down the rabbit hole to see how deep it is."
</p><p>
And so begins a fresh mystery within the Zone spanning eight new quests and seven locations, including the Car Dump, Army Warehouses, City Boiler Room, Rail Depot, and Volkhov SAM. It also promises six new characters, each with their own backgrounds and stories, a unique weapon - specifically the GP37V2, a modified version of the GP37 rifle that only support single and burst fire modes - plus a new hub to create. The latter, assuming you make the right choices on your adventure, will appear in the Burnt Forest, giving you access to a technician, trader, medic, guide, and more.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl's big free Stories Untold update arrives for all platforms on Tuesday, 16th December. And if you'd like to know more about its recent leap to PlayStation 5, GSC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-something-that-should-be-happening-in-any-version-of-the-civilised-world-the-struggles-of-gsc-game-world-bringing-stalker-2-to-the-ps5">spoke to Eurogamer back in November</a>, discussing, among other things, the difficulties of continuing development amid the ongoing Russian invasion of the Ukraine.

            <title><![CDATA[Dogpile Knows The Best Dog Is A Big Dog]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/dogpile-steam-impressions-review/</link>
            <guid>1383685</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I’m in a fight with my landlord over getting a dog, if “fight” means I texted him about it a couple times and he never answered and now I just drive myself nuts wondering if he’s purposefully not answering so that he doesn’t have to say “no” or if he just regular isn’t answering and I should harangue him. I am a person who should have a dog, and in the absence of one, I get my fix wherever I can: friends’ dogs, convincing dogs on the street to notice me and then pretending to be surprised, and video games that have dogs in them, like <em>Dogpile</em>.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3839300/Dogpile/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Dogpile</u></em></a><em> </em>is a collaboration between two Australian studios, Studio Folly and Toot Games. You have a deck of dog cards, which you play to drop dogs into a yard. If two dogs of the same type touch, they merge to form a bigger dog. Those bigger dogs merge to form even <em>bigger</em> dogs, and you keep merging dogs until you either win by getting the <em>biggest</em> dog, or your dogs spill out of your yard and you have to start over. There’s also the smaller goal of earning an increasing amount of “bones” in a certain number of hands, with penalties coming into play if you don’t make the requirement.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0vX6nnTDwJo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Dogpile - Official Release Year Announcement Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>I appreciate a game that understands that the best dog is a big dog (a problem for my own desire to have a dog, since I have a very small apartment). The game’s dogs are very charming, from tiny angry chihuahuas to greyhounds that look like they’ve been up too late doomscrolling to golden retrievers that just look happy to be included.&nbsp;</p><p>Size isn’t the only quality of a dog you have to pay attention to. Dogs can have traits: friendly dogs will be drawn toward dogs of their type, while timid dogs will move away from other dogs. This can be really useful for space management, helping jostle dogs around to get them to touch. Some dogs can be unusually big or small, and dogs can also get fleas that make their traits not work. My least favorite trait is “crated,” which prevents a dog from merging for several turns. You can change dogs’ traits in an interface stylized like a dog wash, removing bad ones or adding good ones.</p><p>In the game’s pet shop, you can buy new dog cards or “tags” that modify your game, such as by making all the dogs super bouncy (I thought this would be great, but it backfired on me). The tags add a metagame over the whole thing that I’m sure will appeal to strategy nerds, but honestly I most like just dropping the dogs into the yard, watching them tumble and then pop into another kind of dog, and seeing all of them pile up in an awkward, jostling crush.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole thing is bright, cute, and chill, and it ate up most of my Friday night as I said things like “get over there, butt dog” and “aah, no more puffballs” at my computer. <em>Dogpile </em>is out now on Steam.</p>

Who's that I hear coming down my chimney? Why, it's… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/megabonk">Megabonk's</a> "Spooky" update? No, that doesn't sound quite right to me either, and yet it is in fact the truth of this world. As you've probably already gathered by the name of the update, this is one that was meant to be out for Halloween, but developer Vedinad needed a touch more time for it.
</p>
<p>
As explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3405340/view/523110495538905880?l=english">Steam post</a> detailing all the new stuff, it was originally planned as just a tiny Halloween update, but they wanted to add in a few other bits and pieces, so the workload just ended up being bigger. Anyway, here's some of the bits you can expect from the update, which is admittedly scant in precise details.
</p>
<p>
There's a new map, character, weapon, as well as new items, enemies and bosses, achievements, and challenges. To get any more insight on any of this, you'll have to play the game for yourself, as the post literally says nothing else about new additions. Although, the game's Zwitter account <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/2000274122127897019">does note</a> that there's "canned spaghetti with extra sauce," if that means anything to anyone.
</p>
<p>
It's not just new things, however. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> clone should look a bit smoother late-game with some FPS improvements for one. A number of bugs have been fixed, including one where you could buy items you didn't have unlocked, and another annoying one where the game might reset when teleporting to the next stage to keep your progress, and in turn resulting in not moving to the next stage.
</p><p>
There's a bunch of balancing bits and new settings to be found as well, and an interesting addition for speedrunner, potentially. You can now open up the game's console, which as noted by the devs, is "only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something." Anyway, what's next, a Christmas update in July? Humbug!

            <guid>1383664</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/2025-best-games-monster-hunter-split-fiction-avowed-1851767689">We got a lot of great games in 2025.</a> Some big, some small. But not every game released over the last 12 months was good. Some were meh. And others, well, others were downright terrible.</p> <p>As we’ve said before, the best games are only great if we can compare them to mediocre or awful games. And 2025 had plenty of these to choose from.&nbsp;So let’s take a look at some of the worst-reviewed games of 2025.</p> <p>But before we do that, it’s worth repeating once again that liking a “bad” game isn’t a <em>bad</em> thing. Numbered scores come with all sorts of caveats, which is part of the reason we don’t use them at <em>Kotaku</em>. And Metacritic’s aggregate isn’t perfect by any stretch. If you see a game on this list that you happen to love, don’t get mad, just smugly nod to yourself and remind yourself that the critics got it wrong.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2020-according-to-metacritic-1845913017?_gl=1*1906hd1*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MDg3NDQuNTcuMC4w">Now,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/worst-games-2024-metacritic-review-scores-funko-jjk-1851714921">as we’ve</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2021-according-to-metacritic-1848234861?_gl=1*1ij1sdw*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzQxNDU4NS44My4xLjE3MzM0Mjg3OTguNDIuMC4w">done in</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2019-according-to-metacritic-1840668824?_gl=1*66bxk9*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MTI4MDEuNjAuMC4w">previous years</a>, here are the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/pictures/worst-videogames-of-2025/9/">10 worst-rated games on&nbsp;Metacritic</a> (they had to receive at least four reviews to qualify).</p> <h2>10: <em>Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition</em> | 45 Metascore</h2>  <p>Even priced at $30, this budget racer port of a so-so arcade game isn’t worth it. You are better off dropping a few quarters into the original arcade version and playing for a few minutes of nonsense before realizing it has little to offer and moving on.</p>

 <h2>9: <em>Glover</em> |&nbsp; 44 Metascore</h2>  <p><em>Glover</em> is back. I’m so sorry. This port of the OG N64 platformer that someone liked, surely, isn’t much of an upgrade, and even if it was, this is still <em>Glover</em> we are talking about, folks. It’s lucky to make any list.</p>

 <h2>8: <em>Scar-Lead Salvation</em> | 44 Metascore</h2>  <p>Wait a minute, this game has the same metascore as <em>Glover</em>, and yet it is worse? Yeah, I’m ranking it below <em>Glover</em> as it has more reviews, so more people didn’t like this pricey and basic anime spin on a <em>Returnal</em>-esque roguelike shooter.</p>

 <h2>7: <em>Ambulance Life: A Paramedic Simulator</em> | 44 Metascore</h2>  <p>Oh, and look at that, one more game that landed at a 44 Metascore.<em> Ambulance Life</em> slides just below whatever the last game was because even more people played, reviewed it, and didn’t like its AI-generated dialogue, clunky gameplay, and ugly visuals.</p>

 <h2>6: <em>Tamagotchi Plaza – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em> | 43 Metascore</h2>  <p>This sequel to <em>Tamagotchi Connection: Corner Shop</em> falls flat on its face because it plays like a bad mobile game and has some truly repetitive minigames.</p> <h2>5: <em>Gore Doctor</em> | 40 Metascore</h2>  <p><em>Gore Doctor i</em>s the first game on the list that I had never heard of before, and now that I do know about it, I’m happy to have avoided this horror game that is apparently a technical mess with terrible controls.</p>

 <h2>4: <em>Spy Drops</em> | 39 Metascore</h2>  <p>Someone wanted to make a stealth-action game like the OG <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>. Sadly, this game is bogged down by a lot of problems, including a bad camera, bugs, and brain-dead enemy AI.</p> <h2>3:<em> Blood of Mehran</em> | 38 Metascore</h2>  <p>Critics really disliked this <em>Prince of Persia</em>-like action game, with nearly every review calling it some form of terrible. Avoid at all costs.</p> <h2>2: <em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em> | 37 Metascore</h2>  <p>What if <em>Among Us,</em> but <em>Fire Emblem</em>? That was seemingly the pitch for this mobile-only Nintendo-published dud. Even the few good ideas are overshadowed by free-to-play garbage and a lack of content.

              <p>If you’ve been considering a PC upgrade, there’s no better moment than right now. Windows 11 Pro—Microsoft’s most up-to-date and feature-rich operating system—is currently being offered at an unusually steep discount. Instead of paying the typical $200 price tag, you can pick up a genuine license for just $10 through StackSocial. That amounts to roughly 94% off. It’s an appealing option whether you’re replacing an outdated OS or finalizing a new computer build, but it just got even more appealing. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">We at Kotaku managed to score you an even better deal. If you use our exclusive discount code<strong> KOTAKU10</strong>, you’ll end up saving yourself an extra 10%.</a> Now, sure, that 10% works out to 99 cents. You might be thinking that pretty negligible, but that’s nonsense. Money saved is money saved. Get Windows 11 Pro for just $9.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Smarter Tools Designed to Boost Productivity</h2>
<p>One of the most helpful additions to Windows 11 Pro is Universal Search, conveniently placed right on the taskbar. This feature acts as a centralized search engine for your entire device and beyond. It simultaneously scans your applications, documents, photo library, and even the web. Doesn’t matter if you’re hunting for a PowerPoint file, trying to pull up a recipe you saved months ago, or quickly checking a location on a map, Universal Search streamlines the process. Instead of digging through folders or juggling browser tabs, you now have a one stop shop for anything you’d ever need to find in a single search bar.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro of course is built from the ground up for OneDrive integration. With OneDrive, your files stay synchronized across all your devices without any extra effort. Saving a document on your desktop means you can retrieve it later on your laptop, tablet, or smartphone. This cloud-based workflow is especially valuable for remote workers, students, and anyone juggling multiple devices. While OneDrive itself requires a separate subscription, the reliability and accessibility it offers make it a beneficial companion to Windows 11 that’s definitely worth dipping into.</p>



<p>The operating system also shines with its improved Virtual Desktops feature. By enabling Task View, you can build multiple customized desktops tailored to different aspects of your life. You can have one desktop dedicated to work, another for entertainment and browsing, a third for launching all your games, and perhaps a separate one devoted to creative projects. Each virtual desktop can sport its own layout, wallpaper, and shortcuts, helping you maintain organized spaces that you can switch between them effortlessly.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about some of the several lesser-known keyboard shortcuts that can noticeably speed up your day-to-day tasks. A great example is the Win + V command, which opens your clipboard history. Unlike the standard Ctrl + V function, which pastes only your most recent copied item, Win + V lets you select from multiple previously copied clips. This is incredibly handy when filling out forms, gathering research, or moving text around without constantly swapping between tabs or apps.</p>
<p>StackSocial’s heavily discounted offer won’t last forever. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to upgrade your operating system, securing a Windows 11 Pro license for under $10 is an opportunity worth jumping on before it disappears. And remember to use the code <strong>KOTAKU10</strong> to save that extra $1, bringing it to $9.</p>

            <guid>1383655</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning, and welcome to your previously scheduled Monday. Don’t watch the clock, and this terrible day will end soon. Until then, enjoy this installment of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. This time around, we get an update on <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em>, check in on <em>Fallout Shelter</em>, and perhaps sing that famous Grinch Christmas song.</p> <h2><strong>Casey Hudson denies claims that <em>FOTOR</em> is five years away</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-rpr-kotor-fate-of-the-republic-2000652729">During last week’s Game Awards, S<em>tar Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em> was revealed</a>, and people got excited. A spiritual successor to<em> Knights of the Old Republic</em> led by that game’s director, Casey Hudson, who also helped create <em>Mass Effect</em>? Heck yeah. But, as pointed out by a few different reporters, this new<em> Star Wars</em> game is being developed by a studio that’s just a few months old and so, folks speculated, the game was likely a long way off, possibly not launching until 2030.&nbsp; This speculation quickly snowballed into full-on “rumors” and spread like wildfire, without proper context online, eventually leading to Hudson <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">publicly denying the 2030 date on social media</a>.</p>

 <p>“Don’t worry about the ‘not till 2030’ rumors,” <a href="https://x.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">posted Hudson</a> on December 12. “Game will be out before then. I’m not getting any younger!”</p> <p>And while I’d love to be playing <em>FOTOR</em> sooner rather than later, I am curious as to why Hudson is so confident that something as large as a new <em>KOTOR</em>-like<em> Star Wars</em> RPG can be developed in under five years by a team that was just formed a few months ago. Maybe they have a super solid, streamlined plan with lots of support and resources to spare? Or maybe Hudson found a genie lamp? Regardless, according to Hudson, <em>FOTOR</em> will be out sometime before 2030. Place your bets now.</p>

 <h2><strong>10 years later, and <em>Fallout Shelter</em> just got its biggest update ever</strong></h2> <p>Mobile bunker-builder <em>Fallout Shelter</em> has been around since June 2015. And despite its age, <em>Shelter</em> is still extremely popular, receiving ports to console and PC and numerous updates. Its most recent one, out now, is its biggest yet, adding seasons, new characters, quests, and more connections to Amazon’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> show.</p>

 <p>“Rejoice, Overseers – <em>Fallout Shelter</em>’s biggest update yet is here,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588430/Fallout_Shelter/">explained Bethesda on the game’s Steam page</a>. “Years of content previously only available on mobile is now available on Steam, including new questlines, characters, weapons, themes, and more.” It ain’t <em>Fallout 5,</em> but at least it’s something.</p>

 <h2><strong>Arcade1Up might have shut down over the weekend</strong></h2> <p>Over the weekend, as reported by <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/12/reports-suggest-arcade1up-is-shutting-down"><em>Time Extension</em></a>, an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcade1Up/comments/1pjy92j/megathread_arcade1up_is_shutting_down/">email was shared online</a> that seemed to indicate that Arcade1Up, a company that specializes in creating modern arcade cabinets, was shutting down. The reported internal email, which was sent on December 10, claims that Arcade1Up shut down on December 12 and that the future of the brand is unknown. At least one dev studio that had worked with the arcade makers has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcade1Up/comments/17cia8r/comment/k5umj6g/">already indicated</a> that its classic ports will still support online play via a backdoor that players will be able to turn on in the future if the shutdown affects online servers. So far, Arcade1Up has yet to confirm or deny the reports of its demise.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Katamari Damacy’s</em> creator might be done making games after T<em>o a T</em> sold poorly</strong></h2> <p>Keita Takahashi, the creator of <em>Katamari Damacy,</em> released a new and odd-looking game this year, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/annapurna-interactive-indie-to-a-t-giraffe-song-sugar-1851766204">To a T</a>,&nbsp;</em>and if that’s the first you’re hearing about it, well, you aren’t alone. Apparently, the famed creator says the game didn’t sell well, and it has potentially forced him out of the game industry.</p>

 <p>“I recently returned to Japan, and one of the reasons I had to do so was because <em>T</em><em>o a T</em>&nbsp;didn’t sell well,” <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/i-wish-i-had-the-katamari-damacy-ip-to-a-t-was-meant-to-counter-the-downer-vibes-of-2019-america-but-keita-takahashi-says-it-didnt-sell-well-and-fears-it-just-wasnt-a-good-fit/">Takahashi recently told <em>GamesRadar</em>.</a> “My next goal is to support my children and find them a school in Japan. Then, if I feel that I don’t belong in the games industry, I’ll have to look elsewhere.”</p> <p>It’s a real shame that an offbeat game like <em>To a T,</em> struggled to find an audience in 2025, and when the developer was asked if there was still room for weird, experimental games in the industry, Takahashi said “I’m not sure” and admitted that it’s “definitely” become harder for him to make these kinds of games anymore.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106">Here’s our review of <em>Pokémon’s</em> new DLC</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-release-date-trailer-2000653076">Learn more about<em> Fate of the Old Republic</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-id-software-union-microsoft-xbox-cwa-2000653008">The makers of <em>Doom</em> have formed a union</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

And if you're wondering what Divinity even is, Larian has now released the latest game in the series, Divinity: Original Sin II, on the newest modern platforms, with a free upgrade available.</p><p>The game launched today, December 15, for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2. People who own a copy of the game for Switch, PS4, or Xbox One can download the Upgrade Pack for free. The exception is Japan, where the upgrade costs a nominal fee of ¥100, or about 64 cents.</p><p>For anyone just buying the game now, it normally sells for $50, but on Xbox, Original Sin II is<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition/bw8pvl4cj2q6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> marked down to $17.50 right now</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqmsdEAMY0aDufiuPCF6PPoTp05uXd5tWBfwuK2LOLtlT8PAdIi" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$25 on Switch</a>, or <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3526-PPSA06865_00-ORIGINALSIN2XPS5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$15 on PlayStation.</a></p><p>The new version of Original Sin II is not a remake or a remaster, but instead it is, "Your way to experience the classic DOS:2 on the current generation of consoles," Larian said. The developer did not provide any further details on any possible improvements or updates on the new hardware.</p><p>Divinity: Original Sin II was originally released in 2016 as a sequel to 2014's Divinity: Original Sin. The turn-based tactical RPG was highly regarded, scoring a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/divinity-original-sin-2-review/1900-6416769/" data-ref-id="1900-6416769">10/10 at GameSpot</a> and picking up <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/divinity-original-sin-ii/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other high marks from critics and fans.</a></p><p>As for the new Divinity game that was just recently announced, Larian said the new title will "offer a completely new story." However, the game also has "some continuity and characters" from past games.</p><p>The game made waves at The Game Awards in part for its intense CGI announcement trailer that featured people having sex in front of a pyre where a man was burned alive.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/digital-foundrys-graphics-of-the-year-awards-nod-to-some-switch-2-beauties</link>
            <guid>1383619</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>2026 is almost upon us, so naturally, everyone is thinking about end-of-year awards. Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025-all-switch-1-and-2-reveals">hosted his ceremony last week</a>, and today, it's time for the tech experts from <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/digital-foundrys-2025-graphics-of-the-year-awards">Digital Foundry</a> to get involved, as they run down their best graphics of 2025.</p>
<p>It will come as no surprise that the shortlist this year is mainly comprised of titles found on PS5 and Xbox Series, with the likes of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/mafia_the_old_country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> getting their flowers, but a handful of Switch newbies got a nod too.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry dedicated the entirety of its honourable mentions section to the Switch 2 this year, giving a shoutout to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> for "maximising the Tegra T239 in different ways", and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which DF calls "currently Switch 2's best 'impossible port'." The outlet also highlights Panic Button's work on the Switch 1-to-2 upgrades.</p>
<p>That's not to say that Switch 2 is entirely absent from the official top 10, mind you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> lands a spot all of its own, with DF calling Samus' latest "a lighting masterwork - a prime (pun intended) example of how pre-baked lighting inside carefully crafted environments, whether fully indoors or exposed to outdoor elements, can implement attractive lighting phenomena like emissive lighting while also organically leading players."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Switch 1 version</a> of MP4 even gets a shoutout in the Digital Foundry listing, with the outlet praising how it delivers "so much ecosystem diversity within large exploration zones at a steady 60fps, building upon the already impressive likes of Metroid Prime 1 Remastered to push the 2017 console to its limits."</p>
<p>As ever, Digital Foundry's top 10 is unordered until hitting the top three, with the seven preceding entries sorted alphabetically instead. Here's the full list, as laid out on the Digital Foundry website:</p>
<p><strong>- Dying Light: The Beast</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Earthion</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Ghost of Yōtei</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Mafia: The Old Country</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Routine</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Silent Hill f</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Assassin's Creed: Shadows</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Doom: The Dark Ages</strong></p>
<p>A pretty good year for good-looking games, then! You'll find the team's explanation for each entry either in the video at the top of this article or by heading over to the <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/digital-foundrys-2025-graphics-of-the-year-awards">DF site</a>.</p>

		<p>Embark has revealed what’s coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> this week, as the game embraces the end of year festivities in one way, and the cooling weather in another. There’s a new Cold Snap map condition to endure, and Flickering Flames to warm you up when you get back to safety.</p>
<p><iframe title="Flickering Flames Winter Event | ARC Raiders" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdGMteCqknE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Cold Snap is a new map condition from 16th December, as brutal cold and blizzard can roll in and force you to approach scavengine missions in a different way.</p>
<p>Embark say, “The freezing weather will cut your Raider down in minutes unless you get indoors, or heal up quickly. Bear this in mind when engaging other Raiders – getting pinned down in the open is a death sentence during a Rust Belt winter.”</p>
<p>And with the difficulties above, Speranza is also having to endure food scarcity and rolling blackouts by gathering in candle light and sharing what little they have. Flickering Flames is the name for this event, which runs from 16th December through 13th January.</p>

<p>You’ve got two new major goals when heading above the surface, looking to gather the Candleberry Bush which sustains the city through the winter, and also light and heat sources to boost morale.</p>
<p>Candleberries and light and heat special items will be rewarded with:</p>
<ul>
<li value="1">Raider Tokens</li>
<li value="2">New items</li>
<li value="3">Rare utility items</li>
<li value="4">Weapons</li>
<li value="5">Cosmetics</li>
<li value="6">Merits</li>
</ul>

<p>And then, as a Christmas treat, the second free and permanent Raider Deck is coming to the game on 26th December. This is a string of items to unlock, Raider Tokens and cosmetics,, building up to the hockey-inspired outfit and hockey stick “tool” of The Goalie.</p>

			<p>Artificial Intelligence is rapidly becoming a key component across many industries, and video game development is certainly not absent from this trend. While several publishers are accelerating the push to integrate AI tools into their studios, the inconsistent results and the associated concerns over job displacement for human artists and developers continue to make this push highly controversial.</p>



<p>However, with the right approach, AI can deliver some frankly impressive results in video games, as highlighted in a new video showcasing an AI remake of the beloved The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p>



<p>This AI remake was created by <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Aillusory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aillusory</a></strong>, who titled their project <em>“The Witcher 3 but it's AI slop - Reimagined by AI.”</em> Despite the creator’s self-deprecating label, this fan project utilized AI to generate photorealistic visuals from footage captured from the original game, overhauling nearly every visual element—from environments to characters. </p>



<p>The results are not perfect, but it's undeniable that this AI remake looks impressive more often than not. It largely retains the original game's recognizable art style for both environments and characters while enhancing them in a fairly credible, photorealistic fashion.</p>



<p>The end results are so impressive that users are consistently praising them. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"AI will first become the best reshade filter, before it's used to make games,"</em> said YouTube commenter misapheonix, a sentiment that is easy to share, considering the quality of this AI-powered remake.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regardless of potential AI enhancements, an official, CD Projekt RED-developed remake of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is likely years away. The original game has aged quite well, and its visuals continue to improve thanks to the dedication of the modding community. Known modder Halk Hogan announced last month that a new version of their <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-2026-announced-with-new-trailer/"><strong>HD Reworked Project is scheduled to launch in 2026.</strong></a></p>



<p>Despite the lack of an immediate official overhaul, we will see more of Geralt of Rivia in the future. Besides hopefully appearing in <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher IV</strong></a>, the White Wolf will return in the complete remake of the first entry in the series. Developed by Fool's Theory, this remake promises to breathe new life into one of the most iconic RPGs released in the early 2000s, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-announced-unreal-engine-5/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">complete with improved visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5</strong></a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-full-open-world/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">a host of other enhancements.</strong></a> The official release window for this remake remains unknown.</p>

As the name suggests, the Spooky Update was originally intended to launch sometime around Halloween.</p><p>In terms of new content, you're getting a brand new map, a new character to play as, and a new weapon to use, as well as new items to collect, new enemies and bosses to fight, and new achievements to give you even more motivation to blast your way through <em>Megabonk</em>'s hordes.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you've been struggling with <em>Megabonk</em>'s performance as you move into the late game, you'll be pleased to note that the Spooky Update also adds "a lot of improvements to FPS late-game", so hopefully, you shouldn't be quite so beset by lag now.</p><p>That's all in addition to tons of new bug fixes and gameplay tweaks that should improve the way <em>Megabonk </em>works under the hood.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2</a>'s getting a bunch of new quests just in time for the holidays, with an update dubbed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stories-untold">Stories Untold</a> sending you off to investigate a mysterious headache-inducing radio signal when it arrives tomorrow, December 16th. There'll also be a new hub area in the Burnt Forest and a new suppressed rifle for you to fiddle with as you chill by the campfire.</p>

<p>Announced, seemingly a bit ahead of time judging by the trailer being an unlisted video, by a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the update's since been <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/2000587226904744392">acknowledged by developers GSC themselves</a> via some eye emojis and <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/2000593761798336770">confirmation</a> that it'll also be coming to PC.</p>
<p>The update's story takes place across eight new quests which GSC stress "can take hours to complete", with new locations and characters waiting for you along the way. Strange things start happening near the Malachite on the western part of the map," reads the tale's synopsis. "The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations.</p><p>"Professor Medulin witnessed everything with his own eyes. While being good at scientific research, he didn’t know enough about the radio signal and what to do to figure out what was happening. That’s where Banzai steps in, a radio enthusiast, who also joined the investigation, but something went wrong." To get started, you'll need to listen out for an emergency transmission which'll seemingly lead you towards the Red Forest.</p>
<p>Naturally, you can't have a new quest without a new gun, so the update's introducing the GP37V2 rifle - a GP37 which had had a suppressor stuck to it and been messed with so it only fires single shots or bursts. GSC stress that its uber-tactical nature means it's suited to the most tactically tactical of tacticians. You can also just take along your tried and tested old gun.</p>
<p>Finally the update can end up adding a new hub to the Burning Forest, where you'll be able to rest for a bit before heading back out. It sounds like whether you get this extra chill spot will depend on which choices you make as you investigate the mysterious signal.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-idea-tab-becomes-the-cheapest-android-tablet-with-a-holiday-discount-lowest-price-of-the-year-2000653357</link>
            <guid>1383589</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tablets make it incredibly easy to stay both productive and entertained on the go. These are also great for students who don’t want to carry a huge laptop to college and are looking to take notes or work on assignments digitally. The Lenovo Idea Tab does an excellent job at that, and Amazon is letting you pick one up without spending a ton.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">It typically goes for around $240, but thanks to a nice 25% discount, you can grab yourself one for just $180.</a> The tablet comes with a pen for easy navigation, plus a folio case, which makes it safe to carry around. The deal is open to all shoppers, but it’s likely to ship after Christmas. If that’s not an issue, we suggest jumping on the discount as soon as you can!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packs a Punch</h2>
<p>The tablet flaunts an 11-inch 2.5K IPS touchscreen display. It delivers sharp visuals while actively reducing blue light emission to keep the screen comfortable on the eyes; great for exam season, where you might need to pull all-nighters with it. The display is nicely paired with immersive sound, thanks to quad Dolby Atmos-tuned speakers. You will be able to take online lectures comfortably, while still enjoying your study breaks by squeezing in an episode of Stranger Things to take your mind off complicated maths problems.</p>
<p>Four learning apps – including Lenovo AI Note, Squid, Nebo, and MyScript Calculator – come built in. These let you write down important points during the lecture, organize tasks, sketch some diagrams, and perform basic mathematical calculations without needing to install another program. Performing quick Google searches has never been easier, either. A quick circle around items or text pulls up the answers you’re looking for, and it even translates content into your preferred language without switching to another app. The included Lenovo Tab Pen takes the experience even further. It makes it quite convenient to scroll, swipe, draw, and jot thoughts down.</p>



<p>Behind the scenes is a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 6300 processor working tirelessly to keep everything running smoothly. The 8GB memory lets you do a bunch (using multiple applications, switching tabs) without experiencing noticeable slowdowns, while the 256 GB built-in storage offers plenty of space to store all your important files and programs. You will be able to keep all your essential programs, group presentations, final year projects, and more in a single place without feeling limited.</p>
<p>As for the battery, you can expect around 12 hours of continuous use on a single charge. That’s enough to go at least two days without worrying about plugging it in. And finally, the included case lets you prop the thing up anywhere you want, with stability. You can use it in the classroom, cafeteria, on your way back home, and even on the couch easily.</p>
<p>All of these features come together to make the Lenovo Idea Tab one of the best tablets for students and work professionals on the market. It’s made to handle work and play efficiently, and the long battery life makes it quite easy to carry with you when you’re out and about. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">Be sure to grab it before the deal expires if you want to avoid paying the full $240 for it. Once the discount is gone, we don’t expect it to be back before New Year’s.</a></p>

<p>The head of studio at Crystal Dynamics has revealed that players don’t need to do homework with previous games before jumping into Tomb Raider: The Catalyst. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Game Awards 2025 made dreams come true for Tomb Raider fans with not one, but two new game announcements. The first is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake of the original 1996&nbsp;title</a>, arriving during the franchise’s 30th anniversary. The other is a brand new chapter that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-catalyst-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takes Lara Croft to northern India</a>. We have now received some new details for the latest chapter. </p>







<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-catalyst-is-the-largest-game-for-the-franchise-to-date">Tomb Raider: Catalyst is the ‘Largest Game’ for the Franchise To Date</h2>



<p>During a virtual Q&amp;A session attended by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/tomb-raider-catalyst-is-crystal-dynamics-largest-lara-croft-game-yet-and-theres-no-homework-required-to-jump-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Crystal Dynamics Head of Studio, Scot Amos, provided more details about Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Amos first spoke about the timeline, revealing that the game is set in “the furthest point in [Lara Croft’s] career”. This is where the character is right now, and “everything else is her history”. However, even though this is the furthest point, new players don’t need to play the previous games before Catalyst. </p>



<p>Amos explains that Tomb Raider Catalyst has been designed in a way where new players “can jump in right now and pick up with her adventures as is, like I say, there’s no homework required.” Players who try the new game will feel “this [is a] complete adventure top to bottom, and understand the story and the characters without having to know any of that pre-history.”</p>



<p>The head of studio also revealed that this is “the largest Tomb Raider” that they have ever created, and they are excited about bringing this experience to everyone. The game also features “really vast and varied landscapes as well that are just begging to be explored.”</p>







<p>In other news, Tomb Raider co-creator says he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-co-creator-prefers-new-chapters-over-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prefers new chapters over the remake</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-prime-video-amazon-sigourney-weaver-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien star</a>&nbsp;is in talks to feature in Prime Video’s Tomb Raider series.

<p>And it's a free upgrade for Switch 1 owners</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Surprise, folks! Larian Studios has dropped a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>. Oh, and it's out <em>right now</em>, and if you already own the game on Switch 1, you can upgrade for free.</p>
<p>It's <strong>$49.99 / £44.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) on Switch 2. However, if you buy the Switch 1 version and then grab the free upgrade pack, it'll only cost you <strong>$24.99 / £22.49</strong> until <strong>7th January 2026</strong>. So save some pennies and grab the Switch 1 version!</p>
<p>Larian, clearly riding on a high after its showcase for a new Divinity game at The Game Awards last week, are treating fans to a sparkly version of the critically-acclaimed CRPG. We don't know what the Switch 2 Edition adds to the experience besides higher resolutions and a better frame rate; can we hope for Mouse Mode?</p>
<p>Here's a little flavour text about the game, just in case you missed out on this pre-Baldur's Gate 3 classic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the creators of Baldur’s Gate 3, experience the world of Divinity in this epic adventure where your choices shape fate itself.</p>
<p>The Divine is dead. The Void approaches. And the powers lying dormant within you are soon to awaken. Choose your role in a BAFTA-winning story, and explore a world that reacts to who you are, and the choices you make. With five races to choose from, and an adventure playable solo or as a party of up to four, lay waste to an oppressive order in a world afraid of magic. Become the God the world so desperately needs.</p>
<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2: Definitive Edition is the most complete version of the best-selling, Metacritic Must-Play RPG.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The game was already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">brilliant on Switch</a>, so we're excited to dive in and lose another hundred hours to this behemoth.</p>

			<p>As creative collaborations go, the combination of Spec Ops: The Line’s Cory Davis and Robin Finck from Nine Inch Nails is as enticing as it gets. When Sleep Awake was first announced, the names involved left me anticipating a thrilling and subversive narrative backed up by a thumping industrial soundtrack. The actual game we got certainly ticks those boxes to some degree, but is it another success story for Blumhouse Games after the excellent Fear The Spotlight?</p>
<p><iframe title="Do. Not. Sleep... SLEEP AWAKE is Out Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gogkM13Cqcc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developers Eyes Out state on their website that they “believe in a powerful synaesthesia emerging from music, narrative, and interactive experiences,” and this manifesto perfectly explains the nature of Sleep Awake. Mixing traditional first person exploration with surreal live action cutscenes, and with all the action being accompanied by a superbly varied and atmospheric score, Sleep Awake takes the ‘walking simulator’ and makes it far more cinematic in scope and feel. It feels strange that this title hasn’t been released on VR devices to be honest. Regardless, it is essential that you play this through decent headphones if you can.</p>


<p>Sleep Awake takes place in a strange world that has been ravaged by the Hush, a mysterious presence that steals away anybody who falls asleep. The few remaining survivors of this nocturnal apocalypse must find new ways to stay awake by whatever means necessary, but different sects have very different ideas of how to do this. You play as Katja, a young girl who uses combinations of herbs to concoct eyedrops to stave off tiredness whilst other groups prefer pain and/or bodily mutilation to achieve the same goal. Your first actions in the game are to find the herbs around your flat in order to make such a tincture, a tutorial section that works well to immerse you into the game’s world. Once you have made the drops you set out to deliver them to Amma, and then the strangeness really begins.</p>


<p>At times, Sleep Awake is visually stunning with neon drenched skylines and dingy, dilapidated buildings at ground level. Other areas feel a little more repetitive but there isn’t much backtracking so the game is always pushing you forward to see new things. Enemies are present but act as moving obstacles rather than antagonists with their presence mostly restricted to several scripted chase sequences and thankfully short stealth sections. The vibe here is very much that of a walking simulator with occasional horror and puzzles to mix things up.</p>
<p>The narrative in Sleep Awake is mostly relayed through environmental storytelling (and Katja’s frequent monologues in response to said environment) but there are also microfiches to find that reveal some of the backstory and lore of the world. There are also spiritual echoes called void shadows left by some taken by the Hush. Katja is able to tap into these shadows and reveal the trapped memories within. Whilst it is never really explained &nbsp;how she is able to do this, the latter parts of the game point to some kind of family connection to the Hush, a connection that is clearly foreshadowing for future entries in the Sleep Awake universe.</p>
<p>This points to one of the most divisive aspects of the game – it feels very much like the prologue to a greater story and, as such, is quite a short experience. I took my time and found almost every collectable and still didn’t get to the five hour mark.</p>

<p>Let me be clear here, I’m not arguing that games have to meet a minimum number of hours to be considered worthwhile (indeed I’ve given high scores to many shorter and more focused titles) but the story here feels like it stops just as it starts to get going. The pacing within those five hours is a little uneven as so much happens towards the end that the game before it feels more like an opening chapter. I hope that Blumhouse support Eyes Out to continue the story but recent experiences in the world of game development leave me apprehensive.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		There's a lot of promise to Sleep Awake, which makes its short runtime all the more frustrating.&nbsp;The fusion of visuals, music, and narrative are reminiscent of peak Remedy titles and the inevitable cliffhanger ending definitely leaves me wanting to find out more about Katja’s story. I’ll be listening to that Robin Finck soundtrack in the meantime and crossing my fingers.	</p></div>

		<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/divinity-revealed-by-larian-studios-who-probably-watched-the-wicker-man-recently/">Divinity’s announcement at The Game Awards</a> (and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-could-be-imminent-following-sequel-announcement/">some rumours swirling</a>), Larian Studio has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2 –&nbsp;Definitive Edition</a> is now available on Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5, with free upgrades for existing owners.</p>
<p><iframe title="Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Now Available On Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, &amp; PlayStation 5!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K_vKMo7DEI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in Larian’s original fantasy setting, Divinity: Original Sin 2 was an acclaimed sequel to the studio’s turn-based RPG revival through the 2010s – a revival that eventually led to the even more acclaimed and beloved <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/05/baldurs-gate-3-review-ps5-pc/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>!</p>
<p>While Larian hasn’t dug into the technical details, you can expect that this upgraded release will offer improved resolutions and frame rates compared to the game on original Switch, PS4 and Xbox One. There was already support for 4K on PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, but native versions on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S should allow for 60fps.This isn’t a remake or remaster, just a fairly simple port.</p>
<ul>
<li>On PS5, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now simply a cross-buy PS5 and PS4 game – i<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP3383-PPSA06866_00-ORIGINALSIN2XPS5">t’s also on sale for £12.49</a> right now!</li>
<li>On Xbox One and Series X|S the game is now cross-gen – <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition/bw8pvl4cj2q6">it’s on sale for £14.52</a> currently.</li>
<li>On Switch 2, however, you’ll want to head to the Nintendo eShop and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Divinity-Original-Sin-2-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2988295.html">search for the free upgrade pack</a> if you own the game on original Switch. The RRP is £44.99 for the game on Switch 2, but <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Divinity-Original-Sin-2-Definitive-Edition-1633057.html">you can currently buy the Switch 1 edition for £22.49</a> and then upgrade for free, so…. uh…. go and do that instead?</li>
</ul>
<p>While free in most locations, Japan has a nominal ¥100 fee on Switch and PlayStation.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/09/26/divinity-original-sin-2-review/">Divinity: Original Sin 2 review</a> we scored the game a smashing 9/10, saying that it was “the strongest CRPG in decades, with a fascinating plot that enthrals, despite taking a while to get going and being hard as nails at times. It’s the little adventures that flesh out the world and so much of it can be missed at first glance because you didn’t have the right skill or failed a persuasion check. Massive in scope and jam packed with features that includes a GM mode that shows a surprising amount of customisation with great ease, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a bumper package.”</p>

              <p><em>Megabonk</em>, a 3D reimagining of <em>Vampire Survivors </em>that became one of 2025’s surprise hits, has somewhat belatedly released its Halloween update just in time for the winter holidays. But hey, Christmas has always been spook-adjacent, right? There’s <em>A Christmas Carol</em>,&nbsp;<em>Krampus</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>…</p> <p>“yoo I’ve finally finished the update I was working on,” said solo developer Vedinad <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3405340?updates=true&amp;emclan=103582791474891212&amp;emgid=523110495538905880">in a post on Steam</a>. “Was originally going to be a small halloween update, but I wanted to make it a bit bigger so it turned into a bit more work than I initially planned.” He goes on to list the new content added in the Spooky Update:</p>

 <ul> <li>New Map</li> <li>New Character</li> <li>New Weapon</li> <li><wbr>New Items</li> <li><wbr>New Enemies and Bosses</li> <li><wbr>New Achievements and challenges<wbr></li> </ul> <p><em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;is an unabashed reinterpretation of Poncle’s <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, albeit with a few original twists of its own, not least that it’s now a 3D, third-person action game. It came out in September this year and absolutely exploded in popularity almost right away. And deservedly so! <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-vampire-survivors-clone-steam-pc-2000627591">It’s a great game, even if most of its ideas aren’t entirely original</a>. It also came out a couple of months ahead of Poncle announcing its own reinterpretation of&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860"><em>Vampire Survivors</em> as a 3D version of itself</a>, although in that case it’s also being combined with a deckbuilding roguelite.</p>

 <p>Alongside the new elements listed above, the Spooky Update also comes with a bunch of bug fixes, some new “advanced” settings for very niche tweaks, and a host of balancing changes. There’s also access to the game’s console, with the intention of making the game more open to speedrunning. And even this update has since received an update, fixing a few issues the spookiness introduced.</p> <p>The game’s well worth checking out. A lot of people already have, to the degree that it was nominated in this year’s Best Debut Indie Game category at the Game Awards, before the pseudonymous developer <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-dev-officially-withdraws-it-from-the-game-awards-2000645270">withdraw it from consideration on the basis that it’s not really his first game</a>. (Something <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">the category’s eventual winners</a> did&nbsp;<em>not</em> choose to do.)</p>

              <p>With Forza Horizon 5 making its way to the PS5 earlier this year, now’s the perfect time to jump in and enjoy one of the standout racing games of this generation. To elevate the experience even further, you’ll want the right gear—something that makes it feel like you’re in the driver’s seat. The Logitech G Driving Force Shifter for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC is currently seeing a major price drop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6395/">Normally $60 on Amazon, it’s now discounted by 17%, bringing the cost down to just $50 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>As funny as it would be to use the Logitech G Driving Force Shifter alongside a standard controller, I’m afraid that’s not possible. This product is part of a larger kit. Logitech’s G Series racing setup is crafted for maximum realism with a driving wheel, pedals, and this optional shifter. Real race cars are manual, not automatic. So if you want to complete your driving simulation setup, you’ll need this last piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6395/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Logitech G Driving Force Shifter is compatible with Logitech G29 and G290 Driving Force Racing Wheels in order to enhance your experience behind the wheel. The shifter plugs in via cable to the rear side of your Logitech driving wheel.</p>
<p>You get real, quality construction that has the weight and feel of an actually shifter you might find in your own vehicle. It’s made with a solid steel gear shaft. The knob and boot are covered in a high-quality hand-stitched leather, which makes it look and feel like the real deal. It’s also durable and can put off wear and tear for a long time.</p>
<p>The shifter can be securely mounted to your driving rig. The lever is designed to be grabbed and pulled around, so the whole unit needs to be able to hold it’s ground while you race. That’s why it has built-in clamps and bolt points. The clamps just twist on either side to screw into a secure fit, then you push down the knobs to lock it into place. Easy peasy.</p>



<h2>Ultimate Precision</h2>
<p>Using the six-speed shifter is fluid. You’re met with a satisfying, tactile click as you shift between each gear. You’ll be able to execute smooth, accurate gear transitions whether you’re speeding up down a straight away or coming out of a turn. Pull down to put your rig in reverse.</p>
<p>Aside from just enhancing your experience playing a racing game, a driving sim like this makes for a not so bad method of learning to be behind the wheel. Particularly if you’ve only ever driven automatic, this can provide a safe way to learn how to drive stick. If you travel a lot, especially in Europe, you’ll find that renting an automatic is far more expensive than renting manual. Plus, you’ll have a lot more options of vehicle choice with manual. It’s a good skill set to have.</p>
