			<p>Have you ever played a video game, where you are convinced there’s a good game in there somewhere – maybe even a great game – it’s just that you can’t quite reach it? That you can’t connect with it, despite your best efforts. The game in question does enough to convince you something brilliant is coming and it’s right around the corner, but you never actually reach it. It’s like the developers have constructed a veritable wall of nonsensical game mechanics, a moat of lacklustre tutorials, and a maze of unappealing level design, to stop you from finding the good game hidden within. Well, Flint: Treasure of Oblivion is that game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Flint: Treasure of Oblivion - Official Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTfxCsPb32k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set before the events of Robert Louis Stevenson’s iconic adventure story Treasure Island, Flint: Treasures of Oblivion follows the escapades of the eponymous Captain Flint. Taking place in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, during the so-called ‘Golden Age of Piracy’, Treasure of Oblivion really does deliver on all of the Piratey shenanigans that anyone could ask for. Double crosses, betrayals, parrots and peg legs, this certainly ticks all the boxes that a fandom brought up on Pirates of the Caribbean movies could ask for. Storyline-wise, this is a fairly standard tale interestingly told.</p>


<p>Thanks to the expertly drawn comic book panels and speech bubbles that crop up during gameplay, Treasure of Oblivion rather nostalgically brings to mind the much-underrated Sega comic-inspired beat ‘em up Comix Zone; though without the fourth wall-breaking which defined that 1995 classic. As a big fan of comic books, I found this stylish method of storytelling immensely engaging, even if the narrative itself was a tired amalgam of a stereotypical pirate yarn.</p>


<p>Played from an isometric viewpoint, Treasure of Oblivion is ostensibly a strategy RPG, though, unfortunately, Savage Level have rather over-sugared the rum. Shoved into your standard TBS mechanics are card collection – to power your crews’ abilities – and dice rolling – to decide who hits who. Sure, many strategy games involve secret dice rolling, influenced by various factors, to determine if your soldier hits an enemy with their sword, say, but in Treasure of Oblivion that roll is blatant, even going so far as to animate the dice for your benefit.</p>
<p>The effect is that everything feels completely random, with too few opportunities for players to impact the outcome in any meaningful way. The combination of cards, dice, and turn based combat, makes the gameplay cluttered and confusing, which is further hindered by terrible tutorials that fail to sufficiently explain how all these mechanics work individually and collectively. Worse, the terrible fiddly controls, on console at least, add to the frustration. In short, I won combat encounters, but I was never really sure how or why.</p>

<p>Visually Treasure of Oblivion is nice enough to look at but does a poor job of signposting where you should be going, leading to wandering around the mostly linear levels clicking on the environment until you find something to interact with. Frame rate drops and minor bugs abound, leading to the sense that this pirate game needed a little more time before it emerged from the depths of development.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		With more development time, copious patches, and some decent tutorials, the good game hidden deep inside Flint: Treasure of Oblivion could be dug up and unearthed. But for now, that treasure remains hidden, with only a map inscribed on the back of a wooden peg leg to try and find it.	</p></div>

            <p>The creative director of indie hit Unpacking, Wren Brier, has called out Nintendo due to the prominence of copycat games on its Switch eShop.</p>
<p>Seventeen days ago, Brier shared a Bluesky post with a series of games titled Unpacking on the eShop, clearly inspired by Witch Beam's award-winning game and sharing the same trademarked name.</p>
<p>Specifically, Unpacking Universe Dreams from CGI Lab (and its DLC packs) was added to the store on 26th October, which invites players to "explore a whimsical world where each box holds new adventures" as they "unpack and arrange items in vibrant locations, each with its own unique atmosphere".</p>

<p>Earlier today, Brier posted on Bluesky once more, stating Nintendo has not responded to reports of these "egregious scams".</p>
<p>"It's been over two weeks and these are still on the eShop," wrote Brier. "Nintendo hasn't responded to any of our reports of these egregious scams which are using our trademarked game name and purposely tricking Nintendo customers into buying cheap fakes."</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-cid="bafyreif5bhzwhz5jgxx7gvv6yvqlkwtlbypg4dygwh555fkl3ak3w5oxea" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:en7lk6dayjekqei65vpfornn/app.bsky.feed.post/3ldfndqrhzk2o"><div lang="en"><p>It's been over two weeks and these are still on the eShop.

</span></p><p>This isn't the first time the Unpacking developers have faced this type of scam. Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-rip-off-pulled-from-app-stores-but-only-after-topping-charts">another Unpacking imitator was removed</a> from the iOS and Google Play store after topping their most-downloaded charts.</p>
<p>"If you've happened to catch an ad for a suspiciously similar-looking game to Unpacking on mobile recently, please know that this is not our game," the official Unpacking account explained at the time. "They sure seem to want to give the impression that it is, though!"</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for further comment.</p>
<p>This also isn't the only game on the store from Moldovan studio CGI Lab. Two other games from the developer are currently listed: SCP-087 The Stairwell Horror and Abyss: Backrooms Pools Horror. However, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/no-indie-hit-unpacking-hasnt-unboxed-new-dlc-its-just-another-naff-eshop-clone">Nintendo Life</a> previously reported, the developer has released games such as Video Game Store: Supermarket Simulator, Car Parking Legends: Drive &amp; Park Adventure and Anime Puzzle Quest: The Magical Girls Adventure. These are all no longer on the store and the <a href="https://cgilabgames.com/">CGI Lab website</a> does not list its games.</p>
<p>The Switch eShop has long been scrutinised, in particular for a prevalence in hentai games. In 2022 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-updated-eshop-rules-on-adult-content-publisher-says">Nintendo revised its eShop rules on adult content</a> as a result.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent came under fire for its Light of Motiram game</a> that's heavily inspired by Sony's Horizon games - or Horizon Zero Originality as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>'s game has been jokingly dubbed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2021-in-review-the-most-moving-game-of-the-year-was-about-moving">Unpacking was Eurogamer's game of the year</a> back in 2021 for its moving storytelling.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New leaks that emerged online over the weekend have provided another look at the Nintendo Switch 2 supposed design, the system's ports, and more.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1heyizw/more_photos_of_the_switch_2/?share_id=9la12PrZ5fFQxo6Zaow3S&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit</a>, another Chinese manufacturer shared images of their upcoming accessories, providing a look not only at the supposed design of the system but also at details like the back stand, Joy-Con controller buttons, the top of the system, and more. While we have seen the system's design multiple times already, these images help us get a better idea of how the Nintendo Switch 2 will look, although we still do not know if this will indeed be the console's final design.</p>
<p>Another detailed look at the Nintendo Switch 2 ports also arrived during the weekend, thanks to the Chinese leaker who previously created <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-pictures-specs/">CAD models</a> of the system based on a prototype used by an accessories manufacturer, providing the first supposed look at the console. Reddit user Fidler_2k also shared the images again with details on what each port showed on the system's top and bottom could be for, and you can find them on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1heg76q/xiaohongshu_the_one_who_originally_leaked_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/">The number of leaks</a> that have been circulating online in the past few days is a very good indication of how players are excited about the Nintendo Switch 2, and it seems like they aren't the only ones. According to Paul Gate, many of those who attended this year's The Game Awards after-party were very positive about the system, and some instances of confirmed dedicated support were also promising to hear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">My take away from The Game Awards after party regarding the successor to Nintendo Switch was VERY positive.</p>
<p>Many people that I spoke to were excited to see the system, hyped over what Nintendo’s games were going to look like next generation, or ready to play more modern…</p>
<p>— Paul Gale (@PaulGaleNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulGaleNetwork/status/1867620652217434188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the console as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is doing quite well on the market, so much so that it is reportedly one of Bandai Namco's best-selling games ever.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-is-one-of-the-best-selling-games-in-bandai-namco-history-a-nice-surprise-in-a-year-thats-been-kind-of-rough-overall-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Circana's executive director and games analyst Matt Piscatella revealed his surprise at how well the game is selling, highlighting how it has become not only the best-selling Dragon Ball game to date but also one of the best-selling Bandai Namco games ever. <em>"One heck of a nice surprise in a year that's been kind of rough overall,"</em> according to the analyst.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO's success on the market is wholly deserved, in my opinion. The game is not only a massive love letter to the franchise and an incredible tribute to the legacy of Akira Toriyama, who sadly passed away this year, but also a very fun game to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-an-explosive-love-letter/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is undeniably one of the best games based on Akira Toriyama's series. With an engaging story mode that includes intriguing what-if scenarios, a combat system that's easy to learn but challenging to master, a massive character roster, and impressive attention to detail, Spike Chunsoft has created a must-have for Dragon Ball fans. If you've ever wanted to be Goku and scream your heart out before unleashing secret techniques, this is the game for you.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

A year after his split from PlatinumGames, series creator Hideki Kamiya now heads the newly founded studio Clovers and is workiing on Okami 2 as its director. IGN Japan spoke with Kamiya and Clovers President and CEO Kento Koyama to hear all about about how the company came to be and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Tell us about the founding of Clovers.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I left my former company, PlatinumGames, on October 12, 2023. There were all kinds of restrictions placed on me for the following year, which meant that I couldn't create games [<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideki-kamiya-on-why-he-left-platinumgames-his-youtube-channel-and-his-next-game"><u>as reported by IGN in a previous interview</u></a>]. Now that the year has passed, I have finally been appointed as the studio head of Clovers. I'll be developing games at this new company with Koyama as president and CEO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> Kamiya was under a year-long non-compete agreement. We wanted to have a clean slate when making games, even at Clovers, so we waited until this restriction was over and Kamiya had entered the company before officially going active.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I was genuinely unemployed between quitting PlatinumGames and joining Clovers. But once Clovers was formed and before I could announce anything, I decided to quietly add a "?" to the "Unemployed" description on my X account's display name!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/screenshot-2024-12-16-101323-1734344073143.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> I wonder if anyone truly noticed, haha.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> It seems like a number of X users actually did. They were speculating that I'd be starting something new. I really was unemployed around the time of Tokyo Game Show 2024, so I wasn't lying when I added "unemployed" to my username at the time!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How many people are working at Clovers at the moment?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> About 20 people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> The company has bases in Tokyo and Osaka. People from those two cities came to Clovers, and so we started locations in both at the same time. We began in small rental offices, but now they're so full that they can't even fit everyone. We're now working on moving to real offices. The move to the Osaka office is scheduled for February 2025, while the Tokyo office move is slated for spring 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> We're thinking of adding new employees together with these moves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> We already have people who say they would like to work at Clovers, so we need to put a system in place to hire some of them. We imagine that hiring is going to become even more active now that we’ve officially announced Clovers’ foundation [<a href="https://clovers2023.com/en/careers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>in fact, a guide to career applications is now available on the official Clovers website</u></a>]. The vision that Koyama and I have in mind is to aim for the company to grow to around 70 people in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Please tell us about what kind of work this new studio will undertake, and what you hope to do in the future.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> We're currently focusing on developing a contracted title for a publisher (the sequel to Okami). We'll be focusing on that one for a while, but we'd like to create our own IP at Clovers in the future. That isn't to say that making IP is a top priority of ours, though. What's important is bringing players the most interesting and fun titles that we can.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Okami (@OkamiOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/OkamiOfficial/status/1867430362017935809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> Our strength at Clovers is that we're a group with a unique sense of creativity. I've never been too fixated on creating only original properties, even when I was at PlatinumGames. When I was there, the company also developed IP belonging to other companies, like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. [Kamiya was not directly involved in developing this game.] Whether it's an existing IP or a new one, our mission at Clovers is to create unique games that only we can make.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Recently there are quite a few Japanese companies that have been funded by overseas publishers, but has Clovers taken on any investments?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> We haven't received any outside investment at the moment. That was a decision we've made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> We were fortunate enough to receive a number of offers, but right now we'd like to see just how far we can go on our own. We want to maintain the freedom to do whatever we want. It is true that it's harder to keep the lights on without taking on investors, but we're doing our best at Clovers to preserve our independence as a studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Mr Koyama, please tell us about your history in the game industry.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> I got my start in the game industry at a company called Mario Club [<a href="https://www.marioclub.co.jp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a subsidiary of Nintendo that conducts debugging and more</u></a>]. I worked there as a debugger, but I never gave up on my dream of being a game designer. I then moved to DeNA where I got to fulfill that dream. After that, I became involved in a smartphone title at PlatinumGames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> Koyama was making the predecessor of what would become <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/world-of-demons-24-minutes-of-gameplay"><u>World of Demons, released on Apple Arcade</u></a>. It was being developed as a live service game at first, but changed direction mid-development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> I left PlatinumGames once World of Demons was no longer going to be a live service game. After that, I was in charge of the games division at the Kyoto office of a company called Donuts, but after a while there, someone I knew from PlatinumGames contacted me. When we met, they said, "You once mentioned that you wanted to work together with Hideki Kamiya, right?" </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I never had the chance to work with Koyama during his first time at PlatinumGames. But the mere sight of how he worked and the quality of his work did impress me. I kept on thinking what a pity it was that he left the company, so when the time came when I wanted to ask for Koyama's help, I had a mutual acquaintance reach out to him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> Through that connection, I returned to PlatinumGames and ended up working under Kamiya for the next three years.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/img-7205-2-1734343903160.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hideki Kamiya (left) and Kento Koyama make Cs for 'Clovers' at the IGN Japan office. Photo by IGN Japan.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What did you think when you heard that Mr Kamiya would be leaving PlatinumGames?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama: </strong>I felt that his leaving was a loss for the game industry. Had his games not been fun, perhaps I wouldn’t have thought about it. We can look back on it and laugh now, but at the time, Kamiya looked unusually serious.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> It's not as if I was feeling sad about my own future. I felt bad for the company's staff I would be leaving behind by exiting the company and my team, and by leaving my positions as game director and vice president. This may sound conceited, but I was in a position where I shouldered quite a lot at PlatinumGames. From my perspective, I left the company based on my own convictions as a creator, but I'm sure that others also saw it as a selfish act. I felt very sorry about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> Kamiya didn't have any plans at all following his departure from PlatinumGames. He was saying things like, "Maybe I'll go back to my family's home and wipe down the floors there." So I said, "If you ever want to make another game, please contact me. I come from a farming family, so let's make games in your free time outside of planting and harvesting rice. I might not be able to pay you a salary, but I can at least send you some rice!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I was happy when Koyama told me he'd send me rice. I mean, I was thinking, "How could there possibly be a company that'd take in an industry troublemaker who's constantly spewing venom on X like me?" But maybe this unemployable guy would still be able to make ends meet if Koyama sent me rice. Of course, it wasn't rice he ended up making for me, but rather a company!</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>How could there possibly be a company that'd take in an industry troublemaker who's constantly spewing venom on X like me?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Mr Koyama, will you mainly be working as a manager as the CEO of Clovers, or will you still be involved in game development?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> Yes, I will be working as the company's president, but I'll continue to be a game designer as well. While I am new to being a company president, I feel like I've been able to do a good job thanks to the help of the other members of the company around me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I don't know what I'd do without Koyama's ability to handle that kind of work. I'm clueless when it comes to the management side, so my primary job will be creating games. I'm able to let him handle the parts of running a business that I'm not capable of doing myself. I've never once felt concerned. I'm very grateful to have someone like him with talents that even stretch outside of game development. I'd like to rely on him as the company's president, and I also highly value his abilities as a creator, so I have high hopes for his future as a game designer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Your studio's name, Clovers, brings to mind Clover Studio, which was responsible for the original Okami and other titles and where Kmaiya used to work. Can you tell us how you decided on this name?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> As I mentioned earlier, I come from a family of farmers, so I first thought about a company name that had to do with agriculture. It seemed that Kamiya had some concerns about my ability to come up with a good name, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> His sense for names is rather unique, you see... That's when I proposed that we name the company Clovers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> We ended up going with his very first suggestion as-is. At first, I couldn’t help but be reminded of Clover Studio, which Kamiya was previously a part of. We were going out of our way to create a new company, so I was reluctant to have a company name that looked back to the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I may have some fond feelings for Clover Studio because of titles like Okami, but Koyama doesn’t have that history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> I was able to empathize with Kamiya's explanation for the name, though. If you break down the name Clovers you get “C” and “lovers." The C in Clovers stands in part for “creativity," something that all of us love. Also, when thinking about the company's philosophy, in reference to a four-leaf clover, we began to talk about being a group with four guiding Cs, as in "C-lovers." Our company's logo is four interconnected Cs in the shape of a clover, as I think you can tell by looking at it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/03-clovers-logo-cpv-1734345911794.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Clovers logo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> We decided on three of the four Cs right away: Challenge, Creativity and Craftsmanship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> While things went smoothly up to here, we had trouble figuring out the fourth and last C. Too many positive words that begin with the letter C, so we didn't know which to pick. That's when Koyama had the idea, "How about we don't decide on the fourth C, and leave it up to each of our new members to decide what the final C means to them personally?" </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> That's why we share three of the Cs as a company, while the fourth is thought up by each of our employees when they join the company, and we have them write down their reasons. Clovers now has a system where new hires choose their own fourth C the day they join the company. [<a href="https://clovers2023.com/en/our-values" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The fourth C is also discussed in this way on Clovers’ website.</u></a>]</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What words did the two of you choose for that fourth C?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I've made my fourth C "Curiosity." It's always been what has driven me forward in my game design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> I made my fourth C "Cleanness," to show my desire to always be sincere in my work and towards business partners. Within the company, you have everything from people who make their fourth C "Century," striving to create titles that will last for a hundred years, to stylish types who made theirs "Coffee Break."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> By having everyone choose their own fourth C, it makes them even more aware of themselves as creators. I think Clovers is a good name for the company we want to become, as it stands for our desire to be a group that loves that fourth C.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami often talks about wanting to focus on helping young talent to bloom. Mr Kamiya, as someone who came up under Mikami, how do you feel about that idea?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I was able to work as a director for the first time on Resident Evil 2 thanks to Mr Mikami's guidance. The offer shocked me because it was only my second year after joining Capcom, but within a fraction of a second I told him I'd do it. There's no question that I've also inherited what you might call this kind of "Mikami-ism," and at PlatinumGames I'd actively give direction work to promising young employees even if they didn't have experience as a director. That's why I'd like to continue to give opportunities to young talent at Clovers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Your new website mentions that you are recruiting, but what kind of staff are you looking for?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Koyama:</strong> We believe that people who can relate to our three Cs – Challenge, Creativity and Craftsmanship – will be a good fit for Clovers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kamiya:</strong> I think that things like taking on a challenge, being creative or having a craftsmanlike mentality are not things you only do because you're told to do them. I feel that people who naturally have that kind of mindset and passion for creativity are the ones who fit in with us. In fact, the members who have joined Clovers so far are exactly like that. I hope to maintain that concentration and expand it even further.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/04-clovers-staff-1734345285435.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The employees of Clovers pose for a group photo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't do anything alone. We have team members who draw artwork, others who turn it into 3D models, or who add movement, or who add sound and music, and people who program and finalize the output. Thanks to this combination of people, a game can grow into a wonderful work that exceeds my imagination; miracles are born, and players can enjoy the end result. Just like with game development, as we start a company from scratch this time, I really feel the importance of people's support. The current staff also came to Clovers without knowing what would happen, and I am so grateful to them for that. I wanted to leave that feeling of gratitude in a tangible form, so we took a group photo of all the Clovers staff. It was a sobering feeling once again. I'm sure they are not without anxiety, but they seem to be enjoying the process of building something from scratch, and that makes me feel really confident. I would be happy to create something with people who can enjoy taking on this challenge together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This interview was conducted by Daniel Robson, Chief Editor of IGN Japan, and the article was written by Ryuchi Kataoka, a freelance writer for IGN Japan.

            <p>Capcom is working on more revivals of its dormant series, the company said following the reveal of new Okami and Onimusha games at last week's The Game Awards.</p>
<p>"In addition to regularly releasing major new titles each year, Capcom is focusing on re-activating dormant IPs that haven’t had a new title launch recently," reads a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e241213.html">press release</a> to investors.</p>
<p>"The company is working to further enhance corporate value by leveraging its rich library of content, which includes reviving past IPs like [Okami and Onimusha], in order to continuously produce highly efficient, high-quality titles."</p>

<p>It's unclear what form these revivals will take, be it some form of remaster or remake, or a brand new game.</p>
<p>For instance, both the Okami and Onimusha games are new entries in their respective series. But Capcom has also seen great success with its Resident Evil remake games.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">Okami sequel</a> will be developed by Hideki Kamiya's new Clovers studio, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-onimusha-game-in-development-from-capcom">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> is set to launch in 2026.</p>
<p>The news of these revivals follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-success-boosts-capcoms-expected-profits">success of Dragon's Dogma 2</a> this year, which helped to boost Capcom's expected profits, as well as the recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-review">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-review">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</a>.</p>
<p>So what could be next? <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a> is perhaps the most obvious, especially considering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">fan interest in a new game acknowledged by Capcom in an official poll</a>.</p>
<p>The original Dino Crisis, a PS1 survival horror game, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dino-crisis-is-now-available-for-all-to-purchase-on-playstation">available for all to purchase on PlayStation</a>.</p>
<p>Could we also see a new Devil May Cry game soon, following the success of the fifth game? Could a new Mega Man game be on the way? Or could Capcom revive another RPG series: Breath of Fire?</p>
<p>Until then, Capcom is busy with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, due out on 28th February next year.</p>
<p>What series would you like to see Capcom tackle next?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Prior to Elden Ring's release in February 2022, the entire Dark Souls series had sold 27m copies combined, according to Niko Partners director of research and insights Daniel Ahmad.</p>

            <p>Hideki Kamiya has stated if he'd continued working for Platinum Games his "artistic spirit [would] die".</p>
<p>The former Platinum vice-president has launched a new studio with another former Platinum employee, Kaneto Koyama, as discussed in a new interview with Japanese outlet <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/2412133p">denfaminicogamer</a>.</p>
<p>The pair have set up Clovers, which will develop a sequel to the much-loved Okami, originally developed by Kamiya at Clover Studio.</p>

<p>"This is purely my personal opinion, but I thought, 'If I continue working here, my artistic spirit will die'," said Kamiya on his reasons for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bayonetta-creator-hideki-kamiya-leaving-platinumgames">leaving Platinum last year</a> (via machine translation).</p>
<p>"I can understand the way PlatinumGames is as a company and its logic, and I was in the position of vice president myself, but as an individual named Hideki Kamiya, I was unable to embrace that way of thinking."</p>
<p>As vice president, Kamiya was "field-first" at Platinum Games - he described himself as the muscle and CEO Atsushi Inaba as the brains.</p>
<p>"The signals sent from the cerebrum are essential for muscles," Kamiya continued. "At the same time, those signals must be reliable for muscles. Until then, I had received those signals, trusted them, and worked to maximize my own strength...but with regards to the future direction of Platinum with Inaba at the helm, I was no longer able to place my trust in them and exert my strength as a muscle."</p>
<p>Kamiya has been quite vocal about his decision to leave Platinum Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-left-platinum-games-due-to-issue-of-trust">previously stating there were issues of "trust"</a>.</p>
<p>He then launched a YouTube channel where he discussed his next project. "I already have a clear idea in mind," he said. "I would like to translate this vision in my head into a full proposal as soon as I am able to do so. And of course, I also have an idea of what I can do to make the project a reality. But if you ask me specifically what kind of game it will be, all I can say at this stage is, 'It'll be a Hideki Kamiya game'."</p>
<p>It's unclear if that project is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">new Okami sequel</a>, announced as in-development at this year's The Game Awards last week.</p>

<p>In this new interview, Kamiya and Koyama explained the Clovers name of the new studio. It's been interpreted as "C lovers", with four Cs relating to the four leaves of a clover.</p>
<p>Only three Cs are set in stone though: challenge, creativity, and craftsmanship. The fourth C is for employees to decide upon themselves.</p>
<p>In a previous interview, Kamiya stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okamis-initial-sales-were-huge-failure-says-director-hideki-kamiya">Okami's sales were a "huge failure"</a> and that had the game been more successful Clover Studio probably would have continued.</p>
<p>Little is known about the new Okami game, beyond the above teaser image.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> producer and Game Science CEO Feng Ji has posted a lengthy statement following the action game's apparent snub for the top prize at this year's The Game Awards.</p>
<p>"The games nominated this year were all exceptional, but honestly, I still can't figure out what the criteria were for Game of the Year. I feel like I came all the way here for nothing!" he wrote in a post on <a href="https://weibo.com/6603744955/5111567333196223">Weibo</a> (translated on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1he81dp/game_producer_of_black_myth_wukongs_post_after_tga/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>).</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong did come away with the Best Action Game and Players' Voice awards, so he didn't leave empty handed.</p>

<p>"Since last night, I've seen a lot of strong dissatisfaction and frustration in players' comments - often expressed humorously or ironically, which made me laugh," the producer continued.</p>
<p>"I completely understand these feelings and share the frustration, because behind these emotions lies not pain or malice, but dignity and confidence."</p>
<p>Feng Ji even admitted he wrote his Game of the Year acceptance speech two years ago, "only to never get the chance to deliver it".</p>
<p>It's unclear how joking he has been in his statement, especially considering the machine translation, but some have read it as rather salty. Eurogamer has contacted Game Science for further comment.</p>
<p>The producer continued to express his confidence in the game and his hopes the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> is the beginning of a new wave of high-quality, engaging games from Chinese developers.</p>
<p>Former Sony Santa Monica writer Alanah Pearce shared in a stream she witnessed a person from the Game Science team crying in the audience when the game didn't win. "It clearly meant a lot to them, they did an amazing thing, but I did find that surprising," said Pearce.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/larian-says-their-next-game-will-be-so-big-but-it-needs-a-lot-more-time-in-the-oven/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Larian Studios prepared a nifty Christmas video for its large community of fans. First and foremost, greetings from every office worldwide are included: Kuala Lumpur, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-opens-new-office-in-warsaw-to-help-make-its-two-very-ambitious-new-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warsaw</a>, Ghent (the headquarters), Barcelona, Guildford, Dublin, and Quebec.</p>
<p>Then, the focus returns to Senior Communications Developer Aoife Wilson, who claims she's got one more thing. It's a big gift with a 'Larian's Next Game' tag on it. She's got just enough time to shake it once before Larian CEO Swen Vincke jokingly tackles her off-screen, though. Vincke said:</p>
<p><em>Oh no, you don't! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry, sorry about that. No, this thing, it needs a lot more time in the oven. By the time it's going to be finished, it's going to be so big! For the time being you're going to have to wait.</em></p>
<p>And then he proceeds to kick the package far away. I have to say, I certainly wasn't expecting them to start teasing the game so soon. After all, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Baldur's Gate 3 in August 2023, and we only <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> they wouldn't do DLCs or a sequel in March.</p>
<p>Moreover, Vincke himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-says-next-game-may-come-in-2029/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> not long ago that the next title could come as late as 2029. Sure, he also later added that it was kind of a throwaway line, and he did not want Larian to be beholden to a date. However, a lot of time is clearly needed. After all, Baldur's Gate 3 was revealed ahead of E3 2019 and only launched out of early access more than four years later. From the sound of it, this one will be similarly big, and triple-A development times are only increasing with each new release.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Larian Christmas Gift" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V4AJ7gCqrvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps this very early tease is an indirect confirmation that the studio's next project will also be released on early access. While this won't make its full launch come any quicker (in fact, the opposite might be true), it would put an early version of it in the hands of the players a lot sooner, probably in the next two to three years.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the studio's fans must be patient. In the meantime, there's their <a href="https://advent.larian.com/intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent Calendar</a> Web game to go through. Speaking of actual videogames, Larian has at least one major Baldur's Gate 3 update <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled</a> for next year. It will add cross-play for cooperative multiplayer, a built-in Photo Mode, and twelve new subclasses to the award-winning cRPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-rumored-to-be-coming-to-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a new rumor, LEGO Horizon Adventures might be coming to Xbox after all. As you might remember, Microsoft's console was the only one left out of the fun, with the game launching right away on PC, Nintendo Switch, and, obviously, PlayStation. Ahead of the game's launch, Guerrilla Games (which partnered with Studio Gobo to make the spin-off) <a href="https://wccftech.com/guerrilla-games-provides-unconvincing-reason-as-to-why-lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-coming-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a rather unconvincing explanation for the absence:</p>
<p><em>Right now, we're just very much focused on pushing this hardware to its limits and making this game look as absolutely amazing as it can possibly be on this hardware, and you know, we don't really have anything to announce about Xbox right now.</em></p>
<p>The rumor was <a href="https://justplayit.info/news/sony-game-coming-to-xbox-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by Just Play It, though, which doesn't really have a track record when it comes to these leaks. Take it with a big grain of salt, but they're saying the reason is LEGO Horizon Adventures only had a modest commercial performance. They also provide a potential release window for the Xbox version: early 2025.</p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures attempted to retell Aloy's first adventure in a manner more befitting for younger audiences. However, the game wasn't quite as successful as the original. It got 6.5 out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, a much lower score than Horizon Zero Dawn. Reviewer Nathan Birch shared these final thoughts about the game:</p>
<p><em>Lego Horizon Adventures just feels a bit… underbuilt. The main campaign can be finished in around 7 hours, and while there are some extras you can pursue, like rebuilding the game’s Mother's Heart hub and revisiting levels to take down high-level machines, even dedicated players probably won't spend much more than a dozen hours with the game. A kid's game being on the short side isn't the end of the world, but the bigger issue is that I didn’t really want more -- by the end of its short campaign, I was already feeling ready to return this one to the Lego bin.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot Games Confirms Policy Change Regarding Betting Sponsorships]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-policy-change-betting-sponsorships/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-confirms-policy-change-regarding-betting-sponsorships.1062237/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-policy-change-betting-sponsorships/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Last week, I covered a rumour suggesting that Riot Games was preparing to make a major policy change. It was said that the gaming titan was about to allow VALORANT and League esports teams to accept betting companies as sponsors for the first time.</p>



<p>Riot Games has confirmed to Insider Gaming that this is the case. In 2025, partnered League of Legends esports teams and VALORANT Champions Tour teams in the Americas and EMEA <strong>will be allowed </strong>to explore such partnerships.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cultural-shift">Cultural Shift</h2>



<p>For the longest time, Riot Games has been against gambling sponsors in the esports scene it upholds. It has also been against cryptocurrency-based sponsors.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://x.com/RiotMagus/status/1868476361884774487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a> that was issued by Riot Games Esports’ COO, it has been made clear that things are about to change:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>A few weeks ago, we told partnered LoL Esports and VCT teams in Americas and EMEA that starting in 2025, they’ll be allowed to explore partnerships with Riot-approved betting platforms. This decision wasn’t made lightly—it’s the result of careful study and planning to settle on a move that will unlock new revenue opportunities for teams while also protecting competitive integrity and the overall fan experience.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Here are two important things to know:&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>1. Riot-owned channels will stay betting-free. No betting brands will appear on our broadcasts, socials, or jerseys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>2. Riot will vet all potential betting partners to meet our standards for integrity, transparency, and fan engagement. All sports books partnering with teams will need to meet local regulatory and licensing requirements and match Riot requirements around content and promotion for this category.</em></p>



<p><em>This is a new sponsorship category for our esports, and we’ll approach it thoughtfully. We’ll learn a lot along the way, and we’ll make changes if at any point this compromises the integrity of the sport or impacts the high-quality experience our fans have today. Depending on how this initial implementation goes, we’ll evaluate opportunities to expand—or refine—our approach in the future.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Naturally, this announcement garnered blowback from the fans of the competitive scenes who are vehemently against gambling.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that esports betting makes up around 50% of the industry’s global revenue, but that doesn’t mean everyone agrees with the notion of it.</p>



<p>What do you think about this policy change? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Regardless of which one you pick, Horizon Adventures will unsurprisingly look and run better on PS5 than Nintendo Switch. If you have both consoles, the PS5 version is the better choice--unless you want the portability of the Switch. Regardless of which you pick, though, this is the best-looking Lego game on either platform (and just in general).</p><p>It's a fun, lighthearted take on Guerrilla's Horizon franchise. No prior knowledge of the series is needed to enjoy it, as the story borrows from Zero Dawn and is self-contained. That said, the story is secondary to the action and exploration. It's a fun, if familiar, adventure for fans of licensed Lego games, especially if you play couch co-op with another player. It has a fairly short runtime of roughly six to 10 hours, but if you're looking for new game to play with your kids this holiday, this is a good way to introduce them to the franchise.</p></div>                      </div><h2>Preorder Horizon Adventures Lego Set</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4415923-legohorizonadventures.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415923" data-ratio="1" data-width="710" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4415923-legohorizonadventures.png" data-ref-id="1300-4415923"></a><figcaption>Horizon Adventures Lego Playset releases March 1, 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4415923-legohorizonadventures.png"></figure><p>Lego Horizon Adventures will become an actual Lego set on March 1, 2025. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHLHC8WN?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Aloy &amp; Varl vs. Shell-Walker &amp; Sawtooth is a 768-piece Lego playset</a> priced at only $45.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-gta-6-most-expensive-game-ever/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, rumours have been circulating suggesting that GTA 6’s development cycle has – so far – set Rockstar back between $1 – 2 billion. This would easily make it the most expensive game ever developed, sitting some way ahead of Destiny (2014 – $500m), Cyberpunk 2077 (2020 – $330m), and Modern Warfare 2 (2009 – $310m).</p>



<p>Even Grand Theft Auto V, released in 2013, only cost Rockstar around $250m to develop. But, when that game launched, it raked in more than $1 billion in just three days – so it’s safe to say that the exorbitant development fee was well and truly earned back.</p>



<p>But is GTA 6 set to dwarf all of these previous titles? If the budget <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/gta/news-gta-6-reportedly-going-expensive-video-game-ever-made" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘leaked’ in 2023</a> is accurate, then it will be.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-could-be-the-most-ambitious-game-ever">GTA 6 Could Be The Most Ambitious Game Ever</h2>



<p>Well, it depends on how you define ‘ambitious’. </p>



<p>What about Starfield, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-starfield-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with 1000 fully explorable planets</a>? Or how about Ghost Recon: Wildlands, which was <em>supposed </em>to boast a living, breathing world, with every NPC having a purpose and a life of their own?</p>



<p>If <a href="https://twitter.com/DexertoGaming/status/1655987337669509177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the rumours are true</a>, then GTA 6 will be the most expensive game ever developed. It’s also the most highly-anticipated title in history, and for more than a decade, players have been locked firmly in on GTA 5, desperately awaiting concrete news regarding the development of the next game in the series.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-leaks-online-with-90-gameplay-videos/">a massive leak</a> that saw 100GB of data posted online, Rockstar Games had no choice but to come out and admit that it was working on the next Grand Theft Auto game, but that was it. For a while, anyway. In December 2023, the team released the first trailer for GTA 6, uncovering what could be the best game ever made:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>There has been an exponential increase in the development cost of Grand Theft Auto games since the series began, but if the rumours are to be believed, then GTA 6 has set a new bar for monumentally expensive games:</p>



<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto (1997) – $1 – 2 million*</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 2 (1999) – $3 – 4 million*</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 3 (2001) – $5 million*</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) – $5 million</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004) – $10 million</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto IV (2008) – $100 million</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V (2013) – $250 million</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 6 (2025?) – $1 – 2 billion</li>
</ul>



<p>(*Estimated based on research)</p>



<p>If we work with that data, then we can assume that both time-wise and financially, the next GTA title might cost around $3 billion to produce and it’ll take around fifteen years for it to be released. But that’s just me having fun with the numbers – don’t quote that.</p>



<p>At the time of publishing, <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/0LCX:LON?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiCmPiIyOz-AhVHdcAKHWBkB_0Q3ecFegQIFxAa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two is worth some $32.5 billion</a>, so around $1.5 billion spread out over the course of a decade to develop GTA 6 doesn’t really seem all that unrealistic – especially when you consider how much this game is going to make when it finally does release.</p>



<p><em>Finally</em>.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 has finally been revealed by Rockstar Games, and we have received our first detailed look at the map. In the trailer that was released by Rockstar, we saw a showcase of sorts, with much of the GTA 6 map being shown, revealing swamps, forests, white beaches, islands, and a dense, urban sprawl, dripping with neon. That’s all well and good, but where is GTA 6 set, and is it somewhere we’ve been before?</p>



<p>Let’s learn about the new GTA 6 map.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-gta-6-map-is-massive">The GTA 6 Map Is Massive</h2>



<p>We now know that GTA 6 is set in Leonida, a fictional state that’s reminiscent of Florida. Like GTA 5’s San Andreas, there’s a city at the heart of the map, which back then was Los Santos. This time around, the beating centre of the map is Vice City, which players will remember from 2002’s game of the same name. It’s a modern-day rendition, though – but it retains much of that ‘1980s vibe’. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c12j12N4yVU">the GTA 6 trailer</a>, we got a relatively full look at the new map for the game, which is scheduled to be released in 2025. We saw airboats skimming through dangerous swamps, planes soaring over glistening blue oceans and white, sandy beaches, and thick traffic sitting bumper to bumper amidst skyscrapers and neon-toting nightclubs. </p>



<p>Check out the trailer here:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It certainly looks like a diverse map, and it’s going to be bursting at the seams with opportunities to explore it for hundreds of hours. </p>



<p>If you came here wondering where is GTA 6 set, we hope that answers your question!</p>

That’s the idea behind Retro Mod Works’ <a href="https://www.retromodworks.com/product-page/ps-placeable">PS Placeable</a>, a mod that “consolizes” the PSP and was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMQ-yDYdgks">featured yesterday in a video</a> from the YouTube channel Macho Nacho Productions. </p><p>Retro Mod Works charges $274.99 for a prebuilt PS Placeable. Those are waitlisted at the moment, though — a message on the site says the project is a “one man show” and that the demand for the Placeable was higher than anticipated. </p><p>Retro also offers to mod customer-provided PSPs for $100 less, and there’s an option <a href="https://www.retromodworks.com/product-page/psp-bt-mod-kit">preorder DIY parts</a> and do the conversion work yourself. The mod requires either a PSP-2000 or PSP-3000 revision, as the first PSP didn’t have a video output. It’s not clear when the DIY parts will ship — we’ve asked Retro Mod Works and will update if we get a reply.</p><div><figcaption><em>A stack of PS Placeables.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Retro Mod Works</cite></p></div><p>The primary person behind the project, named Dan, told Macho Nacho host Tito Perez that he “hated the idea of buying digital games” for which he has physical copies, and wanted a way to add Bluetooth controller support while preserving the UMD drive. He’s also mentioned in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSP/comments/1e3bw4a/what_should_we_name_this_the_play_station/lddy4me/">replies on Reddit</a> that his goal is to help people revive broken PSPs with the mod, which doesn’t need the console’s screen.</p><p>But buying one of these mod kits can be pricey or require skills most people don’t have. If you just want to play PSP games on your TV and don’t care about having a UMD drive, the PSP Go — which lacked Sony’s oddball optical drive but supported Bluetooth controllers and also had a way to output video — is still <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp4432023.m570.l1313%26_nkw%3DPSP%2BGo%26_sacat%3D0">pretty easy to come by</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty has been one of the most popular franchises in gaming for quite some time now. The series has worked hard to release titles every year, making it one of the biggest franchises in the world. </p>



<p>Games like Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops and more have stolen the spotlight as some of the greatest games of all time. Here is a list of all Call of Duty games in order.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-call-of-duty-game-in-order">Every Call of Duty Game in Order</h2>



<p>Call of Duty has made its staple as one of the most consistent franchises of all time. The series has been releasing a new game every year, with them only recently announcing they were switching to releasing a game every other year. </p>



<p>Still, with a new game every other year, Call of Duty continues to keep fans excited, and even pull back old players. Their constant remaking of famous maps and continuous storylines (Modern Warfare series, Black Ops series and more) has also grabbed the attention of players. </p>



<p>So, when <strong>was </strong>every Call of Duty game released?</p>

<p>Call of Duty is one of the most exciting esports titles on the market, offering fans a dense schedule packed with entertainment for around eight months of the calendar year. From Warzone to the traditional multiplayer offering of Modern Warfare or Black Ops, there’s a diverse spectrum out there that millions of fans worldwide can appreciate.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m breaking down the highest-earning Call of Duty pro players of all time. There are thousands of competitors out there, but which among them have earned the most money during their careers?</p>



<p>Read on to learn which Call of Duty players have won the most money.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-players-ranked-by-earnings">COD Players Ranked by Earnings</h2>



<p>Most of these players are still actively competing, so expect their earnings to change over time.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-dylan-envoy-hannon-984-000">10. Dylan ‘Envoy’ Hannon – $984,000</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Envoy won COD Champs in 2022 while playing for the LA Thieves, which is where the bulk of his winnings came from.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-seth-scump-abner-992-000">9. Seth ‘Scump’ Abner – $992,000</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Scump is arguably the most iconic (retired) competitor in the Call of Duty esports scene. In 2017, he won the Call of Duty Championship.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-anthony-shotzzy-cuevas-castro-1-03-million">8. Anthony ‘Shotzzy’ Cuevas-Castro – $1.03 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Shotzzy is one of the best and most capable COD players in the world. He’s a two-time world champion <strong>and </strong>a world champion in Halo.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-james-clayster-eubanks-1-15-million">7. James ‘Clayster’ Eubanks – $1.15 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Clayster was, when he retired, the most veteran competitor still playing in the COD League. He’s one of the few three-time Call of Duty world champions.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-kenneth-kenny-williams-1-19-million">6. Kenneth ‘Kenny’ Williams – $1.19 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Kenny is a two-time world champion, having secured the trophy in both 2022 and 2024. </p>



<h3 id="h-5-ian-crimsix-porter-1-32-million">5. Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter – $1.32 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Crimsix is the winningest competitor in COD history, having won more tournaments than anyone other player. Before retiring, he’d claimed three world championship titles.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-alec-arcitys-sanderson-1-39-million">4. Alec ‘Arcitys’ Sanderson – $1.39 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Arcitys is no longer in the Call of Duty League, but he has claimed two world championships in almost a decade of active competition, along with many chips.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-mcarthur-cellium-jovel-1-53-million">3. McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel – $1.53 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Cellium has represented Atlanta FaZe for years and is often considered one of the best players in COD esports. He secured his first world championship in 2021 and also won the first Esports World Cup in Call of Duty.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-chris-simp-lehr-1-77-million">2. Chris ‘Simp’ Lehr – $1.77 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Simp is a phenomenal player with two world championship wins under his belt at just 23 years of age. He also won the Esports World Cup in Call of Duty in 2024 alongside Cellium and aBeZy.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-tyler-abezy-pharris-1-78-million">1. Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris – $1.78 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris is the highest-earning Call of duty player ever, but it’s close. He has won two world titles and secured the top spot at the Esports World Cup in 2024 in Saudi Arabia.</p>
