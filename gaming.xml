			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> about NetEase effectively pulling out of several of its investments out of China, fans of the promising action role-playing game The Blood of Dawnwalker were worried about its future. After all, developer Rebel Wolves did <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> receiving an investment from NetEase in November 2022.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, this game&nbsp;<span>isn't in any danger, as Co-Owner and Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc clarified&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomasz-tinc-314a88a_ive-also-read-the-articles-suggesting-that-activity-7299704037124247552-4dpq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a LinkedIn post</a> earlier today. NetEase is just a minority investor, and Rebel Wolves has already</span>&nbsp;found another publisher (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bandai Namco</a>) for this game.</p>
<p><em>I've also read the articles suggesting that Rebel Wolves may be in danger due to the rumoured situation at NetEase. First and foremost, thank you for all the warm messages and wishes. The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues.</em></p>
<p><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker's production is fully funded, and we work alongside our partners and friends from Bandai Namco, our game's global publisher, to bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to life. The vast majority of Rebel Wolves' ownership rests in the hands of Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and other studio co-owners, all of whom are employed by Rebel Wolves.</em><br>
<em>NetEase is Rebel Wolves' minority shareholder.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Founded by former developers of The Witcher 3</a>, the Polish studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> The Blood of Dawnwalker in mid-January, showing a promising title that blends a narrative focus with lots of player agency. In the game, players will take the role of Coen, a vampire from 14th century Carpathia who - as implied by the title - can also walk in the sun. Following the Black Death plague, his homeland has been invaded by a powerful coven of vampires, and it will be up to him to stop them and rescue his family. There will also be a time limit of thirty days and thirty nights to do so. The gameplay loop will be different at nighttime, with a more supernatural twist that shows off Coen's vampire powers.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the players will have many choices to make in what the studio is calling a 'narrative sandbox'. Rebel Wolves did say not to expect a huge game in terms of scope and playtime like The Witcher 3, though, which is understandable given that it is a new studio. The game has no release date yet, but the developers will reveal more about The Blood of Dawnwalker later this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mecha-break-demo-player-count-reaches-300k-in-first-day.1117356/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mecha-break-demo-player-count-300k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The newly-released demo for a little third-person mech shooter called&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>is hitting some serious Steam player numbers, with hundreds of thousands of players flocking to check out the demo since it launched yesterday.</p>

<p>According to SteamDB's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2870990/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">numbers</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>demo reached an all-time peak of 317,522 players yesterday. To put things into perspective, that's higher than the all-time Steam player counts of games like&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, and we know <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">how successful the latter is</a>.</p>

<p>That achievement seems even more impressive when we consider that we're comparing a demo to numbers achieved by fully-released games. Sure, these aren't quite&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>numbers</a>, but that's a franchise with some name recognition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mecha-break-demo-player-count-melee.jpg?itok=JTpOjlub 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mecha-break-demo-player-count-melee.jpg?itok=-M67zZFV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mecha Break</em>'s demo is attracting some serious attention.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>is getting some big player numbers for its demo, feedback from those players hasn't been entirely positive. In fact, the demo (which has its own review numbers thanks to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-overhauls-steam-demos" rel="nofollow">changes made by Valve in July</a>) has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870990/Mecha_BREAK_Demo/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mostly Negative rating</a> across almost 4,800 reviews at time of writing.</p>

<p>Those who've left negative reviews point to the game's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/xGCms/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">kernel-level anti-cheat</a>, which is never a popular inclusion, as well as its <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015327365/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">monetization model</a> and its lengthy, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197976329976/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unskippable</a> tutorial sequence.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many positive reviews as well, and even negative reviews frequently mention&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break</em>'s <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061570971/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">gameplay</a> as a positive point. Some players are also urging others to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ggwhiskey/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">show leniency</a> given that the demo doesn't necessarily represent the finished product.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break</em>, it's a multiplayer third-person shooter with - you guessed it - an emphasis on mech combat.</p>

<p>The game offers three distinct modes: a 3v3 deathmatch mode, a 6v6 hero shooter-style mode, and a PvPvE extraction shooter. Needless to say, that's a pretty ambitious mix. It also boasts the involvement of some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiplayer-mech-game-mecha-break-reveals-iconic-mecha-artists-and-beta-window" rel="nofollow">pretty heavy hitters in the mech world</a>, including&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em>'s Takayuki Yanase and&nbsp;<em>Gundam</em>'s Junya Ishigaki.</p>

<p>If you'd like to check out the&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>demo, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870990/Mecha_BREAK_Demo/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so right now via Steam</a>.</p>

            Attention all eyeball eaters, flesh bicyclists, and shooter enjoyers who also enjoy staring into nightclub toilets! I’ve just noticed that survival horror FPS Golden Light is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245430/Golden_Light/">free to keep on Steam</a>… for the next hour only. The offer in question runs out at 6pm UTC today, 24th February. I swear I have only just discovered this. I swear I’m not trying to give you palpitations for the sake of a traffic spike. But if I am giving you palpitations, that’s an appropriate start to your time with Golden Light, “a procedural dark comedy horror game with roguelike elements and an eerie atmosphere”.
</p><p>Eerie? Do not sell yourself short, video game. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> is eerie. Golden Light is a game in which you can swallow a bat’s head just to see what happens. The last time I played I was murdered by a sink clog. The whole world is a deforming colon. Trailer! Quickly!</p><!--more-->

<p>Golden Light is also a particularly revolting take on the archetypal quest to save a damsel. As the game begins, you’re having a nice picnic with a woman known only as She. Suddenly, She is abducted, dismembered and sprinkled across the levels of a hideous meat dimension. Your job is to fight the bosses defending your beloved’s body parts and, well, it all gets very Eraserhead. It makes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> look like a book of Stephen Fry witticisms about his mother.</p>
<p>I’ve never reached the bottom of the labyrinth or found all the body parts, so can’t offer a conclusive verdict upon the precise overall disgustingness of Golden Light, but even the opening dungeon floors are ickier than most horror escapades. Layouts and weapons are procedural or randomised for maximum foulness. If you don’t know what something does, you can always eat it to experience the effects.</p>
<p>An acquired taste, Golden Light. Definitely the kind of thing you might prefer to sample for free, if you’re at all squeamish about fighting a soft cascade of deerheads or arming yourself with various designations of turd.</p>
<p>If it’s already past 6pm UTC when you read this and you’re all up in my comments thread, whinnying with rage about my less-than-punctuality, then calm down, calm down. Look, here’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437570/Chambers/">demo</a> for developer Mr. Pink’s latest project Chambers, “a comedic RPG shooter set in the Weird Wild West”. I haven’t tried it yet but it looks slightly less repulsive. Slightly sunnier, at least.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As such, it’s not surprising you’d want to know just how long you’ll be spending in Obsidian Entertainment’s newest RPG, <em>Avowed,</em> and whether it’s worth your time and money. If you’re curious about how long it will take to beat this exciting RPG, we’ll fill you in on what to expect below.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196572" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="94" data-playlist="196572,196626,196646" data-current="196572"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22127.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h10864"><a id=""></a><strong>How long does it take to finish <em>Avowed</em>?</strong></h2><p>Though it may have a similar vibe to something like <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, <em>Avowed</em> is actually much more straightforward and smaller in scope than Bethesda’s massive open-world title. You’ll still spend a lot of your time exploring large, open locations, densely populated with secrets and side objectives, but there’s a more finite amount of content available in this adventure.</p><p>If you’re powering through <em>Avowed</em>’s main campaign with only limited investment in its optional content, you could likely see its credits in around <strong>20 hours</strong>. Doing so, however, would be skipping a lot of what makes the game such a special experience, and really missing out on half the game. There’s so much more to see and do in the gorgeous, colorful Living Lands of <em>Avowed</em>.</p><p>Indeed, <em>Avowed</em> is certainly not hurting for additional things to do for those who revel in absorbing as much of a game as possible. If you want to complete every side objective, find all of the chests and secrets, and do as much optional content as you can find in the Living Lands, you’re far more likely to land at a playtime of <strong>50+ hours</strong>. It’s fair to say that the average player, playing at a sensible pace, completing side-quests but not hunting down every last element, can expect the game to give them <strong>35 hours</strong> of fun. It’s notably shorter than many other games in the genre, but that can be a very welcome thing for those unable to sink hundreds of hours into an RPG.</p><p>Of course, you can stretch this considerably further by replaying the game and making different decisions than you did on your previous run. With multiple classes to play and dozens of unique endings available, there are potentially hundreds of hours worth of stuff to see for truly dedicated fans.</p><hr><p><em>Avowed</em> is available now on Xbox Series X and PC. A PlayStation 5 version is rumored but not yet confirmed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-3-release-date-verdansk-set-to-return-roze-leaks-everything-we-know/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’re unsure when Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3 will release, we’ve whipped up a handy hub with all the early details: Its likely start date, Verdansk coming back, and much more.</p>



<p>You only have to look at Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Warzone’s player counts to realize Season 3 is the most important yet. Dwindling numbers and a lack of interest mean Activision needs to deliver. October and November 2025 saw Call of Duty’s Steam numbers exceed 300,000. Now, CoD is barely scraping together 100,000 players—and the count is falling more.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 &amp; Warzone Season 3’s release may dictate the next six months. Let’s take a deep dive into the latest plans—including news of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk returning to Warzone</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-amp-warzone-season-3-release-date">Black Ops 6 &amp; Warzone Season 3 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Verdansk dropping in. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The end of the Season 2 Reloaded Battle Pass tells us Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3 likely commences on March 20.</strong></p>



<p>Most (if not all) live service games have a Battle Pass, and the majority have a countdown timer telling us how long the season has left. It’s the same case with Black Ops 6 and Warzone’s Season 2 Reloaded Battle Pass. If we go by its remaining days—and factor in every CoD season ever—then March 20 is the day of Season 3.</p>



<p>Maintenance or mishaps can get in the way of this. We’ll update this if we hear more or if Activision has a different plan.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdansk-rumored-to-return-in-warzone-amp-black-ops-6-season-3">Verdansk Rumored to Return in Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 Season 3</h2>



<p>Verdansk’s long-awaited return is the big news and easily the most anticipated addition in Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3. It’s been in the pipeline for months (daresay years) and <strong>Activision confirmed the news on Aug. 28, 2024</strong>.</p>



<p>“Run it back. Verdansk will return to Call of Duty Warzone in 2025,” said the official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1828873802551271432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty X account</a>. There’s still no official word on when it’s coming back, but all signs point to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-is-reportedly-returning-to-warzone-in-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk returning in Season 3</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re worried about <em>which </em>version of Verdansk we’re potentially getting, you don’t need to. According to leaker TheGhostOfHope, “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s pretty much the OG March 2020 version</a>.” </p>



<p>We’re checking socials every day for official word of Verdansk in Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3. Keep checking back for the latest updates and leaks.</p>



<h2 id="h-season-3-leaks-roze-rumors">Season 3 Leaks—Roze Rumors</h2>



<p>There’s no roadmap so far, meaning this is purely speculative for now: But leaks suggest the <strong>infamous Roze skin</strong> is another dose of nostalgia for Season 3—along with other returning Operators and the usual seasonal content.</p>



<p>You’re lucky if you never had the displeasure of coming up against a user running the Roze skin, you’re lucky. The original Warzone’s Roze wore an all-black military suit that blended in with a lot of the environment. It eventually became seen as a pay-to-win skin as players were effectively being camouflaged—giving them the advantage in firefights.</p>



<p>Call of Duty news source <a href="https://x.com/DETONATEDcom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Detonated</a> claims: “Hudson, Roze, and Mace Operators are rumored to return in Black Ops 6, most likely with Season 3. It’s also fair to assume more maps, game modes, a new Battle Pass, and more Operators are on the way.</p>



<p>We’ll update this hub with more details once we hear more.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s obvious Verdansk is the biggest talking point approaching Season 3. How do you feel about this? Will Black Ops 6 let the vintage Verdansk take the adulation and glory? Or are you not bothered and more interested to see how Black Ops 6 can bring players back? Let us know.</p>

The game has a E10+ rating in North America, making its original PEGI 18 classification in Europe strange.</p><p>As revealed in an update on the <a href="https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PEGI website</a>, Balatro's European publisher, Sold Out Sales &amp; Marketing, successfully appealed the PEGI 18 classification. While the board originally classified the game as PEGI 18 due to explaining various poker hands, the more fantastical elements mitigated the "gambling" aspects and brought the rating down to PEGI 12.</p><p>Another game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/luck-be-a-landlord/" data-ref-id="5000-520128">Luck Be A Landlord</a>, also got its PEGI 18 rating reduced to PEGI 12. In this game, players can attempt to pay their rent by using a customizable slot machine and has similar roguelike gameplay elements as Balatro. Since Luck Be A Landlord had no specific gambling skills that could be transferred to the real world, the game was able to achieve its new rating classification.</p><p>However, the board said that any teaching or glamorization of simulated gambling will still result in a PEGI 18 rating.</p><p>"On the basis of these appeals, the PEGI Experts Group will develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes and the simulation, teaching and glamorization of gambling in different age categories, which will now include 12 but also keep 18 as an age category for games that simulate gambling typically played in casinos and betting halls," the board explained.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-dev-clowns-on-pegi-ratings-criteria-as-games-with-actual-gambling-are-sold-to-kids/1100-6528491/" data-ref-id="1100-6528491">Developer LocalThunk</a> said that they didn't have a problem with the rating itself for Balatro, but pointed out that games like EA Sports FC have microtransactions and loot boxes while being classified as PEGI 3+, meaning "suitable for all ages."</p><p>Balatro is one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's best games of 2024</a>, and it has received numerous awards and nominations at shows like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/28th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6116/" data-ref-id="2900-6116">2025 DICE Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-developers-choice-awards-2025-nominees-revealed/2900-6173/" data-ref-id="2900-6173">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-york-game-awards-2025-all-nominees/2900-6106/" data-ref-id="2900-6106">New York Game Awards 2025</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a>, a publisher with a stellar track record when it comes to quality releases, might have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">been in the news lately for its mass departures</a> and other strange business, but it's eager for everyone to know the show - or rather the showcase, in this particular instance - must go on. So here we are, with a closer look at its next slate of titles - some known, some new, but all looking intriguing for their own reasons. So if you're eager to see what's on the horizon for Annapurna and its talented development partners, read on...

<h3>Wheel World</h3>
<figure>

<p>
If Wheel World looks familiar, that might be because it was initially unveiled under the name Ghost World back in 2023. But despite its new moniker, the fundamentals remain the same. Developed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nidhogg">Nidhogg</a> studio Messhoff, it's a single-player open-world biking adventure with a touch of the supernatural - conjuring up a beautifully stylised world where players are free to simply putter around taking in the sights, or test their pedal mettle against quirky rivals and elite cycling teams. It looks a treat, and is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC this "summer".

<h3>Wanderstop</h3>

<p>
Wanderstop, as you might already know, is first game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> co-creator Davey Wreden's Ivy Road studio. It's described as a "narrative-centric cosy game about change and tea", and while there's definitely a jaunty management aspect to it, Wanderstop seems equally concerned with exploring the emotional journey of its protagonist, Alta - a warrior who's somehow ended up running a teashop in a magical forest and is definitely not happy about it. It's an intriguing take on the often cloying cosy phenomenon, and we'll see how well it all works when Wanderstop launches for Xbox Series X/S, layStation 5, and PC on 11th March. And if you want to get stuck in sooner, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/">Steam demo's out now</a>.
</p>
<h3>Skin Deep</h3>
<figure></figure>
<p>
It's been seven years since Thirty Flights of Loving developer Blendo Games' last release - VR strategy game Flotilla 2 - but the acclaimed studio is back with Skin Deep. Described as an "immersive first-person shooter [with] sneezing", Skin Deep follows the adventures of Nina Pasadena - once one of the galaxy's best assassins, now a lowly insurance commando. As Skin Deep begins, Nina's starship is raided by pirates, meaning players will need to "sneak, subvert, and sabotage", sandbox-style, across its non-linear interior to save the day. Oh, and you have no shoes. Skin Deep launches for PC on 30th April and a demo's out now.
</p>
<h3>Cocoon news and a brief tease</h3>
<figure></figure>
<p>
If you liked what Cocoon was popping in your ears when it released back in 2023 (subsequently becoming Eurogamer's Game of the Year), you might be thrilled to hear it's getting a vinyl soundtrack, reimagining its procedural music in more permanent form. There's also a Cocoon Collector's Edition incoming, AND developer Geometric Interactive has teased a new project that's being published by Annapurna Interactive. Details pretty much none existent right now, but the studio says it's unlike anything it's made before.

<p>
If you haven't already seen Lushfoil Photography Sim in motion, you should stop and watch its trailer right now. Developer Matt Newell has created some absolutely gorgeous environments for his freeform photography sim - little slice of real-world wilderness where players can complete objectives or simply explore and interact with the world. There are kites to fly, bikes to ride, boats to row, and - of course - photos to snap across the crystalline lakes and forests of Italy, the sunset-lit beaches of South West Australia, the moody valleys of Southern Iceland, and more. You can even splash around in the Northern England rain if you fancy something closer to home. Lushfoil Photography Sim comes to PC on 15th April, and a demo's out now.

<p>
Faraway, from developer Steph Thirion, is an "infinitely replayable immersive cosmic game" about a shooting star that wants to see the universe - which it does by whirling around, connecting stars, and creating constellations. It's a game of interstellar flinging that's designed to be as accessible as possible, only requiring a single button to play. But it also promises hidden depths, with talk of randomly generated stages to mix things up, score-multiplying loop-building, and other mechanical nuances. It's even got a couple of different puzzle modes too. Faraway doesn't have a release date yet but it coming to PC this year.

<p>
If you've been wondering what <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi has been up to recently, here's your answer. To a T, from Takahashi's Uvula studio, is a 3D narrative adventure focusing on Teen, a teenager trying to live their life in a small coastal town, despite being permanently stuck in a T-shape. Made in collaboration with AbleGamers, it follows Teen across several days as they find a way to fit in, gaining a newfound sense of self along the way. It's got unicycling, corn-eating, sunset-watching, silly mini-games, a colourful world to explore, lots of customisation, and a "very cute dog". All this comes to Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Game Pass on 28th May this year.

<p>
Who better to overcome a clique of killer cats than a cute little mouse with a peculiar deck of cards? That's the basic premise of Morsels, a top-down action-roguelite from developer Furcula that sees players traversing the dangerous upper worlds in order to bring down their feline oppressors. Those cards, in case you're wondering, have the power to transform into little monsters, which - when combined with the ability to switch between different characters at will - promises frenetic, endlessly replayable action. This one arrives later this year.

<p>
And finally! Developer Simogo's gorgeously dreamy arcade oddity <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sayonara-wild-hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> - officially a game about "riding motorcycles, skateboarding, dance battling, shooting lasers, wielding swords, and breaking hearts" - is coming to PS5 with a few new features. Its announcement referenced an "exclusive" unlockable game mode, high score battles in random stages, and other stuff - all of which is out today on PlayStation 5, and owners of the PlayStation 4 version can upgrade for free.

			<p>The next major update to Infinity Nikki will be coming soon and will launch after server maintenance takes place on February 26. The new season will launch on February 26 and will run until March 25, where players will be given the opportunity to explore the Queen's Palace Ruins and uncover all of the secrets that lay on the grounds. This comes in the form of a cursed song, and players will have to help out the legendary creature Bullquet in a sweet side quest. If you are interested in what the Eerie Season has to offer in Infinity Nikki, make sure to check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The official trailer for Version 1.3 [Eerie Season] is now live!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQG9MKHvB_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Eerie Season will take players away from the vibrancy and pastel colors and instead transport them to a world filled with Gothic aesthetics, Supernatural phenomena, and new challenges.</p>
<p>Throughout the ruins of Queen Philomia's palace, there have been peculiar singing voices that echo off of the walls of the palace, which has led people to believe that the ruins are cursed. Once the day turns to night, the melodies can be heard through the corridors, where the residents of Florawish have become unnerved and fear the grounds of the ruins. As a result of this, Nikki and Momo take a journey into the Queen's Palace Ruins, where there are plenty of secrets to be uncovered.</p>
<p>The initial event will be named The Queen's Lament. Once players have completed this, they will then gain access to the Queen's Palace Ruins: Inner Court dungeon, which provides a new, scary challenge to take on.&nbsp; In addition, once players have cleared this dungeon, they will then be able to visit the high tower in the Queen's Palace Ruins at night, where they will be able to play the piano beside Ms. Glove.</p>
<p>Through the Eerie Season, players will be able to obtain 15 Revelation Crystals and a new outfit named the Dream Chaser completely for free. In the Heartfelt Gifts Store, there will be three more free outfits to obtain, which brings the grand total to nine free outfits throughout the history of Infinity Nikki. <a href="https://www.infoldgames.com/en/home#product">Infold Games</a> continues to be dedicated to the community of Infinity Nikki, and continues to work to optimize the game and ensure that players are having a good time playing the game, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-available-to-wishlist-on-steam/">title set to soon release</a> on Steam.</p>
<p>Players will be able to experience the Gothic and supernatural beauty of Eerie Season once it is released after the maintenance on February 26, where the season will then run until March 25.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A giant rooster that sets a desert sea on fire every time it brushes its beautiful but deadly tail feathers. A toad-like octopus that sends mini-tidal waves roiling through a thick jungle forest as it flops around like a violent puppy. These and other majestic creatures I’ve killed dozens of times in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, and I would gladly do it again.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter</em>’s greatest trick has always been making ecological slaughter feel so engaging, necessary, and urgent that players repeat the same tasks with slight variations for dozens of hours on end. Instead of being bored or exhausted, the endless, vicious cycle leaves us exhilarated and rejuvenated. Slicing rare horns, hides, and relics from fallen prey for the 100th time leaves us not with an existential crisis but with a fresh grin on our face. </p><p>That magic is as alive and cleverly engineered as ever in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. The blockbuster sequel, out February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, presents Capcom’s long-running action-RPG series at its most visually impressive and intricately designed yet, with striking vistas transformed on a dime by sudden storms and beasts of all shapes, sizes, and temperaments living in them. It takes players to the Forbidden Lands to research a previously unexplored region that’s home to new monsters, mysterious weather events, and the remnants of an ancient civilization. </p><p>It’s a massive undertaking full of sprawling maps to explore and some of the coolest boss fights in modern gaming. I’ve had a blast giving myself over to its mesmerizing reward loop, and it’s a game I will continue playing a ton of in the future. At the same time, the few dozen hours I’ve spent with  <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> so far have left me slightly disappointed at just how familiar and unsurprising it all feels. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is a comprehensive visual and combat spectacle that still is still very much a <em>Monster Hunter </em>game, often for better but occasionally for worse.</p><p>It doesn’t feel like the <em>Monster Hunter</em> of the future so much as the super ultra deluxe version of the series as we know it today. Its bells and whistles are mostly quality-of-life improvements, and the splendor of its world is richly layered but more subtle than it’s been in the past. The formula of 1.) find monster, 2.) kill monster, 3.) turn it into cool stuff has been streamlined within an inch of its life, both to deliver the franchise’s core pleasures in rapid, breakneck succession, and also perhaps in a bid to make an infamously dense, arcane, and overwhelming series more hospitable than ever to newcomers. </p><p>The big back-of-the-box innovation this time around is a more seamless  world. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is divided into a series of large open zones. These biomes, from icy caverns to volcanic pits, become characters in their own right as you spend hours combing through them for your quarry and crafting resources. Traveling between these areas involves astoundingly brief loading screens. More importantly, players can travel between their camps and the hunting zones themselves without any loading screen at all, engaging in quests one after the other without constantly being forced to hop back and forth. </p><p><br>You can even cook up meals—an important preparation technique for getting battle-enhancing status buffs—mid-mission now. It is both ridiculously absurd and absurdly satisfying to break out the grill 25 feet away from the dragon-like Rathalos, fry up some fish, and watch my hunter’s eyes briefly glaze over with foodie pleasure before she needs to rapidly dodge away from the incoming beast’s attacks.</p><p> The actual “hunting” part of the series is more nonexistent than ever. Playing through the campaign, I simply selected quests from a menu and then immediately bee-line toward my objective. Finding monsters while simply roaming around environments is equally a breeze. They’ll pop up on a 3D map bursting with icons on which all of their movements can be followed with drone-like surveillance precision. Selecting them gives the option to turn them into quests and then be guided to them automatically by new mounts called Seikrets. The frictionlessness of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>can be liberating, but it also feels like a missed opportunity. </p><p>Man, do I love my Seikret though. The galloping bird, a cross between a raptor and an ostrich, feels better to ride than any horse I’ve ever encountered in an open-world game. It’s superbly animated and controls with just enough imprecision and lag to make it feel like you’re actually riding something while gracefully leaping over most impediments in the environment without ever losing speed or getting snagged. While this can make <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ world feel smaller and less intimidating, it’s a great way to show off its grandeur. Zipping up tree vines and down sand dunes turns  drudgery into a theme park ride as I rapidly pick up resources scattered around the ground along the way. </p><p>To the degree that the Seikret is the star of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it shines most during battle. It can serve as a springboard for hopping onto monsters’ backs or quickly pull you up off the ground right after you get clobbered. Its saddle bag contains not just supplies that let you restock important items, but also a second weapon you can take with you wherever you go. Tired of that slow bulldozer of a hammer? Switch to dual blades completely change up the rhythm of a fight in an instant. Or pair a long blade with a heavy bow gun to switch between short-range attacks and long-range damage. More options, less hassle is one of the mantras animating <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. <br></p><p><br>I spent much most of my time with my tried-and-true greatsword, opting for an iconic <em>Monster Hunter </em>archetype that hits like a jet engine but moves much more slowly. The lack of speed is meant to balance out its high damage potential, yet it also reinforces the natural physics of a six-foot person trying to swing around an eight-foot broadsword. I can feel my hunter’s muscles burning under the weight of a missed double swing as she tries to pick the weapon back up off the dirt, each frame meticulously animated to look at home in the world and also convey to me, the player, that I need to aim better.</p><p>Details like this add up to make the moment-to-moment combat in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> rewarding and entertaining long-past its sell-by date. It’s chunky yet fluid, like a delicious soup of high-stakes creature looting. Hitting the same spot on a monster over and over yields wounds that can be targeted with new cinematic focus attacks to deal extra damage and earn extra rewards. The game’s 14 weapons each have their own focus attacks, which were reason enough for me to experiment with ones I wouldn’t have otherwise tried like the Insect Glaive. </p><p>Hopping off the Seikret and onto a monster’s back turns encounters into <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> for a moment, as you move up and down the creature’s spine to avoid being shaken off while stabbing it to create new wounds. Combine it all with shock traps, pitfalls, exploding barrels, and other players and you have a recipe for making my sixth knock-down, drag-out fight against the roaring lion bear hybrid Doshaguma<strong>&nbsp;</strong>something I wish I were doing  right this second.</p><p> Story has never been <em>Monster Hunter</em>’s strong point and none of this is propelled along by compelling drama or intriguing mysteries. The characters this time around are charming and dutifully carry out their roles, but rarely rise beyond the level of glorified quest giver or exposition vehicle. A journey to reunite a strange child with his secret tribe who are being terrorized by an unknown “White Wraith” is aggressively predictable at every turn. All of it is briskly paced and does an admirable job of table setting for the endgame in which players are meant to spend the majority of their time, even if it much of it still feels like a formality before the “real game” begins in the back half. <br></p><p><br>This post-game that opens up after the credits roll introduces the “higher ranks” at which players get to hunt stronger versions of the monsters they’ve already encountered, including new Tempered and Frenzied variants which contain even more unique materials necessary for crafting additional sets of armor and weapons. I’ve only scratched the surface of this loot chase, and all I can say is that I’m looking forward to excavating it as deeply and completely as my time allows. This high-end gear bestows bonuses and enables strategies for taking on the game’s toughest bosses and, more importantly, it looks really cool. Fashion is the low-key driver of the series’ grim in-game economy, and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> has the drip.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter</em> has always traded in eye-popping scale, and the latest sequel carries on that tradition. But it hasn’t done so at the expense of depth, or at least the feeling of depth. Some video-game world simulations feel paper thin with the machinery poking through at the seams. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ feels naturalistic and multi-layered. I’ve spent most of my time with it so far tangling with its largest creatures, but the wildlife is much more extensive than that, and so subtly executed that it’s easily missed while you’re focused on chasing down giant sandworms and oily wyverns. Smaller herds of giant possums, flocks of birds, and families of river lizards abound, occasionally asserting themselves when you least expect it. </p><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is at its most beautiful and chaotic when all the elements and residents of its dynamic world accidentally collide; multiple monsters locked in a turf war as smaller creatures scurry around, some trying to escape, others following their pack leader into the action, all while hunters set exploding traps and raging storms pass through before eventually breaking into daylight. I wish all of this were  integrated into the harder, better, stronger, faster logic at the heart of the game’s RPG progression in more sophisticated ways, but that liveliness does inject more life and zeal into a very familiar pattern, one that still works and now feels more robust than ever. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-ceo-says-company-will-train-new-ai-on-a-catalog-of-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft’s plans for its new Muse AI technology for video games appears to be ready to move into full gear. In a recent interview, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the company is getting ready to start training its new AI system on a “catalog of games”.</p>



<p>Speaking on the Dwarkesh Patel Podcast—h/t to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-train-its-gaming-ai-on-a-catalogue-of-titles-soon-satya-nadella-says-and-then-start-playing-them" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>—Nadella says that the plan is to train the AI system on games so that it can actually start playing them.</p>



<p>“When&nbsp;Phil Spencer&nbsp;first showed it to me, he had an Xbox controller and this model basically took the input and generated the output based on the input. And it was consistent with the game,” Nadella said.</p>



<p>“That to me is a massive, massive moment of ‘wow’. It’s kind of like the first time we saw ChatGPT complete sentences, or Dall-E draw, or Sora. This is one such moment.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As far as how this ability and training will help with game development and gamers, in general, Nadella didn’t go into any specifics. </p>



<p>According to Microsoft’s announcement of Muse, not only does it have the potential to assist with game development and accessibility, but it could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-technology-could-help-game-preservation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help with game preservation</a> as well.</p>



<p>The idea of AI in gaming continues to be a much discussed topic. Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-players-want-to-filter-out-games-that-use-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam users began requesting</a> the ability to filter out games that use generative AI. Even CEO’s have gotten in on the topic with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick believing</a> that there’s truly no such thing as “artificial intelligence”.</p>

TESRenewal, the modding group working on the project, made the announcement in a new gameplay video showcasing some of Oblivion's upgraded cities, but the team said they still don't have an anticipated release date yet. It'll just be sometime in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">"Making games takes time, this goes double for a volunteer project the size of a AAA game that took a team of full-time devs years to make," the group said, echoing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-to-release-by-2025/1100-6510685/" data-ref-id="1100-6510685">similar statement made in 2023</a>. "Regardless we would like to share today that Skyblivion is in a state where we can promise a 2025 release at the latest.

In addition to improved lighting and assets at higher resolutions, TESRenewal added a new leveling system, changed boss encounters, altered enemy scaling, and even expanded locations.

When Skyblivion does launch, its updates will apply to the entirety of Oblivion, including all side quests and locations.

Oblivion and its DLC are available on Steam.</p>

            <p>Balatro, the poker-themed roguelite, has successfully appealed PEGI's decision to classify it as PEGI 18 and has now been recategorised as suitable for players aged 12 and up.</p>
<p>About a year ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-creator-speaks-out-on-gambling-rating-drama">developer Localthunk commented on PEGI's perceived mishandling of the game's rating</a> after it was pulled from sale in some countries due to a "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'", stating "it is what it is".</p>

<p>"The PEGI 18 rating for the game Balatro has been changed to a PEGI 12 following a successful appeal submitted by publisher Sold Out Sales &amp; Marketing," the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) organisation announced on its <a href="https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12">website</a> earlier today.</p>
<p>"The Complaints Board concluded that, although the game explains the various hands of poker, the roguelike deck-building game contained mitigating fantastical elements that warranted a PEGI 12 rating."</p>
<p>Similarly, Luck Be A Landlord has also been reclassified as PEGI 12.</p>
<p>"At this moment, any teaching or glamorisation of simulated gambling automatically leads to a PEGI 18 rating," the ratings board stated.</p>
<p>"On the basis of these appeals, the PEGI Experts Group will develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes and the simulation, teaching and glamorisation of gambling in different age categories, which will now include 12 but also keep 18 as an age category for games that simulate gambling typically played in casinos and betting halls."</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is a more than worthy new entry in the series, but it fails to deliver a technically sound experience on consoles, with image quality and performance issues on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> released their analysis of the console versions of the new entry in the series launching this week, detailing the three display modes featured on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and what exactly they deliver in terms of resolution and performance. Among the three modes, the only mode that delivers 60 FPS gameplay is Resolution mode, which targets 900p resolution but employs dynamic resolution that hits as low as 720p resolution in demanding sequences and as high as 1080p in lighter sequences. With such low resolutions, it is not surprising to see how Performance mode delivers disappointing image quality, featuring not only blurrier visuals than the other modes, but also some evident visual settings cutbacks, such as aggressive LOD behavior, simplified screen space reflections, and more. The game also uses AMD FSR 1 to upscale to 4K resolution with no temporal upsampling process, which only makes the visuals look worse.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds performance on consoles also leaves something to be desired, as Performance mode doesn't deliver smooth 60 FPS gameplay, with some frequent dips below the target that are only alleviated on a VRR-capable display. Resolution and Balanced mode do a better job at keeping their 30 and 40 FPS targets, though still with some drops. The uncapped framerate option also doesn't seem to be doing a lot, as all display modes run at their framerate target for the most part, with infrequent performance uplifts in light sequences.</p>
<p>With the more powerful current-generation systems struggling in certain scenarios, it's not surprising to see Monster Hunter Wilds look and run the worst out of all consoles on Xbox Series S. This version of the game not only sports worse image quality with even more visual cutbacks than Performance mode, such as the complete removal of screen space reflections and lower texture quality, but it also runs the worst, with frequent framerate drops from the 30 FPS that are far from ideal for a game like this.</p>

<p>On PC, sadly, things don't fare much better, and only top-end machines can run Monster Hunter Wilds at 60 frames per second and above. You can learn more about this version of the game with my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-talos-principle-reawakened-release-date-revealed-for-april.1117230/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital and Croteam have announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened</em>, the remastered version of the two studios' philosophical 2014 puzzler.</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/the-talos-principle-reawakened-launches-april-10" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>officially launches across PC and current-gen consoles (sorry, Switch owners) on April 10th. What's more, you can check a demo of the game out right now as part of the always-excellent Steam Next Fest.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-2025" rel="nofollow">back in December</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>is a remastered version of the 2014 original, although when it was first announced, Devolver and Croteam promised it would be "more than a remaster", serving instead as the "definitive edition" of the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-talos-principle-reawakened-release-date-water.jpg?itok=cWo5ukrx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-talos-principle-reawakened-release-date-water.jpg?itok=BUnL2SxS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>will offer a sumptuous visual upgrade over the 2014 original when it arrives in April.</figcaption></figure><p>Major changes compared to the original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>include a full visual overhaul courtesy of a switch to Unreal Engine 5. You can expect new lighting, new visual effects, and new design elements as well.</p>

<p>Devolver and Croteam are also promising "modernized quality-of-life updates that maintain the vision of the original classic", although the two studios don't go into detail regarding what those changes are.</p>

<p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>also includes the DLC expansion&nbsp;<em>Road to Gehenna</em>, which was released in 2015. As well as that, it'll pack in a brand new chapter titled "In the Beginning", which will explore "the origins of the Simulation", according to the devs.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense of some of the visual improvements made in&nbsp;<em>Reawakened&nbsp;</em>(although the original&nbsp;<em>Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>was certainly no slouch in this area), you can check out the original announcement trailer here.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle</em>, it's a puzzle game by&nbsp;<em>Serious Sam&nbsp;</em>developer Croteam, and it eschews the frantic action of that franchise for a more thoughtful, contemplative approach.</p>

<p>I don't want to spoil the game's mysteries, but suffice it to say that if you're in the mood to debate philosophy with computers and solve some brain-teasers along the way, then this is very much the game for you.</p>

<p><em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2806640/The_Talos_Principle_Reawakened/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012495" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on April 10th. You can check out the Steam Next Fest demo of the game on PC right now.</p>

Though these posts were removed, they've been saved and widely reshared online. Per <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/assassins-creed-shadows-physical-copies-sold-early-leaks-gameplay-shared-online/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, auction listings have appeared on sites like Mercari offering copies of the game for $100, which quickly sold.

Assassin's Creed Shadows itself has been delayed numerous times. The details of the game's DLC, Claws of Awaji, were leaked earlier this year on its Steam page, confirming 10 hours of additional gameplay. Note that this DLC is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-release-its-expansion-in-a-much-different-way/1100-6529019/" data-ref-id="1100-6529019">a preorder bonus</a>, and will also be available as a separate purchase later in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/617587/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-xbox-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In my first few hours with <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, I fought against a gigantic spider in waters that were as red as blood and dodged the onslaught of a twisting dragon amid a desert storm, complete with powerful strikes of lightning terrorizing the ground around me. I went up against sandworms and giant apes and a poisonous bug that could inflate itself while causing a cascade of explosions in the ground below. Each battle felt monumental — and the scale only increased the more I played.</p><p>This focus on spectacle is what sets <em>Wilds</em> apart. The game is the follow-up to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/25/16931366/monster-hunter-world-review-ps4-xbox-one-release-date"><em>Monster Hunter World</em></a>, which shook up the series with a larger, more open world and catapulted it from Japanese phenomenon to global blockbuster. <em>World</em> went on to become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682599/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-preview-kaname-fujioka-interview-e3-2019">Capcom’s bestselling game ever</a>, no small feat for the company behind <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em>. Instead of changing things up once again, <em>Wilds</em> ups the ante and makes its monster battles feel bigger than ever.</p><p>The <em>MonHun </em>games are all built around a specific gameplay cycle. You prepare for a hunt by getting your gear in order, you head out and study your target, and then you spend a long time slowly whittling down the health of a giant monster before killing it. Once it’s dead, you carve some pieces off the creature and head back home to forge new armor with it and start the cycle all over again, only more powerful this time. Also, you have a giant talking cat that serves as your assistant.</p><p><em>Wilds</em> follows this same structure but moves it to a new, mostly uninhabited locale known as the Forbidden Lands. There’s a story about helping a young boy whose village was decimated and following a particularly dangerous creature known as The White Wraith. Mostly, though, the story is just an excuse to take on increasingly challenging hunts across this surprisingly diverse landscape.</p><p>There are a few new details to <em>Wilds</em>. A targeting system lets you really focus on a particular part of a monster’s body in battle, so you can open up a wound and hack away at it to cause lots of damage. You can also store a second weapon type on your mount, opening more options in combat, since weapons greatly determine your playstyle. And of course, there are new monsters and items and locations. You start out in a barren desert, but the Forbidden Lands eventually opens up to include locales like a lush jungle teeming with wildlife and a volcanic oil field that looks ripped out of a postapocalyptic future.</p><p>What’s really different this time around, though, is how massive and cinematic the battles feel. You’ve always fought against giant beasts in <em>MonHun</em> — that’s kind of the whole point — but here, more care has been put toward the backdrop. The action set pieces are ripped right out of a blockbuster movie, and they all have their own feel. That could mean the almost horror-like sensation of that spider swiping at you while your vision is filled with red or facing off against a beast during a dramatic downpour with the wind creating huge waves crashing down all around you. These moments can be terrifying, thrilling, or exciting — and often all three at the same time.</p><p>In a lot of ways, <em>Wilds</em> represents the <em>MonHun</em> team slowly perfecting its more modern formula. It in no way represents a dramatic change, which means it can still be a little rigid in places, particularly when it comes to futzing with menus to use all of the various items at your disposal. More than once, I accidentally whipped out my portable barbecue in the middle of a tense conflict because I hit the wrong button. But for the most part, this is the most accessible <em>MonHun</em> to date, and one that builds on the open-world foundation laid down by <em>World</em>, including more seamless transitions between areas that makes it feel like one big, cohesive place.</p><p>Even in its first real competition with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23599391/wild-hearts-review-ps5-xbox-pc">2023’s <em>Wild Hearts</em></a>, which infused monster hunting with <em>Fortnite</em>-like building, <em>Wilds</em> shows that there’s still nothing quite like the thrill of a hunt in <em>MonHun</em>. They can be exhausting and challenging and, at times, frustrating; my thumb remains sore from all of the rolling and dodging I’ve done over the past week. But it’s also immensely satisfying to actually pull off taking down one of its massive beasts, a combined sense of relief and joy that few other experiences can replicate. <em>Wilds</em> doesn’t change any of that — it makes it feel even bigger.</p><p><sub>Monster Hunter Wilds <em>launches February 28th on PC, PS5, and Xbox.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I have upsetting news. Some months back, I had electrical work done on my office to install ceiling lights. In trying to figure out a problem with the grounding of an outlet, we reset some breakers around the house to diagnose the issue. In doing so, my tiny Costco hot tub was turned off. It does not have a fancy app to tell me it turned off, and so, instead, it just slowly got colder and colder, until the heating pump broke, and simply beeped instead of working. It is now a brick of ice on my patio, waiting for the spring to unthaw it, so I can throw it out. RIP.</p><p>-pk, who is too sad to consider buying another one</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Hotline</em> – Welcome to the first Remap Hotline of 2025!

To a T focuses on a teenager named Teen, who is stuck in a T-Pose and their dog needs to assist them with everyday activities such as getting dressed and washing their face.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7PWNpBDPjI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L7PWNpBDPjI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The AbleGamers organization is collaborating with Takahashi and his studio, uvula, as To a T is an allegory about being disabled. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23777644/to-a-t-keita-takahashi-uvula-annapurna-interactive" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AbleGamers provided feedback</a> on the game's design as the studio was seeking input on sensitivity and accessibility.</p><p>Described as a narrative adventure game, To a T follows Teen as they discover some sort of mysterious ability due to their T-pose posture and must uncover its origins while exploring the town and going to school.
