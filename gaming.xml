This news follows on from Arkane Austin being shut down last week, and there was an initial announcement that there would be no more updates for Redfall. However, that has now changed as it has been confirmed that the development team are able to release this.</p>

            <p>War never changes, and either does <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s love of a crossover. Thus, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a> and Fortnite are colliding as the post-apocalyptic RPG heads to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">battle royale</a> shooter’s upcoming next season.</p>

<p>The official Fortnite TwiXer account confirmed that Fallout would appear in its Wrecked season - that’s Chapter 5 Season 3, for those keeping count - by sharing an imagine of a Brotherhood of Steel knight in the iconic T-60 power armour looming over some yellow-orange clouds. Accompanying the teaser image were emoji of a winking face and a thumbs-up - a fairly unsubtle reference to Fallout's chirpy Vault Boy mascot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fortnite’s own in-game announcement adds that the crossover will arrive “courtesy of the Brotherhood of Steel” in exactly one week: next Friday, May 24th.</p>
<p>The reveal of the Fallout x Fortnite collab - the latest in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-will-soon-let-you-shoot-solid-snake-in-his-beautiful-butt-as-family-guys-peter-griffin-it-seems">long line of video game crossovers</a> for Epic’s battle royale game after the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war">God of War</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo</a>’s Master Chief - comes as it gears up for the next evolution of its map.</p>
<p>As is now standard for Fortnite, its next season was teased by an in-game event. This time, it saw the currently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnites-myths-mortals-season-lets-you-wield-godlike-powers-and-bullet-bend-as-avatar-korra-later-today">Greek-themed map</a>’s statue of Zeus raise its sword to the sky and summon a pillar of red lightning that crashed onto Pandora’s Box. From there, the lightning ball went skipping over the map before exploding on the horizon, bringing forth dark clouds of a storm crackling with energy while an electric guitar shredded in the background.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>There’s been rumour of the Wrecked season having a post-apocalyptic theme - which the crossover with Fallout would certainly lend weight to - with recent leaks hinting at another collab with Mad Max, presumably timed with upcoming prequel movie Furiosa. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-latest-live-event-kicks-off-countdown-to-mad-max-esque-new-season">Eurogamer</a>.) Billie Eilish is also expected to turn up at some point, becoming the latest musician to enter the Fortnite spotlight after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnites-next-live-music-concert-is-eminem-marking-the-rappers-first-video-game-cameo-in-almost-20-years">Eminem</a>, Ariana Grande and more.</p>
<p>As for the Fallout crossover, we don’t yet know what it’ll look like. Will it just focus on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fallout-tv-show-gave-the-fallout-games-a-huge-player-bump-as-everyone-remembers-they-like-fallout">very popular</a> Amazon TV series? Or will it dare to delve deeper than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>, 3 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> by pulling out some nods to the series’ early CRPG roots? We’ll know in a week!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-am-i-crying-because-of-a-damn-video-game-commercial.874347/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24159066/ea-sports-college-football-trailer-analysis<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="6eeVbx">I woke up this morning thinking I would be a normal, composed adult. Instead, I find myself crumpled over my keyboard, misty-eyed, compulsively texting friends I haven’t spoken to in years about a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158944/college-football-25-trailer-gameplay-modes">trailer for a football video game</a>.</p>
<p id="aKz67m">Is this how my parents felt when they watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6QsCOU35ug">coffee commercials</a> in the ’90s? Am I having a midlife crisis? Maybe!</p>
<p id="XJF2f3">That won’t stop me from turning inward and answering a question I haven’t been able to shake since breakfast. Why is the trailer for EA Sports College Football 2025 <em>so</em> effective? I don’t have one definitive answer, but I do have three guesses:</p>
<p id="3HjAbQ"><strong>This trailer had to be excellent.</strong> A lot has changed since <em>NCAA Football 14</em> paused the series over a decade ago. The willingness of the NCAA (and EA, as a partner) to exploit unpaid college athletes became a popular and effective talking point across popular culture, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_Baby_Athletic_Association">episodes of <em>South Park</em></a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6fZV3OP44E">congressional hearings</a>. EA’s other football series, Madden, theoretically well-positioned with the exclusive rights to NFL simulation games, became a shadow of its past, inventive self. And the reputation of EA — following years of creative misfires and studio mismanagement — now stands somewhere between the DMV and the dentist. </p>
<p id="gzrYeO">The EA marketing team wasn’t going to let this rare, ultra-positive opportunity — bringing back a long-requested series, involving college athletes — go to waste.</p>
<div id="K299vq"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="1UlUHD"><strong>They borrowed from the best.</strong> Something about this trailer felt uncannily familiar, but it took a few viewings to pin that something down. It’s this: EA used the GTA trailer template. Quite literally. Take a moment to watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1QDaXkufCo"><em>College Football 25 </em>trailer</a> alongside the trailer for <em>GTA 6,</em> embedded above.</p>
<p id="w0U2WJ">When Rockstar announces a new GTA game, their goal isn’t to show the experience of playing the game, but to produce the bubbly brain chemical feeling of being in the latest open world. GTA reveal trailers are, in the most skeletal form, montages of locals expressing themselves in big and emotional ways, interspersed with beautiful landscapes and iconic architecture. </p>
<p id="lc02yI">The format is a natural fit for EA’s College Football series, which places the pageantry of the sport right alongside the actual playing of football.  Players tap lucky charms on the way to the field. Live animal mascots buck on the sideline. A dude in a Trojan outfit stabs a football field with a sword as if to say, “Fuck off, this is my turf! I have a fucking sword!” </p>
<p id="woUeU5">When the Houser brothers founded Rockstar, they wanted to borrow from record labels, which knew one thing mattered above all else: the right vibes. I don’t think it’s an accident the <em>College Football 25</em> trailer uses a version of Guns N’ Roses “Welcome to the Jungle,” the song Rockstar used to reveal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOzcbtsw_pQ"><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em></a>.</p>
<div id="SLjffa"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1QDaXkufCo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="NdssYm"><strong>It’s been too long. </strong><em>NCAA Football 14, </em>the previous entry in the series, was released over a decade ago — around the time my connection with the series was on the wane. </p>
<p id="Rkd56C">Years before that, in the mid-’00s, the NCAA Football games had been the glue that bonded me and my college roommates. We never got the traditional American college football experience — the NYU Violets last played in 1952 — so we built increasingly intense allegiances to our favorite teams in the game, and then, gradually, outside the game too. By senior year, we regularly hounded one another about the superiority of USC, <em>The </em>Ohio State University, and the University of Texas, none of which we attended. Or had even visited. </p>
<p id="OpECn3">As we left college and our lives became busy in the way all adult lives do, we shed our ironic-but-not-ironic fandoms. And with little connection to the teams, and less time on our hands, our NCAA Football matchups faded, too. I was sad when EA put the kibosh on the series in 2014, perhaps less because I missed the game than I missed my friends.</p>
<p id="ks68Ch">So now, seeing this trailer, I’m flooded with all the good memories spent on a filthy couch that we took from the trash of a neighboring apartment building. That’s probably the real reason a video game trailer can make me cry. </p>

  <p id="TPKImH"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24071083/fallout-tv-show-cast-seasons-explained">Fallout</a> is coming to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. Exactly how and when Bethesda Softworks’ post-apocalyptic franchise is coming to Epic’s battle royale-turned-everything game is unclear, but we’re pretty much guaranteed to get some cartoonish power armor out of it. We’re also likely to get some Vault Dweller jumpsuits, but it remains to be seen what exactly Epic and Bethesda have cooked up for the highly anticipated collaboration.</p>
<p id="SbCEpn">The official <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1791499072789979575">Fortnite social media account on X</a> (formerly Twitter) teased the crossover on Friday, hinting that Fallout-style bases and post-nuclear devastation could be dropping in on the battle royale island. No doubt Vault Boy will also make an appearance as part of the collab.</p>

<p id="Srgf3B"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131018/fallout-games-steam-player-count-bethesda-tv-show">Interest in the Fallout franchise is at a high point</a> right now, thanks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24122477/fallout-tv-series-review-prime-video-show">Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> TV series</a> and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24127478/fallout-4-next-gen-update-bethesda-tv-show">recent “next-gen” update for <em>Fallout 4</em></a>. That free upgrade rolled out for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of <em>Fallout 4</em> in April, and Bethesda’s been patching it up since.</p>
<p id="LNZliz"><em>Fortnite</em> players may get their hands on that Fallout-inspired content as early as next week. Chapter 5 season 3 of <em>Fortnite</em> — reportedly titled “Wrecked” — is expected to launch on May 24.</p>
<p id="2WRDtd">The Fallout franchise appears to also be coming to another big game soon: Call of Duty. Dataminers have <a href="https://x.com/CODWarfareForum/status/1785712301577789550">uncovered references to Fallout</a> (alongside Gundam and The Crow) that could be hints about content planned for season 4 of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> and <em>Warzone 2.0</em>. Call of Duty’s next season launches May 29.</p>

It started when Doja apparently tweeted a criticism of <em>Fortnite</em>’s waterbending ability, which was added to the game in the ongoing season to complement the introduction of a <em>Legend of Korra </em>skin and an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-avatar-last-airbender-skins-characters-sokka-1851399985&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-avatar-last-airbender-skins-characters-sokka-1851399985"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender </em>event</a></span> that concluded earlier this month. Doja has since deleted the tweet, but quote-tweeted a response to it and said, “IM HAVING A FUCKING MELTDOWN” before launching into a thorougly entertaining tirade about the feature.</p><p>According to the responses Doja received, she isn’t exactly alone in hating on waterbending, which appears in the game as a Mythic weapon, and thus is more highly valued and powerful than the average gun. <em>Fortnite </em>frequently introduces weapons like these in tandem with tie-in events, to mixed results. Early on in <em>Fortnite</em>’s lifetime, it added the Infinity Blade from the titular mobile Epic Games title, which could destroy structures and obliterate players in one fell swoop. Some folks really enjoyed the obviously busted nature of the weapon, while others were critical of its inclusion in a competitive game, since it threw off the game’s balance and, they argued, nearly guaranteed victory with little to no skill necessary.<br></p><p>It seems that Doja believes this is the current problem with <em>Fortnite</em> and waterbending, which may have been seen by some as a novelty weapon when it was first introduced. Now, it appears that it has perhaps overstayed its welcome. In Doja’s own words, “YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT THE GAME BECAUSE OF WATER BENDING, I WOULD BECOME SEVERELY DEPRESSED IF I HAD TO RELY ON ANY OF THESE STUPID NON FUCKING WEAPONS.”<br></p><p>Disgruntled players have taken to Doja Cat’s replies with the rest of their <em>Fortnite</em>-related woes, which seem to be tied to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing season’s Greek theme</a></span> and the ridiculous power-ups that came with it, including the explosive Thunderbolt of Zeus. One such player responded, “deadass u a pussy if u use water bending, chains, or the thunderbolt,” though Doja didn’t entirely ascribe to the same notion. Instead, she quote tweeted them to say she thought the thunderbolt was “fine,” and shared a similar sentiment about the season’s Wings of Icarus ability too.</p><p>While players routinely have their reservations and complaints about games, it does seem like constantly shifting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474">live-service titles</a></span> such as <em>Fortnite</em> bear the brunt of these criticisms these days. At times, it can be exciting to play games like it and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span>, which introduce new features, locales, or story beats on a weekly and monthly basis, and fans of these games often eat it up and praise the teams who make it all happen. In the case of <em>Fortnite</em>, though, it seems like its current season doesn’t really resemble the game that players initially invested in, which is par for the course when a game’s M.O. is to constantly change its core DNA to match the moment and the demands of players. If it didn’t change, <em>Fortnite</em>’s fan base would be the first to dub it a dead and stagnant game, making the core issue a complex and thorny one, not to mention kind of self-inflicted.<br></p><p>In other <em>Fortnite</em>-related news, Epic just announced that the game’s latest in a never ending string of collaborations will be with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-fallout-crossover-event-teaser-official-epic-1851484808&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-fallout-crossover-event-teaser-official-epic-1851484808"><em>Fallout</em></a></span>, which has been enjoying a great deal of success following the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505">wonderful TV adaptation</a></span> that debuted last month.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

(I’ve recently been loving, but am terrible at, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627890/Ants_Took_My_Eyeball/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627890/Ants_Took_My_Eyeball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ants Took My Eyeball</em></a></span>, for instance.) I also play absolutely every <em>Metroid</em>-like platformer I can get my hands on. So what is it about <em>Animal Well</em> that is making me not only so happy, but also staying up so ludicrously late at night despite having 7am starts every morning?</p><p>I think it might be the yo-yo. But less facetiously, it’s the spectacularly tactile nature of the platforming. The little blob you play as bounces so perfectly, and with each gained ability feels leagues ahead. I deeply love how the game gives you a frisbee, but doesn’t tell you that it’s possible—well, vital—to ride on it. With every new item, there’s experimentation to discover its full potential. And yet, with all this, it doesn’t incessantly ruin all your fun with incessant boss fights! What a thing to behold. — John Walker</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3115c664ba05259f5f1b4872ec6267b3" data-recommend-id="image://3115c664ba05259f5f1b4872ec6267b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A strange creature stands before the player's sword in Dread Delusion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A strange creature stands before the player's sword in Dread Delusion." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lovely Hellplace</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3115c664ba05259f5f1b4872ec6267b3" data-recommend-id="image://3115c664ba05259f5f1b4872ec6267b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A strange creature stands before the player's sword in Dread Delusion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>Windows (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.protondb.com/app/1574240&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1574240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Deck OK</a></span>)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Venture further out into the world</p><p>I’ve said this here on <em>Kotaku </em>before, but so many role-playing games use the same Tolkien-esque building blocks in creating their worlds. And, look, there’s nothing wrong with that. I love dwarves and orcs and wizards with long gray beards as much as anyone. But it does make it all the more thrilling when you come across a world that feels truly original. I’ll never forget the excitement of venturing into <em>Morrowind</em>, finding a world with hints of familiarity, but that was also wondrous and strange. I’ve only barely stepped foot into <em>Dread Delusion</em>, a new first-person open-world RPG which just came out of early access this week, but already it’s giving me a similar feeling that I’m venturing into a world unlike any I’ve seen before. </p><p>There are familiar elements here, of course: swords and spells, sure, and vaguely <em>Warcraft</em>-esque flying airships to boot. But there are also crimson skies, and towering mushrooms, and enemies who defy description. The fact that the tech powering <em>Dread Delusion</em> makes it all feel reminiscent of late-90s <em>Might &amp; Magic </em>games only adds to the wonderfully textured atmosphere.</p><p><br>Thankfully, while the world itself is alien, the core RPG mechanics feel pretty approachable, and there’s plenty of flexibility in determining just what kind of character you want to create. As I said, I’ve only just scratched the surface of <em>Dread Delusion </em>thus far, but I’m very much looking forward to getting lost in it for a while this weekend and seeing what new wonders await over the horizon. — Carolyn Petit  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="da2d3268aacd75a5bd305cc2831dbdbd" data-recommend-id="image://da2d3268aacd75a5bd305cc2831dbdbd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="716" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Snake looks around a corner while disguised at Pliskin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Snake looks around a corner while disguised at Pliskin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da2d3268aacd75a5bd305cc2831dbdbd" data-recommend-id="image://da2d3268aacd75a5bd305cc2831dbdbd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="716" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Snake looks around a corner while disguised at Pliskin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Windows (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.protondb.com/app/2131640&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2131640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Deck O</a></span>K)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Prepare for a European Extreme mode run</p><p>Having revisited the first <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and its spin-off, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341"><em>Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions</em></a></span>, I got the impulse to move onto <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em>, one of the many games I played to death in the 2000s.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341"><em>Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions</em>: The <em>Kotaku </em>Review</a></span></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-dog-tags-aiming-mgs2-1851474122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-dog-tags-aiming-mgs2-1851474122"><em>MGS2</em></a></span> is almost too perfect for me.

It at least looks like the Brotherhood of Steel, arguably Fallout’s most recognizable faction, will show up in some form, perhaps as a purchasable skin. Some music from the series, such as The Ink Spots’ I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire, could also pop up in some form, and it wouldn’t be a shock to see a Vault Boy skin either.</p><p>Fallout’s origin goes back to the release of the original game in the late ‘90s.

With that in mind, players may want to consider that some of its characters, like Ella Purnell’s Lucy, Aaron Moten’s Maximus, and Walton Goggins’ Ghoul, could make appearances.</p><p>With the next season of Fortnite primed to launch so soon, it shouldn’t be too long before we learn more about what the Fallout collab has in store.

      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">What to expect from Season 4</h2><p dir="ltr">A new season of Call of Duty means a fresh battle pass for unlocking more weapons and cosmetics. Season passes usually contain at least one operator and two DLC weapons. One of the new free weapons for Season 4 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-4-confirms-the-return-of-iconic-rifle/1100-6523524/">confirmed to be the popular Kar98k bolt-action rifle</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on leaks from data miners, this season could include multiple crossover IP events, including collaborations with <a href="https://twitter.com/CODWarfareForum/status/1785712301577789550">Fallout, Gundam, and The Crow</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors are also swirling about a third crossover event with The Boys and a potential operator for the character Kimiko. While it might unrelated, Call of Duty socials <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1790469875057528989">commented on a new trailer for The Boys</a>, which was centered around Kimiko. Additionally, the actress who plays the character, Karen Fukuhara, was apparently also <a href="https://twitter.com/DETONATEDcom/status/1790803060840616291">seen at Infinity Ward studios</a>. The last two crossover events have added plenty of Supes to Call of Duty's growing list of operators, with Homelander, Starlight, Black Noir, A-Train, and Firecracker, so if true, it would be nice to finally see an actual member of The Boys join the lineup.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Official details haven't been revealed for this upcoming season of Warzone, but with the introduction of Rebirth Island in Season 3, players probably shouldn't expect a new map reveal. The season will likely focus on game modes, events, and new features.</p><h2 dir="ltr">MW3</h2><p dir="ltr">Activision hasn't announced any specific content for Season 4 of multiplayer, but the update will likely include new maps, game modes, and new limited-time events.</p><p dir="ltr">The recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-4-confirms-the-return-of-iconic-rifle/1100-6523524/">Season 4 teaser</a> seemingly makes a few references to the DNA Bomb multiplayer killstreak from Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare by using images of ominous green gas and a strand of DNA. This AW killstreak was earned by scoring 30 kills in one life, which is very similar to MW3's current nuke killstreak, with the only difference being that the DNA Bomb didn't end the match. It's uncertain how it might be used, as it is so similar to the existing nuke, but maybe this won't be a multiplayer feature and instead be used in Zombies or Warzone in some capacity.</p><p dir="ltr">There will likely be more Zombies content arriving sometime in Season 4, but the past two seasons have held the big Zombies update for the midseason "Reloaded" update. This means a possible new story mission, warlord boss, and new schematics could arrive, but players will likely be waiting until the halfway point of the season.</p><p dir="ltr">As always, all rumors must be taken with a grain of salt until confirmed by Activision. More official details should arrive closer to Season 4's launch.</p>

Now, these faction traitors will no longer have this power once&nbsp;<em>GZW</em>&nbsp;Patch 1 rolls out.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="317" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Netflix has released some new information about its upcoming <em>Terminator</em> anime series, now formally christened <em>Terminator Zero</em>. Alongside a batch of awesome first-look images, we also have the series’ official release date and a brief synopsis of its story. Here’s everything we know about <em>Terminator Zero</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-when-will-terminator-zero-be-released" data-injectable="false">When will Terminator Zero be released?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Production I.G</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">Barring any final-hour delays, <em>Terminator Zero</em> <strong>will be released</strong> <strong>on August 29, 2024</strong>. It’s a date with an interesting in-universe tie-in, too. Within the <em>Terminator</em> franchise, August 29, 1997, is “Judgement Day,” the day the artificial intelligence network known as Skynet is prophesized to achieve sentience and unleash nuclear Armageddon upon the world.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-is-terminator-zero-about" data-injectable="false">What is Terminator Zero about?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Production I.G</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">Like most other entries in the <em>Terminator</em> franchise, the story of <em>Terminator Zero</em> will involve time travel. The series’ protagonist, an as-yet-unnamed soldier, travels back in time to 1997 to protect Malcolm Lee, a scientist working to create a “benevolent” AI designed to protect humanity from Skynet.</p>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">Of course, the soldier’s job won’t be easy, as Skynet has sent an “unrelenting assassin” to the past to kill not only Malcolm, but also his three children. Amidst all this, Malcolm will grapple with the complex moral ramifications of designing what boils down to a digitized child soldier, who will bear the brunt of Skynet’s malevolence.</p> <h2 id="h-who-is-making-terminator-zero" data-injectable="false">Who is making Terminator Zero?</h2> <figure data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Production I.G</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">While Netflix will produce <em>Terminator Zero</em>, the series will be animated by <strong>Production I.G</strong>, the studio behind many iconic anime films and television series, including <em>Ghost in the Shell: Stand-Alone Complex</em>, <em>Psycho-Pass</em>, and <em>Haikyu!!</em>. The series will be directed by Masashi Kudō, who served as the director for the insanely popular anime adaption of Tite Kubo’s <em>Bleach</em>.</p> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="false">Mattson Tomlin, who also wrote the script for <em>The Batman: Part II, </em>will write<em> Terminator Zero’s </em>script. In <a href="https://ew.com/terminator-zero-anime-first-look-mattson-tomlin-exclusive-8645307">an interview with Entertainment Weekly</a><em>, </em>Tomlin stated that the series will treat every movie in the <em>Terminator</em> franchise as canon, meaning that plenty of Easter eggs and nods will be peppered throughout <em>Terminator Zero’s</em> eight episodes.</p>

            <p>As you might’ve heard, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Hades 2</a> is out in early access, offering up the much-anticipated sequel to Supergiant’s mythical (and delightfully thirsty) roguelite. Though the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">sheer amount of polish and Stuff</a> in even its pre-release form might have you thinking that a full 1.0 release can’t be too far down the line, the game’s creative director reckons we’ve still got around a year to wait before it’s considered all finished up.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div>
<p>That’s per Greg Kasavin’s recent chat with cheery RPS fansite<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hades-2s-creative-director-says-we-expect-to-be-in-early-access-at-least-through-the-end-of-this-year/"> PC Gamer</a>, during which Kasavin touched on the gameplay differences between OG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a>’ Zagreus and Hades 2 hero Melinoë - with more of a lean towards fast-paced spellcasting and area-of-effect attacks - and the litany of small details packed into the game, such as the different reactions of characters to the player’s choices such as picking boons or during boss fights.</p>
<p>With Hades 2 crammed full of those small touches on top of the obvious need to constantly tweak and balance its combat, Kasavin said that the team won’t be rushing to get the finished game out the door. In the near future, there’ll be a run of smaller patches that further polish existing parts of the gameplay - similar to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-hades-2-patch-lets-you-gather-seed-silver-and-souls-simultaneously">recent tweaks to resource-gathering and sprinting</a> - with at least one bigger update that will introduce brand new elements such as enemies, environments and features. While that big update is in the works for “several months”, there’ll be a pause on the smaller fixes.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/hades-2-early-access-review-7.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>“We'll patch that a few times to shore up any issues, and repeat this broader process... until we consider the game complete!” Kasavin said, which suggests we’ll see some more ‘Major Updates’ after that, too. For the first big addition, at least, Kasavin teased that Supergiant already have a particular theme in mind, which enterprising players may uncover if they delve deep enough into the game.</p>
<p>All in all, Kasavin expects Hades 2 to remain in early access “at least through the end of this year”. That’s perhaps not surprising given the first game took around two years from early access launch to 1.0, and the sequel has arrived with even more to play with in the meantime - meaning even more to tweak and balance along the way for its developers, too.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-game-pass-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the reports circulating</a> that Microsoft is set to put Call of Duty Black Ops 6 onto Xbox Game Pass at launch, the company appears to ready to make changes to the services tiers as well. According to multiple insiders, Xbox Game Pass is set to receive changes to its tiers due to the addition of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>“We can assure you that changes are coming to the Xbox Game Pass Tiers mainly due to Call Of Duty,” Insider eXtas1stv <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1791468893925417436?t=P6CsgjcO5D50_1lhFayKEg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Twitter</a>. “There are still things to confirm, but I hope to report back soon.”</p>



<p>This was then followed up by Shinobi602 <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot30-why-so-series-x-s.820296/page-540?post=123109182#post-123109182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Reset Era saying</a>, “There will be changes, yes”.</p>



<p>Whether that means price changes or simply adding another premium tier remains to be seen. But it seems clear that more changes are in store for Xbox Game Pass. Currently, the service has three total plans. There’s Xbox Game Pass Core for console that replaced Xbox Live Gold for $9.99/month, Game Pass PC for $9.99/month, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate that covers both console and PC for $16.99/month.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft for comment on these reports. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>

You can deactivate the Super early to create a blinding explosion and gain a temporary bonus to Arc damage. Your Arc staff will also consume less energy when you're not attacking with it. The stats here are mostly well balanced, with mobility being the best, but resilience is very low.

This Exotic buffs Warlock Rifts to reduce damage for allies, and if you fall in battle, you'll leave a healing rift behind for your teammates.

<p data-characters="367" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> has a new promotional event where buying items in real life benefits players in-game. If you want to collect some of the sweet new Mountain Dew crossover items in <em>FFXIV</em>, including a brand new exclusive mount, you’ll want to pick up a few bottles of the sugary drink. Here’s what to do to earn all of the items while this event is still running. </p> <h2 id="h-all-mountain-dew-drinks-and-points-explained" data-injectable="false">All Mountain Dew drinks and points, explained</h2> <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">For starters, the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-event-calendar-seasonal-ongoing-and-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FFXIV</a></em> crossover event with Mountain Dew is only running for a limited time, so don’t wait or you might miss out on these goodies. How the event works is players buy specially marked Mountain Dew Gaming 20oz bottles, and only them. 2-liters, cans, and so on don’t count at this time. They have a banner around them that reference rewards you can unlock right now. These bottles have a 10-digit code underneath the cap, which grants you some points to your Mountain Dew Gaming account. </p>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">You can then turn around and exchange those points for various prizes, of which there are a few themed around <em>FFXIV</em>, specifically. Unfortunately, some of the 20oz bottles of Mountain Dew go for different points than others, which might be a bit confusing. Below, you’ll find all the different flavors and how many points they’re worth online: </p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Mountain Dew Frostbite:</strong> 200 points</li> <li><strong>Purple Thunder:</strong> 200 points</li> <li><strong>Maui Burst:</strong> 200 points</li> <li><strong>Over Drive:</strong> 200 points</li> <li><strong>All other flavors (original, Zero Sugar, Code Red, etc):</strong> 100 points each</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-mountain-dew-gaming-points" data-injectable="false">How to redeem Mountain Dew Gaming points</h2> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="true">Once you’ve bought yourself a Mountain Dew bottle (or a dozen), it is now time to finally start redeeming some points. What you want to do is look underneath the cap for a 10-digit code. Head to this website right <a href="https://www.mtndewgaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and create a Mountain Dew Gaming account or login to an existing one. You’ll see the option to enter each code and you’ll receive the appropriate number of points, as mentioned above. </p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">You can seemingly redeem as many codes as you want while the event is live. However, this event is only available in the United States for now. Unfortunately, this event excludes Canadian players. Worse still, don’t waste your time trying to redeem one of the rewards on your <em>FFXIV</em> account if its region is different from the US, because it won’t work. </p> <figure data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-all-ffxiv-x-mountain-dew-rewards-and-costs-explained" data-injectable="false">All <em>FFXIV</em> x Mountain Dew rewards and costs, explained</h2> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">There are quite a few <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-live-letter-recap-dawntrail-job-trailer-fall-guys-and-mountain-dew/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FFXIV</a></em> in-game and merchandise rewards you can get through the Mountain Dew event. Note that you can’t redeem some of the reward codes on your account, such as the Sparkling Citrus Refreshment and Mountain Zu mount, until <em>Dawntrail</em> early access begins. Here are all of the items you can unlock and how many points you’ll need to unlock each one: </p> <ul data-found-items="17" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="1051" data-injectable="false"> <li data-index="0"><strong>Sparkling Citrus Refreshment:</strong> 100 points </li> <li data-index="1"><strong>5 pots of Metallic Green Dye:</strong> 200 points</li> <li data-index="2"><strong>5 pots of Metallic Blue Dye:</strong> 200 points</li> <li data-index="3"><strong>5 pots of Metallic Orange Dye:</strong> 200 points</li> <li data-index="4"><strong>Mountain Zu mount:</strong> 600 points</li> <li data-index="5"><strong><em>FFXIV</em> Starter Edition game:</strong> 2,000 points</li> <li data-index="6"><strong><em>FFXIV</em> x Mountain Dew magnet:</strong> 2,000 points</li> <li data-index="7"><strong>Various Taito Prize Cups:</strong> 4,000 points</li> <li data-index="8"><strong>Various Plush:</strong> 4,000 points</li> <li data-index="9"><strong>Figurines:</strong> 4,000 points</li> <li data-index="10"><strong>I Drank Dew T-Shirt:</strong> 4,000 points</li> <li data-index="11"><strong>Desk Mats:</strong> 6,000 points</li> <li data-index="12"><strong>Puma T-Shirts:</strong> 9,000 points</li> <li data-index="13"><strong>Pictomancer or Viper Keycap Set:</strong> 18,000 points</li> <li data-index="14"><strong>Hoodies:</strong> 20,000 points</li> <li data-index="15"><strong>Sweatpants:</strong> 20,000 points</li> <li data-index="16"><strong>Elgato + Stream Deck Studio Controller:</strong> 25,000 points</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="244" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rumors about a&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fallout</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fortnite</span></em>&nbsp;collaboration have been circulating the community, particularly in light of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-biggest-changes-the-fallout-show-introduced-to-the-lore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime Video</a> show. Those speculations are now realized with an artwork teaser for an upcoming&nbsp;<em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fortnite</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;update.&nbsp;</span></p> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">In this teaser, we see the series’ iconic Power Armor, which almost anyone, fan or not, would recognize. But instead of&nbsp;<em>Fallout’s&nbsp;</em>classic look, the suit of armor will be transcended into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite’s&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-players-claim-its-almost-impossible-to-complete-battle-pass-without-spending-real-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">Now, the burning question is: What unique elements will this&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>x&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>&nbsp;collaboration bring? It’s a safe bet that we’ll see new&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>skins, a trend we’ve witnessed with numerous other franchises like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-aang-skin-avatar-last-airbender-elements-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>. The Power Suit, featured prominently in the teaser, is likely to be one of them. Personally, I’m hoping for a&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> Vault Jumpsuit to be part of the mix.</p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">New&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>-themed quests could be&nbsp;another feature included in the crossover.&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;isn’t shy of having collaboration missions, similar to&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-a-lightsaber-in-fortnite-x-star-wars-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lightsaber tasks</a>. Map iterations may also be a part of this, possibly including vault locations.&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>already has vaults in-game, so why not add a&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>touch to match the theme?&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">As for items, a Pip-Boy could be used for Battle Royale. It would make for a great accessory, keeping with the tradition of tracking information for the player.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">Given that the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>franchise has multiple entries,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>could go almost anywhere with this collaboration. It could offer content for one of the most famous entries<em>, Fallout 4</em>, or focus on some of the newer elements of the TV show. Of course, there are plenty of other iterations, such as&nbsp;<em>Fallout 76</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="false">Only time will tell what this&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>x&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>&nbsp;collaboration will bring. But the one thing we know for sure is that war never changes.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/redfall-will-get-a-final-update-including-offline-mode.874278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-will-get-a-final-update-including-offline-mode/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=redfall-will-get-a-final-update-including-offline-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="200" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Good news for anyone playing <em>Redfall</em>, or anyone who cares about a gaming ecosystem where publishers can’t make entire titles vanish from existence: the game is still going to get its offline mode.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">Arkane Austin has just announced that <em>Redfall</em> will be getting one final update before the studio shuts its doors for good. The update will make some changes to the Neighborhood and Nest systems, potentially pulling in new or returning players, and it will also add single player pausing and an offline mode to let people actually continue to play the game, which otherwise would have all but disappeared whenever Microsoft decided to take down the servers.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you for all your supportive messages. </p><p>We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more. </p><p>We’ll provide additional details soon. Thank you all.</p></div>— Redfall (@playRedfall) <a href="https://twitter.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true">Earlier this month <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/">Microsoft essentially dissolved four studios</a> in one unceremonious swoop. <em>Redfall </em>developer Arkane Austin got cut alongside Tango Gameworks (<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>) and Alpha Dog Games (<em>Mighty DOOM</em>), while Roundhouse Studios got merged into ZeniMax Online Studios. It was another heartbreaking example of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-people-making-the-games-keep-paying-the-price/">game developers losing work</a>, whether or not their game succeeded in the market. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-redfall-pc-xbox-arkane-microsoft/"><em>Redfall </em>didn’t wow reviewers</a> or gamers last year, but <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hi-fi-rush-represents-game-pass-secret-strength/"><em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>was a definite success</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="false">The final <em>Redfall </em>update is bittersweet news to say the least. The game might have failed to make an impact, but Arkane proved with <em>Prey </em>that it has the capacity to make a great game. Given a little more time to make updates and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-killed-redfall-right-before-arkane-could-save-it-from-online-only-fate/">actually release the game’s planned DLC</a>, Arkane Austin might have been able to turn <em>Redfall </em>around. Now we’ll never know. The last update will technically keep the game alive, but with Arkane Austin itself being shuttered, that doesn’t feel like much of a win.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Endless Legend, the superb fantasy 4X game from developer Amplitude Studios, is currently free to download and keep on Steam - and there's still almost a week to claim it.
</p>
<p>
Amplitude - which has also developed the likes of Endless Space, Dungeons of the Endless, and Humankind - released Endless Legend back in 2014. It quickly drew praise for its fantasy flavoured Civ-style strategy - enlivened by some smart twists on the formula and its highly distinctive factions - mixed with a heavy dollop of lore.
</p>
<p>
If you're still a stranger to Endless Legend's action some ten years after its release, and the above description has set your strategy nubbin a-tingling, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289130/ENDLESS_Legend/">permanently add it to your Steam library</a> for the princely sum of zero money right now. And don't panic if you're currently indisposed: the offer runs until next Thursday, 23rd May.
</p>

<p>
To coincide with Endless Legends' 100% price slash, its nine expansions are also heavily discounted, with the priciest currently costing £2.19 and the cheapest slinking in at a svelt 59p.
</p>
<p>
And if you'd like to check out more of Amplitude's work, it's probably also worth noting the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/AmplitudeStudios">studio's entire catalogue</a> is currently discounted on Steam, meaning substantial savings on everything from Endless Space and Humankind to the more recent Endless Dungeon.

            <p>If you’ve been wondering what Valve’s been working on as their next game after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/counter-strike-2-best-settings">Counter-Strike 2</a>, the answer may be at hand. Details and screenshots for Deadlock, a third-person hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> with MOBA elements, have seemingly leaked out of a recent closed playtest, revealing a blend of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> and Valve’s own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>.</p>

<p>Deadlock is apparently the latest evolution of a project previously known as Neon Prime, which you may faintly recall <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-register-mysterious-new-neon-prime-trademark-in-the-us">Valve registering a vague trademark for</a> a couple of years back. The game’s reappearance as Deadlock came via <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791110448114188557">noted Valve leaker Gabe Follower</a>, who described it as being a competitive hero shooter in the vein of Overwatch or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> - albeit in third-person - with the lane-based map design and even tower defence elements of MOBAs like Dota 2 or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>.</p>
<p>Those maps will host matches between two teams of six players, who will control unique hero characters able to pop off different abilities and items. The maps themselves are said to be “huge”, with the inclusion of floating rails - a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a> - to help players zip around.</p>
<p>The game’s world also seems to draw at least a little from the likes of BioShock, with a mixture of steampunk and fantasy in a European-inspired city home to strange creatures, robots and magicians alike. (Gabe Follower notes that the game was originally more sci-fi-themed closer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Portal</a> - which might explain the futuristic-sounding Neon Prime moniker - but shifted more to fantasy after “bad feedback” from testers.)</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Since testers started sharing Deadlock screenshots all over the place, here's ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon. <a href="https://t.co/KdZSRxObSz">pic.twitter.com/KdZSRxObSz</a></p>— Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Screenshots supposedly verified by the leaker reveal at least one character, a bow-wielding ranger called Grey Talon with the ability to use traps alongside long-range precision. The character design does indeed look very Overwatch-y or Dota-y to my eye, with the teases of the map showing graffitied city streets and alleys.</p>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8MqhEz6N_k">Tyler McVicker</a> added to the swirling rumours by claiming that the now-leaky closed playtest already has hundreds of people giving Deadlock a go, with a proper announcement and reveal of Valve’s next “major” game due sometime soon - perhaps sooner than even the developers expected, given the information already finding its way out into the public eye.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158351/mad-max-fury-road-rock-riders<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="PbJcr0">There are many things that make <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a><em> </em>one of the most <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/5/20929735/best-movies-of-the-decade-2010s">enduring crowd-pleasers of the century</a>. Death-defying stunts, a fantastic and deep cast, extremely quotable dialogue, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/1/8700423/watch-how-mad-max-used-center-framing-to-keep-the-action-scenes">breathtaking imagery</a>. But one of the most important elements in the movie, and the Mad Max franchise in general, is the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/9/21/9364407/mad-max-game-disabiliy-fury-road">evocative character design</a>.</p>
<p id="cGlfBc">The War Boys and The Doof Warrior get their fair share of attention, and rightly so — their designs are vivid and very memorable, and before a recent rewatch they were the characters I remembered the best. But there’s one group I feel gets overlooked, that I gained a new appreciation for on that recent rewatch: The Rock Riders.</p>

<p id="wvBHh1">The Rock Riders are a group of motorcycle-riding bandits who live in a canyon smack dab in the middle of the path of Furiosa’s breakaway convoy in <em>Fury Road</em>. Furiosa made a deal with them to trade Guzzolene for safe passage, but the Rock Riders reneged on that deal when they saw just how upset Immortan Joe was at Furiosa’s betrayal. </p>

<p id="OdkgjH">That leads to a very cool sequence where Furiosa and her crew fight off the Rock Riders, as their motorcycles jump over The War Rig and repeatedly drop bombs on it. It’s like a circus act shows up in the middle of <em>Fury Road</em>, injecting some extra life and excitement in a movie already full of it.</p>
<div id="loGjug"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-K20x3mFhZs?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="D3x4Cs">The circus act isn’t far off — the origin for the Rock Riders <a href="https://www.cbr.com/exclusive-brendan-mccarthy-goes-full-throttle-for-mad-max-fury-road/">came from a beach trip by co-writer Brendan McCarthy</a>. While at a surfer pub, a video caught his eye of bikers doing eye-popping stunts. He pitched the idea of bikers leaping over Furiosa’s truck to George Miller (who, naturally, loved it), and they <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/mad-max-fury-road-the-story-behind-its-most-insane-stunts-41441/">hired professional motocross riders from around the world</a> to perform the sequence. </p>
<p id="na359n"><em>Fury Road </em>is made up of many great action sequences, yes, but they work in large part because of the character designs behind them, and the hard work to pull them off. The Rock Riders might not get quite as much attention as some of their bandit brethren, but they deserve recognition for this excellent sequence.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/24159010/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-deluxe-set-buy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="firstHeading">You might not know this if you grew up in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo">later eras of Nintendo</a>, but the company ran an esports competition called the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/15/8780155/nintendo-world-championships-e3-2015-kickoff">Nintendo World Championships</a> way back in 1990. The event toured 29 American cities and players from across the country gathered to compete using a custom Nintendo Entertainment System Game Pak. The cartridge used in the event went on to become a prized collectors’ item, but now, players will get a chance to buy a physical item directly inspired by it. </p>
<p id="7g4kUI">On Wednesday, Nintendo shared a trailer for the upcoming game, <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>. The game recreates the competitive spirit of the event and will allow players to speedrun more than 150 “<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-switch/">challenging moments</a>” from across 13 NES games like <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and <em>Metroid</em>. In addition to the virtual eShop download, the company announced <em>Nintendo World Championships </em>would be getting a physical edition as well. And while it’s not replacement for those rare early NES cartridges from the actual competition — the physical version of the game has plenty to ooh and aah over. </p>
<p id="oxqPej">You can buy the <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition – Deluxe Set</em> off of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-deluxe-set-121051/">Nintendo’s website</a>. It will go on sale July 18 and cost $59.99. (The virtual game-only version costs $29.99.) The Deluxe Set comes with a Gold replica NES cartridge and stand to commemorate the 1990 World Championships, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/games/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> game card, 13 art cards, and a set of five pins. The golden NES pack cartridge is not playable, but this physical version touts details like embossed pixel art of the Nintendo games featured in the World Championships event. </p>

That’s in many ways by design, as the foundations of the game are so entrenched in the stylistic and mechanical elements of other titles. The game’s deep roleplaying mechanics allow for combat, magic, stealth, and more due to a reliance on skills that are pulled from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646"><em>Elder Scrolls</em></a></span>. The slightly unsettling fantasy setting is reminiscent of <em>Morrowind</em> specifically. The polygonal graphics are inspired by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-one-ps1-hanami-handheld-ff7-yveltalgriffin-1851410777&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-one-ps1-hanami-handheld-ff7-yveltalgriffin-1851410777">PlayStation 1</a></span> in the same way as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202">retro-horror trend</a></span> is. But its character models feel lifted from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-game-ever-thief-the-dark-project-is-the-only-way-5897240&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-game-ever-thief-the-dark-project-is-the-only-way-5897240"><em>Thief: The Dark Project</em></a></span>. <em>Dread Delusion</em> expertly weaves these inspirations together into a wholly unique cloth. It’s a game talked about in comparison, that manages to be more than its inspirations.</p><p>The star of <em>Dread Delusion</em> is its setting, the Oneiric Isles. A floating archipelago under a menacing red sky filled with warring armies and cosmic mysteries. As a prisoner of one such army, the player is essentially deputized into the fight and tasked with the mission of taking down a rebellious woman named Vela Callose. Infiltrating her fortress and assassinating her is your first goal, which you won’t be able to complete and will send you down a dozens-of-hours quest to finish the job. Once you have your (conditional) freedom from your jailers, <em>Dread Delusion</em> sets you loose in its weird world. </p><p><em>Dread Delusion</em> wants you to get lost. But don’t get so lost that you fall off the side of the map, these are floating islands remember? When the game warns you to watch your step at the start of your journey you, like me, might laugh and think that will never happen. Then you laugh right off the side of the island. It’s undeniably hilarious but also highlights that the world is in fact dangerous if you aren’t careful. Like <em>Morrowind</em>’s Vvardenfell or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span>’s Lands Between, the joy of the Oneiric Isles is encountering its unique charms naturally along your journey. A pub inside of a dead god’s head, a castle haunted by illusions, a traveling college of wizards, all of these and more await the curious player. What makes all these discoveries so much more compelling is that they all have stories to tell—they aren’t just set dressing. Everything here has depth.</p><figure id="" data-id="1351a30b700f4b4fcb6f18074fde91a2" data-recommend-id="image://1351a30b700f4b4fcb6f18074fde91a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A withered man stands in front of a gothic city under a red sky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A withered man stands in front of a gothic city under a red sky" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dread XP</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1351a30b700f4b4fcb6f18074fde91a2" data-recommend-id="image://1351a30b700f4b4fcb6f18074fde91a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A withered man stands in front of a gothic city under a red sky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That narrative depth and sense of discovery tendrils out from the game’s mechanical intricacy that offers so much player freedom. Like in <em>Elder Scrolls</em>, players are able to tailor their protagonist to different styles of play. You can focus on combat, magic, stealth, or even charm, and unlock different ways to complete problems. Instead of fighting your way through, maybe you could just befriend the guards and walk right into your desired area. It all depends on what skills you are able to unlock with Glimmers of Delusion, the resource that gives the game its name.<br></p><p>Combat does remain perhaps the most silly element of the game, a feeling I had during early access. <em>Here</em> the game lacks depth, and in most encounters, I find myself circling enemies and slashing until they die, a surprisingly effective tactic. It makes it simple but not very fun. Sneaking, lockpicking, and charming your way through encounters is always more compelling.</p><p>Tying leveling into a sense of cosmic horror is a great tonal decision that supports the game’s low-poly horror aesthetic. Visually and mechanically the game is unsettling in the most enthralling way, perhaps taking further inspiration from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928"><em>Pathologic</em></a></span>. But <em>Dread Delusion </em>shifts between so many different tones. It has cosmic horror and fantasy, but also comedy. The humor of the game feels especially well used in relation to its mechanics. Like in <em>Elder Scrolls</em> games, in which mechanical freedom often leads to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-met-a-very-immature-serial-killer-in-the-elder-scroll-1846839859&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-met-a-very-immature-serial-killer-in-the-elder-scroll-1846839859">hilarious unintended consequences</a></span>, <em>Dread Delusion</em>’s freedom will make absurd scenarios occur regularly. It’s nice that the game’s inhabitants have a sense of humor about it too.</p><p>In an already overflowing few weeks of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730">compelling</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">indie</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967">games</a></span> punching well above their weight, <em>Dread Delusion</em> is another fantastic game to put on your radar. Come for the deep skill system and the fascinating world, but stay for the unexpected adventures you’ll surely fall into. Just don’t fall off the sides.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Redfall is set to get one final update before work ends on it entirely. </p>



<p>In a message <a href="https://x.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Twitter</a> on Friday, the game’s official account thanked fans for the support since it was announced that developer Arkane Austin was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-shutting-down-four-studios-including-tango-game-works-and-arkane-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of four studios being closed</a> by Microsoft.</p>



<p>The message went on to reveal some of the features included in the final update, including the promised offline mode that will allow players to play even after Microsoft shuts down the game’s servers in the future.</p>



<p>“We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more,” the Twitter post reads. “We’ll provide additional details soon. Thank you all.”</p>



<p>When it was first announced that Arkane Austin was closing, the studio said there would be no more updates for the game. It seems clear that, based on the pushback from players, releasing one last update was the best thing to do for players to ensure that they can keep playing the game now and in the future.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>. Fortnite frequently changes. The next big change for Fortnite, Chapter 5 Season 3, is expected to kick off next week, and today Epic has let a major detail out into the open: A Fallout collaboration is on the way. Depicted in our first bit of art for the next season is the iconic Power Armor helmet from the Fallout franchise, as well as a pair of emojis in the tweet that act as a stand-in for the blonde-haired Vault Boy who is so intertwined with the Fallout universe.</p><p>The Fallout collab comes just a few weeks after the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-is-happening-amazon-confirms/1100-6522787/" data-ref-id="1100-6522787">Amazon Prime Video series became a huge hit</a>, and is just the latest in a years-long run of Epic's gargantuan video game platform staying in lockstep with pop-culture moments happening elsewhere.</p><p>It's not yet clear exactly what the crossover will entail, but an in-game skin seems like the bare minimum. Perhaps the new map and/or weapons will also be inspired by Bethesda's post-apocalyptic franchise.</p><p>The image also interestingly features what looks to be a massive dust storm and some sort of industrial tanks, lending credibility to the rumor that Chapter 5 Season 3 will feature some Mad Max-like dieselpunk inspirations, including an emphasis on vehicle combat--and likely a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga-review-a-whole-new-gear/1900-6418226/" data-ref-id="1900-6418226">Furiosa</a> crossover too.</p><p>For everything else we know about the next major Fortnite update, read our story on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-start-date/2900-5356/" data-ref-id="2900-5356">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 start date</a> and more.</p>

                <p>A Star Wars-themed Total War game is reportedly currently in development over at Creative Assembly.</p><p>According to to <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-works-at-creative-assembly/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DualShockers</a>, there are three Total War games being worked on right now. It's unclear which project Creative Assembly is furthest along with in development. However, the closest one is presumably the next mainline installment, as Total War is an annual series. The only exception is 2021, which was the first year without a new mainline Total War game since 2014.</p><p>The second one is a Total War: Star Wars game that seemingly started development in October 2023. Currently, any info about the alleged third Total War game is unknown. The most recent game in the series is Total War: Pharoah, which was released last year. Creative Assembly Sofia is <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-pharaoh/blogs/19-total-war-pharaoh-update-announce" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently preparing a large update</a> for the game that will add more campaign content and cultures.</p><p>Back in September, parent company Sega canceled Creative Assembly's latest game, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/segas-shooter-hyenas-canceled-other-games-canned-as-well-as-part-of-restructuring/1100-6518042/" data-ref-id="1100-6518042">multiplayer shooter called Hyenas</a>, and it laid off the developers who were working on it. In November, Sega president Haruki Satomi said that Creative Assembly would go back to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/total-war-dev-creative-assembly-is-returning-to-real-time-strategy-games/1100-6519563/" data-ref-id="1100-6519563">creating RTS games such as Total War as that was the studio's primary expertise</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/17/fallout-is-coming-to-fortnite<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's a great time to be a Fallout fan, thanks to its <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="77931a3c-3f80-4855-9ad5-3f76e5fbcb32" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/2024/04/10/the-fallout-tv-show-is-good-season-1-review">excellent Amazon Prime series</a> and the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="90f9957b-0269-4766-8f9c-ad4a933dbbf4" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/25/fallout-4-gets-a-next-gen-update-today-heres-what-to-expect">next-gen update for Fallout 4</a>. But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon</p>



<p>The teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f5b5da80-dc07-4895-9626-9cdca5c3d817" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/09/avatar-the-last-airbender-skins-now-available-in-fortnite">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef3902aa-9994-4d48-bfe5-4dd44b9364c8" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/15/fortnites-next-star-wars-crossover-will-span-lego-festival-and-battle-royale-modes">Star Wars crossovers</a>, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.</p>

<p>It will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.</p>

            <p>
A final update is on its way to Redfall after all.
</p>
<p>
Following the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft was closing a number of Bethesda studios</a> including Redfall developer Arkane Austin, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-studio-was-reportedly-working-on-offline-mode-for-may-release-before-closure">the team was working on DLC and updates</a> - including an offline mode - until very recently.

</p>
<p>
A new post on X, however, states the update is still on the way. "Thank you all for your supportive messages," it reads. "We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighbourhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more. We'll provide additional details soon. Thank you all."

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Thank you for all your supportive messages. </p><p>We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more. </p><p>We’ll provide additional details soon.

What's not specifically mentioned here, though, is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-hero-pass-dlc-still-missing-a-year-after-its-release">Hero Pass DLC</a>, which will add two new player characters to the vampire shooter but remains missing a year after the game's release.
</p>
<p>
This was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-hero-pass-cancelled-following-arkane-austin-closure">cancelled after the studio closure</a>, with players directed to a <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/?linkId=100000260400360#en/answer/65606">Bethesda support page</a> with details forthcoming of a credit programme to reimburse anyone who already purchased the DLC.

</p>
<p>
At present, that support page still stands. It suggests that while the offline mode and other requested features are still on the way, the Hero Pass is not.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Bethesda to confirm.
</p>
<p>
Even before this final update, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-last-stroll-through-redfall-at-the-pace-it-was-always-meant-to-be-played">Redfall remains worth checking out through one last stroll of its world</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-redfall-update-will-grant-arkanes-shooter-offline-immortality.874197/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-redfall-update-offline-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arkane Austin's ill-fated vampiric shooter&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>is just about still alive, it seems, as the devs have announced the game is to receive one final update before being laid to rest for good.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>'s official X (formerly Twitter) account, Arkane Austin says that one last update, titled Game Update 4, is in the works for&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>, so it looks like the studio will get to finish <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redfall-offline-mode-update-report">what it was working on before that shutdown</a> after all.</p>

<p>The first major feature the update will bring is the long-called-for Offline Mode, which will allow you to play&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>without being connected to a server. With online games being shut down left, right, and center, this is a pretty important move for preservation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-vampire-stairs.jpg?itok=M8bwdiZP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-vampire-stairs.jpg?itok=DNYIrNCA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>is getting one last update after all.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to being able to play offline, the last&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>update will also bring "revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems", and Arkane doesn't seem to have intended that pun.</p>

<p>The update will also bring the ability to pause the game if you're in single-player mode, so no more getting ganked by nasty vampires while you're making a cup of coffee in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Arkane says additional details for the update will be revealed "soon", and there's no release date for the update yet, so it might be a little while before it arrives.</p>

<p>Still, it's nice to know that although&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>was much maligned by critics and players alike, there will still be a way to revisit it in future, even if it is just to figure out what went wrong.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-sniper.jpg?itok=SiDR7yWO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/redfall-update-offline-mode-sniper.jpg?itok=86e2IwBT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to play&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>offline? You'll soon be able to do just that.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>, it's a shooter developed by&nbsp;<em>Prey&nbsp;</em>studio Arkane Austin.</p>

<p><em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>has a multiplayer focus (although it can technically be played single-player), with each character taking the role of one of the game's survivors, each of whom has special abilities that complement the rest of the group.</p>

<p>On release,&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/14768/redfall" rel="noopener" target="_blank">met with ambivalence</a> by critics and players, with many pointing to its lack of Arkane's signature immersive sim-style gameplay features, as well as the shallowness of its gameplay loops and story.</p>

<p>Last week, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">made the call to shut down Arkane Austin</a>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks and two other studios.&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>will, however, seemingly survive the death of its studio. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Around a week after Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">shuttered a number of beloved studios</a> with a track record of making excellent single-player, story-driven games, their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">newly-owned arm of Activision</a> has revealed a brand new studio. Working on a new series of story-driven, triple-A games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The unveiling of Elsewhere Entertainment comes days after the sudden and shocking closure of Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks and Alpha Dog Games, who between them have been responsible for games including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey">Prey</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-evil-within-2">The Evil Within</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostwire-tokyo">Tokyo: Ghostwire</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and more.</p>
<p>With the exception of multiplayer misfire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a>, the likes of Arkane and Tango were arguably known for specialising in inventive and well-liked-to-loved single-player titles built around their narratives, making the emergence of a new studio doing exactly that somewhat frustrating timing.</p>

</div>
<p>It’s worth noting, of course, that Activision and Microsoft operate separately in many respects - including budgets - despite now being merged into one multi-billion-dollar megacorp, so the new Activision studio’s launch isn’t directly tied to Microsoft’s decision to close several other developers. (Elsewhere will apparently draw from Activision’s resources and use their tools for their projects.)</p>
<p>On top of that, the Polish team made up of devs with experience on Naughty Dog’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection">Uncharted</a>, CD Projekt Red’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division">The Division</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> was <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/activision-and-microsoft-are-opening-a-new-game-studio-in-poland-elsewhere-entertainment-with-a-totally-new-ip">apparently put together a little while back</a>, rather than being freshly formed now.</p>
<p>Given those particular credits, it might not come as a surprise to learn that Elsewhere will be working on an original “narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise", which lines up with those blockbuster single-player titles.</p>
<p>“The team’s underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games,” Activision added in their <a href="https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-announces-new-studio-elsewhere-entertainment-all-new-franchise-development">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>By “enduring legacy” and “resonates beyond games”, I can only assume they mean “makes a whole boatload of money and gets turned into a prestige TV show like The Last of Us and The Witcher”. Whatever it ends up being, expect it to be at least a while off while Elsewhere continues to staff up on their debut project.</p>
