            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The United Kingdom’s relationship with the video game expo scene has crumbled. Once upon a time, the nation boasted showcases like the Insomnia Gaming Festival, WASD, and EGX, but they’ve all disappeared into the shadows over the years.</p>



<p>The Insomnia Gaming Festival went bust (and is trying a half-hearted resurgence), WASD shut down, and EGX has become a pitiful, almost unbranded corner in the larger MCM Comic Con in London. I attended EGX over the weekend, and I’m sad to say that it’s no longer worth keeping alive.</p>



<p>EGX’s disappearance marks the death of the UK gaming expo circuit.</p>



<h2 id="h-uk-gamers-are-left-to-dream-hack">UK Gamers Are Left to Dream(Hack)</h2>



<p>Next year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhack-coming-to-the-uk-in-2025-call-of-duty-dota/">DreamHack returns</a> to the United Kingdom for the first time in <strong>ten years</strong>, which is a saving grace of sorts for gamers across the territory. In some places, the courageous efforts of more grassroots events like EPIC.LAN are trying to get some wheels turning, but the most iconic expos in the business have now faded into nothingness.</p>



<p>In 2024, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomnia-gaming-festival-review/">Insomnia Gaming Festival</a> imploded after 25 years of entertaining visitors, thanks to financial woes brought on by the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s trying to make a grand return in 2025, but <strong>it’s not looking good</strong>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>One of the final Insomnia Gaming Festival events, and while it was bustling, nobody knew it was about to collapse.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Also in 2024, the WASD showcase, a more intimate event in London that was one of my favorite events in the world, was shut down as the event’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/uk-gaming-expo-scene-crumble-wasd/">organiser entered liquidation</a>.</p>



<p>Now, I’m sad to report that EGX is done and dusted.</p>



<h2 id="h-farewell-egx">Farewell, EGX</h2>



<p>Formerly known as the Eurogamer Expo, EGX was once the shining star of the UK gaming scene, a monumental event that drew international acclaim and hosted a showfloor featuring the biggest names in the business.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This was EGX in 2014 after a rebrand from ‘Eurogamer Expo’. It was a massive event that was once seen as the UK’s E3.</figcaption></figure>







<p>The COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t kind to EGX, but in the years that followed the devastation of the virus, EGX seemed to be getting back on an even keel. That growth has ebbed away into nothing, and EGX is now an unrecognizable corner of the larger MCM Comic Con event.</p>



<p>I attended EGX (for the last time) this year, and baulked at what was on display. It was almost impossible to spot any EGX branding, and what I did find was a few scattered indie games and a lone LAN area featuring a few rigs with a mix of playable titles on them. No big names, no exclusive demo opportunities, and almost <strong>nothing </strong>in the way of gaming activations.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The cracks in EGX started showing in 2023 (Image Credit: Later Levels Blog)</figcaption></figure>







<p>In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-mcm-comic-con-same-event/">EGX and MCM joined forces</a>, but the showcases were separated, and EGX still enjoyed a standalone profile that was represented in the branding of the event. This year, EGX has all but disappeared, leaving MCM standing tall – but even that has issues.</p>



<p>As I walked around MCM, I was greeted by vast swathes of market-style stalls selling anime body pillow covers, mystery bags, animatronic furry tails, AI-generated art prints, and plastic toys aplenty. Amid a sea of half-baked cosplays and bored-looking event employees, I found none of my people; the gamers had failed to show out for EGX, what little of it there was.</p>



<h2 id="h-barely-an-expo">Barely an Expo</h2>



<p>The PR folks backing the event were offering me nothing but film and TV opportunities, and despite there being the likes of Troy Baker, Ben Starr, Chris Judge, Doug Cockle, Neil Newbon, and Elias Toufexis in attendance, nothing came up in a gaming capacity.</p>



<p>I made a conscious effort to request <strong>some kind of connection </strong>from the staff running the meet and greet area, and was palmed off with a ‘Sorry, they don’t have time for that,’ by a go-between messenger of an employee who failed to get me any traction from a nearby manager. I should stress that the manager who had ‘no time’ for me was plainly standing on the spot doing nothing.</p>



<figure><figcaption>You never know you’re in the good times <strong>when you’re in them</strong>. This was one of the first Eurogamer Expos in London</figcaption></figure>







<p>With no games to play, no big-named exhibitors occupying the show floor, and there being nothing in the way of gaming activations, I was reduced to wandering the stalls and trying to get excited about merchandise (spoiler alert: <strong>I didn’t</strong>).</p>



<p>The panels were visited by a half dozen people every time someone was on the stage, the security staff were lacklustre and weren’t doing their job properly, and the busiest portion of the event seemed to always be the ‘food court’.</p>



<p>I can see EGX vanishing entirely next year, and while MCM will persist, it too has been reduced to something almost unworthy of a spot in your calendar. All eyes are now on Gamescom, an utterly phenomenal event that continues to expand year after year. I’ve been to Gamescom twice and can stress that it’s the <strong>ultimate event </strong>in the world for gamers, and I just praise that it’s only a short flight away for me.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, gamers around the world can still enjoy events like Summer Game Fest, PAX, DreamHack, Tokyo Game Show, and other localized, regional events. If you want a regular expo in the UK, you’re out of luck and will need to travel.</p>

The game tasks players with guessing a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>Overall reception was positive, with many praising its continued gameplay and intriguing storyline, though some criticism was made toward the game's high difficulty and limited multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Its the west vs. Japan this week, so let's get to it!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/gamecube/related-articles:192886,174452 @ 1761480368 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="727ea50c27067"><a title="Prime Echoes - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/727ea50c27067/prime-echoes-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/6139-metroid-prime-2-echoes">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're all familiar with this one, right? It showcases Samus in a pretty cool action pose, while in the top left, we can see U-Mos, the last remaining Luminoth on the planet Aether. In the bottom right, meanwhile, we can just about make out the Ing, and this makes for a lovely little representation of the light and dark shifts we see in the game. Lovely stuff.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="df0b1e0b514c2"><a title="Prime Echoes - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df0b1e0b514c2/prime-echoes-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/6139-metroid-prime-2-echoes">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's approach is interesting, not least because it contains an odd little release date advertisement over on the right. Why..? Who knows. Otherwise, this is mostly a showcase of Samus herself, however the change in colours as we move toward the right indicate the encroaching presence of Dark Samus.</p>
<p>Oh, and it's also called 'Dark Echoes' here, for reasons!</p>

<p>Give Ryu, Chun-Li and Ken a new look</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>McDonald's Japan recently teamed up with Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter</a> series to offer a new range of burgers.</p>
<p>If you're not able to make it to Japan in time to taste test each one, this might be the next best thing. The global fast food restaurant is now offering free codes for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> which unlock "McDonald's EX" colours for certain characters. This includes different colours for select Ryu, Chun-Li and Ken outfits.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c5375a50981e"><a title="McDonalds Street Fighter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c5375a50981e/mcdonalds-street-fighter.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom, McDonald's</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here's each code via the McDonald's Japan social media account. To unlock each colour in the game, you'll need to navigate to the options menu and scroll down to "Input event code". From there, you can redeem each outfit colour.</p>
<h4><strong>McDonald's EX Colour (Ryu)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>M3L4-WJAK-8FCH-6AYV</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>McDonald's EX Colour (Chun-Li)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>CDU9-BBPC-DNQU-98M9</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>McDonald's EX Colour (Ken)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>LFCU-8RYT-7MP9-RH8F</li>
</ul>
<p>Nintendo Life can confirm these codes can be redeemed in local copies of Street Fighter 6 on Switch 2. You can redeem these codes on other platforms as well. Just keep in mind, to access these colours, you'll need to have unlocked or purchased the specific outfit for each character.</p>
<p>These codes can be redeemed until <strong>12th December 2025</strong>. There's also a McDonald's EX colour for M.Bison, but this is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/1ogaq3r/comment/nlfd6qe/">apparently a gift</a> region-locked to Japan.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 arrived alongside the Switch 2 in June. You can find out more about it in our review here on Nintendo Life.</p>

I played a short demo of it already, so be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one">my first impressions</a>, but here we’ll go through everything we do and don’t yet know about 2026’s Halo release – which will be the first one since 2021’s Halo Infinite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Did you say “remake”?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, I asked Halo Studios point-blank if this is a remake or a remaster, and Executive Producer Damon Conn said, “It’s a modernized remake – a rebuilt version of the classic story that started it all.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo: Campaign Evolved – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Since Microsoft has been publishing a lot of games on other platforms, does this mean Halo will be coming to PlayStation 5?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Halo: Campaign Evolved will be released for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and PS5. And yes, I did clarify with Halo Studios that the PS5 version will be released day-and-date with the Xbox and PC versions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is this weirder than Sonic games coming to Nintendo consoles?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s at least on that same level of weird, yeah.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is Halo Studios adding any PS5 Pro enhancements?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked this question, and Game Director Greg Hermann didn’t say much, only telling me, “It’s safe to say that it will be tuned for the target devices.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>OK, so when will Halo: Campaign Evolved be released?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, all Halo Studios will say is “2026,” but it seems highly likely that it will be released close to the 25th anniversary of Combat Evolved’s release, which will be on November 16, 2026. In other words, Fall 2026 seems like a safe bet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Campaign Evolved? Does that mean there’s no multiplayer?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sort of. There is campaign co-op for two players in split-screen, or up to four players online. Cross-play is supported.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wait, cross-play? Does that mean I can play co-op with a friend who’s on PS5 while I’m on Xbox or PC?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yup.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Finish the multiplayer thought. What do you mean by “sort of” with multiplayer?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the name suggests, this is campaign-only. When I asked about why they’re not also remaking Halo 1’s fantastic multiplayer in Unreal Engine 5 – think about how glorious Blood Gulch and Hang ‘Em High and Sidewinder would look in UE5! – Game Director Greg Hermann told me, “Right now we’re just focused on the 25th anniversary and the campaign here.” Executive Producer Damon Conn added, “Halo Infinite and [Halo: The Master Chief Collection] provide really great experiences for multiplayer.” Which is true…though that doesn’t help PS5 owners very much. Unless… </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Does this pave the way for Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Halo Infinite to get ported to PS5 to get PlayStation players caught up on the series?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll have to check back on that one. Conn said, “There is an opportunity for us to grow the fanbase. We’re bringing the most players to Halo ever. So that growth is what we’re truly interested in. And this paves the way for future stories and Halos.” So…maybe?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Will Campaign Evolved be a full-price game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked but didn’t get an answer. Personally, $50 feels right to me without proper multiplayer, but Microsoft <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers"><u>already tried</u></a> to raise its first-party game prices to $80 this year, so I’m probably being naively optimistic with that $50 thought. At least there’s new single-player content here, though.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/hce-general-4k-03-1761260005068.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Did you just say “new single-player content”?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes! I didn’t get any details beyond the very basic description: Campaign Evolved will include a three-mission prequel story arc revolving around Master Chief and Sergeant Johnson. I asked if those missions will be available straight out of the box or if they’ll need to be unlocked, perhaps by completing the campaign. Halo Studios did not have an answer for me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are there any gameplay changes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, lots of little ones, actually. Vehicles are now destructible and they can be hijacked, as they were in every subsequent Halo game after Combat Evolved. You can also now pick up and wield any weapon the enemies can, which means you’ll have access to the Energy Sword, among others, in this campaign. The Warthog has four seats now (the extra one is on the back, like riding on the lowered tailgate of a pickup truck), and you can pilot a Wraith tank. I didn’t get to see any of the Flood in the chunk of The Silent Cartographer mission I played, but Halo Studios says they’ve implemented dismemberment for Flood enemies. The team also told me that “level design has been thoughtfully updated” to smooth out pain points. Presumably they meant the Library, but they didn’t specify. Also, the cinematics have all been completely redone, with new mocap and freshly rerecorded dialogue from Steve Downes (Master Chief) and Jen Taylor (Cortana). </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/hce-general-4k-04-1761260005069.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Any other updates?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">One other notable one: Skulls! Halo Studios is adding Skulls to Campaign Evolved, and lots of ‘em. The most Skulls ever in a Halo campaign, apparently, and the total number is “dozens.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Does it still feel like Halo in Unreal Engine 5?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my brief experience so far, I’d say yes. See my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one">preview</a> for more about that. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Halo: Complete Playlist</h3><p>Halo: Combat Evolved arrived on the scene in 2001.

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite x South Park Collab Coming Soon, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-collab-coming-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-x-south-park-collab-coming-soon-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1335118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed that a Fortnite collaboration is coming with <strong>South Park</strong>, the animated show that has been running since the late 1990s. On social media, a claim emerged alongside a source, with the uploader suggesting that someone <strong>at Paramount </strong>corroborated the leak.</p>



<p>Fans quickly busied themselves imagining how it would work, given that South Park characters are fairly diminutive in stature and stand all of about a few feet tall.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-south-park-coming-to-fortnite">Is South Park Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://xcancel.com/SamLeakss/status/1982196155606786464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SamLeakss claimed</a> that South Park is coming to Fortnite in a crossover event.</p>



<p>Far from being the most unlikely thing in the world, players have accepted that this is gospel and have started assembling theories to explain how the collab would work. One user quickly shared an outfit that <strong>might just work</strong>:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Others suggested that Epic Games would be throwing Cartman into a Mech Suit, while others demanded the arrival of Mr. Hanky as a Back Bling item. Those familiar with the South Park universe pointed out that ‘anime versions’ of the characters could be used, but that’s perhaps a little too niche to be a commercial success.</p>



<p>We know nothing beyond the original claim, unfortunately.</p>



<p>In recent Fortnite news, it was revealed that the developers of the Roblox game ‘Steal a Brainrot’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steal-a-brainrot-developers-sue-fortnite-copycat/">are trying to sue</a> Fortnite UGC developers who have allegedly ripped off their creation. This is being taken pretty seriously, as Steal a Brainrot has become one of the most popular Roblox games in record time in recent months.</p>



<p>Also, <strong>The Simpsons </strong>are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-springfield-map-coming-crossover/">coming to Fortnite</a> with a themed map.</p>



<p>Do you want to see any particular South Park characters surface in this collaboration with Fortnite? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent YouTube video has revealed 40 minutes of gameplay from Wreckreation, the open-world sandbox racer. Eagle-eyed gamers spotted the upload and have been poring over the gameplay, which shows a halfway-decent racer with destruction elements and arcade-like racing mechanics.</p>



<p>Wreckreation is set to drop on October 28, and I’m hoping for a solid day-one patch, as there are more than a few bugs in the gameplay video uploaded by ‘Flotutu’ on YouTube.</p>



<h2 id="h-burnout-in-the-big-2025">Burnout in the Big 2025</h2>



<p>We’ve not seen a new Burnout game for more than 15 years, which feels pretty harrowing. Once upon a time, Burnout offered a high-octane, energetic racing experience punctuated with visceral crashes and takedown systems.</p>



<p>Wreckreation comes <strong>from the creators </strong>of the Burnout series, and it’s an all-new adventure set in a massive open-world map with sandbox mechanics. The game is designed to be pretty open-ended, offering multiplayer gameplay, stacks of customization, and some construction features that allow you to flex your imagination.</p>



<p>Here’s the video featuring the 40 minutes of Wreckreation gameplay that was uploaded recently:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="WRECKREATION🚓 v1.1 Gameplay Découverte FR en 4K sur PS5 🎮 Le Burnout où TU construis tout ! 🏗️" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/taEd4HPhN_w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>As the gameplay unravels, prospective fans will spot a few bugs involving the game’s physics and destruction-based elements. At one point, the player crashes into a truck and glitches inside it, clipping like crazy until the game forces a cutscene.</p>



<p>It’s relatively safe to assume that a day-one patch will drop on October 28 alongside the launch of the game to address some of these lingering issues. That’s the problem with playing a game early; it’s often not representative of the final product.</p>



<p>It looks good enough, though. It’s mostly unlicensed and focuses more on high-speed, arcade action than realism, but that’s what people <strong>want </strong>from former Burnout developers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 RedSec Battle Royale will only be available in Duos and Squads at launch, one insider claims. Once known as Firestorm, we reported that it has changed its name to RedSec and will be shadow dropping on October 28th.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, another story has emerged that may confirm a pretty interesting addition to the mode. While nothing is yet confirmed, the leaker in question has leaked many details about the upcoming mode, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the name</a> and mode itself.</p>



<h2 id="h-duos-and-squads-are-only-team-options-for-battlefield-6-redsec-claims-insider">Duos and Squads Are Only Team Options for Battlefield 6 RedSec, Claims Insider</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 BF6 BR LAUNCH PLAYLIST 🚨</p><p>EXCLUSIVE: Duos (2) and Squads (4) is currently planned to be the ONLY team sizes available at launch for the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale / RedSec.</p><p>So with 100 player count max thats a total of 25 teams of 4 or 50 teams of 2 in every match of RedSec <a href="https://t.co/Uy2D7vlCUh">pic.twitter.com/Uy2D7vlCUh</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1982171308839276707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1982171308839276707?t=p0lnGa3QMgZbPQs634JShw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ModernWarzone</a>, which we reported on yesterday for the name RedSec, they claim that Battlefield 6’s battle royale mode will only be available in Duos and Squads. That means only groups of two and groups of four will be the only formations playable. Fortunately, the insider claims it will only be for launch, so future builds may expand that number. As they point out, the 100 player count could be made of 50 teams of two and/or 25 teams of four.</p>



<p>With 100 players, it’s sure to be quite the spectacle. The popularity of EA’s military shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has only grown</a> since its release earlier in October. While the surprise shadow drop isn’t going to be exactly how they may have planned it, it’s no doubt going to hit big. Other titles like Fortnite and Call of Duty have done the genre, so it’s natural that Battlefield is going there. Still, it may be a bit disappointing for some who wish to go in by themselves or with a group of five or more.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Duos/Squads matching in Battlefield 6: RedSec? Do you think it’s true? If so, have you already decided who you’ll venture out with? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMOs</a> are a strange facilitation of games because they are, ostensibly, dead on arrival. Not dead in the sense of "lol dead game," that exact comment you see littered in the comments of articles, videos etc. about literally any online game, no matter how popular it is. Dead in the sense that it will die, as all things do, because one day the servers will go down and there will be no (legal) way to play it anymore. I put the legal in brackets there because there are many a fan effort that allow you to play a range of "officially" dead MMOs, but what would a game about a Frankensteinian revival of such a thing look like? Probably, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gorgons-garden">Gorgon's Garden</a>.
</p>
<p>
For Gorgon's Garden, we go back to the year 2008, weirdly, personally, probably the last year I spent regular amounts of my time playing an MMO. It's a random summer day, and you are trawling through Hypogeum.net, a resuscitated version of it anyway, a fictitious forum all about an MMO called Gorgon's Garden, now defunct due to a majority of the game being sealed away by a digital currency that no longer exists.

<p>
In practicality, the game is not the game, "Gorgon's Garden," but the game, Gorgon's Garden. It is you, hanging out on your computer, in what looks to be the family computer room - you can see the edges of the computer screen, hints at a room beyond the bevels fully revealed in a reflection when the screen goes dark. You can browse that fake forum, read cringey posts from people of all ages, learning tidbits about their lives, and importantly, find a tool from a notorious hacker that bypasses that dead digital currency. The world of Gorgon's Garden opens up to you once more.
</p><p>
It's mostly quite simple, you can only look left or right, though you can move in any direction. Attacks are limited to the swing of a sword and one spell, and as you kill enemies you level up, which doesn't do much but increase your health.
</p>
<p>
As you delve further and further into the game, or perhaps dive is the right word, it starts to fall apart, the forum acting as a hub of secrets pushing you further down the rabbit hole. What starts as something silly moves towards something genuinely a bit unsettling, and I'll stop there because the whole thing is short, and free, and given the season, you've not got much reason to not try it out yourself.
</p>
<p>
If you need further convincing, Gordon's Garden comes in part from Feverdream Johnny, developer of one of my favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/orbos-odyssey-is-psychonauts-meets-sonic-adventure-and-you-can-shoot-your-character-like-a-bullet">weirdo platformers Orbo's Odyssey</a>. Go on, give it a go, remind yourself of the horrors of niche forums and your favourite dead MMO, there's no better time for it. You can pick it up on <a href="https://feverdreamjohnny.itch.io/gorgons-garden">Itch.io</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just like the seasons, everything changes in the Jwar Isles. These developments are reflected in the Cycle Decks, and we've been given a first look at some of the cards in the next. In this article, we'll exclusively reveal 5 new cards from the <em>Bushido</em> Consequences Cycle Deck, which is available to preorder now.</p>

<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer. You can also check out our review of the last Cycle Deck <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-weeping-sky-cycle-deck-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Seasonal Changes</h2>

<p>Cycle Decks in <em>Bushido</em> are a way for GCT to easily incorporate new cards, rather than packaging them with specific miniature releases. The Concequences Cycle Deck, like the Weeping Sky Cycle Deck before it, contains 54 cards for a mixture of factions and card types, including:</p>

<ul><li>Events, usually actions that can be played during the game</li>
	<li>Terrain, which can be deployed onto the battlefield for specific effects</li>
	<li>Enhancements, are attached to units to offer effects and abilities</li>
	<li>Themes, offer new abilities if the warband construction restrictions are followed</li>
</ul><p>We don't know the full breakdown yet, but there are usually a few faction-specific cards, along with Ronin cards that can be used by all. GCT has stated that the newest factions, such as Awoken, will receive dedicated cards in upcoming releases like Kuna, rather than in this cycle deck. This allows them to focus on fully developing these factions, however, Awoken players can still incorporate Ronin cycle cards into their warbands.</p>

<p>Below we reveal 5 cards from the new cycle deck, with comments on their design and lore from the GCT Studios team ahead of our own thoughts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-2.jpg?itok=SqoK0GN5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-2.jpg?itok=4GLiMHap 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>New Eagle Army</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Amidst the mystical upheaval in the celestial realm, it's vital to anchor the narrative through the eyes of the Jwar Isles' people. The Shiho Clan has been quietly rebuilding its power base since Hiroto's return. Though they lack the resources to field a standing army like the Prefecture of Ryu, they’ve uncovered pockets of Ashigaru veterans, disciplined fighters whose loyalty, training and battlefield organisation remain intact. These seasoned warriors are well-suited to open combat, a necessity if the Shiho are to reclaim their former influence.</p>

<p>Theme cards play a pivotal role in shaping a faction’s identity, unlocking fresh warband configurations and tactical possibilities. The New Eagle Army theme exemplifies this. Reflecting the elite band of Shiho Ashigaru, once the envy of the land, these soldiers gain powerful advantages when managing Virtue Tokens, making them reliable in both melee and ranged engagements.</p>

<p>Strategically, the Theme enhances warband efficiency by offering free Warband Terrain &nbsp;and / or Enhancements, along with cost reductions for Ashigaru profiles. While the Theme forges the Shiho’s hallmark flanking warfare, it introduces a compelling “take and hold” playstyle, rich with nuanced micro-movements that the faction is celebrated for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a Shiho player, I'm looking forward to trying this out. Even as a Wolf player, it reduces the cost of the Wolf Ryoshi and Spears, and adds in the free Terrain and Enhancements. It might just pull me away from my Open Rebellion theme!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-3.jpg?itok=B-E4Hiz3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-3.jpg?itok=Tbxf8TtV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Consequences of Kiyohara</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Sojobo’s machinations continue to unfold, and the stakes have never been higher. Having already fractured an Asura, the act that drew the gaze and anger of Rajin, he has now unleashed the Awoken to keep the heavens turning, but at what cost? One thing is clear: desperate times demand desperate measures.</p>

<p>From a gameplay perspective, Sojobo has fallen out of favour with the Kami and is now relentlessly struck by lightning, a punishment few could endure. Even a king, it seems, is not immune to the consequences of his actions.</p>

<p>So why include the card in your warband? Despite the divine backlash, Sojobo's card offers a substantial cost discount, making him a compelling choice. This allows players to field a high-value defender at a low cost, unlocking new possibilities for list-building and tactical flexibility. It’s a risky play, but one that could pay off handsomely for those bold enough to use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sojobo is a 24-cost Ronin that can join&nbsp;Shiho Clan, Temple of Ro-Kan, and The Descension warbands and is a very effective fighter who can make it harder for ranged attacks across the entire battlefield, and also push units away from them. As the team says above, reducing their cost to 19 at the risk of them taking damage each turn could really pay off.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-4.jpg?itok=dxs-AL5j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-4.jpg?itok=VY_9KwqU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Yokai Corruption</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>After the great Tsunami, rising waters forced the spiders from their hidden lairs into human settlements and forests, spreading dread wherever they crept. Once again, the common folk came to fear the spider’s presence and so Grandmother, and her corrupted followers, took on this form, one that mirrors her essence and the spirit of her death-bringing cycle.</p>

<p>Now, Sojobo must confront the embodiment of the returned Thirteenth Cycle. If he is to fulfill his mission, he cannot avoid this malevolent force. With such powers unleashed, even the Yokai are being reshaped and twisted into new forms that reflect the corruption of nature itself. The Cult of Yueri stands as a chilling benefactor to this transformation.</p>

<p>This card presents a true conundrum. Your Yokai will blaze with additional Ki Tokens, surging with unnatural energy throughout the game. But this power comes at a price: the stolen energies will eventually consume them. It’s a classic twist on risk-reward mechanics, and one that many Yueri players will find irresistible, offering bold new strategies for those willing to gamble with fate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adding this to a Yokai unit with a high Ki empowers them more and means they'll survive longer, but each time they use a Ki feat, they'll drop by 1, which means they might not be as effective late game, but if you want to storm them into combat, and watch them burn out taking down enemies, then this Enhancement for the Cult of Yurei is glorious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each cycle is marked by a celestial Asura, a divine embodiment of that cycle’s spirit and nature. For generations, it was believed there were only twelve cycles, but ancient calendars and forgotten dates revealed a hidden truth: a missing cycle, long obscured, whose absence caused the Heavenly misalignment that Sojobo now seeks to correct.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the return of the Thirteenth Cycle, a much older cosmic order begins to reassert itself. At this pivotal moment, Master Bat’s influence surges, and as the heavens realign with his domain, his growing power manifests through this event card.</p>

<p>Mechanically, this event disrupts many effects that would normally remove Bleeding Markers, including Heal. As a result, any model with the Bleed Trait becomes significantly more lethal, its damage lingering. Ideal for warbands that lean into damage-over-time mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the recent release of the Master Bat Ronin unit (who gives Bleed tokens on their attacks) and Nagato, who opened up the House Bleeding Moon Shadow Wind Clan theme, this Event means that those Bleed tokens are definitely going to be there in the end turn to do damage.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-6.jpg?itok=_fyRFbIG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-6.jpg?itok=xQ5exTGY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Weeping Sky’s Influence</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The skies themselves are said to weep, mourning the faltering celestial order. As the heavens tremble, the consequences ripple through both the mortal realm and the spiritual plane, reshaping the balance of power across the Jwar Isles.</p>

<p>At the heart of this upheaval stands Lord Toad, master of the previous cycle and a divine force whose influence endures. Even King Sojobo, no stranger to ambition, offers him respect. Lord Toad is far from finished. He revels in the bounty his cycle has unleashed, and the signs of his lingering power are unmistakable.</p>

<p>From the quagmire and shadowed tunnels, the lifeless legions of the Imperial Court have begun to rise. Their emergence is no coincidence, it is a reaction to Lord Toad’s enduring will for change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This card offers a powerful early-game advantage: it prevents long-range attacks during Turn One, shielding your warband from opportunistic enemy volleys before formations are set. Whether you're protecting fragile units or setting up a bold advance, this effect can dramatically shift the tempo of the opening round.</p>

<p>The battlefield even becomes a quagmire, Lord Toad, ever the opportunist, thrives in this environment. The movement boost granted by the Quagmire effect plays perfectly into his slippery tactics, allowing him to reposition with ease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lord Toad was a recent Ronin release that can be used across all 14 factions. While in a quagmire, Lord Toad's movement is boosted by 2 to 6 and ignores all terrain and other models for the purposes of movement, rushing them ahead to make use of their Swallow Up ki feat to remove an enemy unit from the battlefield for a turn.</p>

<h2>Future&nbsp;Consequences</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new mode for Marvel Rivals has caused a major player spike on Steam, its highest in a while.</p>



<p>Released in December 2024, the free-to-play multiplayer superhero shooter has been going steady. With the release of Season 4, which added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-showcases-daredevils-duelist-moves-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daredevil</a> and Angela, the game has seen a decent, stable player base. While not as high as when its first season dropped, touting a 644,269 player count, it still ranks as one of the most popular games on Steam. In any case, earlier this week, the numbers rose quite a bit, heading into numbers only seen for the beginning of a season. Well, a new mode, one fans have been asking for for quite a while, has been added.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-pve-marvel-zombies-mode-almost-doubles-marvel-rivals-usual-player-count">New PvE Marvel Zombies Mode Almost Doubles Marvel Rivals’ Usual Player Count</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#1w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, earlier this week, Marvel Rivals kept at a usual 75k-80k player count, decreasing from the start of Season 4.5 with Daredevil. However, on October 23rd, the game spiked into the high 120k, almost double what it was the previous day. It continued into yesterday and today. The reason? The addition of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-pve-zombies-mode-arrives-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Zombies PvE mode</a> lets players fight against AI enemies. Based on the comic and new animated series, the limited-time Halloween-based mode brings it to life with droves of zombies and perilous fights with friends. </p>



<p>A quick look at Reddit supports the rise quite well, as many fans have praised the mode a ton. Some, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1oeqvfe/holy_fucking_shit_is_the_marvel_zombies_game_mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Living-Ad102</a>, want it to be a permanent addition to the game. Given that PvE has been asked for since the game’s release, the massive spike isn’t too surprising. If anything, it’s clear that NetEase may want to do more of these events. Either way, if you want in on the fun, best to do it before mid-November while Marvel Zombies lasts. </p>



<p>Have you played the Marvel Zombies mode in Marvel Rivals yet? If so, how is it? Would you like to see PvE added permanently to the base game? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

A thing I find a lot of joy in is the fact that despite there's technically a new, shinier, perhaps by some people's standards better version of it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/old-school-runescape">Old School RuneScape</a> is still kicking around. Before the Old School was tagged on the front end of it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> was an MMO I put many hours into (and found little success in) as a youth with too much free time, so the fact practically two decades later it's introducing a brand new skill into the game simultaneously impresses me and strikes existential fear into my heart because of how old this game actually is.
</p>
<p>
Moving on swiftly, sailing! That's the new skill coming to Old School RuneScape, the first new one since its launch. According to a <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/sailing-launches-on-november-19th?oldschool=1">blog post</a>, sailing is quite the undertaking, described as "bigger and more expansive than any content that's come before it," and a skill that "touches almost every aspect of the game." With this new skill, you can own up to five boats at any time. These boats are upgradable, and there's three sizes to choose from: the raft, small boat, and large boat.

<p>
There's ship combat, which apparently mostly works the same as land combat, and you can also take a few different NPCs with you out on the sea - or your real friends too! Levelling up requires, technically, just one thing, which is, well, sailing. This includes "interacting with facilities on your boat" like trimming your sails, an action that nets you some XP as well as a speed boost.
</p><p>
On top of all that, you can salvage shipwrecks, chart the oceans you travel across, do some deep sea trawling, complete new quests, gather new resources, and while this one's a bit more secretive, there's new areas to explore too, including 30 new islands, some of which have some new dungeons.
</p>
<p>
The sailing update is coming to Old School RuneScape pretty soon too, as it's currently planned to launch in just under a month's time on November 19th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a sleepy Sunday, but it’s also time to wrap up your week with another round of NYT Connections hints and solutions. Today’s puzzle will be easy for some, including <strong>boxing fans</strong>, but I’ve still provided the best hints around so that you can get things finished as fast as possible, then get on with the rest of your weekend.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full scope of today’s NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-26">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 26)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #868:</p>



<ul>
<li>BEE</li>



<li>BUTTERFLY</li>



<li>FLOAT</li>



<li>STING</li>



<li>BRASS</li>



<li>PERCUSSION</li>



<li>STRING</li>



<li>WIND</li>



<li>BEAUTY</li>



<li>POPULARITY</li>



<li>STARING</li>



<li>TALENT</li>



<li>DOGGY</li>



<li>DROPLET</li>



<li>KITCHENETTE</li>



<li>STARLING</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think orchestra sections! These are categories of musical instruments</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These all describe creatures or actions associated with light movement or flight</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These words relate to qualities often judged or admired in people or performances</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>This group plays with diminutives or cozy-sounding words</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 26.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-26-868">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 26 (#868)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BRASS, PERCUSSION, STRING, WIND</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BEE, BUTTERFLY, FLOAT, STING</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BEAUTY, POPULARITY, STARING, TALENT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – DOGGY, DROPLET, KITCHENETTE, STARLING</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <p>FromSoftware has pushed back the release of the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> to "allow time for performance adjustments".</p>
<p>In a brief statement, the developer apologised for the delay, but said it was "wholeheartedly [working] toward release", which is now expected sometime in 2026. Sadly, a firmer release window has not been provided.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring's Switch 2 port, Tarnished Edition, was announced at a Nintendo Direct presentation back in April</a>. It's slated to include the base game and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC, as well as new armour and a new Torrent appearance customisation feature.</p> <div>

<p>FromSoft hadn't given a firm release date for the Switch 2 Tarnished Edition in 2025, but it was initially expected to release before the end of the year.</p>
<p>"We apologise to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support," the team said.</p>
<p>As for FromSoftware's Elden Ring spin-off, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-unveils-elden-ring-nightreigns-new-mode-ahead-of-release-tomorrow">New mode Deep of Night mode is now live</a>, adding extra challenge to the multiplayer spin-off game. The world of Limveld will be full of deadlier enemies, and Nightlords won't be selectable, as in the main game, but instead players can traverse multiple depths, with escalating difficulty and challenges.</p>

            <p>Raven Software says its focus for the year ahead and Call of Duty: Warzone comes down to three pillars: "Battle Royale, Resurgence, and the future of the game".</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/RavenSoftware/status/1981852213581381882">update</a> posted earlier today, the developer said the team was "incredibly excited and there is much more to come", including a "first look" at some of the updates on the way, but insisted "Battle Royale is the foundation upon which we've built every new mode, feature, and memorable moment".</p>

<p>"While we continue to innovate across the entire game, we feel it's important that Battle Royale remains a cornerstone of what we do," the developer stated. "That's why we're expanding Battle Royale to include support for multiple large maps via map rotation. While it wasn't previously realistic for us to host multiple large maps, we've since taken the steps necessary to support it. This won't be a launch feature with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a>, but it's a key addition slated for early next year."</p><p>Though it previously insisted it would "approach change more deliberately to preserve the original Warzone launch experience" after re-releasing Verdansk last spring, Raven confirmed it's going to "increase how often we release updates and refine the way we surface new features to you".</p> <div>

<p>"The goal is balance: keep things moving without forgetting about seasonal support and quality-of-life improvements," the team explained.</p>
<p>As part of that, Raven says it's heard you "loud and clear" about Rebirth Island and the broader Resurgence experience, admitting it has "started to feel a bit stale".</p>
<p>"So, to start, we're delivering a full refresh to Rebirth Island in Season 02, which includes new POI updates, a cosmetic pass, and several other upgrades that improve flow," Raven explained. "The launch of the new Haven's Hollow map in Season 01 will be another step in spicing up Resurgence. These past months, we've made changes based on feedback received during early previews of Haven's Hollow.</p><p>"Shortly after launch, we'll be bringing back map rotation to Resurgence, which will swap between Rebirth Island and Haven's Hollow," the statement added. "We are also exploring opportunities to bring back past maps in future seasons: an improved version of Fortune's Keep is underway as we speak. Our goal is to ensure that each map has room to shine without sidelining the ones that you love most."</p>
<p>Moving forward, the developer says it will continue to make "significant, meaningful improvements on multiple fronts", and intends to "deliver a higher frequency of updates, with a larger emphasis on balance changes no less than twice per season".</p>
<p>"Our approach to weapon and attachment balance is fundamentally shifting, which means redefined roles at launch followed by multiple balance passes per season with adjustments entirely unique to Warzone," Raven explained. "Regular updates will extend beyond weapons to include shifts in ground loot, perks, equipment, contracts, and much more throughout the year."</p>
<p>Players can expect a seasonal roadmap next month, and more Ranked Play camos in Season 2, as well as "the arrival of our new Blackout experience on Avalon during Season 2".</p>

        <p>This is the game's second delay</p>

    </div>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
There are two sides to every game delay coin. On the one hand, it's a shame when you're looking forward to a thing only to have to wait even longer for said thing. On the other, there's too many damn video games these days and, oh, gods, don't we all just have a laundry list of things to attend to right now? So make of it what you will that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nivalis">Nivalis</a>, the cyberpunk restaurant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> set in the world of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cloudpunk">Cloudpunk</a>, has been delayed.
</p>
<p>
Word of said delay (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/glittering-cyberpunk-life-sim-nivalis-has-been-delayed-until-2025">its second one</a>) comes in the form of a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1488490/view/536616765394782627?l=english">Steam news post</a>, which took the time to highlight just how big this technically small indie game actually is: "Right now, we’re deeply focused on the voice over: we’ve just completed the casting process for over 100 new voice roles after our first casting of 32 roles for our demo 2 years ago," the post explains. "In Nivalis, there will be around 135 primary and secondary fully voiced characters, for a total of about 200,000 words."
</p>
<p>
That, to be clear, is genuinely very impressive. We all know how even the biggest of RPGs reuse voice actors for multiple characters and NPCs. With that, the post notes that amongst all of this voice acting stuff, "releasing the game in 2025 would risk compromising its quality." So the game will now be releasing in 2026, though an exact release day or even month hasn't been revealed just yet (apparently the devs are working on this with their publisher, and confirmation of a release date will hopefully be coming before the year is out).
</p>
<p>
Nivalis, for those that haven't heard of it, conceptually feels like quite an open game. You can manage a restaurant or a night club, buy or grow your own ingredients for your establishment, go fishing, purchase a home, and most importantly meet people. It's the meeting people that almost seems to be the key thing here, and the thing I'm most curious about.
</p><p>
The game's Steam page does note that Nivalis is not an easy city to live in, with gangs hoping to harvest your organs, Corps fining you just for breathing, and "the whole time, the ground under your feet is crumbling." So in a world like this, what are its people like? With as many voice lines as the devs claim the game has, hopefully these people are varied and strongly defined, but I also want them to be people with believable problems, wants, and needs.
</p>
<p>
Like many of us in this world I worked in hospitality for many years, and met all sorts of folks, which sometimes was even quite a nice thing to do. It was also often not a nice thing to do, a dichotomy I hope is represented in Nivalis, whenever it launches next year. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1488490/Nivalis/">here</a>.

            <p>
You know, with the original Paranormal Activity steadily approaching two decades of existence, it's becoming harder and harder to recognise what it actually was and is as opposed to the cultural consensus around it. First and foremost you probably think of it as a cheap, jump-scare-filled kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> movie, when in actuality the first entry in the series is a slow, tense window into the world of gaslighting and, obviously, the paranormal. Being as removed as we are from this means one thing: IP expansion, which we're viewing today in the form of the first proper trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paranormal-activity-found-footage">Paranormal Activity: Threshold</a>, the video game adaptation from the developer behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-mortuary-assistant">The Mortuary Assistant</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let's set the scene, with some assistance from the game's description on Steam. Paranormal Activity: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/threshold">Threshold</a> focuses on Daniel and Jessica Stewart, who've just decided to remodel their first home. We're introduced to said home by Daniel, showing a fairly sized if sparsely decorated building that he describes as the only one they could afford. Sure thing Daniel!

<p>
The rest of the trailer shows a variety of hauntings and happenings like a shadow moving across the room, a stool sliding along the floor, a door suddenly shutting. There's some kind of vaguely satanic-looking puzzle you can do, but aside from that it doesn't really show much of the broader activities you'll be participating in.
</p><p>
Returning to Steam again, there's an explanation that you can "play in multiple timelines," "hunt and communicate with entities," and "perform demonic rituals to alter your fate." There's apparently multiple endings, and the game's "Paranormal Engine makes every playthrough unique." My guess is that different playthroughs can have different hauntings as I described above take place randomly, which if I'm right, sounds quite similar to the hauntings you can experience in Silent Hill 4's pseudo-hub area.
</p>
<p>
I'll admit that I feel quite apprehensive about Paranormal Activity getting a game adaptation. I can count the number of good entries in the film series on one hand, but there's two hands worth of films to count, distorting what it could be if done well. How might a game adaptation deal with such a framework? Is a game even capable of capturing that tactile feel an actual tape presents like in the first film, having you question what's real and what isn't? I'm not sure that there's enough filters in the world to convey such a feeling.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there's no release date for Paranormal Activity: Threshold, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3394030/Paranormal_Activity_Threshold/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.

<p>Neither EA nor Battlefield Studios has yet committed to a release date for the highly anticipated mode, but the teams did previously say that preparation for the shooter's seasonal content would be "starting" with "an exciting new Battlefield take on Battle Royale", suggesting we'll get it sooner rather than later.</p> <div>

<p>Battlefield and Call of Duty X/Twitter account ModernWarzone shared the news on social media, saying: "Think it’s safe to say this is the BF6 Battle Royale."</p>
<p>The datamined code itself isn't quite convincing everyone, but the dataminers are certain this will be a "full on shadowdrop", even believing they've discovered the name for it: Battlefield: RedSec.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>EXCLUSIVE: The F2P Battlefield 6 battle royale is officially named “Battlefield: RedSec”.</p><p>Releasing October 28th as previously reported, however it looks like there won’t be any trailers or official announcements until the 28th itself instead of a day before.</p><p>Full on shadowdrop <a href="https://t.co/blP6NQR3jW">pic.twitter.com/blP6NQR3jW</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981741907387523203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

EA and Battlefield Studios recently released a trailer for the first season of post-launch content, including a peek at the massive Blackwell Fields map and new game mode, Strikepoint. It's split into three stages in total, the first being dubbed "Rogue Ops" which we'll experience next Tuesday.</p><p>This marks the first major update for Battlefield 6, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/missing-shots-in-battlefield-6-well-you-might-not-be-bad-a-bug-might-be-throwing-your-shots-off">series of smaller bug fixes</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-developers-u-turn-on-a-multiplayer-adjustment-following-community-feedback">balance adjustments</a>.

<p>Play through 'Book 2 episodes 1-4' today</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo shadow-dropped the new mobile game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_shadows">Fire Emblem Shadows</a> in September. If you haven't given this free-to-play title a go just yet, now might be the time to take a look.</p>
<p>A new story "and more" has been added in a free update. Book 2 - Wolf Brother adds episodes 1-4. You can unlock the chapters by collecting Story Fragments earned as battle rewards. You'll also need to complete Book 1 before you can dive into this new content featuring the character Joachim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unsettling footsteps approach a small, impoverished village quietly tucked away deep in the mountains…A kind boy from a cold village in the northern mountains who rarely seeks conflict. He's a descendant of wolves from the bloodline of Fenris. You can unlock him by battling and collecting Book 2 Story Fragments."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Along with this, there's also a new labyrinth map, and new weapons and skills have been added as treasure rewards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The feature rewards this time are Soul items for Lyn: Plain Wind. Collect 12 of these to recruit Lyn as one of your disciples."</p>
</blockquote>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Last month, something a bit surprising, and perhaps concerning, took place in the games industry: a deal was made which saw that a mixture of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, equity firm Silver Lake, and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners had privately acquired EA. There's a whole host of reasons why this is worrisome, but one reason in particular is the way that it might affect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims</a>.
</p>
<p>
While it isn't exactly a paragon of identity politics, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> has by and large been a game that welcomes and encourages people of all creeds, notably LGBTQIA+ folks. It is probably safe to assume that these new owners, however, will not be so welcoming. In fact, concern has been so great over this acquisition that the biggest Sims YouTuber around lilsimsie has <a href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxPVv5K6a9ZXkFzbLrta3DlHckpC8A9OF6?si=sglHvJEekR-fr1md">left EA's Creator Network</a>, having been joined by other big Sims YouTubers like <a href="http://youtube.com/post/Ugkxe7pZtIiCBZpCErpuc1fqI3k41pAsna53?si=OTATMfwD8usqaILA">Plumbella</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxGxA76frKUAO6anFj84Ijhqkc4m-jlznc?si=4KaoEumB9X0jgD7u">James Turner</a>.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
In turn, a message has now been shared by The Sims team on its official Dwitter account seemingly attempting to assuage some of the above concerns, though it has been delivered in a bit of a vague tone. "We're continually inspired by our incredible players and creators; by your imagination, creativity, and the joy you bring to The Sims every day," reads the statement.
</p>
<p>
"We deeply respect that everyone experiences The Sims in their own way and will make choices that are right for them. However you choose to play, create, or share, we’re grateful to be part of your journey. Our mission, values, and commitment remain the same. The Sims will always be a space where you can express your authentic self."
</p><p>
The statement carries on with an even vaguer bit about how everyone's "passion and voices" have affected bits to come in 2026, and that on November 4th there'll be a new update coming to The Sims with "150+ fixes and fresh freebies." Notably, this update is "the first of ongoing updates that address the things that matter most to you," though personally this feels slightly disconnected from the main message and is more addressed at those who are frustrated with how broken the game often can be.
</p>
<p>
This is all well and good for now, it's just still a bit too early to tell what kind of effects this acquisition will have. For now let's all just cross our fingers for the future of any staff members currently working at EA.
