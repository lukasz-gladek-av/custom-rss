<figure><a title="Silksong article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/71e649992dfee/silksong-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not in any way whatsoever radical to have your players follow along a tightly-scripted path in a video game. It's nothing new, it's nothing that hasn't been a constant (in platformers especially) since...well...forever. So why is it, some five or six hours into my time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, that it's the locked-down and <em>relatively</em> linear nature of proceedings that's got me most excited thus far? Why's it that bit that's got me all worked up to keep playing?</p>
<p>Perhaps it's over-exposure to big noisy AAA monstrosities that's done me in. Reviewing new games these days invariably leads to a whole lot of wandering around huge open worlds, you see. And whether they be set in the past or future, from medieval all the way through to post-apocalyptic wasteland 3000, there's usually a recognisable flow, a loop to even the biggest of worlds encountered, that gives you a lot of room to breathe, and purposefully lets you take your foot off the gas.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qpnwjv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>That loop typically sees you learn the gameplay ropes gently through tutorials in the field - usually somewhere safe in the field, mind, like a training area or castle ramparts full of stuffed-sack bad guys. And then we have our story beats and our collectibles, our side missions and our methods of travel all added in, and all of these aspects are layered on in such a way that there's (usually) space to think and get used to things, nice and comfy, as well as some time-outs to settle into your surroundings. Oh look, what a lovely vista.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/749d0b3041011/silksong-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, maybe Silksong's grabbed me thanks to too much lollygagging in open worlds of late, alongside a <em>ton</em> of recent roguelike offerings that allow you to navigate in various ways across their maps, honing and swapping so many skills and loadouts, adding/subtracting buffs until it's got your stamp on it. Until it feels like your comfy clothing. Maybe these things have made me a little afraid of a proper beatdown from a proper platformer that's properly bossing me where to go most of the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a game where every screen is worth your attention - and <em>demands</em> your attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because Silksong doesn't do any of this nice and friendly stuff. It kicks my ass and it sends me back to bosses beyond lines of baddies. It's still got me scrapping with a tiny needle a few bosses in. I'm stuck on a boss and I can't get out! My jumping skills are also underwhelming starting out, so there are sharp deaths and other ignominious endings to my existence around every bloody corner.</p>
<p>And I am thrilled. Absolutely thrilled. And a bit terrified.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not saying this is some super hard game either, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-is-hollow-knight-silksong-too-difficult">that's a discourse that's happening right now</a> - I'm not really finding that it's doing anything unusual for the genre in this regard. It's challenging, but it should be, and it is in all the right ways, but the tension brought about in me by having lost so much of the usual control...it's got me right sweaty, hen.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c41bc5361953/silksong-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In this case, with the hugely talented maestros at Team Cherry on the case, the tightness — the claustrophobia of it all, in places — is so beautifully stage-managed that you can't help but be drawn into the thing. And they do an amazing job of making you <em>want</em> to push through battles, because there's always, 100% definitely, something worth seeing or hearing or fighting to the bloody death around the next corner. It's a game where every screen is worth your attention - and <em>demands</em> your attention.</p>
<p>On a broader note, it's also got me feeling a little guilty that perhaps I've been ignoring this part of games in general. I've allowed myself to become a lollygagger. I've become one of those sorts of gamers who sees a challenge in the distance (perhaps an enemy riding around Limgrave on a horse, as an example - I hate him with a passion) and immediately brings up their map to plot the quickest way to return to vibing with picking berries, riding over NPCs on my horse, and other Sunday-driver-styled activities.</p>
<p>Silksong isn't letting me do any of this. It's making me face my fears, like so many great platformers. What would <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario</a> be without all the awful falling to your death, so vicious and cruel and repetitive and tough at times? Or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>! What good would Silksong be if it weren't constantly killing you with all the sharp things?</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6529994aa5eda/silksong-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Team Cherry's majestic use of level design and atmosphere, its properly challenging boss fights, and the ever-present fear of something awful lurking just around the bend, make for a game that, even just six hours or so in, has got me thinking on all the time I've spent letting my edge dull. I mean, I never actually had a gaming edge, or any edge, really, but you tell yourself these things.</p>
<p>It's also got me thinking I need to download <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a> again, y'know. I need to get back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/cave_story">Cave Story</a>, and a bunch of other quite challenging platformers that I shrugged and put down because it was easier to stick <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/assassins_creed_the_ezio_collection">Assassin's Creed</a> on and spend two hours avoiding everyone while I tried on new outfits. What a fool I've been.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-new-contract-fief-dlc-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wartales-new-contract-the-fief-dlc-lets-you-manage-your-own-domain-later-this-month.1294836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Shiro Games has announced a new DLC pack for&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>in the form of&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief</em>, and, as the name suggests, it'll put you in control of your very own domain when it launches later this month.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the DLC, which was first teased as part of&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-roadmap-late-2025" rel="nofollow">most recent roadmap</a>, will launch on September 25th, and it'll offer you a domain in which you can "enact laws, oversee industry and tradecraft, and manage state affairs".</p>

<p>As your fiefdom develops, you can construct new buildings, watch as factions emerge and battle one another for dominance, and more. It's up to you whether your domain will become known for diplomacy and scholarship or for brutal militarism (or anything in between!).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wartales-contract-the-fief-dlc-overhead-view.jpg?itok=Cax840UE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wartales-contract-the-fief-dlc-overhead-view.jpg?itok=pM91oZrp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Are you ready to manage your very own domain in&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' new&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief&nbsp;</em>DLC?</figcaption></figure><p>Shiro says that you'll be able to make decisions in&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief&nbsp;</em>that will affect your citizens' lives on a granular level, granting them prosperity or condemning them to "short, brutish lives of violence and starvation".</p>

<p>What's more, the new DLC will integrate seamlessly with&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' existing campaigns, so you'll be able to manage your fief and issue commands as you play through one of the other stories on offer.</p>

<p>Game director Quentin Lapeyre says&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief&nbsp;</em>will add "a whole new way to interact with the world of&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>", and that it'll allow you to "expand [your] horizons and rule over [your] own fief" without distracting you from your usual mercenary activities.</p>

<p>You can check out a (very brief) trailer introducing&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief&nbsp;</em>and its various gameplay additions right here.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>, it's a gritty medieval mercenary RPG that blends open-world exploration with tactical turn-based combat, pitting you against everything from "petty thieves" to "the land's most notorious figures".</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527950/Wartales/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/wartales" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>.&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief&nbsp;</em>launches for both platforms on September 25th.</p>

                <p>Canadian musician bbno$ is everywhere right now. Pronounced 'baby no money,' and definitely not 'bibinos,' he's collaborated with everyone from the VTuber Ironmouse through to producer Y2K. Several of his tracks have gone viral on social media platforms such as TikTok, including the likes of "Edamame" which was used in the trailer for The Garfield Movie, and "U Mad?" which appeared in CS:GO promotional materials.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is not messing around with this new laptop deal, which is only fitting because it’s on a laptop that also does not mess around. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3724/">You can get a fully loaded 17-inch HP Business Laptop with a 12-core Intel Ultra 7 255U processor, supercharged AI power, and 2TB of storage for a 72%-off price of $1,119 — that’s a savings of over $2,800</a>.</p>
<p>Along with this enormously powerful HP touchscreen laptop comes a $200 accessories package including a wireless mouse, USB hub, 128GB flash drive, and 7-in-1 cleaning kit. For additional value, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/windows-11-pro">Windows 11 Pro</a> is preinstalled, and the 12 TOPS (Trillions of Operations Per Second) of AI computational power combined with Microsoft Copilot creates a peak AI device.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3724/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Terrific Touchscreen</h2>
<p>The generously proportioned 17.3-inch touchscreen of this business laptop is not only a perfect interactive device giving the user a rapid-reaction tablet-like experience, but it’s a vivid HD+ (1600 x 900 resolution) display with anti-glare treatment and 250 nits of brightness. The keyboard is also backlit for better accessibility, and the Copilot key is present for one-touch deployment of the powerful AI features.</p>
<p>Whatever you have on that high-performing screen — anything from multiple windows of complex spreadsheets to whatever TV show or movie you’re streaming — will come through without any hesitation or glitching. That’s because the 12-core Intel Ultra 7 255U processor is an absolute beast, able to hit speeds of up to 5.2GHz and bolstered by a maxed-out <strong>64GB of RAM</strong>. The huge<strong> 2TB SSD</strong> reads and writes data with impressive speed, and the huge amount of storage and memory combined with the elite processor makes this HP laptop virtually future-proofed.</p>



<h2>All the Connections</h2>
<p>The Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4 hookups are just the tip of the connectivity spear. This HP laptop has a 720p HD webcam with a privacy shutter built in, and there are two USB-A, one USB-C, and an HDMI 1.4b port at the ready should you want to connect parallel accessories, including the 128GB USB flash drive and 7-in-1 USB hub that come free with this laptop. The pre-tuned stereo speakers complete this truly impressive package.</p>
<p>While the $4,000 retail price for this 17.3-inch HP Business Laptop with Windows 11 Pro and accessories bundle is a little bloated, to say the least, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3724/">the huge 72% Amazon price cut lands it at an exceptionally competitive $1,119</a>. With the powerful Intel processor, huge cache of memory and storage, and hypercharged AI engine, this will be your everyday productivity laptop for years to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sucker Punch Productions </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-sly-cooper-titanfall-splinter-cell-left-4-dead-1851506835"><span>hasn’t made a </span><i><span>Sly Cooper </span></i><span>game in 20 years</span></a><span>. The last time the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sony-ps5-state-of-play-1851786081"><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i></a> <span>developer put together an elaborate heist in the stealth platformer series was 2005’s </span><i><span>Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves </span></i><span>on the PlayStation 2. If that had been the Cooper Gang’s last hurrah, I would be more than happy to leave the anthropomorphic kleptomaniac crew in the PS2 days and play the old games on my Vita every few years. However, Sanzaru Games brought the series back in 2013 with the PS3 game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sly-cooper-thieves-in-time-the-kotaku-review-5981954"><i><span>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</span></i></a><span>, and it ended on a devastating cliffhanger, stranding the titular thief in Ancient Egypt thanks to some time travel shenanigans. Sanzaru intended to resolve this with a DLC mission, but Sony </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tbwTiCn16k&amp;t=3215s"><span>pulled the plug</span></a><span> on that, and the studio was acquired by Meta in 2020. So now, one of PlayStation’s mascots has been in time travel limbo for over a decade, with no sign of a fifth game or DLC in sight. Could Sucker Punch go back and make a new game, saving its beloved thief from a fate worse than death? Nope. Apparently, the studio is just not interested in going back.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffOTS1CkZVg"><i><span>Minnmax</span></i></a> <span>had </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span> co-creative director Nate Fox on its show for 125 rapid-fire questions. Naturally, they talked a lot about the upcoming samurai game, joked about the relief of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-ghost-yotei-cyberpunk-2-keanu-leak-2000624435"><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i><span> getting delayed</span></a><span>, and discussed a hypothetical VR game concept set in the </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span> world. At roughly the 7:40 mark, </span><i><span>Minnmax</span></i><span> asks Fox what percentage of the studio would be enthused about working on a fifth </span><i><span>Sly Cooper</span></i><span> game. Fox says “10 percent” of the Bellevue studio would be excited. Interviewer Ben Hanson expresses shock at the low number, and Fox says, “It’s been a long time, Ben, since </span><i><span>Sly Cooper</span></i><span>‘s come out.”</span></p>  <p><span>Yeah Nate, it has been a long time. The series just celebrated its 20th anniversary with a series of exclusive merchandise (all of which I bought), and Sly has spent more than half of those years now stranded out of time because Sony left him there. Look, I’m not picky. I just want Sony to get </span><i><span>any Sly Cooper </span></i><span>project off the ground that could potentially save my raccoon son from this terrible fate, I don’t need it to be </span><i><span>Sly Cooper 5</span></i><span>. In the years since </span><i><span>Thieves in Time</span></i><span>, Sony has greenlit and then </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/first-look-at-the-sly-cooper-movie-1510540922"><span>canceled an animated film</span></a><span>, and the </span><a href="https://slycooper.fandom.com/wiki/Sly_Cooper_(TV_series)"><span>animated series</span></a><span> that was in development at Technicolor Animation Productions has vanished without a trace. Hell, Sony could make a short comic series about the rescue mission to get him back to the present day, and I’d shut the fuck up. You will never hear me ask for a fifth </span><i><span>Sly Cooper </span></i><span>game again.</span></p> <p><span>While Sly may not be getting his own game anytime soon, the character continues to make appearances in PlayStation crossover games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150"><i><span>Astro Bot</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303"><i><span>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</span></i></a><span>. Should I just consider him showing up in </span><i><span>Rift Apart </span></i><span>as a sign that Ratchet saved him from time travel purgatory?</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival">Hellraiser: Revival</a> intend to push its M Rating as far as it can with the upcoming video game adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival is a story-driven, single-player survival horror action game set in the Hellraiser universe. It's developed by Boss Team Games, creator of the recently delisted Evil Dead: The Game, and is due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hellraiser, for the uninitiated, is a cult classic horror franchise made up of 11 films and various comic books, all based on The Hellbound Heart novella by English author Clive Barker. The star of the show is Pinhead, a ‘Cenobite’ who harvests human souls to torture in sadistic experiments. And you can see that in action in the trailer, which — content warning! — contains as much sex as it does body horror.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hellraiser: Revival is not for the faint of heart. If you’re wondering just how extreme the game gets, be sure to check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hellraiser-revival-is-resident-evil-for-sickos">hands-on Hellraiser: Revival preview</a> for all the gory details. But in short, expect body horror, sex, no holds barred nudity, nightmarish scenes, and a healthy dose of hell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s 'Resident Evil For Sickos,' we said coming out of our time with Hellraiser, but just how extreme can the developers at Saber Interactive take it? In an interview with IGN, Saber development chief Tim Willits said the studio plans to push Hellraiser as far as the people who make the rules around an M Rating will let them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are going to go as far as we possibly can, as far as the people that make rules will let us go,” Willits insisted. “And I hope that we can make one version, but we are willing to go as far as we possibly can go.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hellraiser: Revival - gamescom 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, what we’ve seen of Hellraiser: Revival so far is in keeping with Clive Barker’s cult classic Hellraiser movies, so tonally, there’s no real difference. But there’s something unique about seeing and doing all this horrific stuff from a first-person perspective that’s a bit more in your face than watching a film in a theater or at home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to be a responsible publisher / developer, but we are going to push it as far as we possibly can in the context of the game and the movie.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clive Barker is working with Saber on Hellraiser: Revival to ensure it fits with his vision for the universe. This back and forth should result in a game fans of the movies will get a real kick out of, Willits added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He's come back and said, ‘Yeah, Pinhead wouldn't do that,’” Willits explained. “And he's come back and said, ‘Yeah, you got to tweak this a little bit.’ Because this is his world and he knows stuff that we don't even think about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And he's been really fast too. Sometimes when you work with famous people you throw something over and then six months later they come back and they complain about something. No, he’s that on it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doug Bradley, the original actor behind the Cenobite leader Pinhead, has reprised his role for the game, adding to the authenticity of the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Discover the tale of Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration, a mysterious puzzle box, to help his girlfriend from a hellish abyss. As Aidan, you’ll harness the box’s infernal abilities to survive your pact with the sinister Pinhead and battle against the twisted cult that worships him and the Cenobites. Fail, and your suffering will be legendary, even in Hell.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Hellraiser was thrust back into the public consciousness in 2022 with a franchise reboot film. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hellraiser-review-2022-hulu">Hellraiser review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Hellraiser is a reinvigorated reboot that gets the blood pumping, starting with Jamie Clayton’s worthy Pinhead performance that sets a fresh tone with immense reverence paid to Clive Barker's works.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a big week for Drukhari fans after Games Workshop finally remembered the Dark Eldar exist and announced two new models for the faction as well as a new codex and Combat Patrol. But one of the models in particular has caught the attention of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> fans, many of whom think she looks very much like God's Favourite Princess.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Drukhari have been biding their time in the depths of Commorragh, but it’s finally time to launch the raid and drink deep of the galaxy’s misery — Codex: Drukhari is on its way!” Games Workshop said in a post on the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/5jk5xmlb/lady-malys-stands-tall-over-the-new-codex-drukhari/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a> website earlier this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At the fore is a character long known for her quicksilver intellect and violent tendencies, who now steps onto the battlefield with a wicked weave of schemes and strategies to confound her prey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Give it up for the Archon of the Poisoned Tongue — Lady Malys.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/image1-1756899954-a9cqxpnbho-1757597029789.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lady Malys, a brand new model coming to the Dark Eldar. Look familiar? Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Look familiar? If you’re thinking of Shadowheart from Baldur’s Gate 3, then you’re one of many with the same opinion. Ever since Lady Malys was revealed, the conversation around the model has involved comparisons to the much-loved Baldur’s Gate 3 companion, which is as much to do with the similar hairstyle and color and sort of similar facial features as it does her imposing demeanor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on Lady Malys:</p><blockquote>Lady Malys is as deadly with her wit as she is with her slender blades, fighting with a barbed longsword known as the Lady’s Blade and a fan of razor sharp knives. Her knowledge of poisons can render her unit’s attacks even deadlier than usual, and opponents are always caught off guard when Kabalites they thought they had sussed out are suddenly spirited elsewhere before the battle even begins.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It legit is Shadowheart,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Drukhari/comments/1nbofea/comment/nd395l8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Sliversix</a>. “I was just tempted to get her model because of how gorgeous it looks.” “FR.

They should look more like a twisted form of the Eldar, Warhammer 40,000’s space elves, than Eldar in gnarly armor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Am I the only one who feels her face looks wrong for a Drukhari?” asked Perversoris. “Like way too light and closer to Craftworld than Drukhari appearance imho.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Drukhari shouldn’t be cute!!! <a href="https://t.co/STQueb3OQ8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/STQueb3OQ8</a></p>— Marius Gage (@For_Macragge) <a href="https://twitter.com/For_Macragge/status/1965437243721744681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever your take, Drukhari fans are finally having <em>a moment</em> after years spent in the wilderness, looking on enviously at their Space Marine-loving brethren. It’s fair to say the Dark Eldar haven’t been on top of Games Workshop’s to-do list when it comes to new Warhammer 40,000 models, so whenever Lady Malys and co hit store shelves, the Drukhari fandom will have plenty to sink their teeth into.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And perhaps they’ll bring a few Baldur’s Gate 3 players along for the ride. All we need now is a Karlach World Eater...</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">My passion for looter shooters has burned quite brightly for over 15 years and Borderlands is the flame that lit the fuse. With Borderlands 4, Gearbox proves it still knows how to bring the boom. After fizzling somewhat with Borderlands 3, it felt like this series had begun to fall behind in the genre it pioneered, but breaking away from segmented levels and embracing an honest-to-goodness open world allows 2025’s Borderlands to surprise us again. Drastically improved movement makes it one of the best-feeling first-person shooters out there, the story takes a refreshingly grounded approach that pays off, and the expanded buildcrafting options like healing items, throwing knives, and weapon enhancements are all fantastic ideas. But taking these swings also comes with some unfortunate downsides, like how exploration is quite literally held back by invisible walls and awkward surfaces that refuse to be trod upon, not to mention fairly rocky technical performance (at least on the PC version provided for review) and numerous bugs. But those rough <s>edges</s> borders did little to keep me from once again falling head over heels for my first looter-shooter love, and blasting through hordes of psychos with a friend or three feels as awesome as it ever has.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re new to the absolute insanity that is Borderlands, it’s a series where the weird enemies you mow down drop increasingly bizarre weapons that you then use to mow down even weirder enemies in an endless cycle of looting and shooting. How bizarre? It’s stuff like an assault rifle that shoots tiny rockets, can call in an airstrike, and explodes like a grenade when you reload and toss it. Or maybe you’ll luck into a sniper rifle that fires off ammo like a gatling gun and stops consuming ammo while overheated, or a grenade that screams absurd (and occasionally horny) things as it bounces up and down, spewing acid. Borderlands 4 keeps that feeling fresh by continuing to iterate on the silly weapons it gives you, which can cross-pollinate across different weapon manufacturers for even weirder outcomes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other distinctive bit of style that’s set its best games apart from the crowd is that despite always having been filled with lowbrow dick jokes to match its hand-drawn graphic novel look, Borderlands has never been afraid to surprise with sharp turns toward genuinely touching story moments. (Heck, it’s a universe that’s supported a Telltale-made Tales from the Borderlands game and its Gearbox-developed sequel, so it’s not all about run-and-gun action.) Borderlands 3 notably didn’t have a lot of those, though, so it was a relief when this followup finally ditched the original planet of Pandora and many of its legacy characters who’d started to wear out their welcome to tell a completely new tale on a world called Kairos that’s been dominated by a malevolent, brainwashing dictator named the Timekeeper. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 is much more than just a breath of fresh air, bordering on what almost seems like a soft reboot at times. It immediately adds some memorable characters to its cast, like the fancy and charming Levaine, who has a somewhat messy dating history with your fellow Vault Hunters – but then every once in a while it takes a welcome dip back into the nostalgia pool to have Claptrap rattle off a few jokes. (Yes, the sassy little bot is back; love him or hate him, it wouldn’t be Borderlands without him.) With a few neat twists in store and a compelling plot about trying to free this planet, I ended up liking the story quite a bit, even if it doesn’t hit the highs of Borderlands 2 (especially in terms of its iconic villain).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Borderlands 4 is a proper open-world game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the action itself is what you’d expect from this series, but number four (or six, if you count The Pre-Sequel and Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands) makes a number of pretty huge changes that shake up your vault-hunting expedition. The biggest by far is the fact that Borderlands 4 is a proper open-world game (as opposed to the traditional approach of large zones separated by loading screens) that’s filled with side quests, timed activities, collectibles, and puzzles to seek out. You also have a whole bag of tricks to aid you in the exploration of Kairos’ four diverse regions, like a grapple hook that lets you get to areas normally out of reach, a glider to soar over large swaths of land, and a vehicle you can summon on command to zip over hills and through deserts without having to hoof it to a Catch-A-Ride station first. Aside from a very limited few (such as The Division 2 or Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League), fully open-world games are pretty rare in the looter shooter space – none of which are in first-person.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Borderlands Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That might not seem like a big deal at first, but it’s hard to overstate how different this makes Borderlands 4 from its predecessors, not just because you’ve got so many new ways to get around, but because progressing through the story and leveling up your character is so much less linear now. Sometimes I’d spend a few hours just exploring a new region of the map, clearing the fog of war away and completing any activities I encountered along the way, while other times I’d race from place to place, focusing on one part of the main story quest line before pivoting to another part of it in a different region. That story took me about 40 hours to complete, but that was with plenty of distractions, and I’ve spent another 20+ after the credits rolled with lots still left to do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also awesome that you don’t have to worry so much about sticking next to your teammates this time. They can be leagues away doing their own thing, and if they need help with something you can just pull up your map and warp to them instantly. Open-world activities are more diverse than I was expecting as well, and range from proper story-focused side quests to an activity where you have to fix a giant crawler to claim a vehicle upgrade to one where you fight loads of madmen at a drill site to earn some badass loot. The fact that you can do all that free-wheeling exploration and discovery alongside a group of friends in a way that’s never inconvenient makes it that much better and impressive.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Some areas are filled with invisible walls that you’ll unsatisfyingly slap into.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is one major issue with this new open-world philosophy, however, which is that the physical terrain of Kairos doesn’t always rise to the occasion of these free-roaming ambitions. For example, some areas are filled with invisible walls that you’ll unsatisfyingly slap into while you’re trying to glide over a hill or mantle up a ledge. Borderlands has always had issues with its environments being a bit wonky, but it feels so much more noticeable in an open world where you naturally assume you’re meant to explore every nook and cranny, and most games come up with natural barriers like mountains or oceans to make it clear that you can go no farther. Instead, you quickly find the limitations of that exploration and they feel artificial. Although I eventually learned to recognize when a surface was probably not something I was going to be allowed to interact with, it still bums me out that there isn’t just some kind of “out of bounds” warning when going places I wasn’t meant to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One other major area of evolution is combat, which not only has tighter, more responsive gunplay than any Borderlands game before it, but comes packed with a frankly silly number of new movement options that make battles much more dynamic. In addition to the existing ways to get around like running and sliding, you can now double jump, glide, grapple hook, dash in any direction, and even swim (that’s right, water no longer instantly kills you, praise Moxxi). It actually took me quite a while to remember all the new ways I was expected to navigate combat encounters, but with the help of some enemies that smartly push you to make full use of your options, I eventually learned to master them. By the end, I was soaring across the map, dodging attacks like a pro and raining hell down upon my enemies. It became wonderfully satisfying stuff once I got the hang of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has also heaped an impressively high volume of new things to shoot into this game. While other Borderlands sequels reused many of the same enemy types dating back to the 2009 original, Borderlands 4’s change of planetary venue means it has to significantly expand its menagerie. Sure, the masked psychos that serve as the series’ poster boys (they’re like a disturbing version of the Minions from Despicable Me, and they managed to hitch a ride off of Pandora somehow), but there are also little mechanical spiders that reflect all the bullets you send their way when they to spin their legs rapidly, creatures covered in crystals that are immune to damage until you shoot those crystals off and quickly destroy the floating orbs they turn into, and many others that I hadn’t seen before. Those caused me to stop and adapt to their tactics in interesting ways, and that was always a memorable moment.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rest assured, the major bosses usually step up their game pretty noticeably.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even better are the boss fights, which have evolved pretty significantly in that they usually involve some special mechanics you have to learn in order to beat them. These are often pretty simple things, like picking up and throwing a toxic bomb onto one boss to peel his armor off, or having to juggle yourself in the air with grappling and gliding after the floor becomes hazardous for a phase of another fight. Granted, they don’t come close to the mechanical complexity of something you’d find in a Destiny raid, but those are often kind of over-the-top and this is a significant step up from some of the basic “dodge and shoot it until it dies” battles we’ve seen in Borderlands past. It’s a happy medium, and that makes these bosses a lot less forgettable. That’s not to say there aren’t any basic fights, but it’s fair to say that those can be an entertaining excuse to turn off your brain and blast something to bits and serve as a contrast to the ones with an extra element to them. Rest assured, the major bosses usually step up their game pretty noticeably.</p><div id="borderlands-vault-hunters-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also neat that you’ll start encountering enemies with various modifiers as you get further into the adventure and unlock higher difficulty settings via the endgame grind. These might be things like Elemental Eater, an effect that means enemies aren’t just resistant to a specific type of attack but healed by it, or Centripetal, which causes a black hole to form where an enemy with this trait dies, pulling everything in range into its center and dealing massive damage. It’s not all new, groundbreaking stuff for Borderlands – these are similar to effects found in Borderlands 3’s Mayhem Mode, for instance – but they’re now a central part of Borderlands 4, and that makes combat more interesting and has you staying a little more aware even of enemies you’ve seen a lot of already. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One huge pain point, though, is that the full descriptions for each of these modifiers’ effects don’t appear to be listed anywhere, so you’ve just gotta figure them out on your own – or look them up on the guide that IGN’s team is already cooking up for you. I can’t tell you how long I spent accidentally healing a bad guy before realizing I was doing something very wrong, and it would have been nice to have a codex somewhere with more info.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat has you staying a little more aware even of enemies you’ve seen a lot of already.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If the fact that I’ve gone this long without even getting to discussing the entirely new batch of Vault Hunters in Borderlands 4 doesn’t tell you there’s a lot going on here, I don’t know what will. It mostly sticks to tradition, but puts some pretty neat spins on the series’ existing classes. There’s the Siren, Vex, who uses her space magic to deal elemental damage and has some awesome life-stealing options; Rafa, the Exo-Soldier who can summon all sorts of DigiStructed weapons, from shoulder-mounted turrets to melee arm blades (as though Borderlands didn’t have enough weapons already!); Harlowe, a Gravitar with an assortment of gravity-manipulation abilities that can trap enemies in bubbles, among other things; and Amon, a massive, cybernetically enhanced warrior called a Forgeknight, who has a bunch of melee options at his disposal. Each one feels pretty good, with unique tools that make them all viable choices for endgame activities without feeling especially overpowered. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’ve been pretty high on it so far, I do have some complaints to lodge as someone who tends to play this kind of game more than once, and with an eye toward making each of those playthroughs feel distinct.  After a few dozen hours with it, it strikes me that Borderlands 4’s buildcrafting hasn’t pushed this series into the realm of something like Diablo or – dare I say it – Path of Exile, given that there are a few branching paths to choose from in each Vault Hunter’s skill trees that you can then can optimize with gear to excel at a handful of specific things like dealing loads of elemental damage or healing yourself when getting kills, but not enough customization options to really go wild.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the three different trees each character does have each at least add a little bit of variety to how every class can play, meaning more than one person on your team can use the same Vault Hunter while having a different set of buffs and abilities that can make them work well together. For example, for the first half of my playthrough I focused on Vex’s Spectral Summoning tree to deploy ghostly doppelgangers onto the battlefield, but after finding a legendary item that worked well for a different kind of build, I respec’d into the elemental DPS tree that focused on casting powerful spells instead of summoning others to do my bidding. If those two different characters worked together side by side, there’d be little overlap in what they’re bringing to an up-to-four-person team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ah yes, teams! Although Borderlands 4 feels great to play solo as well, for sure the best way to play is when among friends, but those who play together should expect to experience bugs together. The vast majority of my time in Borderlands was spent with friends, and we encountered just about every issue in the online-multiplayer book: lag and desyncing from combat if you’re not the host, enemies sometimes becoming immune to damage or teleporting around the map, and non-host players losing progress or getting locked out of quest lines because something didn’t track properly, just to name a few.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Borderlands 4 is a fairly buggy ride in general.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of this, like the fact that you don’t uncover the map in your own save file while exploring with friends, seems like it might be intentional, but is still deeply annoying and disincentivizes teaming up. Other issues, like equipment-selling vending machines that consistently offered no wares at all for any of us while in co-op, are just head-scratching pains in the neck. There were times when I hit enough issues in succession where it became preferable to just play solo, and others where it created friction when deciding who would be the group’s host because we knew that person would see the fewest problems. That’s definitely not the kind of dynamic you want in your co-op game, and it caused my group no small amount of grief as we discovered the various ways in which things feel not so great when playing together, despite gunplay and synergizing our builds with one another otherwise being really awesome. Granted, some of this is the result of playing a short time before launch and there will certainly be at least a few fixes by the time you play it – but if history is any lesson it will be a minute before all of this is ironed out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing solo is smoother, but there’s no escape from all of the problems because Borderlands 4 is a fairly buggy ride in general. It seems like there are as many bugs as there are guns, and the longer you play the more likely you are to see things like infrequent but severe framerate hitching, or your backpack suddenly deciding you have way less space for equipment than you should until you back out to the menu and reload. Two of my crew even found themselves locked out of the endgame grind when different steps in the questline broke, blocking their progression and making it so we couldn’t run the activities we wanted to do together. It’s a testament to just how fun exploring Kairos is that, even with all of that laundry list, I still couldn’t wait to play more even after dozens of hours. You’ve gotta take these complaints in context.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Borderlands Rankings</h3><p>Borderlands is a series that's always been very dear to my heart, and here's my ranking of them all.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the endgame grind, Borderlands 4 appears to come pre-loaded with one of those (though hey, I said the same thing about Diablo 4 – you can’t call them all right, but I’m feeling optimistic). There are three activities you’re expected to complete weekly: a more challenging version of a story mission that has a bunch of tricky modifiers, like one where all enemies explode into a black hole of damage and another where enemies heal themselves when dealing damage to your team, a repeatable boss fight that mostly just seems like it’s there to give you a straightforward enemy to kill as many times as you’d like for great loot, and a hidden vending machine that moves around each week and sells guaranteed legendary loot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you grind these activities, you’ll also unlock the more advanced world tier difficulties that offer better loot, but these are gatekept behind incredibly challenging quests with loads of modifiers that are the ultimate test of your loadout and shooting skills. At this point, none of these things are particularly deep or time-consuming since you just run them all each week and then are basically done, but even if that’s not your thing there’s still a massive map that has lots of side activities for you to complete out of the “box.” (Are there still boxes?) Beyond that, we have promises that Gearbox has a fairly good track record of delivering on, courtesy of a post-launch roadmap which includes plenty of content on the way. I have a lot of hope that Borderlands 4 will have legs for quite some time.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Borderlands 4 is a badass open-world evolution of a wonderfully unhinged looter-shooter series that needed to try something new, and it largely nails the biggest swings it takes. Combat is slicker than ever thanks to exciting new movement options and some interesting enemy designs, and the entertaining story takes things in a fresh direction while still tying neatly into existing lore. The transition to an open world isn’t the smoothest, especially when troubling terrain with a few too many invisible walls can make it feel like these environments are all for show, but that’s more than worth putting up with in exchange for being able to chart your own path and freely explore the wacky, violent world of Kairos. The bugs my crew and I encountered were bad enough to occasionally sour our co-op groove, but in between them we had a great time, and my friends and I have found ourselves utterly at the mercy of its loot grind. The Borderlands series feels like it has been a bit stuck in the mud for some time now, and especially after a few patches, Borderlands 4 is exactly the kick in the pants it has needed.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-review]]></content:encoded>

These modifiers, which can help or hinder your progress, include Cadia Stands, which makes Imperial Guard soldiers spawn on levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have loved seeing Guardsmen help out in Stratagem mode, which not only increases the sense of epic scale for battles, but also leans on the beloved Cadian Shock Troops — perhaps Warhammer 40,000’s best-known human soldier force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cadia was the setting of one of the most important moments in Warhammer 40,000 history, and the origin of the rousing ‘Cadia Stands’ battle cry. Cadia was destroyed when Abaddon the Despoiler crashed a Blackstone Fortress into the planet during his 13th Black Crusade, causing the planet to tear itself apart, and triggering the expansion of the Eye of Terror into the Great Rift, which split the Imperium. The destruction of the ancient Necron pylons on Cadia, which had kept the Eye of Terror stable, unleashed raw warp energy into real space, dooming the planet and reshaping the galaxy. The Warhammer 40,000 setting has spent recent years dealing with the fallout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, Warhammer 40,000 fans love a plucky Cadian, especially while stomping around as a Space Marine. Therefore, when patch 10 introduced a quite wonderful bug that saw a Cadian soldier sometimes attract the attention of a monstrous Trygon Prime (one of the toughest Tyranid enemies in the game) to the point of obsession, Space Marine 2 players absolutely loved it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some wonderful clips showing how Cadians were able to lead the Trygon Prime to its doom simply by attracting its attention, perhaps causing it to fall to its doom as in the clip below. Cadia stands, after all!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, no more.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/invert-controls-horizontal-x-axis</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ok-but-who-is-inverting-their-horizontal-controls.1294767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we talk about inverted controls for video games, we’re usually talking about the way the camera moves vertically, called the y-axis. We talk about how the screen should move when the right thumbstick moves up and down. If you’re an inverted y-axis person, like me, you’re expecting the camera to tilt up when you push the thumbstick down—as if the camera is being controlled from the back. People who <em>don’t</em> invert the y-axis expect the opposite: If you push the thumbstick down, you expect the camera to look down, as if the front of the camera is being controlled. My former Polygon colleague Jeffrey Parkin has a great piece—and survey—about this, called “<a href="https://medium.com/@parkinjc/the-right-and-wrong-of-the-right-thumbstick-3bfea3a95024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The right and wrong of the right thumbstick</a>.”</p><p>As an inverted y-axis person, I’m always digging through video game menus to change the camera settings. I’m also an idiot, and sometimes I forget if the y-axis is vertical or horizontal, and I ended up switching the x-axis inversion instead. It’s always exceptionally jarring; though my brain expects the y-axis to work as if there’s a joystick on the back of a character’s head, I can’t wrap my head around the x-axis inversion. What’s even worse is that I <em>can</em> imagine it if I’m visualizing a joystick on the back of my own head—I “push” the stick to the left and I turn my head right. But when I’m playing a video game, my brain shuts down. When I push the stick to the left in the video game, I expect the game to show me what’s left of my character’s vision.</p><p>It scrambles my brain so much that I simply don’t understand how <em>anyone</em> can use a controller with x-axis controls inverted. I expect that some people may feel this way about me and the y-axis.</p><p>There’s not a ton of research into the x-axis, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12185817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but researchers are starting to look into why y-axis inversion</a> is a thing for video game players. From MIT researcher Jennifer Corbett and Northeastern University researcher Jaap Munneke’s 2025 paper “<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12185817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why axis inversion?</a>:”</p><blockquote><p>The debate over y-axis inversion has persisted, likely due to individual differences and varying gaming experiences. Importantly, multiple literatures in human factors, ergonomics, cognitive science, industry, and medicine all touch on issues relevant to y-axis inversion preferences. However, discrepant or even contradictory terminologies and discordant dissemination methods impede a unified view of the overarching problem space. A clearer cross-disciplinary understanding of the factors underlying inversion preference can serve as a starting point for future empirical investigations in a variety of situations.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>For now, we can simply look to history for a reason for seemingly rare x-axis users. (Corbett and Munneke wrote in their paper that “there were very few participants [in their survey] who inverted the x-axis.” Through my own research, there’s more people online confused by the x-axis inversionists, though they certainly do exist.) It could come down to the sorts of games you play—or grew up playing. A bunch of generational hits, like Kingdom Hearts games, <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, and <em>Super Mario 64</em>, forced players into using x-axis inverted controls—at least to start. Both <em>The Wind Waker</em> and <em>Super Mario 64</em> use a free camera system, so you can think of the perspective as being filmed through a camera on a tripod or gimbal. When you rotate the camera tripod arm to the left, the camera turns to the right, which can explain the reasoning the developers had for building the games this way. Nintendo even used this sort of reasoning in its game manuals to explain the free camera system. You’re playing the game, yes, but you’re actually “filming” Mario as the Lakitu Bros., who fly around a cloud with a camera attached to a fishing pole. For the Lakitu Bros.’ camera to film something to the right, the fishing pole would be moved to the left. <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> works this way, too.</p><p>A lot of GameCube games were actually using this method for their cameras, but it seemingly fell off as a standard option by the time Halo was all the rage on Xbox consoles. The first-person perspective made the “camera” perspective feel much too abstract; people expected to push the stick to the left to see to the left, as if they’re pointing their eyes.</p><p>Of course, <em>a lot</em> of people played Nintendo’s early inverted games—and x-axis inverted games from other developers—but my hypothesis for why it didn’t stick around as a default is in how controllers evolved. GameCube controllers controlled the camera by using buttons and not two thumbsticks. Parkin talks about this in his survey piece, as well as about muscle memory: If you play a lot of games, there are just certain things you expect a controller to do. That muscle memory could be easier to override because of the disconnect between the way a camera moves when using buttons or thumbsticks. There could be enough of a gap there to create space for a different expectation, making it easier to "remap" what a button does in your head, regardless of the game's genre.</p><p>I asked people on BlueSky to weigh in, and one person, indeed, responded that they got used to x-axis inversion in <em>Sly</em> and <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> on the PlayStation 2. “Ended up creating a psychological association with ‘3D platfomer’ and ‘horizontal inversion,’” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scubaprison.bsky.social/post/3lye2bh6if22b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they said</a>. Another person added that the first game they played with x-axis inversion was <em>Super Mario 64</em>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aimelle.bsky.social/post/3lye67meu6k2h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but that they’re able to change their perspective</a> when playing first-person shooters.</p><p>Most games offer y-axis inversion these days, but x-axis inversion has become obscure enough that some games don’t offer the option. <em>Alan Wake 2</em> was released recently with only the option to invert the y-axis, something that was so painful to horizontal invert players that someone permanently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Controller/comments/1e7iayj/how_to_mod_your_ps5xbox_controller_to_permanently/?share_id=6LmSfGavRnr1-1-qCX2rv&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modded their PlayStation 5 controller by rewiring the analog stick to be x-axis inverted</a>. However, <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/the-anniversary-update-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remedy did end up adding the feature in</a>—something it called “one of the most requested” pieces of the Anniversary Update. “Inverting either axis can be a matter of preference, but for a lot of players it also presents a usability and accessibility issue,” it said. Options are good!</p><p>The statement is confusing, because that implies that a lot of people play in the shadows with the x-axis inverted. Where are you folks? Tell me what got you into it. How does your brain see the camera and screen? Let’s figure out the science behind it, and learn why y-axis inversion doesn’t mean x-axis inversion will click.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/unikat-32-33-indie-games-publisher-marketing"><h3>Running A Video Games Publisher AND Marketing Agency Sounds Absolutely Exhausting</h3></a><p>'Seeing all of your different efforts, ones that are synced by the work of many people, all being unveiled at once is a cool feeling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-author-immortal-image-comics-interview"><h3>The Author Immortal Is A Metanarrative Isekai Comic That Explores The Messiness Of Separating The Art From The Artist</h3></a><p>Amid canceled creators, cultural reckonings, and A.I.’s rise, Frank Barbiere and Morgan Beem’s new Image Comics series invites readers to reclaim fantasy and confront who stories truly serve

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/">Gamesfray</a> spotted that as of last week, Nintendo had secured <a href="https://archive.org/details/12403397">US Patent 12,403,397</a>, a patent that protects the game mechanic of "<em>causing a sub-character to appear</em>," or in other words, summoning a character, and "<em>controlling a battle between the sub-character and the enemy character</em>." Which is a long way of describing a classic Pokémon battle. You could also call it another patent in Nintendo's arsenal in its legal battle against <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/">Palworld maker, PocketPair</a>.</p>



<p>It's also not the only patent that Nintendo has acquired, as it also secured <a href="https://archive.org/details/12409387">US Patent 12,409,387</a>, which protects mechanics around player characters riding other in-game "<em>objects</em>," which is another patent that fits right in its fight against PocketPair and Palworld.</p>



<p>No matter who is doing it, whether it's Nintendo, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Warner Bros.</a>, or any other entity, it's never great to see videogame companies patent game mechanics. But according to IP and patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon, these latest patents go beyond the general level of ire that patenting game mechanics causes players. Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/an-embarrassing-failure-of-the-us-patent-system-videogame-ip-lawyer-says-nintendos-latest-patents-on-pokemon-mechanics-should-not-have-happened-full-stop/">PC Gamer</a>, Sigmon doesn't mince words, saying, "<em>Broadly, I don't disagree with the many online complaints about these Nintendo patents</em>. <em>They have been an embarrassing failure of the US patent system</em>."</p>



<p>For Sigmon, it's not just the content of the patents and what they protect, it's how little of a fight the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) put up against Nintendo when it came to questioning and scrutinizing these patents. </p>



<p>"<em>This seems like a situation where the USPTO essentially gave up and just allowed the case, assuming that the claims were narrow or specific enough to be new without evaluating them too closely</em>. <em>I strongly disagree with this result: In my view, these claims were in no way allowable</em>...<em>This allowance should not have happened, full stop.</em>"</p>

			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>An obvious issue with these patents that Sigmon also points out is that they don't just apply to Nintendo's fight with PocketPair. They can apply to scores of other games, and give large companies with deep legal departments too much power to threaten whoever they want whenever they see fit. For Sigmon, it's a warping of the patent system that he still believes in.</p>



<p>"<em>The USPTO dropped the ball big time, and it's going to externalize a lot of uncertainty (and, potentially, litigation cost) onto developers and companies that do not deserve it</em>...<em>They were not made to allow a big player to game the system, get an overly broad patent that they should have never received in the first place, and then go around bullying would-be competition with the threat of a legally questionable lawsuit.</em>"</p>



<p>Securing patents that it could turn around and claim PocketPair is infringing on is right in-line with the 'hail mary' tactics Nintendo has been trying with its lawsuit against PocketPair and Palworld. This past July, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">reports surfaced of Nintendo adjusting existing patents</a> to better align with its arguments against PocketPair.</p>



<p>As Sigmon points out, the most terrifying aspect of these patents is the precedent they set. It could be that these patents are rolled back if an Inter Partes Review case is successfully heard. But with how easily these patents went through, it doesn't seem worth it to put stock in the USPTO going through patents like this with a fine-tooth comb.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Future Far Cry Games Will Focus Much More on Multiplayer, Ubisoft Says]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-multiplayer-ubisoft</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/future-far-cry-games-will-focus-much-more-on-multiplayer-ubisoft-says.1294746/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has revealed that future&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>games will likely have much more of a multiplayer focus, and he says the shift is to ensure longevity.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-will-more-predominantly-push-multiplayer-in-future/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Guillemot spoke about the future of the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series during the New Global Sport Conference in Saudi Arabia, at which he was asked about what was next for the first-person shooter franchise.</p>

<p>In response to that question, Guillemot said that the goal for the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series is to "bring the multiplayer aspects more predominantly pushed" so that the franchise and its games "can also be played for a long time by players".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/far-cry-multiplayer-focus-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=H7i_L6Oq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/far-cry-multiplayer-focus-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=46PqyLwy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Future&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>games will foreground multiplayer to a much greater degree.</figcaption></figure><p>According to VGC, Guillemot's comments echo rumors that&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7&nbsp;</em>is being developed in conjunction with a standalone multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>game, which the publication says will be an "extraction-based shooter set in the Alaskan wilderness".</p>

<p>The last game in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-6-release-date-revealed-for-late-2021" rel="nofollow">launched almost four years ago</a>. Ubisoft hasn't announced exact sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 6</em>, but in its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/7FRH9Pjch7t9yXb4GMFgi0/db479fa1ae07fc5264f8b16e1d7a15f8/Ubisoft_FY22_Earnings_PR_English_Final.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2021-22 financial report</a>, the studio claimed the game was behind the series' "best year ever".</p>

<p>Of course, given Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">recent</a> financial <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">woes</a>, it stands to reason that the company would want to shore up sales for its major brands as much as possible, but whether shifting to multiplayer will work that magic for&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>franchise has yet to be officially announced by Ubisoft, but in December last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rumors suggested</a> that the game had been internally pushed from a 2025 release window to 2026, so it may be some time before we hear from the series again.</p>




<p>If Guillemot's comments are to be believed, then it's likely that when&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7&nbsp;</em>does arrive, it'll push its multiplayer aspect much more prominently, so you might want to grab a friend or two to play it with. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is out now. Our Borderlands 4 review is not, because we have only just been sent a review code. I fear I was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">unduly forgiving of Team Cherry</a> last week for not supplying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> code before release - they're a cute, tiny indie, after all, albeit a cute, tiny indie with the power to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-has-murdered-steam">break Steam</a> - so let's take a firmer stance this time: bad! Wrong! Don't you know you're suffocating games journalism, Gearbox and 2K Games, you swaggering chancers? Whither accountability and transparency in a time of choosy PR departments? 
</p>
<p>I should teach you all a lesson by diverting your brand power and googlejuice towards some other game instead. I think I will, actually. What else is on sale today. Ah yes, Try To Drive.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Try To Drive (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3621700/Try_To_Drive/">Steam page</a>) is one of those daft multiplayer games that trades on co-op partners repeatedly sabotaging each other. In this case, it's a tandem simulator, a tandem being a bicycle for two people.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Red Core Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Doesn't sound nearly as arduous upfront as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">climbing out of hell</a> while shackled to Nic "We Can Jump Those Lasers" Reuben and Brendan "My Left Not Your Left" Caldwell, but you will not be cycling down any ordinary roads in Try To Drive. You will be cycling along chains of floating biscuits pooped out by gingerbread men. You will be ponderously T-bogging your way over precarious glass accordions.
</p><p>I actually have some firsthand expertise to bring to bear, here, based on sharing a tandem with my life partner. The trick is to put the one with the biggest bum in front. No, I am not going to tell you whether I have a bigger bum than my partner - don't be uncouth. My other top tip is to put a mirror on your handlebar so you can check whether the other rider is goofing off.
</p>
<p>I have run out of tandem expertise to share, so let's circle grudgingly back to Borderlands 4, the game that murdered journalism. My big takeaway from the previewage so far is that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-wont-be-making-jokes-every-minute-because-its-set-in-a-totalitarian-world">won't be as jokey as the other Borderlands games</a>, apparently because it's set in a totalitarian world, and they want to set a grimmer tone. 
</p>
<p>As some of you noted at the time of that linked report, the idea that humour isn't seemly in this context seems absurd, given that past Borderlands games have already seen us battling against odious corporate bosses and tyrants, while rattling through gags like ammo belts. That said, I do think Borderlands in general could benefit from being less punchline-driven.
</p>
<p>Beyond that, I can tell you only that they want <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-cutting-the-gags-borderlands-4s-pc-specs-say-it-still-needs-100gb-of-ssd-space">100GB</a> of SSD space for the pleasure, and they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-shows-hes-capable-of-not-being-an-idiot-about-borderlands-4-prices-raising-questions-about-previous-insistence-on-being-an-idiot">pondering an $80 price tag</a> at one point. If you're hungry for more, I will grit my teeth and suggest that you cast your eye over <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/borderlands-4-review/">this review from Very Gary Computing</a>. They <em>did</em> get code, possibly because they didn't call the studio boss an idiot in any of their news coverage.
</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

              <p>The streaming wars are over and with them the era of cheap, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-ps-plus-disney-netflix-spotify-price-cancel-1850848468">buffet-style content delivery systems</a> is coming to an end. Prices are getting jacked up. Subscribers are getting nickel-and-dimed. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav is here to promise you that HBO Max will be doing this too.</p> <p>“We haven’t been pushing on the password sharing and the economics yet,” the cosmic-brained exec told other rich people at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology conference this week, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/why-hbo-max-password-sharing-crackdown-1236514152/">per <em>Variety</em></a>. “People are really starting to love HBO Max. That’s the key. We want them to fall in love with our content, with our series, with the differentiated offering outside the U.S. and then over time, it’s a little tricky, with the password sharing, we’re going to begin to push on that.”</p> <p>You can tell Zaslav loves his job because he talks about locating the optimal pricing strategy for other people’s creative output like he’s searching for the G-spot on a P&amp;L spreadsheet. Warner Bros. announced last month that it would soon start aggressively monitoring HBO subscribers’ accounts to make sure they weren’t letting friends and family mooch off them. But the password sharing crackdown isn’t the only thing coming to the home of <em>The Last Of Us</em> and<em> Peacemaker</em>.</p>

 <p>He continued, “I think our ability to raise price as people become more and more in love with the quality that we have and the series that we have and the offering that we have will have a real ability because I think the pricing across the board—not only is there too many players, in order to stay alive, a lot of the players have just decided to drop prices aggressively.”</p> <p>HBO Max’s first major price hike came in 2023 when the main plan <a href="https://www.avclub.com/hbo-max-subscription-price-increase-1849980303">went from&nbsp;$15 to $16 a month</a>. The following year prices went up again as the plans splintered, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/max-price-increase-hike-1236024561/">with the Ultimate tier rising to $21 a month</a>. HBO became HBO Max in 2020, then just Max in 2023, and then went back to HBO Max earlier this year. During that same period Zaslav saw the disastrous merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery that led to tons of debt and massive gutting of content at, among other places, HBO. Now Warner Bros. and Discovery will split up again by April 2026 as the stock price hovers below $20, down from a peak in 2021 of over $70.</p>

 <p>Big “my job here is done” energy from the guy awarded $50 million last year in total compensation for shuffling logos around on a whiteboard. Except we now know his job won’t truly be done until he jacks up HBO prices a few more times. Next year sees the arrival of a new <em>Game of Thrones</em> spin-off,<em> A</em> <em>Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em>, and the <em>Green Lantern</em> detective show, followed by the <em>Harry Potter</em> reboot in 2027.</p> <p>“I think we want a good deal for consumers,” Zaslav said this week, “but I think over time, there’s real opportunity, particularly for us, in that quality area, to raise price.”</p>

            <p>Françoise Cadol, the actor who voiced the French version of Lara Croft in all of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a> from their inception to 2008, is taking legal action against Aspyr Media for the apparent AI-generated use of her voice in the Tomb Raider 4-6 remasters.</p>
<p>Cadol told <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/cinema/cest-une-trahison-quand-lia-vole-la-voix-francaise-dangelina-jolie-pour-tomb-raider-10-09-2025-63HIGMNMEZBSFLELCKNN4S5I2M.php">French newspaper Le Parisien</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-ai-voice-generation-france-francoise-cadol-cease-and-desist/">The Gamer</a>) that Aspyr Media generated lines of dialogue using her voice without asking her or even notifying her. She has reportedly issued Aspyr a cease and desist demand.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BastienDruker/status/1956361274515743015">Examples of the allegedly AI-generated voice lines</a> were shared on social media, and in them you can clearly hear the difference between the original Tomb Raider games and the recently remastered ones. A much more robotic reading of the lines suddenly takes over part-way through the remastered dialogue.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="fr"><p>🇫🇷 ALERTE INFO — Le patch des remasters de Tomb Raider IV, V et VI par <a href="https://twitter.com/AspyrMedia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AspyrMedia</a> vient de sortir…</p><p>Mauvaise surprise pour les fans français de Lara Croft, certaines répliques de Françoise Cadol dans le tutoriel ont été refaites avec l’IA et ça s’entend ! <a href="https://t.co/YRbZsY669H">pic.twitter.com/YRbZsY669H</a></p></div>— Bastien D.

<p>Cadol, who has regularly dubbed for high-profile actors like Angelina Jolie, including dubbing her performance in the 2001 Tomb Raider film, was alerted to the recording discrepancies by French Tomb Raider fans. Speaking to Le Parisien, Cadol said the use of AI here was a "betrayal" of their support.</p><p>"It's a game, my voice accompanies the gamers, we play together," Cadol said in a translation of the article. "Tomb Raider has been followed by a lot of people over the years, for them, it's a betrayal, a total disrespect. They are angry."</p>
<p>Alarmingly, this isn't the only example of AI-generated voice work in the game. Brazilian actor Lene Bastos was also told by fans that her voice seemed to have been AI-generated in the remasters, and she decided to speak out about it. This prompted a reply - and apology - from Aspyr. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOMNDrFj8R9/?hl=en-gb">Bastos explains in an Instagram video</a> that Aspyr promised to remove the AI-generated lines in an update in a few weeks.</p>
<p>It's unclear if Aspyr has contacted Cadol and said the same. We've requested comment from Aspyr.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-entire-french-cast-of-voice-actors-risk-jobs-in-ai-dispute">the entire French cast of multiplayer shooter Apex Legends refused to sign an agreement allowing their voices to train generative AI</a> for the game.</p>
<p>"We are asked to give up our expertise to train the generative AI that will replace us tomorrow," commented Pascale Chemin at the time, the French voice of Wraith in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. "We are asked to agree to what we specifically fight against. We are asked to shoot ourselves in the foot. We are asked to support AI."</p>

<p>Don't get your Robotniks in a twist</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sega has dropped some details regarding the demo for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>
<p>As you'll no doubt already be aware, a demo for the game was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/sonic-racing-crossworlds-scores-free-single-player-demo-this-month">confirmed a little while back</a>, and we have also had a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/reminder-sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test-for-switch-is-now-live">stress test available to try out</a> for a little bit. Now, though, starting on the dates compiled below, the game's official demo will be available to play for Switch 1 owners:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 9pm (Tue) PDT / 10pm (Tue) MDT / 11pm (Tue) CDT / 12am EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 5am BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 6am CEST / 7am EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 1pm JST / 12pm AWST / 2pm AEST</li></ul>


<p>Not too long to go now until we get a proper shot at what looks like a game which could give the ever-dominant Mario a run for his money on the karting front. Maybe. So long as it runs ok! We'll find out on 25th September.</p>
<p>Of course, the Switch 2 version of the game is still set for a "holiday 2025" digital release date (physical fans gotta hold out until early 2026), so stay tuned to Nintendo Life for exact dates when they drop.</p>

<p><em>Will you be jumping into the demo for Sonic Racing: Crossworlds next week? Played the stress test and have any impressions? Make sure to let us know!</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-is-getting-an-exact-amount-v-bucks-option-next-month.1294707/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced that you'll soon be able to buy exact amounts of V-Bucks in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, so if you want something that's 500 V-Bucks but you've only got 400, you won't need to buy hundreds more to make up the difference.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/new-v-bucks-exact-amount-purchasing-offer-in-fortnite?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the game's official website, Epic confirms that this feature is coming on October 14th, and that it'll be available not only in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, but also in&nbsp;<em>Rocket League&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Fall Guys&nbsp;</i>as well.</p>

<p>There's a catch, though: you won't be able to take advantage of this feature on PlayStation. It'll be available on every other platform, though, so presumably, thanks to the wonders of cross-progression, you can just play somewhere else, top up your account, then head back to PlayStation to enjoy your spoils.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-v-bucks-exact-amount-window.jpg?itok=doI5o5o0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-v-bucks-exact-amount-window.jpg?itok=11tTQtza 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is getting an Exact Amount button for V-Bucks purchases.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also take advantage of the new Exact Amount offer on the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>web shop, so even if you don't have another platform to hand, you can grab your V-Bucks there if you'd prefer to top up with just what you need.</p>

<p>Although the PlayStation limitation will be frustrating for those playing on that platform, Epic says it'll "work to make [the new feature] available everywhere", so you may see the option appearing on PlayStation in future as well.</p>

<p>Exact Amount offers will be available "in increments of 50" for&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em>'s in-game currencies, while in&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>, increments of 100 will be available, with balances being rounded up to the nearest 100. Epic says this is being done in order to "align with item prices".</p>

<p>News of this latest&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>feature follows the revelation back in July that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-uk-cma" rel="nofollow">may never return to iOS in the UK</a> thanks to decisions made by the country's CMA regulatory body, although the game did make its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">triumphant return to the US App Store back in May</a>.</p>

<p>You can do that, and a lot more besides, in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>for free right now on...well, on pretty much every platform going, although you may want to avoid PlayStation if you're looking to use the new Exact Amount feature.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-streams-xbox-games-for-a-steal-no-pricey-console-needed-2000624771</link>

              <p>With an Amazon Fire TV Stick, you can turn any TV into a smart TV. That was the original selling point anyway, but at this point you’d have to try pretty hard to find a TV out there that doesn’t support smart features. The really selling point now is the Fire TV ecosystem and interface. Some television UIs are significantly worse that others. I’m looking at you LG with your wannabe Wiimote remotes.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4050/"> Anyway, right now you can save a solid 40% on the latest Amaozn Fire TV Stick 4K.</a> It normally is priced at $50, but that discounts brings it down by $20 to just $30 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Stream all your favorite movies and shows through popular streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max (or whatever it is they’re calling that one this week). You can access the individual catalogues of those apps with their subscriptions, but there’s also a ton of free content your can enjoy right on the Fire TV. Access free movies and TV show epiusods via a number of ad-supported apps such as Amazon Freevee, Tubi, Pluto TV, and the various Fire TV channels.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4050/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Alexa remote makes searching for what to watch super easy. Typing with a directional pad with an on-screen keyboard is tedious. With the Alexa-remote, just hold the button down and say the movie name and be brought right to it. It even searches through the libraries of apps like Netflix and Disney+ to direct you to which app has what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>4K video contains a lot of data, so the Fire TV Stick 4K has been made to be compatible with Wi-Fi 6. Support for faster internet speeds helps ensure super smooth streaming, even when you have a number of other devices connected to and actively using your router. This is the newest model Fire TV Stick 4K and that Wi-Fi 6 support is really the biggest enhancement over the previous model.</p>



<h2>Play Games From the Cloud</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4050/">One of the bonuses you get with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription these days is cloud streaming support.</a> You no longer actually need an Xbox to play Xbox games. You can stream them to you PC or laptop or, yes, even your Fire Stick. The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4 supports streaming games ranging from indie-darlings like last year’s brain-wrinkling Metroidvainia <em>Animal Well</em> to darling Indies like Bethesda’s first-person action-adventure&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>.</p>
<p>If you live in an area with stable enough internet, you can get a pretty seamless experience playing games just streaming them from the cloud. And with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you’ll gain access to hundreds of awesome titles to keep you entertained for the foreseeable future.</p>
