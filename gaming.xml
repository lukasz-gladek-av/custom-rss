		<p>For all the years of build up and anticipation, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/starfield">Starfield’s</a> launch last September didn’t exactly set the world alight. It took a bold step into sci-fi with its interstellar adventure, but felt like it didn’t quite explore its galaxy of possibilities as fully as it could have done. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/starfield-shattered-space-dlc-revealed-coming-to-xbox-and-pc-later-this-year/">Launching on 30th September, Starfield: Shattered Space</a>, the first big expansion for the game, looks set to take one of the dangling threads of potential and head down a dark and twisted rabbit hole.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield: Official REV-8 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rA1z1DbA_Io?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout the version of Starfield that shipped, you can see the vestigial remnants of some of the many gameplay experiments and ideas that Bethesda explored through the game’s eight years of development. Some remain as gameplay elements with little meaningful purpose, like building bases to refine fuel for space travel that was eventually made practically limitless, while others were left as dangling threads waiting to be revisited, like House Va’ruun.</p>


<p>This bunch of fanatical space serpent worshippers were easily one of the most enigmatic aspects of the main game. Ostensibly one of the biggest factions in the Settled Systems, alongside the United Colonies and FreeStar Collective, they were almost nowhere to be seen, outside of historical context and having Andreja as one of your possible companions. The presence of Va’ruun’kai, their homeworld, was kept a closely guarded secret as they retreated into isolation.</p>
<p>Also weird as heck experiments. Shattered Space reveals the location of Va’ruun’kai and the capital city of Dazra in the wake of a reality tearing experiment by their leading scientists, with extra-dimensional beings flooding through.</p>


<p>Va’ruun’kai promises to be a dark and unsettling locale to explore, the planet shrouded in deep, dark reds and purples from its sky that lend it a deeply ominous tone, while Dazra itself has been engulfed in a spatial anomaly and surrounded by a suspended explosion. Still, Dazra is basically the one safe place left on the planet, with the Va’ruun evacuating other settlements and places from across the planet to reach its relative safety.</p>
<p>House Va’ruun is threatened on all sides, the most eye-catching being the enemies that can burst out from another reality, whether they’re new long-limbed bugs or humanoids that are reminiscent of Spider-Man villain Mister Negative or Destiny’s Taken. There’s the potential to explore some real cosmic horrors through this rend in time and space that they’ve created, especially if Bethesda choose to reveal more about the Great Serpent itself.</p>

<p>While the trailers look to lean in on the horror aspect, I’m not sure the expansion will really be all that terrifying. Battling these enemies, Bethesda is pushing the combat in a subtly different direction that might ramp up the pressure and challenge you in different ways. There could be more zero-G battles, you’ll have more hostiles to deal with when exploring the wider surface of Va’ruun’kai and you’ll probably want the Rev-8 to help outrun things, but also there’s a shifting emphasis on enemies that will bullrush you and try to get within melee range. If you went through the main game hunkering down behind cover constantly, that might no longer be an option in Shattered Space as you’re pushed to stay mobile and make use of the jet pack.</p>
<p>However, just as impactful to this expansion will be the threats to House Va’ruun from within. There’s a power vacuum at the top of this space empire and all of the sub-factions and lesser figures are vying to step up to the big time. You’ll no doubt have a hand in deciding you gets to lead House Va’ruun into the future, and there will no doubt be the full gamut of reasonable leaders and full-on galaxy destroying nutters.</p>

<p>With the galaxy of systems and planets already generated, Bethesda’s expansions to Starfield can take on a much more hand-crafted approach. Shattered Space is the first fruits of this labour, building within this established framework to expand the universe narrative and make this a game worth revisiting.</p>

			<p>After months of silence, <a href="https://wccftech.com/suikoden-iii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-announced-for-pc-and-consoles/">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars</a> has finally resurfaced, and with a final release date to boot.</p>
<p>In today's Nintendo Partner Direct, it has been confirmed that the collection featuring the first two entries in the beloved JRPG series by Konami will be released on March 6th on Nintendo Switch. Konami has yet to confirm the release date for PC and PlayStation consoles, but it will likely be the same as the Nintendo Switch release. A new trailer showcasing some of the remasters' features was also shared online, and you can find it below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Suikoden I&amp;II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4m7YHLlDq40?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As showcased in the trailer above, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars will come with plenty of improvements over the original releases, such as enhanced visuals featuring pixel sprites and environments with new screen effects and shadow animations, redone character portraits and more. The two games will both receive some gameplay improvements and new quality-of-life features such as a dialogue log, auto-battle, the ability to speed up battles, and more. For the rest, it will be the same classic JRPGs that fans have come to love. The second game, in particular, is considered by many the best entry in the series and one of the best JRPGs ever released, thanks to its excellent story and gameplay.</p>
<p>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars launches on March 6th on Nintendo Switch. The game should be released on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles on the same day.</p>

<h3><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>sure does look pretty</h3>

You'll be able to play two remastered&nbsp;<em>MySims&nbsp;</em>games on Switch on November 19th.</p>
<h3><em>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2&nbsp;</em>jumpscares its way to Switch this holiday</h3>

      </div>
<p>Lego Horizon Adventures is co-developed by Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo, and will launch on Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC. There is no word yet on an Xbox release for the game.</p><p>Lego Horizon Adventures re-tells the general story of Horizon, which follows the hero Aloy and her life in a harsh and unforgiving world full of dinosaur-like machine creatures. The game supports solo play or co-op locally and online.</p><p>Horizon is just the latest franchise to be adapted for a Lego game, following the likes of Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, and Marvel.</p><p>As for the Horizon game series, no new entries have been announced, though a multiplayer title is said to be in the works. Beyond that, a live-action TV show based on the franchise was announced for Netflix but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-horizon-live-action-series-reportedly-not-moving-forward/1100-6524712/" data-ref-id="1100-6524712">may no longer be moving ahead.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Usually, video game consoles get cheaper as the years pass by. But that's not the case for the PS5 in Japan. In fact, Sony is about to raise the price for both PS5 models there by 13,000 yen on September 2, which is roughly about $90 in the US.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1828334413110820877?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, The Verge senior reporter Tom Warren highlighted the price hike for the PS5 in Japan. He also pointed out that this will be the third time Sony has raised the price for the system in Japan since the PS5 launched in late 2020.</p><p dir="ltr">For instance, almost exactly two years ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-price-increasing-in-europe-canada-and-more/1100-6506882/" data-ref-id="1100-6506882">Sony increased the price for PS5 in a lot of regions outside the US</a>, including Japan. Sony cited global inflation and adverse currency trends as the reasons behind the price hikes at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-hardware-sales-are-on-the-decline-but-sony-is-still-looking-healthy/1100-6525590/" data-ref-id="1100-6525590">Sony revealed that PS5 hardware sales were down</a> about 27% year over year for the company's first quarter of fiscal year 2024--April 1 to June 30. Lifetime sales of PS5 have surpassed 60 million systems.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, a new report says <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-coming-this-year-could-be-600-playstation-showcase-in-september-report/1100-6526118/" data-ref-id="1100-6526118">a PS5 Pro could be coming this year and cost $600</a>. The expected release date for the new system would be October or November, and the price could go as high as $700.</p>

		<p>Yakuza Kiwami, the 2016/17 remake of the PS2 classic, is coming to Nintendo Switch on 24th October 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yakuza Kiwami – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 8.27.2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fa4LtKgIVtA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first game in the long-running Japanese crime thriller series (though not the earliest story told in the series, which would be the prequel Yakuza 0), Yakuza Kiwami sees the iconic protagonist Kazuma Kiryu come out of prison 10 years after taking the fall for a murder, and then being dropped right back into the battle between yakuza clans.</p>
<p>There’s an epic story to be told here, but this is also a dense open world that’s full of things to see and do. Kamurocho, a fictional district of Tokyo based on the real-life Kabukichō district is a haven for side missions, mini-games and random enemy encounters.</p>
<p>Bringing the series to the Nintendo Switch for the first time is a pretty great move by RGG Studio and Sega, though we’ll have to wait and see how the game handles the jump to the low powered system. The game did originally launch for PS3 and PS4 in Japan in 2016, though only the PS4 version was localised for other regions. There’s other great places to play this, including Xbox consoles, PC and even PC handhelds… but there’s also just something to the Switch and its relatively light handheld form that will surely appeal.</p>

		<p>The beloved Coffee Talk visual novel series will carry on with Coffee Talk Tokyo, coming to Nintendo Switch in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Coffee Talk Tokyo – Indie World Showcase 8.27.2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ae4dp4ZKREo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Coffee Talk team at Toge Production – represented by AJ and Dio in the announcement – is carrying on the legacy of co-creator and writer Mohammad Fahmi Hasni, who sadly passed away in early 2022. They’ve reunited with co-writer of Episode 2, Anna Winterstein of Chorus, and Kimitaka Ogawa, writer and English-to-Japanese translator who localised the originals.</p>
<p>Combined, they are producing Coffee Talk Tokyo, bringing a more Japanese flavour to the game with things like a matcha latte, while listening to the stories of&nbsp;love, loss, joy and sadness that your patrons share.</p>

A new bundle featuring revamped versions of EA’s <em>MySims</em> and <em>MySims</em> <em>Kingdom </em>will<em> </em>revive the classic simulation titles with Switch-optimized controls and updated textures.</p><p>If you’ve never played <em>MySims</em>, it’s sort of like a cross between <em>The Sims</em> and <em>Animal Crossing</em>. In the mainline game, you’re tasked with rebuilding a run-down town by procuring blueprints, constructing houses, and making furniture to attract new residents. Each character has their own unique characteristics, like the bug-loving <a href="https://mysims.fandom.com/wiki/Gertrude_Spackle">Gertrude Spackle</a> and <a href="https://mysims.fandom.com/wiki/Yuki">Yuki</a>, who often threatens to bite your face for some reason.</p><p><em>MySims</em> launched on the Wii and Nintendo DS in 2007 before arriving on PC and Blackberry. <em>MySims Kingdom</em>, which switches up the original gameplay by putting you inside a royal setting, launched on the Wii and Nintendo DS a year later.

I just kind of wish EA created a new entry with refreshed stories and characters specifically for the Switch, instead of simply remastering the old games. But, hey, maybe that will happen down the line. There’s been a lot going on with <em>The Sims</em> franchise as of late — along with <em>MySims</em>, EA is also working on a new free-to-play <em>Sims</em> game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870172/project-rene-next-gen-sims-free">codenamed Project Rene</a>. </p><div><p><em>MySims: Cozy Bundle</em> launches on the Nintendo Switch on November 19th for $39.99, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fmysims-cozy-bundle-switch%2F">preorders are available starting today</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I find it bizarre that people still really like Crash Bandicoot games in this, the year 2024, two decades after the decline of the platform mascot warz. I have ample nostalgia for the old marsupial myself, with his second Naughty Dog-developed outing being a particular obsession, but come now, we're all about deckbuilders, soulsliking and battle royale nowadays, right?</p>
<p>Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The rumour in question has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzHwPNPW2VM">mongered</a> by video game historian Liam Robertson (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-bandicoot-5-cancelled-in-favour-of-live-service-games-report-claims">EG</a>), who claims that Crash 5 would have been another single player 3D platformer and a direct sequel to Crash 4, which released in 2020. Robertson has also gotten hold of some alleged artworks and story concepts. One proposal envisaged a game set in a school for villainous kids, featuring returning villains such as Dr Cortex. Another would have seen Crash join forces with Mr Spyro of the Dragon family - another darling of the mascot era and patient zero for Toys For Bob's currently on-hiatus Skylanders toys-to-life series.</p>
<p>
But then along came the axemen of Activision, with their brutal talk of Crash 4 'not meeting sales expectations' and online live service games being 'all of the rage'. Crash 5 was apparently cancelled in the very early days of development to make room for another live service-me-do. Team members were moved to other projects such as Crash Team Rumble, released last year, which didn't exactly set the world alight. 
</p>
<p>
Toys For Bob <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crash-bandicoot-4-studio-toys-for-bob-split-from-activision-and-microsoft-to-go-independent">washed their hands of Activision and went independent earlier this year</a>, following a round of layoffs. Back in March, studio heads Paul Yan and Avery Lodato declared that they were "in the early days of developing our next new game and a ways away from making any announcements". I wonder if any of those abandoned ideas for Crash 5 have made their way into the studio's current projects.

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtcYQtng9rY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Nintendo announced Tetris Forever is coming to the Switch in 2024 with a new trailer as part of the latest Direct Partner showcase.</p>



<p>Tetris Forever celebrates the 40th anniversary of the original Tetris game, compiling a wide range of classic titles in the series. </p>



<p>Today’s new trailer description reveals that Tetris Forever is an “interactive documentary game.” Fans can play “more than 15 different classic Tetris games while exploring the history of the series through over an hour of all-new documentary footage.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tetris® Forever – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WtcYQtng9rY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Unfortunately, today’s trailer did not confirm an exact release date for Tetris Forever. However, the new trailer did mention that the NES version of Tetris is coming to Nintendo Switch Online in Winter 2024. That will also coincide with a Tetris 99 Maximus Cup event.</p>



<p>So, it’s possible that Tetris Forever will try to launch around the same time as that release.</p>



<p>The original Tetris gained a lot of renewed interest following a live-action film based on its origins. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, a 13-year-old player also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/13-year-old-player-defeats-and-crashes-tetris/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally beat Tetris</a>. Also, just last month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-receives-a-tetris-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft got Tetris DLC</a>, so fans will surely be pleased to revisit the classic titles with Tetris Forever sometime in 2024.</p>

Discussing the grand strategy genre, specifically, Kim notes those titles are so "zoomed out" –often spanning hundreds of years–they also struggle to humanise their characters and narratives, leaving players struggling to establish meaningful emotional connections.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To counter those perceived pitfalls, he says </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bonaparte</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will&nbsp; "really zoom in on a narrow point in history where a lot happens."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're looking at the revolutionary decade from 1789 to 1799 for the initial release, and there is so much in there in terms of big personalities and big ideas," he says, noting that the real-life Napoleon Bonaparte was initially quite "ambivalent politically" making them the perfect wildcard for players to inhabit in an outlandish alternate history.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We emphasize that you are not Napoleon. You are Bonaparte in an alternate timeline. You are not bound by Napoleon's choices. You can choose to make your radical worker's republic if you really want to go for that. Or if you want to choose to be the king's lackey, you can also do that," says Kim.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In terms of depicting history in games, often there's a belief that history is just the names, places, and dates. That's actually the boring stuff. What's interesting is why people do something. What were the dynamics behind these factions? Why couldn't they come to peace?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kim says </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bonaparte</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will look to deliver "alternate history with authenticity," but notes that players shouldn't expect a full blown historical simulation. The title will take place during a niche period and focus on a select few historical figures, letting players become deeply immersed in a moment in time rather than pulling them across multiple generations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How does that play to their advantage in a market with a litany of expansive historical strategy titles? Kim believes Imugi's approach can win players over by eschewing "oatmeal" narrative design conventions. "It's about having more meaningful outcomes from your choices," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think grand strategy games with a massive scale allow us to have a lot of choices that really change games and their outcomes, [but] there's a saying in game narrative circles about oatmeal experiences. There are these bumps, but there's so small and they're everywhere so you don't really notice that each bump is actually a meaningful choice. By really zooming in on this era and focusing on key figures I think we'll have a much more defined experience."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kim hopes it's an approach that can turn </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bonaparte</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> into a "spicy appetiser." A delectable morsel that, while not quite as hearty as oatmeal, is altogether more potent.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>'s collaborations are set to continue this autumn when players will have the opportunity to whip out their squirters and give Shrek's fairytale world a good hose down in a brand-new paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator's Shrek Special Pack marks the fifth bit of paid DLC for video gaming's premiere wash-'em-up, following on from collaborations with Spongebob SquarePants, Back to the Future, Warhammer 40,000, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulators-next-paid-dlc-is-heading-down-a-rabbit-hole-with-alice">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a> - and that's alongside free seasonal content and more.
</p>
<p>
Developer FuturLab's Shrek Special Pack promises five new "fairytale" maps inspired by the Dreamworks' currently four-strong animated movie series, with levels revealed so far including Shrek's Swamp and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragons-lair">Dragon's Lair</a>.

<p>
As is customary, it'll also including a new outfit to don while blasting off the grime, this time resembling a set of knight's shining armour. And if PowerWash Simulator's Shrek DLC is anywhere near as good as its surprisingly excellent Alice DLC, we're in for a treat.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet for PowerWash Simulator's Shrek Special Pack, but expect it to cost around £6.50 when it shows up for all platforms this "autumn". And in the meantime, there's plenty of free stuff to de-filth, thanks to FuturLab's recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hose-down-a-cruise-ship-in-powerwash-simulators-latest-free-dlc">summer celebrations and Washer-Versary</a>.

<p>Neva is the next game from the maker of the equally sad and beautiful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-review-an-evocative-ethereal-experience-you-dont-want-to-miss">Gris</a>.
