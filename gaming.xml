			<p>Obsidian know a thing or two about RPGs. Whether creating one of the greatest sequels of all time in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, or providing evidence that they’re more than capable of out-Bethesda-ing Bethesda with Fallout: New Vegas, they’re now presenting us with Avowed, a first-person, high-fantasy RPG set in their homegrown Pillars of Eternity universe. Their flagship talents haven’t dimmed in recent years, and if you’re yearning for the type of evocative fantasy adventures found in games like Morrowind and Oblivion, this is a thoroughly modern, gorgeously presented adventure that places the Pillars of Eternity universe amongst that hallowed company.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed - Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EbB4-LoURRs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Avowed takes place in The Living Lands, an untamed region of the the fantasy world of Eora. You are a Godlike, a being touched by a God, their watchful eye intended to grant you various boons, and some colourful face ornamentation, but you are unusual, even for a Godlike. For one thing, you don’t know who your patron God is, and for another you keep hearing a voice in your head. Like I said, unusual.</p>


<p>One of the most immediately interesting things about character creation here is that there’s a visible manifestation of the Gods’ power all over your face, with flora and fauna sprouting from your forehead, cheeks or across your entire face. It can be as subtle as having colourful freckles, or as ostentatious as half a tree coming out of your hair and fungal growths surrounding your eyes. I opted my character’s face to appear wholly made of bark, and, unsurprisingly, you spend a good portion of the opening hours shocking everyone you meet.</p>
<p>You can turn the Godlike visual effects off, but it won’t affect how characters react to you and would be missing the entire point of being an outcast, of being visibly different, of a life of hardship and otherness and dealing with how the rest of the populace treat you. Don’t do it.</p>


<p>The Emperor has sent you to The Living Lands to investigate a plague known as the Dreamscourge, a malady that drives people mad, but which has also begun to take effect upon the landscape and the wildlife itself. This relatively simple opening immediately branches into myriad pieces as you talk to every citizen possible, and then help or hinder them with their tasks.</p>
<p>You’re doubly separate from the population of Paradis and the surrounding areas, as you’re the Aedyran envoy. The previous representatives and soldiers of this nation have sought to subjugate and control the people of The Living Lands when this population of outcasts are used to living freely. It’s the frontier, the edge of the world to some, and you are unwelcome, while your compatriots seem to be aggressive, trigger happy and underhanded. The people, quite rightfully, rankle under Imperial rule, but you can decide which side of the conflict you want to support.</p>
<p>You’ll have to balance how you treat and respond to people via the different speech options during each conversation, being respectful, helpful and kind or aggressive and violent; ie. a complete and utter dick. Your character’s stats and background give you access to additional speech options if they’re high enough, letting you fully immerse yourself in role-playing as your creation, while shaping the conversation or the information you gain from it.</p>

<p>Your choices have consequences, sometimes dire ones, but the way they come back into sight will often surprise you. It feels organic, realistic, and unforced, and it ensures that this feels like a living world (heh), one that you can directly affect through your actions and your words.</p>
<p>The writing here is often intriguing and fantastical, while at other times it’s humorous and down to earth. The setting is magical and arcane, but there’s an underlying sense of reality, emotion and the truth of human existence, the trick being that it manages to be affecting and thoughtful even when you’ve got flowers growing out of your face, and you’re conversing with a glowing entity in a cave.</p>
<p>The exceptional writing is complemented by the stellar voice acting you experience through much of Avowed. Your central companion through the opening of the game, Kai, is voiced by <span>Brandon Keener</span>, the inimitable Garrus in Mass Effect, and frankly, that’s more than enough to give you an indication of how the rest of the game will play out. It’s hard to express what it is that grounds each of the performances here, but, just as with the writing and the narrative, it doesn’t forget the human aspect or the reality of each situation.</p>
<p>One of my favourite things about Avowed is how side-quests are dealt with. As you walk through populated areas, you’ll pick up snippets of conversation – a soldier talking to someone trying to get into the city, a friend telling their companion to pull themselves together – and you can then interrupt them, jumping feet first into their business, and likely adding another quest to the creaking, groaning catalogue of jobs you’ve already accumulated.</p>
<p>Clearly, you should be completing these, turning up interesting personal moments, learning more about the world, and gaining unique equipment or extra materials. They are nearly all interestingly framed, even if the tasks themselves centre on killing things, collecting them or, in the interests of variety, a combination of the two.<br>
</p>
<p>The game plays as a standard in first-person, but there’s an option to switch to a third-person view if that’s more your thing, especially as it gives you a constant view of your Godlike creation and their current armament. With combat in mind you can set two distinct loadouts, switching between them at the press of a button, so you can opt for a melee centred setup with a two-handed weapon as your secondary choice for heftier damage, or mix an axe in one hand, grimoire in the other, and have a bow or arquebus as your ranged alternate. You can also learn magic innately instead of needing to read it from a book, but having one in hand is a shortcut to a broader set of magic spells.</p>
<p>I chose to play as a magical paladin, as comfortable with a sword and shield as with magic, and I loved being able to move back and forth between them while in combat, particularly against the tougher enemies you’ll come across from time to time. Avowed is no slouch, and combat feels increasingly hard won and rewarding. Your companions also play their part here, taking some of the aggro and with abilities that you can call upon from a quick radial menu, both in combat and exploration.</p>
<p>Whatever task or story moment you’re undertaking, Avowed’s world is gloriously creative, gorgeous to look at, and eternally compelling, begging you to check out every spider-web covered nook and mountainous cranny. It’s not wholly unfamiliar – there’s designs that echo those seen in the Elder Scrolls series, and of course, fans of the Pillars of Eternity games will get a kick out of various elements – but it comes together so well. Vistas will make your heart swell, alien foliage will intrigue you, and the various architectural styles can’t help but pique your curiosity.</p>

<p>Playing on PC, there have been some very long initial load times, and the compiling of shaders happens every single time you load the game, when I’m sure most games normally complete it once, and that’s it. It doesn’t detract so much as force you to sit and ponder what you’re about to be doing, but I’m hopeful that a patch will deal with it. Aside from that, it ran very well on our 3070 equipped rig.</p>
<p>The long loading times are echoed on Xbox Series X, where you have a choice between 30fps and 60fps visual modes. We stuck with the latter performance mode, where the game’s art direction still looks handsome, but it does exhibit some distracting quirks with noisy shadows, bright water reflections in the deepest of caves, and some temporal smearing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/avowed-review-pillars-of-excellence<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there's one thing Obsidian Entertainment is known for, it's for fantastic writing. That was true with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-old-republic-ii-sith-lords-kotor-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II</em></a> in 2004, true&nbsp;with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a> in 2010, and still true all the way in 2022 with the release of the incredible game that is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pentiment-review" rel="nofollow">Pentiment</a>. In 2025, we have <em>Avowed</em>.</p>

<p>Fear not, for Obsidian's quality of writing is still there with <em>Avowed</em>. It is, in essence, Obsidian doing what they do best: Adventures with gripping narratives and fleshed-out characters. <em>Avowed</em> is an epic fantasy in the truest sense, giving us one of the best RPGs this decade.</p>

<p>In this ambitious role-playing experience, players can expect to travel across the continent of The Living Lands. A terrible fate awaits those who live in The Living Lands, with an enigmatic malady called the "Dreamscourge" affecting not only its people, but the continent's wildlife and terrain as well. All of these elements are a recipe for a grand adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed_pillar.jpg?itok=vCtni87o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed_pillar.jpg?itok=9QrvgzCt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look! It's one of the pillars... of eternity!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Avowed</em>:<em> </em>A Wonderful Continuation to <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>'s Lore</h2>

<p>First things first,&nbsp;I'd like to acknowledge the setting of <em>Avowed</em>. Yes, it takes place in The Living Lands, but the world itself -- called Eora -- is one that has a great deal of existing lore. <em>Avowed</em> is set within the <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/pillars-of-eternity" rel="nofollow"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a> universe -- the first game of which was released in 2015 and following that several years later in 2018,&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em>.</p>

<p>As a result, <em>Avowed</em> feels like a living world. The lore has had time to develop over the course of a decade, and in doing so, we see a masterful display of worldbuilding in <em>Avowed</em>. Indeed, Carrie Patel, one of the lead writers for <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, is the director for <em>Avowed</em>, and her love for the lore is evident here. It's treated with reverence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, you, the player, are the star of the show here. You'll have a great deal of agency over how the plot develops throughout the 40+ hour campaign, with a myriad of side quests with equally excellent writing to string players along.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed_roleplaying.jpg?itok=7khg1Lki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed_roleplaying.jpg?itok=NBTpC_Uc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are plenty of choices in dialogue, and sometimes even skill checks or ones that leverage your chosen background.</figcaption></figure><p>The most impressive aspect of <em>Avowed</em>'s writing is the ability to roleplay<em>. </em>At the start, you create a character, but two things are persistent across all playthroughs: we're Godlike from the Aedyr Empire. Godlike are a race of individuals touched by the gods before birth -- they are extremely rare in the world of Eora and that is a very important aspect of your character.</p>

<p>Godlike's appearances are jarring for some. As a side-effect of being a Godlike, your features reflect the characteristics of your deity. In this case, we have fungal growths covering our face and head. This leads to our character being extremely recognizable among the crowd in <em>Avowed</em>, but also sometimes reviled.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-character-screenshot.jpg?itok=KqbCDSHy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-character-screenshot.jpg?itok=QT3nNXqH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These pillars of adra sure are mysterious.</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, you can also choose a backstory for your character, all of which tie you back to Aedyr. I chose to become a noble, and throughout my campaign, I was a selfish, somewhat emotionless individual with undying loyalty for the Empire and hellbent on completing my duty of discovering the cause of the Dreamscourge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most impressive aspect of <em>Avowed</em>'s writing is the ability to roleplay<em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Empire wants to colonize the Forgotten Lands, because that's what empires do, of course. As the representative of the Emperor himself, you're often thrust into awkward situations. The locale does <em>not</em> like you, and you can either play as a sympathetic ambassador, a ruthless inquisitor, or anything in between.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-choices.jpg?itok=uwOdOxhX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-choices.jpg?itok=Nke4Fj0h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Is that so, Mr. Pastor? I'll keep that in mind.</figcaption></figure><h2>Choices, Choices<em>...</em></h2>

<p>Indeed, it was refreshing to see the amount of dialogue choices in <em>Avowed</em>. At any point during a conversation, I'd consciously decide how I would respond, and nine times out of ten, there would be a dialogue choice that fit exactly what I wanted.</p>

<p>This goes back to my original point: You have a great deal of agency over how the story develops. There are a myriad of choices, some inconsequential and some substantial. Many choices will come back to rear its ugly head many hours after the fact.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-companions.jpg?itok=30r-N29R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-companions.jpg?itok=yd-jq8TM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Companions aren't just static characters -- they are very present in both dialogue and gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>The impact of your choices varies in severity, but rest assured: <em>Avowed</em> is a game where choices <em>do</em> matter. Even your companions (of which there are four) remember your decisions, and they aren't afraid to either shower you with praise or chastise you for your actions.</p>

<p>As for companions themselves, we have a likable bunch of characters. From the reclusive scout Marius to the chaotic wizard Yatzli, these characters will go through arcs of their own, which make them feel more realistic and relatable. They are beneficial in combat too, of course, but writing is what truly makes these individuals shine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-mushroom-boi.jpg?itok=CHGUloyo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-mushroom-boi.jpg?itok=wBHVtlsp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'd switch my loadout often until I found my ideal gear to settle with, but loot is fun to find!</figcaption></figure><h2>Loot? Yes Please!</h2>

<p>Really, I could gush about the narrative for days. Still, <em>Avowed</em> also has excellent combat, loot, and exploration. The way in which Obsidian Entertainment designed these systems makes for an engaging game in both narrative <em>and </em>gameplay.</p>

<p><em>Avowed</em>'s gameplay is designed to be versatile. There are numerous weapon types like spears, swords, bows, axes, and uh... guns? Yes, there are guns, and they are awesome. Of course, we can't forget magic and the abilities that come with it, which is just as fleshed out as the other weapon types in <em>Avowed</em>.</p>

<p>A very smart design decision on Obsidian's part was to incorporate two separate weapon load-outs players can switch on the fly. In the middle of combat, I might want to engage the enemy by sneaking up with a bow. Upon getting the enemy's attention, it takes but a moment to switch to melee and fight back.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-gear_0.jpg?itok=V8EGiz_B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-gear_0.jpg?itok=xfQSzHhL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guns and magic can indeed work well!</figcaption></figure><p>Some weapons take up two slots, but for most weapons, they are one-handed. This means you can duel-wield, and you are most certainly encouraged to take advantage of this. Holding a pistol in the right hand and a tome of magic in the other allows for a gun-and-sorcery type of build, giving you plenty of combat options.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are guns, and they are awesome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the most part, I stuck with two swords as one loadout and two pistols on the other. Leveling up allows players to spend points into simplified skill trees, so I ended up creating a duelist type of character.</p>

<p>Engaging the enemy with two shots from my pistol either outright kills them or deals a great amount of damage. Enemies, which are often found in packs, would then charge at me. I'd jump into the fray with my two swords and slash away furiously. Increasing my attack speed and damage with one-handed weapons made me a fearsome opponent.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-swords.jpg?itok=YhNLtyt2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-swords.jpg?itok=OMKGx1B0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two swords sounds like a solid set of gear to me!</figcaption></figure><p>While I'm on the topic of enemies, that's one part of <em>Avowed</em> that needs work. Enemy variety leaves me wanting; I could probably count on my hand the number of enemy types. Most of the foes you fight comprise xaurips (lizard men), spiders, keth (an encompassing term for humanoids), skeletons, and bears.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enemies do vary in power, and that is where I find the level system to be quite engaging and innovative. Enemies are not assigned a level, so they don't scale to you as you level up. Instead, enemy power is reflected in item quality.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-loot.jpg?itok=5e907SDx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-loot.jpg?itok=zODDwhwl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are also trinkets like rings, as well as boots and gloves to help with your loadout. Take this, uh, Wahaki Tua for example...</figcaption></figure><h2>A Quality Way to Handle Scaling and Gear in <em>Avowed</em></h2>

<p>The whole enemy level/item quality system can be a bit confusing to grasp at first, but once you start picking up loot of better quality and encountering enemies that are a bit stronger, everything clicks. I love the way loot is handled in <em>Avowed</em>, making gear seem just as important as your character. Perhaps my favorite aspect, however, is unique items.</p>

<p>Unique items are, well, unique. Swords, axes, maces, guns, whatever it is, there's a chance you'll find a unique item in your travels. These are hand-made by Obsidian Entertainment and one-of-a-kind pieces of gear that all have different "unique abilities" attached to them. They also have individualized flavor text to make them stand out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the way loot is handled in <em>Avowed</em>, making gear seem just as important as your character.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are especially exciting pieces of loot to find, and as a result, exploration feels exceedingly rewarding in <em>Avowed</em>. While you can purchase some of these items from vendors or receive them as quest rewards, it's through exploration that you'll get the bulk of these uniques. You'll find them tucked away in various ruins or stowed in treasure chests.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-pistols.jpg?itok=lgg36vLq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-pistols.jpg?itok=07gqUx1z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Why have one pistol when you can use two?</figcaption></figure><p>With the incentive to explore, it makes <em>Avowed</em> feel like an exciting adventure -- you never know what you'll stumble across. Of course, it's important to pick up other, regular ol' items as well because of <em>Avowed</em>'s loot system. It's in this crafting where the game also shines. Basically any item, no matter how low in quality, matters.</p>

<p>Items are broken down into resources (you can also find some of these resources in the world) and are used to improve your weapons and armor. Even if you find junk, it has value because of the resources gained from scrapping them. From there, you can use it to improve the quality of your weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You could improve that one unique you found in the starting zone and have it carry you through the whole game, so long as you keep improving on it. I know this because I used a pistol from the first area throughout my entire 40+ hours of play, and it was consistently a great weapon. Items you enjoy using don't become obsolete, which gives more agency to the player to use what they want.</p>

<p>All this talk about gear and I've barely touched on combat. Sure, enemies are repetitive, but being able to use the gear you like against your foes makes for a satisfying combat experience. Fighting is fast-paced and simply fun, especially when switching between loadouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buffing my attack speed with a perk I unlocked allowed me to eviscerate foes. Enhancing my ability to dodge made me untouchable. I became a force to be reckoned with, and if you're looking for that sort of power fantasy of being the biggest badass in all the realm, well, you can do that here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Items don't become obsolete, which gives more agency to the player to use what they want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the most part, everything I tried felt viable, and you can respec really quickly if you find that you don't like your current perks. Since you're likely to find so many different weapons, <em>Avowed</em> encourages players to experiment and try different builds, which means combat will always feel fresh if you like trying new things.</p>

<p><em>Avowed</em> is a gorgeous game, with some of the best environments I've seen in gaming. The art design for The Living Lands is absolutely on point, effectively portraying this fungal-infested, untamed wilderness. There are certain key moments during the game where the overall aesthetic took me by surprise -- moments I won't spoil but you'll know when you see it.</p>

<p>Though I won't be surprised if others experience some instability in their game's performance on PC, such is the price of such a beautiful game. FPS tended to fluctuate on my rig - <em>especially</em> in cities and towns -- which made me a bit too reliant on DLSS and frame generation. Performance will definitely depend on your rig, as always, but it's worth keeping in mind.</p>

<p>That, and there are a lot of bugs in <em>Avowed</em>. Obsidian Entertainment's been very responsive to any bugs and issues reviewers encountered, and there will be a patch to fix many issues, but still... for a game as ambitious and big as <em>Avowed</em>, expect bugs. Just as an example, I wasn't able to complete a few side quests, but that was the worst of it.</p>

<p><em>Avowed</em> impressed me in many ways. The way it handled gear and enemy scaling, its rewarding exploration, and unparalleled storytelling and world-building are most certainly the highlights, but its combat is also immensely fun. What more can you ask from an RPG? Obsidian Entertainment is one of the best in the business, and that's proven with <em>Avowed</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/611255/avowed-review-xbox-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We’re likely still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23878504/the-elder-scrolls-6-2026-release-xbox-exclusive">a long way out from Bethesda’s next <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game</a>. But that wait isn’t such a big deal when the Xbox has other excellent roleplaying games like <em>Avowed</em>. The latest from <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20959758/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-fallout-series-hero-narrative-xbox-one-ps4-pc"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a> developer Obsidian, <em>Avowed</em> doesn’t shake up the genre. It’s just a really solid fantasy RPG, one that keeps you pushing through with a combination of epic story, delightful companions, difficult decisions, and a true sense of adventure in a massive world.</p><p>The game puts you in the role of a godlike, a race of rare human-like creatures believed to have been blessed by — and thus are close to — the many gods that exist in this world. You’re immediately put to work investigating a deadly plague that is impacting a region known as The Living Lands. It’s an ecological disaster, slowly killing people (after it causes them to go mad) while also being responsible for everything from gigantic sinkholes to <em>very</em> angry bears. <em>Avowed</em> is actually a spinoff of Obsidian’s <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> series, but it serves as a great entry point; I rarely found myself lost or confused, and there’s a handy glossary to help you with key names and places during conversations.</p><p>The larger quest is actually compelling, as far as these things go, and touches on larger themes like imperialism as well as more personal ones, like your character’s connections to the gods. Usually, I ignore the main quest until I can’t, but here, I actually wanted to know what happened, particularly a dozen or so hours in, when the scope of the world becomes clearer. But like in most RPGs, the main storyline is also largely an excuse to push you through the world. <em>Avowed</em> thrives on distraction. You’re off to do one thing, and then you spot something else interesting — a lost character calling for help, a strange glow on the horizon, an ancient ruin buried underground — and you find yourself pulled into something new and completely unexpected.</p><p>I could be describing a lot of fantasy RPGs there. But part of what makes <em>Avowed</em> work is that even those smaller stories and moments are full of intrigue and personality, often bringing you into something larger and deeper than it first seems. So even if a bunch of them are typical fetch quests, the how and why of what you’re doing is enough to make them interesting. Many are funny, others are tragic, and a few are tragically funny. One of my favorites involved dealing with a farmer who was working hard to create a more cost-effective workforce out of reanimated corpses.</p><p><em>Avowed</em> also does a good job of making it feel like you’re part of this world and having an impact. Maybe it’s all an elaborate trick of narrative design, but it felt like my choices mattered. Early on, I let a would-be assassin go free, which caused some initial pain — mostly, my fellow party members got pretty mad at me — but also opened up new story avenues with his faction of rebels.</p><p>Those party members, who you can have long conversations with while camping and complete specific sidequests with to further your relationships, respond to your actions and decisions in ways that feel believable and personal. Sometimes it’s just a little quip in the heat of battle; other times, it’s a long lecture about a choice you made. And those choices can be really difficult: at multiple points, you have to decide in the moment if someone lives or dies, and I often felt unsure of what to do. You can’t make everyone happy — and you definitely can’t keep everyone alive.</p><p>I also really enjoyed feeling like I could roleplay as the godlike adventurer I wanted to be. There are some very fun dialogue options, and I turned my wizard into the intimidating silent type, often responding not with words but with a “raised eyebrow” or “dangerous smile.” The godlikes really stand out in this world thanks to visible physical features. My character had a face full of fungi and tree roots for hair, so I just went with the strong outcast vibe, and it was a blast.</p><p>It’s those smaller, more personal moments that really help set <em>Avowed</em> apart because, structurally and mechanically, it’s pretty standard — if well-tuned — stuff. That means multipart quests that have you running around The Living Lands collecting and returning items and combat that can occasionally become a slog, particularly when you’re fighting huge groups of enemies. There’s a whole lot of dialogue to sift through, though a lot of it is optional, and I found myself skipping very little of it. I also spent way too much time fiddling with an inventory full of identical magic wands and rotten cucumbers.</p><p>But the moment-to-moment storytelling and adventuring is so good that those issues didn’t really bother me. Sometimes you just want a huge, fantastical world to lose yourself in, and there aren’t a lot of them with the scale and quality of <em>Avowed</em>. There’s a reason these games only come around so often — and why the wait can be so hard.</p><div><p><sub>Avowed <em>launches on February 18th on Xbox and PC, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/avowed-guides/521374/release-time-early-access-game-pass-est-pst">with early access starting on February 13th</a>.</em></sub></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this week, Sony set the stage for the rest of this year and beyond with the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">State of Play</a> for 2025. But while looking to the future, Sony didn't forget about the past. During the onslaught of announcements and reveal trailers, Sony noted From Software's 1997 PS1 mecha shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-review/1900-2546613/" data-ref-id="1900-2546613">Armored Core</a>, is coming to PlayStation Plus Classic Games in the near future.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-project-phantasma-review/1900-2546603/" data-ref-id="1900-2546603">Armored Core Project Phantasma</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-master-of-arena-review/1900-2545917/" data-ref-id="1900-2545917">Armored Core Master of Arena</a> are also slated to hit PS Plus Classic Games "soon," although Sony didn't set a specific date for either of those titles to arrive. The most recent game in the series was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/" data-ref-id="1900-6418109">Armored Core 6</a> in 2023, and there hasn't been any concrete word yet about any additional sequels on the way. </p><p>In the more immediate future, the PSP game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/patapon-3-review/1900-6308897/" data-ref-id="1900-6308897">Patapon 3</a> is making the leap to PS4 and PS5 when it joins PlayStation Plus Premium on February 18. This adventure/rhythm game will feature newly enhanced visuals as well as rewind and quick save features as players lead their Patapon followers into 80 different quests.  </p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dropship-united-peace-force/1900-2870144/" data-ref-id="1900-2870144">Dropship: United Peace Force</a>--which was originally released for PS2 in 2002--is also coming to PlayStation Plus Premium on February 18. Like Patapon 3, Dropship will feature rewind and quick save features, as well enhanced graphics. Dropship puts players in control of an advanced military force of land and air vehicles as they battle terrorists and organized crime across the planet.  </p><p>Among the more recent titles coming to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium on February 18 are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-fear-itself/1900-6418060/" data-ref-id="1900-6418060">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/top-spin-2k25-review-painting-the-lines/1900-6418222/" data-ref-id="1900-6418222">TopSpin 2K25</a>.

It’s the story of four high school friends reuniting after 27 years without contact. Why they’re getting back together now is, apparently, part of the plot you create with your decisions, but there’s word of a terrible secret they all shared coming back to haunt them.</p><p>Each part is being released as a “tape,” because ‘90s references I guess, the first next week on February 18, and the second (currently) set for April 15. And, both will be included for PS+ subscribers at the Extra and Premium tiers.</p><p>But that’s not all that was revealed. Intriguing puzzle game&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.blueprincegame.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.blueprincegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Blue Prince</em></a></span>, that calls itself an “atmospheric architectural adventure,” and looks absolutely fascinating. It’s seemingly first-person exploration, but in buildings where the rooms rearrange themselves, and all sorts of secrets are hidden within. It’s an indie piece, published by Raw Fury, and it will be coming straight onto PlayStation Plus this spring.</p><p>Then, in the summer, early access Steam hit <em>Abiotic Factor</em> will arrive on PS+ too. This is an FPS combined with survival sim, for one to six players, set across a bonkers mix of biomes and realms. It’s absolutely <em>adored</em> on PC, so makes for an excellent addition to Sony’s catalogue, especially given it works best when played in groups. If you’ve tried to convince friends to pay for an obscure indie title on console so you can play together, you’ll already know why everyone just have automatic access makes it far more likely to happen.</p><p>Sony is clearly testing the waters here, given its previous defiant refusal to sacrifice those day-one $70 sales for the ongoing income of a subscriber. While these are obviously not games that’d fetch such sums, and the latter two would be harder sells outside of Steam’s more esoteric ecosystem, it’s still a pretty big deal—<em>Lost Records</em> especially, given Don’t Nod’s string of previous mid-price successes.</p><p>Let’s hope it proves popular, enough that PlayStation broadens the day-one options, such that those who can’t afford to pay for multiple $70 games a year might have a cheaper path to entertainment.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hazelight Studios is looking to gatecrash all the Game of the Year parties again. Split Fiction is the studio’s newest co-op project, and Xbox Game Pass and EA Play members are curious to see if the title is coming to either subscription service.</p>



<p>It Takes Two to Tango, which is why the 2021 predecessor was so revered and successful. It shined a spotlight on tandem tale-telling and showed co-op games still have so much potential. I’ve already discussed our most anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op games of 2025</a>, and comfortably topping the list has to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<p>Split Fiction on Game Pass would be smart, and it’s an EA game, so EA Play access is logical. However, the cookie doesn’t always crumble this way.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-split-fiction-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Split Fiction on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will you choose? Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Split Fiction isn’t coming to Xbox Game Pass at launch, and all the evidence would suggest it is staying this way.</strong></p>



<p>It’s common for new game announcement trailers to mention Game Pass. Split Fiction was announced during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>, and came with a full trailer. Unfortunately for Game Pass subscribers, there was zero mention of it coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/split-fiction/9n1wxxd1rl8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction Xbox Store Page</a> also neglects to mention Game Pass eligibility. There’s still time before release, meaning it could change. If it does, we’ll update this page and let you know.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-split-fiction-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Split Fiction Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s not confirmed, but Split Fiction could come to Xbox Game Pass if It Takes Two is anything to go by.</strong></p>



<p>It Takes Two released in March 2021. <strong>The co-op title was on Xbox Game Pass a few months later in November 2021</strong>. There’s no guarantee history repeats itself with Split Fiction. But there is a precedent here, so stay tuned for a change in its status.</p>

<p><strong>Split Fiction is not available as a day-one title on EA Play.</strong></p>



<p>EA rarely (if ever) makes new EA titles free on EA Play straightaway. You can grab a Split Fiction discount if you have EA Play though. But like Game Pass, it’ll likely be a while before Hazelight’s newest co-op adventure is free-to-play on EA Play.</p>

<p>Can another Josef Fares game catch lightning in a bottle and win Game of the Year again? Or is Split Fiction destined to split opinions and fall short of It Takes Two? Let us know based on what you’ve seen so far.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s February State of Play</a> showcase rightfully gave Split Fiction more exposure. You can check out the exciting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-received-a-new-trailer-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> showing off the litany of new ideas the release brings.</p>

            <p>The Minecraft Movie team has released another trailer for the upcoming film, which intends to whet appetites and put emphasis on the idea that creativity is key to survival. But, that's not what everyone is talking about.</p>
<p>Rather, it is our first look at the film's depiction of Minecraft's villagers that has caused quite the stir among, well, anyone who has had to look at them.</p>
<p>These chaps are rather unusual looking. "God has abandoned us," <a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1889776013724283175">one social media commentator said</a> under a screenshot of the Minecraft Movie villagers. Another added: "They look like square cousins of the dad from Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."</p>

<p>And, just for posterity because it is one of those images I can't actually bring myself to look away from even though I do want to, here they are again in a screengrab from the trailer.</p>

<p>"Four misfits," explains the official blurb if you're looking for more context on the upcoming film, "find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve.</p>
<p>"Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world."</p>
<p>The Minecraft Movie is set to release this April. It stars Jack Black as Steve (which right now appears to be Jack Black but in a blue T-shirt) and Jason Momoa as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison.</p>
<p>Away from the big screen, an animated Minecraft series was also announced for Netflix back in May. Netflix will produce the project alongside Minecraft developer Mojang Studios, while WildBrain Studios - the studio behind Sonic Prime - will handle the development.</p>
<p>While further details are thin on the ground, it is said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">upcoming show will "feature an original story with new characters</a>, showing the world of 'Minecraft' in a new light".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-loot-boxes-season-15<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has announced that loot boxes will be making a return to&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>in the game's upcoming fifteenth season, so if you're nostalgic for that particular aspect of the game's bygone days (for some reason), then you're in luck.</p>

<p>According to senior systems designer Gavin Winter, the goal for the return of loot boxes is "keeping it fun while being transparent about what's inside and the rate of various drops from opening each box".</p>

<p>In <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24177197/overwatch-2-spotlight-a-new-era-of-innovation-and-excitement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> summarizing yesterday's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>Spotlight presentation, Blizzard says loot boxes will contain "a variety of cosmetics". That'll include skins, voice lines, and more, just like it used to be back in the early days of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overwatch-2-loot-boxes-coming-back.jpg?itok=3wUHmTrd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overwatch-2-loot-boxes-coming-back.jpg?itok=3VftSz8G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Loot boxes are making a comeback in&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Lest you think this means&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2</em>'s battle passes are going away, think again. Blizzard says you'll be able to earn loot boxes "from weekly and event rewards", as well as via the battle pass.</p>

<p>One Legendary-level loot box will be available via the free track on the battle pass, while two further boxes will be earnable via the Premium track. It doesn't sound like you'll be able to directly buy loot boxes from&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2</em>'s in-game shop.</p>

<p>Perhaps to stave off some of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-uk-loot-box-guidelines" rel="nofollow">criticism</a> that's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/proposed-australia-loot-box-law-would-ban-them-for-minors" rel="nofollow">aimed</a> at the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-uk-research-draws-robust-link-between-loot-boxes-and-gambling" rel="nofollow">nature of loot boxes</a> over the years, Blizzard says it's aiming to be "transparent" about what chances you'll have to obtain certain levels of cosmetics.</p>

<p>Each loot box is guaranteed to contain one Rare or better item, while an Epic item will definitely drop within five boxes and a Legendary item will drop within twenty.</p>




<p>Specifically, you've got a 5.1% chance of a Legendary item in a regular loot box and a 100% chance of one in a Legendary box. Epic items stand at 21.93% and Rare items at 96.26% across all boxes, with common items sitting at a rarity of 97.97%.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>Spotlight also offered a look at some of the other things coming to the game as part of Season 15, including new crossbow-wielding hero Freja, the new Stadium game mode, and the introduction of a Perk system to let you customize heroes.</p>

<p>Loot boxes will be reintroduced to&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>when its fifteenth season begins on February 18th. The game is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2357570/Overwatch_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/overwatch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/overwatch-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/overwatch-2-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nintendo and the Pokémon Company recently received a new patent in the United States, which could help their lawsuit against Palworld.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/yesterday-nintendo-received-a-u-s-version-of-another-anti-palworld-patent-and-asked-the-u-s-patent-office-for-an-interview-to-get-a-third-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Fray</a> (via <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patents-uspto-infringement-lawsuit-implications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>), Nintendo and the Pokemon Company recently acquired U.S. Patent No. 12,220,638, which helps them fight Palworld in different countries. Players must first learn about a previous patent published on December 31, 2024, to understand the new patent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On December 31, 2024, U.S. Patent No. 12,179,111 was acquired by Nintendo, where the company outlined a “first mode and a second mode”. In the former, players would use a “catching item” to procure a “field character”, and in the latter, a “fighting character” is released to engage in battle with the “field character”. It was speculated that Palworld changed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-has-changed-how-pal-spheres-work-in-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how Pal Spheres worked in the game</a> when Nintendo was in the process of publishing this patent, as all parties were informed about it a month before it was published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo acquired the new U.S. Patent No. 12,220,638 on February 11, 2025, and it was very similar to the one they published at the end of last year. However, some different terms were used in this patent, where “field character” has been replaced by “virtual character” and “catching items” with “obtaining items.” A display indicator for “likelihood of success” for obtaining a virtual character was mentioned, too. Lastly, any mentions of the first and second modes were removed.</p>



<p>So, how does Nintendo’s new patent help their lawsuit against Palworld? The report reveals that with the first patent, Pocketpair argued that there wasn’t a clear separation between a “first mode and second mode” in Palworld. With the new patent, Nintendo removed the distinction between these first and second modes and added new terms like “virtual character” and “obtaining items” to increase their chances in the patent infringement lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Nintendo and the Pokemon Company are not slowing down in their battle against Palworld. To help with the rejected claims, their attorney has requested an interview with the patent examiner on February 8, 2025. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-dev-pocketpair-publishing-interest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocketpair Publishing</a> is now live. Palworld received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-spring-festival-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five new skins</a> for the Spring Festival. Do you think Nintendo’s new patent help them in their lawsuit against Palworld?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

Embracer said Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 did particularly well on Steam, where it saw over 250,000 peak concurrent players. For context, the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance hit a peak Steam concurrent player count of 96,069 seven years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s actual peak concurrent player count will be bigger, given the game launched on console as well as PC. However, neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer, which owns Warhorse Studios via its subsidiary, Plaion, said Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 “has been initially successful, not only in terms of player and critic reception, but also in terms of performance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This reflects the dedication and hard work of our development studio, Warhorse Studios, and our publisher, Deep Silver,” Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is our strong belief that the game will continue to generate substantial revenues over the coming years, highlighting the exceptional quality, immersion and appeal of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Warhorse Studios has a robust roadmap, including updates and new content over the next 12 months, ensuring an engaging and continuously evolving experience for the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are immensely proud of the teams involved in the successful release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which has significantly outperformed our expectations so far,” Wingefors added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Embracer has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> due out later this quarter (January to March 2025). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer said it has more than 5,000 game developers working on its upcoming games, with 10 triple-A games due out over the next three financial years (FY 2025/26, FY 2026/27, and FY 2027/28). Eight of these are from internal studios, two from external studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In FY 2025/26, Embracer has two triple-A games scheduled to be released towards the end of the financial year. Mid-size releases include Gothic 1 Remake, REANIMAL, Fellowship, Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, Titan Quest II, Screamer, Echoes of the End (working title), Tides of Tomorrow, Satisfactory (console) and the full release of Wreckfest 2, alongside a similar number of mid-sized games yet to be announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer has endured a tough time in recent years, laying off thousands of staff and selling a number of its studios, including Borderlands maker Gearbox and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive. It still owns Metro developer 4A Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metro-developer-makes-clear-playstation-vr2-game-awakening-isnt-next-mainline-metro-game"><u>which is working on a brand new game in the series</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting started in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?

<p>Players who made in-app purchases in January 2024 or later will be able to request a refund via Apple Support.</p>
<p>The game is no longer available to download. Though free-to-play, it included in-app purchases for the full version of the game ($24.99) and individual DLCs.</p>
<p>Crystal Chronicles was first released for the GameCube in 2003, but sales suffered due to the need for a complex Game Boy Advance setup to fully enjoy. The game was then remastered for Switch, PS4, Android and iOS in 2020.</p>
<p>Square Enix has confirmed the other versions of the game remain unaffected.</p>
<p>The news follows other mobile games shut down by Square Enix in the past couple of years, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-final-fantasy-mobile-game-ends-global-service-this-time-the-one-with-ariana-grande">Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dissidia-final-fantasy-opera-omnia-will-shut-next-year">Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> battle royale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-mobile-battle-royale-the-first-soldier-shuts-down-next-year">The First Soldier</a>.</p>
<p>These were all shut down due to declining player numbers. While Crystal Chronicles has suffered from this purchase bug, Square Enix clearly did not deem it worthy of fully fixing, perhaps due to similarly low player numbers.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">latest financial report</a>, Square Enix revealed net sales of its mobile games had plummeted by over 32 percent, owing to the closure of these games.</p>
<p>However, profits from mobile games remain higher than its HD games (console and PC), and are further dwarfed by MMO profits.</p>
<p>That's a key reason the company is developing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-officially-revealed">mobile version of Final Fantasy 14</a>, though it's set to be free-to-play and won't include gacha mechanics.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The first look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> gameplay has finally arrived with a new trailer shown during the latest State of Play presentation.</p>
<p>The trailer, which can be watched below, introduces the new main character, the renowned Miyamoto Musashi, as he fights his way through some zombie samurai using his sword and taking advantage of the environment. The grounded combat system, in particular, feels like a welcome change over the vast majority of modern action games featuring over-the-top elements and looks markedly Onimusha. Hopefully, during the course of the adventure, we will be able to employ the Niten Ichi-ryū combat style that Musashi created and perfected during his life that was absent from this initial gameplay showcase.</p>

<p>Besides featuring a new Onimusha: Way of the Sword trailer, yesterday's State of Play presentation also featured a new Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny trailer which provided another look at the recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-spotlights-new-monster-hunter-wilds-trailer-onimusha-way-of-the-sword-release-window/"> announced</a> remaster of the second entry in the CAPCOM series. You can check out Jubei Yaguy in action with higher resolution graphics and other visual improvements below.</p>

I had Hell Is Us vaguely pegged as an "arty" game, but then I watched the new release date trailer, which begins with Adam Jensen('s voice actor) grizzly-grunting that "when the fury of emotions sparks the wildfire of violence, it dissolves our illusions and exposes the fragile structure of reality". And I realised that, no, this is some glorious nonsense. Maximum ham. High-concept cheeseville. Pseudostravaganza. I mean all these phrases as compliments. Come now - let your illusions dissolve as the fragile structure of your reality is exposed by the wildfire violence of this furious trailer!

<p>
In less excitable language, Hell Is Us is a third-person action-adventure with a mix of melee combat featuring lightsabers and drones, exploration featuring a mix of rundown military and otherworldly architecture, and narrative sequences featuring fellahs with flappy double chins.</p>
<p>You play Rémi, who is voiced by the afore-referenced Elias Toufexis, and is on "a quest to find his origins in a country" both "ravaged by civil war" and full of "supernatural creatures reminiscent of ancient headstones and monuments". The game is the work of Rogue Factor with Nacon publishing, and its creative and artistic director is no less a lofty luminary than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête. 
</p>
<p>
It looks a bit like a weaponised <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, with notes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> and Tom Clancy. It's also got something called "player-plattering", which I don't entirely understand.
</p>
<p>
"Through its Player-Plattering approach incentivizing players to follow their instincts rather than markers, the title aims to return to the roots of adventure games," the press release explains. "It encourages reflection and observation by eliminating all forms of intrusive assistance." Is this some kind of minimal-output HUD mode, perhaps? The term "plattering" makes me feel like I'm going to be eating other players for dinner. Which I guess would be an intriguing mechanic.</p>
<p>Oh hang on, Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hell-is-us-wants-to-make-its-action-adventuring-more-old-school-than-elden-ring">spoke to Jacques-Belletête about player-plattering in 2022</a>. And yes, it appears to be about allowing players to navigate and explore with reference to things and people within the world, rather than forcing you to use a magic mapping tool or follow a breadcrumb trail.
</p>
<p>
We'll find out for sure on 4th September 2025. Always happy to see Toufexis in a starring role, simply because he has such overt Main Character Voice that it confuses and alarms me when I find him playing a side character in other games, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>.

			<p>Over a year after its debut on PC, Shift Up's Stellar Blade will finally release on PC in a few months, alongside new DLC.</p>
<p>During yesterday's State of Play presentation, the Korean studio confirmed that the action game will launch on PC this June. Following the announcement, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3489700/Stellar_Blade/">Steam store page</a> also went live, but it sadly did not reveal any additional information on the PC version or the system requirements.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the PC version of Stellar Blade will be accompanied by the launch of a new GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE DLC, which, much like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-photo-mode/">NieR Automata DLC</a> released last year, will bring two different franchises together in an explosive collaboration. You can check out the new DLC in action in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PlayStation 5 and will launch on PC this June. You can learn more about the excellent action game by Shift Up in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title, and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 is doing great on the market and has sold an impressive number of units in the past quarter, bringing its total units sold well past the 60 million units point.</p>
<p>In Sony's latest financial report covering the third quarter of the current fiscal year, it has been confirmed that the PlayStation 5 had its best quarter to date in terms of sales, having sold 9.5 million units, bringing the total of units sold to 75 million. In terms of software sales, Sony reported 96 million units sold, a solid increase over the 89.7 million units sold during the third quarter of the previous fiscal year. Both hardware and software sales contributed to the record operating profits in the third quarter of the year.</p>
<p>In terms of user engagement, the PlayStation 5 is also doing quite well. 42% of new console purchases have come from new users, bringing the total number of active users to 129 million users, which Sony is looking to increase further by diversifying its lineup with family and live service games. Regarding new releases, it was <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-q3-ond-fy3-2025-financial-results-hw-9-5m-sw-95m-ltd-75m.1107987/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that both Ghost of Yotei and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach are still scheduled for a 2025 release, which is definitely reassuring, considering both did not make an appearance during yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-state-of-play-confirmed-for-february-12th/">State of Play presentation.</a></p>
<p>The full detailed report, which goes over other Sony business segments besides PlayStation, can be found <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q3_supplement.pdf">here.</a></p>

            <p>
Slashy soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> is not quite <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> but it's the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">closest we have got on PC</a> so far. Now, developers Round8 have revealed a snowy expansion for the game. Lies Of P: Overture was shown off during last night's State of Play showcase, in a trailer introducing the creeps and kittens you'll be meeting in this puppety prequel DLC. But enough stringing you along, here's the video.

<p>This DLC was previously teased (as our sister site <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-as-game-director-teases-dlc">Eurogamer once noted</a>) but this is the first glimpse we've got of its setting. It'll see you explore the wintry city of Krat as it lives out its "final days of haunting, late-19th-century Belle Époque beauty". There are carnivals, cats, and columns of steel. "As Geppetto’s deadly puppet, you’ll journey through Krat and its surroundings, uncover hidden backstories, and face epic battles that shape the past and future of Lies of P."
</p>
<p>The puppet's original outing made for a pretty slick soulslike, according to Ed (RPS in peace). "Lies Of P might lack some of the presence of its main inspiration," he said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">his review</a>, "and not all of its parts come together to form a cohesive whole, but the game is an undeniable must for Soulslikers who crave the dark. It's perhaps the closest any Soulslike has felt to a FromSoft game, in everything from its presentation to the cadence of your character's jog."</p>
<p>Aha, that'd be why it got on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">10 best soulslikes</a>. Round8 are also reportedly working on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-game-from-the-lies-of-p-studio-sounds-like-it-might-just-fill-a-dead-space-shaped-hole-in-my-heart">unannounced sci-fi horror game</a> as well as a direct sequel to Lies Of P. That sounds like a lot of work, but who knows, we might still see all those come out before FromSoft manage to bring their traipse through Yarnham to our envious machines. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
