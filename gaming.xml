There was no TikTok, DLC was still a relatively new concept on consoles, <em>Fortnite</em> didn‚Äôt exist, and covid-19 wasn‚Äôt a thing. But what if <em>Skyrim </em>launched in 2024? And what if it was written and developed by 13-year-olds? Well, you don‚Äôt have to wonder, because YouTuber CJMattis has created a video that presents us with that alternate timeline. </p><p>Using AI-generated voices, CJMattis has rewritten <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-rogue-bee-kept-breaking-skyrims-iconic-cart-intro-1847504734&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-rogue-bee-kept-breaking-skyrims-iconic-cart-intro-1847504734">the famous intro to <em>Skyrim</em></a></span><em> </em>in which you wake up on a wagon alongside a few other captured prisoners as you all await your execution. Now all the characters use ‚ÄúGen Alpha Slang,‚Äù according to the video‚Äôs title. </p><p>So instead of saying ‚ÄúWatch your tongue!‚Äù when someone in the cart speaks poorly of Ulfric Stormcloak, we get ‚ÄúCheck your vibes!‚Äù When the person realizes who they are talking to they freak out, saying: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the leader of the rizz-bellion!‚Äù At another point, someone asks what gooncave someone is from after he starts to panic and yell out, ‚ÄúNo, this is cap. This must be cap.‚Äù </p><p>Here‚Äôs the original <em>Skyrim </em>intro in case you want to compare.</p><p>I do think that some of the ‚ÄúGen Alpha‚Äù slang in this video is actually much older internet speak, like ratioed and doxx. And I‚Äôm not sure a reference to Twitch streamer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-elden-ring-stream-marathon-malenia-1851484479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-elden-ring-stream-marathon-malenia-1851484479">Kai Cenat</a></span> is slang, but hey, what do I know? I‚Äôm an old man. Besides, the main point of the video is to rot your brain, and it does a solid job of that. </p><p>Although, personally, I don‚Äôt mind kids using new words because that‚Äôs how this whole language thing works. That‚Äôs how this has always worked. The youth develop new words and phrases, their parents and teachers roll their eyes, and then 10 years later those kids‚Äînow teens‚Äîroll their eyes at the new kids and their fresh slang. Repeat until the heat death of the universe. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/24/playback-outland/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><em>Nearly 10 years on, the Playback series returns to revisit games from years past.</em></p>
<p>In 2011, Housemarque released Outland, its unique and only 2D platformer. It tends to be overlooked within the company‚Äôs impressive catalogue of games, overshadowed by hits like Resogun, Super Stardust Delta, and Returnal. Nevertheless, Outland emerged during a phase of experimentation for Housemarque, and its impact is noticeable in many later titles, from the particle-like graphics that distinguished Resogun to the varied enemy styles that may have inspired those in Returnal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Outland - Reveal Trailer [Europe]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bcc949DAWPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Outland has also been in my Steam library for years, languishing with zero minutes of play, so I decided to finally sit down and give it a go. You play as a nameless Hero who has visions of a battle from 30,000 years ago which sees another nameless hero fight the Sisters of Light &amp; Dark, before imprisoning them. The Sisters are nearing their escape, and your character, a descendant of the original Hero, is charged with the task of preventing their escape and thwarting their plans to destroy the world. To be honest, while it‚Äôs narrated well enough, Outland‚Äôs story is not particularly engrossing or interesting, playing into all-too-familiar story beats.</p>
<p>What Outland did do when it released was play on the dual identity of the Hero, who can switch between red and blue forms. These forms correspond to the light and dark forms of the Sisters and plays into the gameplay too. The different zones have enemies and puzzles that are colour-coded red and blue, so your character‚Äôs colour matters. In Outland, the red form can combat blue enemies and navigate through red traps with minimal damage, and the blue form has the same capabilities. The game gradually introduces this mechanic, increasing the difficulty level as you progress. Initially, you get accustomed to the basic controls, but soon you will be leaping across colour-coded platforms, needing to switch between red and blue forms swiftly. While the combat is relatively basic, even with the colour-switching element, and the variety of enemies is decent, the game‚Äôs boss fights are less compelling, ranging from tedious, like the golem encounters, to frustrating, such as a dragon battle.</p>

<p>Abilities are unlocked progressively in the game, from granting players a charge attack to moving up to a beam attack capable of eliminating multiple enemies or inflicting significant damage on bosses. Additionally, you can unlock environmental features such as teleporters, which provide access to previously visited levels, and leap pads that allow exploration of new world areas. Earning coins by exploring and defeating enemies enables you to enhance the hero‚Äôs health and increase the hero‚Äôs abilities‚Äô charge capacity. However, obtaining these upgrades in Outland is not straightforward; it‚Äôs not merely a matter of accessing a menu and allocating points. Players must venture through Outland to discover upgrade statues, which are often hidden away from the main paths.</p>

<p>Outland‚Äôs visual design still holds up today, and there are moments where you see how the decisions made in Outland have influenced the future games, as well as building on the Housemarque games that came before. The final boss has designs elements that would not look out of place from Resogun or Returnal, and you cna see the developer‚Äôs trademark style starting to form. The music also deserves a special mention, elevating even those boring fights into something more frantic and engaging. It just sets up that some of these battles are meant to be epic in scale, and the final boss theme is incredible, even if the fight itself is basic.</p>
<p>Outland has become one of those games that‚Äôs increasingly difficult to add to your games library. It‚Äôs no longer available on Steam or the PlayStation Network, but you can still purchase it on the Xbox Store. Alternatively, you can obtain a physical Xbox 360 copy through the Ubisoft Triple Pack, which includes Outland, From Dust, and Beyond Good &amp; Evil HD, which has backward compatibility.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-the-ronin-cat-stats<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a set of statistics showing how players engaged with&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>'s various activities, and the game's cat quest has proven surprisingly (or perhaps completely unsurprisingly) popular.</p>
<p>While Sony and Team Ninja's open-world epic has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-showcases-dynamic-storytelling-player-choices-and-bonds-with-characters">deep historical narrative to discover</a> and plenty of the developer's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-combat-deep-dive">signature action</a> to enjoy, it turns out that finding and cuddling every cat in the game is an important activity for a number of players.</p>
<p>According to Sony, 16% of&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>players collected every cat. That's 100 cats in total, which is a lot of wandering around Edo-period Japan. I haven't played this one yet, but I'll definitely be adding to this statistic when I do.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rise-of-the-ronin-cat-stats-gun.jpg?itok=G4wY0kfS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rise-of-the-ronin-cat-stats-gun.jpg?itok=V7EUOzsJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>may have plenty of killing in it, but cats are more diverting.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's cats have proven so popular that in the latest update, a feature was added whereby you can get reacquainted with cats you've already met near Usugumo Dayu, so you can while away your hours simply loving cats and refusing to engage with the story. What a rush!</p>
<p>If you're not a cat lover, then there are plenty of other interesting statistics to pore over. Be aware that minor story spoilers for&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>follow, so if you're looking to go in without knowing anything, avert your eyes.</p>
<p>When given the choice between sparing or killing Gonzo in the main story, 35% of players chose to kill him, while 65% chose to spare him. 62% of players sided with the shogunate and 38% with anti-shogunate forces, which surprises me.</p>
<p>51% of&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>players opted for Dusk, the game's "normal" difficulty mode, while 36% played on the easier Dawn difficulty and 13% opted to challenge themselves by playing on the Twilight mode.</p>

<h2>Give Team Ninja's latest a try yourself with the&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>demo</h2>
<p>These <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/24/explore-the-top-choices-in-rise-of-the-ronin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fascinating statistics</a> aren't all you're getting by way of&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>goodies today.</p>
<p>If you're yet to check out&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>, you'll be pleased to know that a demo is now available <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/rise-of-the-ronin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the PlayStation Store</a>, so you can see whether this one is for you or not.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-humble-games-situation-gets-messier-with-claims-of-lies-and-damage-control/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p><strong>UPDATE (12:05 PM ET):</strong> Humble Games has denied using AI to write the statement put out by the company regarding the layoffs and restructuring. </p>



<p>In addition to that, a spokesperson for the company says that ‚ÄúHumble Games and Ziff Davis are not commenting further about the ongoing restructuring at this time.‚Äù</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong>: On Tuesday it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/humble-games-lays-off-entire-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed that layoffs were happening</a> at Humble Games, a subsidiary of IGN Entertainment. Despite many believing it was a closure of the publishing studio, the company put out a statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/humble-games-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying that it was a ‚Äúrestructure‚Äù</a> rather than a closure of Humble Games.</p>



<p>Now, nearly 24 hours later, the situation is only getting messier. </p>



<p>On Tuesday, former Humble Bundle creative lead Chris Radley <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221616554927411200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on LinkedIn</a> that what was happening was ‚ÄúNOT a restructuring of operations. This is a total shutdown of Humble Games.‚Äù</p>



<p>He continued: <em>‚ÄúOperations have been handed off to a third party consultancy. NO staff are left. DO NOT believe this AI message written by the parent company of Humble Games, Ziff Davis, who are trying to mitigate pushback. This was ONCE AGAIN a failure of leadership across the board, and once again hard working talented staff are paying the cost for their poor decisions. Every ex-employee is being gaslit by this narrative and its so disrespectful.‚Äù</em></p>



<p>What‚Äôs more is that <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aftermath</a> was sent a recording that confirmed that all current Humble Games projects would be handled by The Powell Group, a third-party company.</p>



<p>Steve Horowitz, president of technology and shopping at Ziff Davis, said that the company failed multiple times to sell Humble Games before deciding to shut it down. Horowitz said that attempts to sell the company didn‚Äôt produce ‚Äúa viable offer or outcome‚Äù.</p>



<p>He then went on to say that the company has seen ‚Äúan additional millions increase in development expenses‚Äù leading to a ‚Äúvery tough but necessary decision to restructure all of Humble Games‚Äù.</p>



<p>‚ÄúAs such, we‚Äôre gonna be using a third-party to help us manage the slate moving forward, as well as the back catalog,‚Äù Horowitz said. ‚ÄúAs a result, all roles within Humble Games are gonna be impacted.‚Äù</p>



<p>Despite being called a ‚Äúrestructure‚Äù, there are no employees left at Humble Games. The company, for all intents and purposes, is no more aside from a name. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has once again reached out to IGN Entertainment and their parent company Ziff Davis for more clarification. Specially, we have asked about the claims that the statement was written by AI and how the company will move forward with no employees.</p>



<p>Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-tease-desert-biome-possibly-coming-to-reload/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-leaks-tease-desert-biome-possibly-coming-to-reload.935664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-tease-desert-biome-possibly-coming-to-reload/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1816128743888609327" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, reliable leaker HYPEX supported leaks by SpushFNBR and KPMisParrot that tease the Desert Biome may be coming to Reload. </p>



<p>Loosely translated from the post <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1816126192711524462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by SpushFNBR</a>, a material with the same codename as Chapter 1‚Äôs desert biome was modified in version 30.30. </p>



<p>This implies that the Fortnite team could be working on reintroducing the desert biome. SamLeakss, also notable for Fortnite leaks, further supported the desert biome should be added to Reload ‚Äúsoon.‚Äù</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The desert biome of chapter one remains a beloved and nostalgic area, though it didn‚Äôt offer many named locations. </p>



<p>Fortnite Reload is the 40-player Battle Royale game with central reboot mechanics. It continues to thrive well enough, though fans are looking forward to another big update for Reload.</p>



<p>In addition to Reload, other recent Fortnite leaks pointed to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-introduce-a-deadpool-wolverine-bundle-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential tie-in bundle</a> for the upcoming film Deadpool and Wolverine. </p>



<p>Just today, Fortnite did update its X social account with artwork teasing a Deadpool takeover. This adds a lot of validity to previous leaks about the bundle.</p>



<p>Fortnite just released its massive v30.30 update this week. The update introduces a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fall-guys-collaboration-arrives-in-uefn-following-delay/">Fall Guys collaboration</a>, a new season of Rocket Racing, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rocket-league-adding-tesla-cybertruck-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divisive Tesla Cybertruck</a>.</p>



<p>At this time, the Fortnite team did not officially confirm anything about the desert biome making a big return.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/24/dungeons-and-kingdoms-mixes-medieval-fantasy-with-polygonal-dungeon-delving/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We do enjoy a good bit of medieval fantasy at TheSixthAxis, so we welcome with open arms the announcements of Dungeons and Kingdoms, a game that is seemingly about building up your domain, or kingdom, and then adventuring down into some dark, mine-like areas. Possibly dungeons. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with a Ronseal-like name for a game though, and if you like both of those things too, we‚Äôre off to a good start.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dungeons and Kingdoms | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hrNzDad5Fg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer sees you astride your polygonal mount, surveying the landscape, before giving us a taste of what you‚Äôll need to do to turn a tiny village into a full-blown kingdom, starting with chopping down trees (doesn‚Äôt it always?) and building wooden huts, before going off in search of great wealth and treasure by heading into a dungeon to fight off evil creatures like skeletons, giant snake beasts and the odd dragon.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs definitely got it‚Äôs own unique art style going on, and it‚Äôs looks as though you‚Äôre going to be able to really get into the nitty-gritty of building and adventuring, with hopefully an array of different tools and building types to work on. You can either work on things yourself, or become a lord by ordering all the lowly serfs to do it for you instead.</p>
<p>Alongside building things up, you can manipulate the landscape, creating hills, mountains, rivers and moats to bring your kingdom to life, and make it truly your own. Besides that, you can farm for crops, hunt wild animals, and create the infrastructure needed for an expanding kingdom</p>


<p>While there‚Äôs no set date for release, the development team at Uncle Grouch Gaming are eying up an Early Access launch in either Q4 2024 or Q1 2025, with a demo showcase due in an upcoming Steam Next Fest.</p>
<p>You can wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3092110/Dungeons__Kingdoms/">Dungeons and Kingdoms right now on Steam</a>, and stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more!</p>

			<p>Delta Force: Hawk Ops is a free-to-play platformer with tactical shooter elements. The developers behind it have officially announced that the official Alpha Test for the game will be open for players to participate in as of August 6. They are expecting a big turnout for the Alpha test, as over 600,000 people have wishlisted the game on Steam and the Epic Games Store thus far.</p>
<p>For those who want to see what <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-qa-early-access-in-october-release-window-in-q1-2025/">Delta Force: Hawk Ops</a> is all about, you will need to sign up to participate in the <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha test</a>, where you can experience two game modes: Hazard Operations and Havoc Warfare. Signing up for the Alpha test is easy, as you have to go to the official website for Delta Force: Hawk Ops and register your interest in participating. Alternatively, you can go to the Steam webpage for the game and register interest there. Finally, you can follow the developers on X, where they will be announcing a Twitch Drop of codes for people interested in taking part in the Alpha test for Delta Force: Hawk Ops.</p>
<p>The developers behind the newest iteration in the Delta Force franchise have released a small statement expressing their joy with seeing how hugely anticipated this upcoming game is. "We are immensely grateful for the incredible support and enthusiasm shown by our community. Hitting 600,000 wishlists is a remarkable achievement, and we couldn't have done it without our dedicated players," said Shadow Guo, the Game Director at Team Jade.</p>
<p>The two modes available in the alpha test are wildly different. Havoc Warfare is a large-scale battle with multiple teams battling it on gigantic maps. You can utilize an arsenal of weaponry and military vehicles, such as tanks and Aircraft, to get the advantage over your opponent.</p>
<p>Hazard Operations has players split off into rival teams. They have to take on AI-controlled mercenaries and Royal Guards, and random events happen across the map to allow the teams to gain an advantage. There are two maps for players to explore and various PvE challenges to overcome to reign victorious.</p>
<p>The latest iteration of the Delta Force franchise is still in relatively early stages of development. For those interested, the game will be available on PC, Console, and Mobile. Not only will there be a variety of multiplayer activities to participate in, but there will also be a high-intensity single-player and co-op campaign that you can play through if you're looking to get more of a story fix to your game. The campaign is inspired by the 2001 Ridley Scott movie Black Hawk Down.</p>

<p>Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/24/gran-turismo-7-update-1-49-brings-six-new-cars-updated-physics-simulation-model-and-more-on-july-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has announced the next</a> Gran Turismo 7 update for all players, and it includes a number of new cars along with changes to the game‚Äôs physics model. </p>



<p>Starting with the new cars, six new vehicles are coming to the game. In a mix of old and new, Gran Turismo 7 will see the following cars added:</p>



<ul>
<li>BMW M3 ‚Äô97</li>



<li>Ferrari 430 Scuderia ‚Äô07</li>



<li>Genesis X Gran Racer Vision Gran Turismo Concept</li>



<li>Lamborghini Gallardo LP 560-4 ‚Äò08</li>

</p></figure>



<p>Moving on to the physics model, Sony says it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmajor update‚Äù to the system for the game.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThis update mainly affects the suspension physics model and tire physical calculation model resulting in much more natural weight shifting during cornering,‚Äù Sony said. ‚ÄúTire response has also been improved, along with more realistic tire heating and wear. Look forward to more dynamic car movement and a further polished driving feel.‚Äù</p>



<p>Other updates to Gran Turismo 7 include new menus in the GT Cafe, new World Circuits, Pokal wheel brand to GT Auto, and new AI agent named Gran Turismo Sophy.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-shareholder-qa</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcoms-latest-shareholder-q-a-is-a-terrifying-indictment-of-capitalism.935580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-shareholder-qa<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released its latest shareholder Q&amp;A summary, and while some of the questions asked by shareholders are perfectly sane and sensible, there are some that truly beggar belief.</p>
<p>The summary&nbsp;gives Capcom shareholders a chance to ask the company pertinent questions about its operations, and if you ask me, some of those questions truly demonstrate that some Capcom shareholders don't appear to know the first thing about video games or how they're made.</p>
<p>One shareholder, for instance, asks Capcom whether it wouldn't be more prudent, from a profit perspective, to bump the release date of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>up from 2025 to "the December 2024 holiday season". Why didn't every other studio ever think of that?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-shareholder-qa-slope.jpg?itok=CundxPcY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-shareholder-qa-slope.jpg?itok=1zsQ8zqk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A Capcom shareholder wants to know why Capcom doesn't just release&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>earlier. Genius!</figcaption></figure><p>The studio's response is characteristically patient. Capcom simply says that it will announce&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' release date "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-summer-capcom">once preparations are complete</a>" and reiterates the studio's commitment to a goal of 10% or better profit growth each year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, another shareholder asks whether the gaming giant has thought about engaging in a share buyback scheme in order to ensure "the current share price is appropriate" and that share prices aren't "simply left to the market".</p>
<p>Capcom's response to this question is fairly stock; it says that it typically engages in share buyback schemes and the like "after comprehensively considering several factors". Given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-layoffs-share-buyback">state of the industry right now</a>, I can't say I'm particularly sad Capcom doesn't seem to have any plans in this direction.</p>
<p>One shareholder asks Capcom about whether&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>will be limited to "non-portable consoles", which is, on the surface, a reference to the Switch, but which could also be read as an attempt to perhaps tease some information out regarding the Switch's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">much-talked-about successor</a>. No such luck, sadly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mega-man-11-capcom-shareholder-qa.jpg?itok=yv4g3OeI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mega-man-11-capcom-shareholder-qa.jpg?itok=T98Tl-vn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Capcom says it's "considering" how to make more&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>Some shareholders have some pretty pertinent questions for Capcom. One asks about what's in the pipeline for&nbsp;<em>Mega Man</em>, for instance, to which the studio responds that it is "considering how to create games" for the franchise.</p>
<p>Another wonders why Capcom hasn't made a cozy game yet, and while I can't say I'm personally sad about this, I can't deny there would be a significant market for it. Who doesn't want to chill with a cute Palico in Raccoon City?</p>
<p>It's worth reading the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/assets/pdf/stock/2024capcom_d.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full shareholder Q&amp;A</a> if you want to see what kind of issues the shareholders hold close to their hearts, and also if you want to know why shareholders probably shouldn't be allowed any kind of creative control over games.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/team-folon-tease-fallout-londons-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/team-folon-tease-fallout-london%E2%80%99s-release.935574/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/team-folon-tease-fallout-londons-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just over a year ago, Team FOLON uploaded a video of the song "I Just Can't Wait (For Tomorrow)" to their YouTube channel, which will be heard on the Fallout: London radio in-game. As of today, the developers behind the expansive mod posted this song on their Discord server, which is home to over 50,000 members with only a handful of moderators to take care of the entire server.</p>
<p>Since they posted this, fans are excitedly waiting for the release of Fallout: London, which is expected to be released tomorrow, as the song suggests. However, they have not officially confirmed a date, so this is speculation.</p>
<p>The Fallout: London mod is a complete overhaul of Fallout 4, allowing players to explore a brand-new universe in a familiar game. The mod is hosted by GOG.com, and players can access it from the GOG mod launcher. This mod takes players through many different boroughs of London, each with unique traits and aesthetics.</p>
<p>The mod introduces some very well-known voices to breathe life into the characters of the mod, such as Neil Newbon from Baldur's Gate 3, Colin Baker from Doctor Who, and John Bercow, who was Speaker of the House of Commons from 2009 to 2019, and is now reprising his role as a Speaker in Fallout: London.</p>
<p>With the release of the next-gen update for Fallout 4, players who have purchased the game through the Epic Games Store <a href="https://wccftech.com/gog-confirms-fallout-london-wont-be-playable-through-epic-games-store-versions-of-fallout-4/">can no longer access</a> the mod unless it is purchased directly through Steam or the GOG.com store. This is because players must be able to roll back the Next Gen update, which resulted in Team FOLON having to redo the coding for the mod entirely, as it isn't compatible with the Next Gen update. However, the current version of the mod is compatible with the game pre-update. As it stands, Team FOLON is working on a version of the mod that will be compatible with the Next Gen update, but it may take a while for that to be realized, as they found out at the very last second about the update being released.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://fallout4london.com/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FAQ</a> listed on the official Fallout: London website, players must make a new save entirely to explore the mod in full, as pre-existing quests that players will have completed in their previous save can cause issues with the mod.</p>
<p>If the Fallout: London Discord post is true, it means that the full release of Fallout: London is just around the corner for excited players to get stuck into.</p>

<h2 id="h-personalized-3d-audio-profiles">Personalized 3D Audio Profiles</h2>



<p>This new feature allows players to create a personalized 3D audio profile for headphones and earbuds. Players invited to the PS5 beta can run sound quality tests to analyze many factors to create an audio profile that best suits their hearing characteristics. For example, players will have a ‚Äúbetter sense of the positions of characters and objects in a game world more clearly than before,‚Äù which helps enhance immersion.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>To access this feature, players must go to Settings, Sound, and 3D Audio headphones on the PS5 console. Then, follow the steps on the screen to create and save their audio profile. Players can create one audio profile per user and also select from the 3D Audio presets if they wish to.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-remote-play-settings">Remote Play Settings</h2>



<p>The PS5 Beta also adds new Remote Play settings per user, allowing them to choose individuals to connect to their console through this feature.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-producer-says-game-wont-be-another-run-of-the-mill-anime-fighter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>During Anime Expo 2024, Bandai Namco shocked fans by announcing a brand new 3D fighting game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-new-bandai-namco-fighting-game-trailer-anime-expo"><u>Bleach Rebirth of Souls</u></a>. Much like Bandai Namco‚Äôs other hotly-anticipated anime fighter, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-hands-off-preview-and-new-details-revealed-at-gamescom-latam"><u>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</u></a>, it's been well over a decade since we‚Äôve last seen a Bleach game, and expectations for it are understandably at an all-time high.  </p><p>Piggybacking off Bleach Rebirth of Soul‚Äôs newly released gameplay trailer, which saw a recreation of Ichigo Kurosaki‚Äôs battle against Byakuya Kuchiki, IGN spoke with producer Katsuaki Tsuzuki about how the game will differentiate itself from other titles in the series and what players can expect out of its swordplay-centric combat once it releases on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.</p><p>Anime arena fighters have a track record of having a short shelf life in players' minds, in part because their gameplay <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-deserves-more-than-run-of-the-mill-arena-fighters"><u>tends to lack depth</u></a> beyond the bread-and-butter strategies that are sussed out within the honeymoon period of their release. Tsuzuki says Rebirth of Souls will distinguish itself from the pack by incorporating the anime‚Äôs intricate power systems into the DNA of its gameplay, resulting in an enthralling ebb and flow of mechanically-rich battles. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>‚ÄúWhile developing the game as a fighting action game, we delved into details from Bleach like reishi, konpaku, spiritual power, and spiritual pressure. After looking into that, we were surprised by how the worldview had been created in detail and how well those features aligned with our game concept and the fighting action genre," Tsuzuki said.</p><p>"For example, konpaku, which represents the concept of the soul in Bleach, is constructed with reishi. Drawing inspiration from that concept, we set reishi as a health gauge in the game, and players can break the konpaku to decrease reishi," he added." We introduced systems that allow players to experience reversals such as breaking konpaku with a single strike or enhancing power through transformations to facilitate breaks.‚Äù </p><p>In action game layman's terms, Rebirth of Soul‚Äôs combat is like a pastiche Sekiro‚Äôs stagger swordplay, Tekken 7 reversals, and Smash Bros. Ultimate‚Äôs stock health bar system, wherein players win battles by destroying an opponent‚Äôs 9 stocks or konpaku. Although Tsuzuki referred to established action games like the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm games, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jojos-bizarre-adventure-all-star-battle-r-review">JoJo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/02/tekken-7-review">Tekken 7</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/22/dragon-ball-fighterz-review">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> when making Rebirth of Souls, Rebirth of Souls feel authentically Bleach to fans new and old.</p><p>"I know that Bleach is loved by fans worldwide, so I have been eager for the opportunity to work with this IP," Tsuzuki says. "We know that there is strong enthusiasm from Bleach fans, and I wanted to develop a new Bleach game for modern high-spec platforms, especially since it is also around the timing of the 20th anniversary of Bleach."</p><h2>A balanced shonen fighting game</h2><p>Arguably the most difficult challenge in making Rebirth of Souls was integrating major tenets of the anime‚Äôs unique power systems. While Rebirth of Souls‚Äô naming conventions may prove intimidating to prospective players on first blush, Tsuzuki stressed that players won‚Äôt be required to have an overfamiliarity with Bleach‚Äôs encyclopedic power structure to enjoy the game and eke out a victory. Rebirth of Souls will also come with a comprehensive in-game play guide, tutorials, and a user-friendly battle UI to make it easy to understand, akin to standard action games to ensure first-time players aren‚Äôt lost in the sauce of Bleach‚Äôs unique flavor of shonen anime power schemes.  </p><p>In contrast to Sparking! Zero, whose producer hinted that the game would reflect the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-is-delightfully-unbalanced-and-definitely-not-an-esports-game-so-the-devs-had-to-find-a-unique-approach-to-ranked-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>anime ensemble‚Äôs power scaling with unbalanced battles</u></a>, Rebirth of Souls characters were designed to have an equal win rate with another. </p><p>‚ÄúOur game concept revolves around the reversal experience and each character is really unique, especially their zanpakuto [the weapons wielded by Bleach's Shinigami], which offers multifaceted abilities,‚Äù Tsuzuki said. ‚ÄúEach character retains distinct features: some characters excel in speed, while others focus on heavy power, and some are good at attacking from distance. </p><p>‚ÄúAdditionally, each character can enhance their abilities through Awakening. In that regard, some characters are easy to handle, even for casual gamers, while others cater more [to] core action gamers,‚Äù Tsuzuki added. ‚ÄúHowever, every character has the chance to reverse the situation, ensuring that all have an equal chance to win.‚Äù</p><p>Historically, Bleach has been noticeably out of the gaming zeitgeist in comparison to its fellow ‚Äúbig three‚Äù shonen contemporaries, Naruto and One Piece. As mentioned earlier, it's been 13 years since Bleach characters have graced a video game‚Äîthat is if you don‚Äôt count their appearance in 2019‚Äôs anime Oscars-esque arena fighter, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/jump-force-review"><u>Jump Force</u></a>. The last fully-fledged Bleach game was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/07/28/bleach-soul-resurreccion-review"><u>Bleach: Soul Resurrecci√≥n</u></a> for the PlayStation 3. Bleach: Soul Resurreccion received <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/07/28/bleach-soul-resurreccion-review"><u>middling reviews from critics including our own</u></a>, where we said the game had a simple yet enjoyable Dynasty Warriors-esque combat system that players wouldn‚Äôt be missing out on if they passed it up.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls - Announcement Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>As far as the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù are concerned time hasn‚Äôt slowed down their output of games with recently released titles like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naruto-x-boruto-ultimate-ninja-storm-connections-review"><u>Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-piece-odyssey-review"><u>One Piece: Odyssey </u></a>‚Äî a classic turn-based action RPG that Tsuzuki produced. When approaching Bleach Rebirth of Souls, Tsuzuki said the upcoming anime action game will be an exception to the trend of anime action games by having a combat system that is as complex as its beautifully rendered 3D models.</p><p>‚ÄúEach of the previous Bleach games published by the other companies have different features and all of them capture the charm of Bleach. The development team played these games before starting the development of Bleach Rebirth of Souls and really enjoyed them. We learned the core features of Bleach like bankai, and integrated them into the necessary components of an action game,‚Äù Tsuzuki said. ‚ÄúThanks to the capabilities of new-generation platforms, we tried to create a Bleach game that delivers cutting-edge visual expression in battle.‚Äù</p><p>Although Bleach has one of the largest casts of characters in shonen anime with more personalities and power sets being introduced in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bleach-thousand-year-blood-war-part-3-will-air-in-october-2024">Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War, </a>‚Äî the anime's sequel series which adapts the manga's final arc ‚Äî Rebirth of Souls will only feature characters from the anime‚Äôs first two story arcs, Soul Reaper and Arrancar arc. </p><p>‚ÄúThis is the first Bleach game that Bandai as a company is introducing and it's been a while since the last game was introduced so we thought that it would be great to introduce these characters from the original [arc] to the Arrancar time period and introduce the history of these characters, how they met, and how battles have taken place,‚Äù Tsuzuki said. </p><p>Fans can look forward to more updates like Rebirth of Souls playable character roster in the future as the game inches closer to its yet-to-be-announced release date.</p><p><em>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-only-accessibility-option-is-its-fantastic-open-world<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It‚Äôs been two years since I traversed The Lands Between. Two years since I became Elden Lord. Two years since I beat a game that I now consider one of my top 10 favorite games of all time. And now, with Shadow of the Erdtree, I‚Äôm once again reminded why Elden Ring is a masterpiece, despite some accessibility flaws.</p><p>For this Access Designed, I‚Äôm going to talk about how Shadow of the Erdtree is nothing short of incredible ‚Äì it‚Äôs more of the same game that left me in awe of its combat, open world, and inclusive design. Yet, despite following the same formula of vast landscapes dotted with optional, difficult content, nothing substantial is brought forth to increase FromSoftware‚Äôs latest title‚Äôs accessibility.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/21/eldenringthumb-1708528702214.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The open world structure of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, while not explicity an accessibility feature, is nontheless a good example of inclusive design.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Exploration and Discovery</h2><p>Shadow of the Erdtree‚Äôs introduction immediately transports players to the Land of Shadow, an area that rivals Limgrave in its size. It‚Äôs an understatement to say that it‚Äôs massive and occasionally overwhelming with direction and choice. As is common with the Eden Ring base game, players are given no guidance on where to go. A glowing white castle that leads to a giant divine lion puppet, a castle that mirrors the Raya Lucaria Academy, and empty fields filled with huge dead birds and a giant flaming golem are immediately present, and it‚Äôs up to you to decide what you want to tackle first. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For physically disabled players that struggle with fatigue, it‚Äôs entirely possible to save a troublesome boss for later or even skip it altogether. </p></div><p>Naturally, I ignored all of these and traveled into a pleasant forest where a naked man named Logur, the Beast Claw killed me 10 times over. Rather than give up and move to a different section, I stubbornly fought Logur until I defeated him, claiming his Beast Claw weapon as my prize. This was my first foray into Shadow of the Erdtree.</p><p>Do I recommend this path? Absolutely not, unless you want to try the new Beast Claw weapon type. However, my questionable decision demonstrates one of the best inclusive design practices of Elden Ring ‚Äì optional content. Much like the base game, players are not required to fight many of the bosses. For physically disabled players that struggle with fatigue, it‚Äôs entirely possible to save a troublesome boss for later or even skip it altogether. While classic Elden Ring accessibility mechanics like summoning spirits and other players are available, many of the enemy encounters are brutal, especially when players refuse to explore and rush to progress the game.</p><h2>The Difficulty Question</h2><p>Shadow of the Erdtree is immensely tough at first, so much so that the award-winning game received mixed reviews on Steam because of the drastic spike in difficulty above that experienced in the base game. And, in true FromSoftware fashion, the game doesn‚Äôt explicitly tell you how to mitigate this jump in challenge ‚Äì you need to explore to learn how. I praise Elden Ring‚Äôs exploration as a crucial accessible tool, and the DLC is no different. Yet while the design practice can ultimately be viewed as optional in the base game, it‚Äôs a mandatory requirement for the expansion. You <em>need </em>to explore. You <em>need </em>to discover items that boost you over the game‚Äôs difficulty spike.</p><p>Dotted around the massive map are Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes, two key items that act as Shadow of the Erdtree's new leveling system, called the Shadow Realm Blessing. While you are within the Land of Shadow, your traditional rune level does little, if anything, to provide buffs for combat. Instead, you must use Scadutree Fragments to boost your stats, and Revered Spirit Ashes to bolster the offenses and defenses of your spirit summons. While it‚Äôs entirely possible to beat the expansion without ever using these, nobody should ever follow this method unless they're a masochist. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/24/divine-beast-dancing-lion-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-1721834616491.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Divine Beast Dancing Lion is a strong and fast boss that poses a big challenge.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Prior to discovering any Fragments or Ashes, I attempted to fight the Divine Beast Dancing Lion using my magic build that could obliterate most base game bosses in under 10 seconds. After around 15 tries, the closest I came to defeating this optional boss was by bringing its health bar down to one third. My spells did pitiful damage, and my summons did nothing more than boost the Lion‚Äôs already-inflated health bar. So I left. I explored until I discovered a significant number of Fragments and Ashes, and only returned after significantly increasing by Shadow Realm Blessing levels. And while the Blessing's enhancements didn't allow my magic build to melt the Lion like it had done bosses prior, the boost to my damage, defenses, and my summon‚Äôs stats was incredibly noticeable. It allowed me to survive long enough to finally defeat the beast. The overall boss mechanics may have still mirrored the base game ‚Äì I sat at the back and fired off spells while my summons distracted the boss ‚Äì but I needed to explore and find specific items before succeeding.</p><h2>No New Accessibility</h2><p>Despite being a new expansion to a two-year-old game, Shadow of the Erdtree does little to increase Elden Ring‚Äôs overall accessibility. While there are new weapons, armors, spells, and talismans that you can discover that lead to new accessible playstyles, no new accessibility-focused options were added. Blind and low vision players still have nothing to assist with combat or exploration, Deaf and hard of hearing players have no new environmental subtitles or visual cues, and cognitively disabled players still need to heavily rely on extensive memorization and pattern recognition. For me, a physically disabled player, Elden Ring and its expansion are near flawless for my needs. Yet, as I continuously say, the disabled experience is incredibly vast and individualistic, meaning the inclusive designs and options like customizable controls that I regularly praise may not be enough for others.</p><p>It‚Äôs difficult to review Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree from an accessibility perspective. My thoughts remain the same from two years ago: it was my game of the year in 2022, and this expansion reignites those same feelings. However, it‚Äôs admittedly disappointing to see FromSoftware continue to fail to implement accessible tools beyond inclusive designs. Is this DLC accessible? If it wasn‚Äôt accessible for you two years ago, I can confidently say this expansion will leave you feeling disappointed. If you found the game to perfectly suit your accessible needs before, then I encourage you to once again lead your Tarnished into unexplored territories. Just be sure to search for Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes.</p><p><em>Grant Stoner is a disabled journalist covering accessibility and the disabled perspective in video games.
