            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/19/star-wars-zero-company-details-first-screenshots-emerge-from-star-wars-celebration-japan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During this weekend's Star Wars Celebration Japan in Tokyo, the team behind the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/14/star-wars-zero-company-a-turn-based-tactics-game-announced">recently announced Star Wars Zero Company</a> delved deeper into what fans should expect from the upcoming tactics game. Developed by Bit Reactor in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor/capturing-the-fantasy">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> and Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment, Star Wars Zero Company puts you in control of Hawks, a former Republic officer, in a gritty story starring an original cast set during the waning Clone Wars.</p>

<p>As Hawks, you command a ragtag group of mercenaries and bounty hunters from across the galaxy to combat a dangerous, emerging threat. Hawks' appearance and class are fully customizable, and the operatives you recruit come from a wide array of original Star Wars character classes and species, including Clone Troopers, astromechs, Jedi, and more. Your squadmates are also customizable through their appearances, loadouts, and abilities.</p>



<p>While in the field, players engage in turn-based tactics missions. Player choice looks to play a role in shaping the narrative and gameplay. You can also increase the bonds between your squadmates, unlocking powerful combat synergies. Between missions, you can build up your base and leverage your intelligence network of informants to stay on top of your enemies' moves.</p>

<p>"Our vision for Star Wars Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay," Bit Reactor CEO and creative director Greg Foertsch said in a press release. "It's our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and a deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Shadows Gets Rated for Nintendo Switch 2]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-rated-for-nintendo-switch-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-gets-rated-for-nintendo-switch-2.1168848/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-rated-for-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It looks like Assassin's Creed Shadows might be coming to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a> in the not-too-distant future. The news comes directly from PEGI (Pan-European Game Information), the European rating regulator, which has <a href="https://pegi.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed</a> a version for Nintendo's upcoming console. Of course, it could be a mistake, especially since the listing only appears in the 'most searched' tab and not when you actually search for the game.</p>
<p>However, chances are it's not. We know that Ubisoft has been a big supporter of Nintendo platforms ever since the original Switch. So far, for the Switch 2, they have just announced Star Wars Outlaws, which will be released on September 4 with all the DLC, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-dlc-arriving-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Pirate's Fortune</a>, which launches next month on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>The main doubt surrounding the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows on the Nintendo Switch 2 would be of a technical nature. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-report-a-ray-traced-leap-forward-for-ubisoft-anvil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is very advanced from a technical standpoint</a>. The latest iteration of the Anvil engine features virtual geometry, ray-traced global illumination, dynamic weather, wind, seasons, and destructible environments. However, it is that announcement of Star Wars Outlaws that should give fans hope. While Massive's game runs on a different engine, their own Snowdrop, it is just as advanced as Assassin's Creed Shadows, if not more so in certain areas. On PC, it's even more taxing than the latest Assassin's Creed game.</p>
<p>If the Nintendo Switch 2 could run both games decently, it would be proof that it can punch above its weight class, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-good-job-ps4-visuals-enhancements-40-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to be</a> PlayStation 4-like with some enhancements here and there. Both of these games only run on the latest consoles by Sony and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Regardless, with Assassin's Creed Shadows, the lineup of the upcoming console would get even richer. The game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> the second most successful launch after Valhalla, which launched during COVID, and critic reviews also rewarded Ubisoft Quebec's title accordingly. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was rated 8.7/10 by Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>

            <p>
Everything is expensive. Everything! Bills, food, video games, you name it. I mean, £75 for a game where you drive around as an Italian plumber? Not entirely convinced by this one, Mr. Bowser. I could get into the weeds of why all of this is happening (none of it for being particularly good reasons), but I won't because I bring word of something actually getting less expensive. Shock horror, I know, and yet here are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rockfish-games">Rockfish Games</a> announcing that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everspace-2">Everspace 2's</a> upcoming Wrath of the Ancients DLC will be a bit cheaper when it launches.
</p>
<p>
Rockfish shared the news in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1128920/view/524214742651240614">Steam post earlier this week</a>, explaining that "with events happening in the world, it seems like everything is getting more expensive and there’s a lot of uncertainty in general." Said events could perhaps be in reference to a certain man in a certain position of power enacting baffling tariffs, though I could be reading a smidge too deep between the lines here. As such, while the initial plan was for Wrath of the Ancients to be priced at $30, it'll now only be $25, quite a nice little reduction.
</p>
<p>
In turn, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game's</a> previous bit of DLC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everspace-2-turns-monster-hunter-with-secret-nebula-dwelling-kaiju-that-are-essentially-living-procgen-dungeons">Titans</a> is also being lowered from $15 to $12. Great! Rockfish also quite quickly cleared up that no, "no content has been cut," and that currently they're in the "middle of our final polish and bug fixing phase ahead of release."
</p>
<p>
I am genuinely not sure I've heard of a developer lowering the cost of DLC prior to it even releasing like this before. I'm sure it must have happened somewhere along the line, but couldn't possibly tell you when. It's genuinely just quite a nice move because $5 really can go a long way. You'll be able to pick it up pretty soon too, as it launches on May 12th next month.

            <p>
I always find it a bit odd when people make comparisons like "new game is the next game you really love" because you're most likely setting yourself up for some kind of disappointment. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall</a> was the most recent game to fall victim to such a framing, with many dubbing it as British <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout</a>, which it didn't end up being, nor was it likely intended to be. Thus, alongside some other issues, it's had a general reception of "yeah, it's not bad", which in a world of sequels upon sequels isn't always the response a developer might want. Still, a sequel is still clearly on developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rebellion-developments">Rebellion's</a> mind.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Rebellion CEO Jason Kingsley recently spoke to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rebellion-ceo-on-atomfalls-success-and-launching-a-new-ip-on-xbox-game-pass">GamesIndustry.biz</a> about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>, and how he's feeling post launch. "Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall," Kingsley explained, continuing on to say, "Happily, that risk is paying off." Guess that roughly positive, slightly mixed response isn't a huge deal then! That doesn't mean Kingsley believes the scale of the developer's projects is perfect, in fact when asked about it whether or not they've got it just right, he said he doesn't think so.
</p>
<p>
"I think that one of the things Chris [Kingsley, Rebellion co-founder and CTO] and I want to do is repeat success. So we want to do more Sniper Elite, we want to do more Zombie Army, we want to do more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/strange-brigade">Strange Brigade</a>. Now it looks like we want to do more Atomfall - it's been successful, can we find the resources to do it? I don't know."
</p>
<p>
Kingsley goes on to talk about things like those Fallout comparisons, success on Game Pass, releasing Sniper Elite: Resistance just a couple of months beforehand, all well worth reading, but no clear indication as to whether or not he thinks a sequel might come. Rebellion are obviously best known for their Sniper series these days, which continue to do well. Perhaps we'll have to wait a while longer to see if they can carve out a slice of that pie for another Atomfall.

Look, here's the thing. I'm no narc, but when it comes to online games, you probably shouldn't cheat. Do what you want in single-player games! But in the multiplayer space you're there to have a nice time with everybody, you know? And as it turns out in the case of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, things can end pretty badly for you (I promise this isn't a Mafia-style threat). The official Monster Hunter Twitter account shared a post yesterday announcing that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> have "confirmed the unauthorized modification of game data in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> for High Rank environment Investigations, Field Surveys, and more."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The post comes with a pretty scary sounding warning too: "Modified data can interfere with normal gameplay and even render the game unplayable. If you suspect a quest has been modified, please do not play it, or stop playing it immediately." Capcom even provided a handy chart of different criteria, like target monsters, which you'll only ever find one to two of in a quest, and the modified version, which can have three or more. As Capcom warns, if you see something like that, avoid starting the quest.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>🔍Expanded Countermeasures Against Unauthorized Data Modification🔍</p><p>We plan to implement additional countermeasures in future updates to detect users who have engaged in unauthorized modification of game data to prevent other players from being implicated in such actions.</p><p>We…</p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1913217339102835099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
In a follow-up post, the developer noted it plans to add "additional countermeasures" to find people that are modifying quests like these, which will come in future updates. What these countermeasures are, we'll have to wait and see, but right now Capcom are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/534347841813873218?l=english">examining the final ranking results</a> for the recent Doshaguma of the Hollow challenge quest for the next one to two weeks to root out cheaters. If that includes you, you'll likely see your account receive some restrictions.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, I don't really understand why you'd bother cheating in a game like Monster Hunter where the challenge is the point. Your ranking is meaningless if you didn't achieve it yourself, buddy! Maybe go play a PS2 game and put on big-head mode or something if you've got the need to cheat.

            <p>
It's Star Wars Celebration right now, which as I gather is about celebrating giant balls of gas fighting one another. Sorry, I'm being told that it's actually about some multimedia franchise that has so much going on it's impossible to keep track of? Doesn't sound right to me, but I'll have to trust it. Arguably the biggest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-star-wars-games-on-pc">Star Warsy game</a> announcement of the weekend is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-zero-company-looks-like-xcom-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away-in-its-first-trailer">first trailer for the Star Wars meets XCOM game Star Wars Zero Company</a>, but it wasn't the only one. Turns out last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' second story pack got a reveal too, and a release date to boot.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This one's pirate themed, as evidenced by the DLC's name, A Pirate's Fortune, once again following Kay and Nix on a new adventure in the Khepi system. As is often the case with Star Wars media that isn't the movies, A Pirate's Fortune features one of those Glup Shitto type characters, Hondo Ohnaka, who you'll be joining forces with for this particular escapade. He originally appeared in the animated Clone Wars series, first season even, so even if I jest a touch, he really has been around for a while now.

<p>
You'll also be facing off against a new character called Stinger Tash, both of you looking to enter some place called the Khepi Tomb to "uncover the secrets and hidden treasures it holds." The DLC also adds in the Miyuki Trade League which can net you goodies for your ship, the Trailblazer, and even if you aren't getting A Pirate's Fortune, everyone will also receive some cosmetics inspired by Star Wars: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeleton-crew">Skeleton Crew</a>.
</p>
<p>
The DLC's out quite soon too, currently due to arrive May 15, less than a month away. I wouldn't bet on any more story stuff after this though, so savour it while you can.

<p>Whilst a number of third-party developers have confirmed ports for Nintendo's highly anticipated upcoming console, up until now, there'd been no word of a Switch 2 Assassin's Creed Shadows edition… well, not until PEGI let it slip, anyway.</p>

<p>Could it be a mistake? Possibly. Either way, we've reached out to Ubisoft and will update just as soon as we know more.</p>
<p>Relatedly, while we already knew that Ubisoft was also bringing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> to Nintendo Switch 2, this weekend's Star Wars Celebration in Japan - which revealed earlier today that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-next-story-update-is-a-pirates-fortune-and-its-coming-next-month">its next story-based DLC is coming on 15th May</a> - revealed the Star Wars adventure will <em>not</em> be a launch title, instead releasing on 4th September, 2025.</p>
<p>We awarded Assassin's Creed Shadows four out of five stars, with our resident Creed expert Tom writing in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>: "Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists."</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">Nintendo finally detailed how US tariffs will impact the launch of Switch 2</a>, and confirmed price rises for an array of console accessories "due to changes in market conditions".</p>
<p>A new set of Joy-Con 2 controllers, for example, will now cost $95, an increase of $5. The Switch 2 Pro controller and Switch 2 camera have also seen $5 price rises, up to $85 and $55 respectively. But the $450 Switch 2 itself, including its $500 bundle with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, will not increase in price for now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
We've all known it's coming for a long while now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-are-making-three-new-star-wars-games-including-a-new-strategy-game-with-former-xcom-devs">three years in fact</a>, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-zero-company">Star Wars Zero Company</a> got a proper reveal today. In case you aren't sure which one this was meant to be, it's the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> one from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bit-reactor">Bit Reactor</a>, led by former XCOM devs. For the most part the announcement trailer is just a CGI cutscene, you've been round this rodeo before, you know how these things go. Though, it does end with a smidge of gameplay and yeah, it really does just look like Star Wars by way of XCOM, which is likely to be an instant winner.
</p>

<p>
I'm not exactly sure if "gritty" and "authentic" are words that'd normally apply to any Star Wars media - let's not forget Yoda was literally performed and played by The Muppets' own Fozzie Bear - but that's how Star Wars Zero Command has been described, at the very least. The single-player game is set "during the twilight of the Clone Wars" where you'll play as Hawks, a "former Republic officer" who leads the titular Zero Company.
</p>

<p>
They're a band of misfits, by the sounds of things, and they've been recruited by Hawks that sees them facing off against some vague threat that could consume the galaxy, or whatever. This is Star Wars, there's always galaxy threatening stuff going on, and this is a prequel so we can only assume things will generally end well - though, in a press release CEO and creative director of Bit Reactor Greg Foertsch did say in a statement that they're aiming to provide "meaningful outcomes" based on the choices you make.
</p>
<p>
The core gameplay looks mighty similar to XCOM, and apparently between missions you'll be able to build up your own base and do spy things like gathering intelligence. On top of that you'll be able to make and customise your own squad of "authored Star Wars characters", so it sounds like you shouldn't expect Jar Jar Binks to show up.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps predictably, an exact release date hasn't been confirmed just yet, but it is supposedly releasing sometime in 2026, and it'll be available on PC via Steam.

            <p>Dying Light 1: Stay Human's Patch 22 - the spring update - is now live, improving co-op, offering "creative control" over Villedor's looks, and introducing new rewards in Tower Raid.</p>
<p>The latter is particularly interesting given it should now be easier to claim rewards, such as exclusive skins and 27 new weapons, including 24 Elemental weapons and three Elemental pistols. There's also been some changes to the HUD, too, to make it easier to track your progress.</p>

<p>Techland also <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/update-122-spring-update">revealed</a> there's now "enhanced co-op gameplay with fixed enemy behaviour synchronisation issues" which reduces teleporting and lag, and whilst console players have to wait a little bit longer, PC players can now customise textures for Villedor thanks to new mod tools.</p>
<p>"In the Spring Update, you'll experience a slew of enhancements designed to elevate your co-op experience," the team explained. "We have addressed and resolved various enemy behaviour issues affected by synchronisation between players. This intends to ensure smoother gameplay and reduced discrepancies, including the amount of enemies teleporting and lagging.</p>
<p>"The HUD has also received substantial improvements, providing clearer visual cues and streamlined access to vital information, ultimately enhancing situational awareness with multiple players on screen."</p>
<p>For the full list of fixes, head on over to the <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/update-122-spring-update">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Dying Light 1 released on 26th January, 2015, and proved to be a massive hit for Techland, selling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-2-has-surpassed-5m-copies-sold-since-launching-in-february">over 20m copies as of 2022</a>.

<p>"Embark on a mysterious adventure with Kay and Nix to explore the Khepi system and learn what it takes to be a true leader," teases the blurb. "Team up with legendary pirate Hondo Ohnaka and face off against Stinger Tash and her Rokana Raiders as you infiltrate the Khepi Tomb to uncover the secrets and hidden treasures it holds.</p>
<p>"Along the way, you’ll discover the Miyuki Trade League, who offer new rewards for the Trailblazer in exchange for smuggling dangerous goods across the galaxy."</p>
<p>As part of the update, all players will be gifted cosmetic items inspired by Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, including an outfit for Nix, a Trophy for the speeder, and a Trinket for both the speeder and the Trailblazer. They'll pop up in your delivery crate on the Trailblazer after downloading and installing the update.</p>
<p>We awarded Star Wars Outlaws two out of five stars on its initial release last August.</p>
<p>"It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>. "It lacks the linear polish and charisma of Uncharted. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647481/haste-broken-worlds-game-review-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Haste: Broken Worlds</em> takes the relaxing loop of sliding down and leaping off hills from iOS classic <em>Tiny Wings</em> and turns it into a thrilling, high-speed, and 3D roguelike.</p><p>In <em>Haste</em>, you play as Zoe, a girl who typically delivers letters but has found herself mysteriously transported to the new worlds you run through. When I say run, I mean it: Zoe <em>cannons</em> through the game.</p><p>Levels are filled with rolling hills, and your goal is to leap off the upslopes and land on the downslopes. The better your landings, the more you’ll increase your speed and build a boost meter that can be used for things like a burst forward or a grappling hook.</p><p>You’re incentivized to keep your speed up. The faster you complete a level, the higher grade you’ll get; higher grades give you better bonuses of things like “sparks,” which you can use to buy items.</p><p>Throughout the vibrant, procedurally generated levels, you’ll also have to avoid obstacles like rocks, giant <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sarlacc">Sarlacc-like pits</a>, and machines that shoot lasers and bullets at you. If you crash into an object, you’ll lose health and slow down. If you’re too slow, a crackling, damaging energy will sneak up behind you. If you run out of health, you’ll lose a life. Lose all your lives, and your run will end. </p><p>There are some familiar roguelike mechanics in <em>Haste</em>, like a currency you can spend between runs to permanently improve things like your health and boost meters. During runs, you’ll also pick each stage on a map. <em>Haste</em> has a great map feature that lets you pick some or all of your route in advance so that you can play a series of levels without interruption. It really helps with the momentum.</p><p>When things are going well, it’s easy to reach an amazing flow state where you’re leaping from hills at breakneck speed, timing your landings and boosts, dodging obstacles in your path, and racing to the end of every level as fast as you can.</p><p>But at the end of each zone (technically a “shard”), there’s a large boss — like a giant flying snake — and they were often total buzzkills. The boss levels force you to run through more open-ended zones instead of just blasting forward, and the game just isn’t as fun and feels tougher in the open environments. Thankfully, you can change the game’s difficulty level.</p><p>The game’s storytelling messes up the flow, too. You’ll meet a bunch of characters, and while their personalities are fun and their character portraits are illustrated well, they often show up in lengthy, forced conversations between levels. For a game called <em>Haste</em>, there are a lot of long chats!</p><p>Those quibbles only detracted a little from how much I enjoyed <em>Haste</em>. At its best, <em>Haste</em> keeps you on the edge of your seat as you leap up and down from hills and careen through worlds. But when the game changes pace, it can be frustrating. I just want to go fast. </p><p><sub>Haste: Broken Worlds</sub><em><sub> is now available on PC.</sub></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
