But this city is actually more bite-sized than you might anticipate by the game’s name, offering a brief but enjoyable romp that doesn’t overstay its welcome. If you’d like to know just how long you’ll be spending with this little black kitty, here’s what you need to know.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h88152"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>?</h2><p><em>Little Kitty, Big City</em> is a short game, especially if you overlook any unnecessary side-quests. <strong>If your main goal is to just get our titular kitty back home, you can achieve that in only 2-3 hours</strong>. </p><p><strong>But skipping all of the optional content in the game would be missing some of the most charming parts of this cat’s journey</strong>.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/">Switch 2 launch lineup</a> is not exactly bursting at the seams. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/">Mario Kart World</a> is the banner game, the handful of others coming on June 5 are mostly ports of existing games. Among those, Bravely Default is an oddball, as it's an HD remaster of a game that's more than a decade old rather than a modern game like Street Fighter 6 or Cyberpunk 2077 that can finally run on Nintendo hardware. But for my money, Bravely Default is also an all-time RPG classic, and as strange as it feels to be nostalgic for the 3DS era of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a>'s Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster looks to be a great way to play it.</p><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar, Bravely Default was a riff on the classic Final Fantasy formula, making it FF in all but name. Four warriors of light, holy crystals, the whole enchilada. It sported a robust class system that encouraged players to find game-breaking combinations, and it was one of the first to sport the ability to speed up encounters and auto-battle--both now mainstays in classic RPG remakes--or even turn them off entirely. The title referred to one of its battle mechanics, the ability to "Default" (defend and store an extra Brave Point aka BP) or "Brave" (spend extra BP, or even go into BP debt, to take extra actions). So for level-grinding, you could Brave every time to burn through low-level enemies, and against tougher enemies and bosses you would need to take a more considered approach.</p><p dir="ltr">It was followed by the semi-sequel, Bravely Second: End Layer, and a full sequel, Bravely Second. Notably unlike the Final Fantasy series, the Bravely games take place in one consistent canonical world, so the sequels build on the stories and continuity that came before them.</p><p dir="ltr">But like much of the 3DS library, Bravely Default is not exactly easy to play anymore. You need working 3DS hardware and a game cartridge, and unlike Bravely Default 2, it was never released on another platform like Steam. That makes it a prime candidate for the HD remaster treatment, allowing fans to own it in a format that continues well into the future. After a brief hands-on, I'm convinced that Bravely Default will be my most-played Switch 2 game outside of Mario Kart at launch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496384-01_battle_brave_en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4496384" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496384-01_battle_brave_en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4496384"></a><figcaption>The Battle menu in Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496384-01_battle_brave_en.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496385-01_battle_brave_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496386-01_character_tiz01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496387-01_character_tiz02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496389-01_concept02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496390-01_concept03_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496392-01_concept04_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496393-01_job_freelancer_abi01_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496395-01_job_freelancer_abi02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496396-01_system_graphic_new_en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4496385,1300-4496386,1300-4496387,1300-4496389,1300-4496390,1300-4496392,1300-4496393,1300-4496395,1300-4496396" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496385-01_battle_brave_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496386-01_character_tiz01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496387-01_character_tiz02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496389-01_concept02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496390-01_concept03_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496392-01_concept04_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496393-01_job_freelancer_abi01_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496395-01_job_freelancer_abi02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496396-01_system_graphic_new_en.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496385-01_battle_brave_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496386-01_character_tiz01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496387-01_character_tiz02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496389-01_concept02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496390-01_concept03_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496392-01_concept04_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496393-01_job_freelancer_abi01_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496395-01_job_freelancer_abi02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496396-01_system_graphic_new_en.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">To start, the game looks fantastic. The prerendered painterly backgrounds look incredible and vibrant on the big screen, which is all the more impressive when you consider they were originally made to appear on a 3DS. This visual style--your polygonal characters running against a painted backdrop--was itself a throwback to early 3D RPGs like Final Fantasy 7, but it looks especially wonderful here. Meanwhile, the style of the character models themselves largely holds up. It's a testament to the strength of the art style that these characters--squat chibi characters rendered in the unmistakable style of Akihiko Yoshida--still look so elegant in their simplicity. I wasn't able to tinker with the job classes to see the lovely way these models look when donning their various outfits, but I'm looking forward to it.</p><p dir="ltr">The battle system remains untouched as far as I can tell, which is fine by me because it's already perfectly balanced. I only played a little bit of an early area but I know from experience that the combination of the Brave/Default and job-class systems creates some engaging combat puzzles, especially once the game starts challenging you to split its systems wide open. This is a game that absolutely wants to make you feel like you've outsmarted it.</p><p dir="ltr">The newest element is a pair of minigames, which seem well designed even if they're temporary diversions at best. Both use the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/">Switch 2 mouse functionality</a>, challenging you to use both at once in different ways. The first is a rhythm game that has a glowing tether between your two cursors, and so matching the rhythm means lining up the tether to intersect with the music prompts, or hitting exact notes with the cursors themselves. The second is an airship-piloting game set in the first-person perspective of a pilot, so you have to manage steering the ship's wheel while also tending to other tasks. Imagine Steel Battalion but cute, with its massive controller being virtualized on screen. Neither game feeds back into the main game, but you can use the job-class costumes in the minigames as you unlock them for a bit of personalization.</p><p dir="ltr">I doubt I'll play much of the minigames. They're neat little showpieces for the Switch 2 mouse functionality, but they aren't the draw. The real prize is Bravely Default, one of my favorite modern(ish) RPGs, getting a beautiful restoration and being released from 3DS jail. If you haven't played it before, or even if you have, this looks to be the way to experience it.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>GTA Online gets weekly updates, but Zelnick is likely referring to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-adding-story-dlc-featuring-gta-5s-franklin-and-dr-dre/1100-6498737/" data-ref-id="1100-6498737">the biggest ones that have added new story content</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-adds-big-new-mode-assault-on-cayo-perico/1100-6516769/" data-ref-id="1100-6516769">big new heists.</a> Rockstar apparently originally planned even more expansions for GTA Online, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-have-had-a-james-bond-like-story-dlc-actor-says/1100-6522891/" data-ref-id="1100-6522891">James Bond-like DLC focused on Trevor.</a></p><p>Rockstar remaining so dedicated to GTA Online over the years is part of the reason why the game has continued to be so successful--and lucrative. The game features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-s-online-mode-is-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving-take-two-says-about-its-monetary-opportunity/1100-6418882/" data-ref-id="1100-6418882">microtransactions</a> as part of Take-Two's ambition to create ongoing revenue beyond sales of the base game. And those have been strong, too, as GTA 5 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-has-sold-an-absolutely-absurd-amount-of-copies-in-the-last-three-months/1100-6531582/" data-ref-id="1100-6531582">just sold another 5 million copies in the past three months</a> to boost its lifetime tally to 215 million.</p><p>"Our strategy is when we give consumers a hit, they would like to stay engaged. And that requires our teams to create more content quite properly, to support that content, and to market that content," Zelnick explained. "The business has become a worldwide, ongoing business. I would argue that Rockstar is delivering to its consumer base daily, and it has been doing that for quite some time, basically since 2014."</p><p>The huge, ongoing success of GTA Online creates an interesting scenario for 2026 when GTA 6 launches. What's going to happen to GTA Online then? We don't know, but Zelnick has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-suggests-that-current-gta-online-could-continue-after-gta-6-releases/1100-6529517/" data-ref-id="1100-6529517">GTA Online may stick around in some form</a> when the new game comes out.</p><p>Given the immense success of GTA Online, it's expected that GTA 6 will feature some kind of online element, though as of yet, Rockstar has only focused on the game's story mode featuring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/" data-ref-id="2900-6537">Jason and Lucia.</a></p><p>The long wait for GTA 6 has inspired the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-got-x-before-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"We got ___ before GTA 6"</a> meme, and they've become so widespread that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-gta-6-news-is-frustrating-fans-take-two-boss-admits/1100-6528571/" data-ref-id="1100-6528571">even Zelnick has seen some of them. </a></p><p>While fans have to wait until May 2026 to play GTA 6, reports have suggested Rockstar is developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">ports of GTA 4 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-feels-really-good-about-switch-2-amid-reports-of-rdr-2-port/1100-6531595/" data-ref-id="1100-6531595">Red Dead Redemption II for Switch 2</a>, and they could launch as soon as later this year. </p>

                <p>The Android gaming handheld scene is bursting with options, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DT4G4PD2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retroid Pocket 5</a> offers arguably the best performance for the price among today's retro handhelds. Released late last year, the sleek portable sports powerful hardware capable of running high-end native Android games and apps, while also doubling as great portable for streaming console and PC titles. It has a custom frontend for retro games and is powerful enough to run sixth- and some seventh-generation console games. The Retroid Pocket 5 was initially only available through the manufacturer's online store, but now the device is finally available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DT4G4PD2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">through Amazon</a>, where it's priced at $259 with free shipping.</p><p>Amazon has four different color options available as of May 16.

It comes with Android 13 installed out of the box.

                <p>Darth Vader is one of the most looming and well-known characters in all of pop culture. Actor James Earl Jones provided most of Vader's lines throughout his history (with actor Matt Sloan taking over for some video games and television appearances), and actually signed over his voice for future Star Wars productions before his passing. However, something tells me Jones didn't predict Vader ever dropping the F word in a video game.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/#:~:text=Users-,Fortnite%20Now%20Lets%20You%20Speak%20To%20Darth%20Vader%20With%20the,Fortnite%2C%20with%20his%20family's%20consent." data-ref-id="1100-6531599">AI model for Jones' voice as Vader is used</a> for the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-star-wars-galactic-battle-all-guns-and-loot/2900-6520/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6520">Fortnite addition</a>, and the Dark Lord has been saying some pretty wild stuff to players, including <a href="https://x.com/AciDicGamerz/status/1923359424581689384" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eliminating their duos partner</a> and using profanity. Fortnite player Loserfruit was a witness to Vader using her words "freaking" and "f---ing" when she was asking about what food he was eating.</p><p>"Freaking? F---ing? Such vulgarity does not become you, Padme," Darth Vader replied. Obviously, the moment went super viral, super quick, with Epic Games responding on Twitter that a hotfix was indeed in place immediately.</p><p>"We pushed a hotfix immediately and this shouldn’t happen again," it <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">replied</a>. Now, with the model in use, this isn't the only weird thing Vader is saying. Some players have even overheard racist comments about <a href="https://x.com/SomeRandomDyl/status/1923360651113611536" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Spanish speakers</a>. It'll be interesting to see how Fortnite addresses this, or pull the plug momentarily. Using Jones' voice wasn't probably cheap, so they will want the most out of it, even if more hotfixes are on the way.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blades-of-fire">Blades Of Fire</a> is the latest dark fantasy smackeroo from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/castlevania-lords-of-shadow">Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow</a> developers MercurySteam. It takes place in a world where steel is a divine substance passed down to humanity by the mysterious Forgers. Some sinister young queen has, however, cast a spell that turns everybody else’s steel into stone, granting her followers a near-monopoly on all the butt-kicking.</p>
<p>Playing as bleak and burly beardyman Aran “We Have Kratos At Home” de Lira, your job is to chase down that queen, murder her minions, and craft a whole bunch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darksiders">Darksiders</a>-esque weaponry. Aran is accompanied by Adso, a juvenile sidekick in the vein of Atreus, who catalogues the game’s “over 50” enemy types and can also translate lore written in the ancient Forger language.</p><!--more-->

<p>I’m keen on what I’ve seen of Blades Of Fire’s geography, which is stuffed full of ruined palaces, enchanted trees and such. I’m much less keen on Aran – he’s got a tragic past he “refuses to let define him entirely”, but any empathy I feel is sabotaged by the fact that Aran’s default outfit consists of at least eight belts. I’m undecided, meanwhile, on the combat. It’s described as “unique”, with controller buttons corresponding to body parts, but come now, MercurySteam, the concept of limb-targeting is literally as old as I am.</p>
<p>Ah, if only there were some kind of demo I could play to work through my misgivings. Oh yeah, that’s right – publishers 505 have <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/blades-of-fire-demo-78b5d3">just released a demo on the Epic Games Store</a>. Way to smother the lede, Evans-Thirlwell!</p>
<p>As you might deduce from the title, Blades Of Fire is heavy on the blacksmithing. You’ll collect Forge Scrolls to develop your crafting capabilities. There are 30 of these scrolls, plus seven weapon families, at least three types of damage in the shape of stabbing, slashing and bludgeoning, and an unspecified quantity of different raw materials. All of which allows for “almost infinite weapon combinations”. Please, PRs, I beg of you. Please allow the ridiculous phrase “almost infinite” to die. I hate getting all tangled up in self-contradictions when I’m trying to count broadswords.</p>
<p>Blades Of Fire is due out on 22nd May, so now is a fine time to sample that demo. Let us know if you do. Also, let us know what your preferred maximum belt count is for a videogame protagonist. Seriously, eight belts - that’s like, four more than Voldo in most Soulcalibur games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks is exiting early access and getting its 1.0 release on May 22nd, PLAION and Wired Productions has confirmed. The big announcement is that when the game launches, all microtransactions will be removed. Players who have been part of the early access period and bought the in game currency will be able to spend it through the in game store. The in game store is not going to be available for those who did not take part in early access. The general DLC model will replace microtransactions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks – Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLRTsjrCP00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Game Director Chris Mallinson, of developer Caged Element, said, <em>“We set out to make the Orkiest of Warhammer 40,000 games, and through our early access period we’ve had thousands of people help us achieve that goal – along with our previous publisher PLAION. Now with Wired Productions picking up the torch, we’re launching out of early access and into version 1.0 with a different approach that we think players will really appreciate and enjoy. We thank both partners for their dedication to the game, along with Games Workshop. We’re of course very happy to be back with our pals at Wired Productions, since we worked with them before on GRIP. Now enuff o’ dat, on to da WAAAGH!!!”</em></p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:154">Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks was going to be a free to play title funded by microtransactions, though that has obviously changed. The main move to being a paid title means that Caged Element can include player hosted games with custom rules, private games, a free roam mode, and remove the third party account requirement. As the game transitions from free to play to paid, the game will be offline from May 20th to May 22nd. The launch price will be $15.99, 15.99€ and £12.79.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-fixed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An exploit that caused&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s new Darth Vader AI to swear at players has already been fixed, so if you were hoping to hear some fruity language from everyone's favorite Sith Lord, you might be disappointed.</p>

<p>Earlier today, a clip showing Australian streamer Loserfruit prompting the game's new AI-powered Darth Vader to swear at her (as preserved <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here by user Cordial</a>) went viral. In the clip, the Vader AI can be heard clearly dropping an F-bomb. He might be evil, but that's probably not what Epic intended.</p>

<p>Following the clip's proliferation, Epic <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">responded</a> to Cordial in order to confirm that the issue "shouldn't happen again", since a hotfix has been pushed. If you ask me, it would have been infinitely funnier if they'd kept the swearing in the game, but I guess we can't have nice things anymore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-grievous.jpg?itok=m4uO1d19 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-grievous.jpg?itok=6wKLtCv7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The now-not-swearing&nbsp;Darth Vader AI is part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>season.</figcaption></figure><p>According to an official <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/disney#darth-vader-faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a>, Vader's dialogue is generated by Google Gemini 2.0 Flash, and the audio, which is clearly based on original actor James Earl Jones' voice, is created by the ElevenLabs Flash 2.5 model.</p>

<p>Vader only understands English (and not Galactic Basic, weirdly enough), and if you're a minor, you'll need your parent or guardian to approve voice or written communication with Vader via the parental controls section of the game.</p>

<p>The character can be spoken to by the first team to recruit Vader in either the standard Battle Royale mode or its Zero Build alternative, and he's also available in the Ranked play mode, so even if you're trying to sweat up a storm, you can still take some time to chat with Ani (spoiler alert).</p>




<p>The Darth Vader AI is part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow">latest&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a>, which also brings the likes of Emperor Palpatine, Poe Dameron, and, er, Darth Jar Jar as skins for players to terrify their foes with.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on iOS, then all of this is moot, at least for now; earlier today, Epic announced that Apple has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">blocked the release of the game</a> on iOS in the US and Europe, which means it's currently offline on the platform "worldwide".</p>

A mere vessel without a soul. Someone like Matt Sloan (voice of Darth Vader in various video games and shows) carries more sentiment to this role than an AI ever could.

It's unclear if the port will release digitally-only or be sold as a physical edition, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We considered Red Dead Redemption 2 a "masterpiece" when it released in 2018, awarding it a 10/10. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review"><u>IGN's Red Dead Redemption 2 review</u></a> said: "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open-world ode to the outlaw era."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps red Dead Redemption 2 coming to Switch 2 wouldn't come as a huge surprise. In a Q&amp;A with investors following Take-Two's most recent financial results, CEO Strauss Zelnick answered a question about the publisher's support of the Switch 2 by saying he felt "great optimism" for Nintendo's new platform. In fact, he said Nintendo's support of third-party publishers this time around was better than it had been in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're launching four titles with Nintendo Switch 2, and that's I think a bigger array of releases than we've ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform," he said. "Historically, being a third-party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo has been very forthcoming in addressing that. And we're stepping up too, because we have great optimism for the platform. In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis, we obviously want to be where the consumers are. But we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalog opportunities as well."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Take-Two is bringing Civilization 7 (June 5, launch day), the NBA 2K and WWE 2K series (unclear which games, or when), and Borderlands 4 (September 12). Those admittedly aren't surprising inclusions, as Take-Two was already publishing all four franchises on the Nintendo Switch. But Zelnick's quote does make it sound like the door could be open in the future to other releases, especially from Take-Two's back catalog. GTA 6 probably won't make the cut, but perhaps GTA V or red Dead Redemption 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-director-vows-to-deliver-a-respectful-representation-of-japan-on-par-with-ghost-of-tsushima<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon release back in 2020, American developer Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Tsushima was generally well-received for its fictionalized depiction of historical Japan. The game’s director Nate Fox recently talked about his commitment to bringing the same kind of cultural sensitivity to the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, emphasizing the importance of research, respect, and listening to cultural advisors.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Ghost of Tsushima had us take on the role of Jin Sakai as he defends Tsushima from a Mongol invasion in the 13th century, Ghost of Yotei skips forward to 1603, where we play as female warrior Atsu in Ezo (modern day Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost main island). She is out to wreak vengeance on a band of outlaws who murdered her family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Tsushima paid homage to classic samurai movies (with its black-and-white “Kurosawa mode” named after legendary Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa), so it will be interesting to see if Ghost of Yotei takes any influence from Japan’s many movies featuring tough female warriors exacting revenge, like the Lady Snowblood series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/15/ghost-of-yotei-how-sucker-punch-chose-hokkaido-for-the-games-setting/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation Blog post,</u></a> Ghost of Tsushima and Ghost of Yotei director Nate Fox talked about how the research trips to Japan have not only been the “best part” of working on the games, they have also been highly inspiring and eye-opening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Everyone from Sucker Punch that went on those reference gathering trips came back to the studio with a driving passion to bring a sense of authenticity to our fictional depiction of these real life places," he commented, emphasizing the importance of getting the feel for a place in person, and then using this experience to craft an original, in-game environment that matches the spirit of the real location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/d_ishidate/status/1792615489707147300" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Comments</u></a> made by Ghost of Tsushima’s English-to-Japanese localization producer Daisuke “Dice” Ishidate on Twitter / X back in May 2024 echo these sentiments: “The Ghost of Tsushima development team told me that 'we want to create enjoyable entertainment, not a history lesson...' I think that maybe the reason for Ghost of Tsushima’s success is not objective historical accuracy but its subjective period drama-like style (and flair).” (As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ghost-of-tsushima-japanese-localization-producer-responds-to-assassins-creed-shadows/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Ghost of Tsushima read like a thoughtfully researched love letter to historical Japan with a dash of classic samurai movie thrown in. What inaccuracies it has were mostly artistic license used to create a more entertaining and atmospheric experience for the player, and to make the game more accessible to wider audiences. For its depiction of samurai, Ghost of Tsushima tapped into later centuries and the pop culture image of samurai as katana wielders, when they predominantly used bow and arrow in the 13th century (archery expert Sensei Ishikawa is perhaps the closest character to the samurai of that period). As for accessibility, Jin can compose haiku (the most widely recognized type of Japanese poem), however the haiku form didn’t develop until centuries later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Ghost of Tsushima’s towns, shrines, and environments do feel like experiencing a nature hike through Japan from the comfort of your sofa, the game took some liberties in allowing the player to experience all Japan’s seasons. The real Tsushima is subtropical, located between South Korea and Japan’s southernmost main island of Kyushu. The heavy snow that Jin encounters in Act 3 is anachronistic, as the real Tsushima is too far south to experience such weather. However, this gave players the chance to experience a sort of virtual postcard of the most iconic and famous aspects of each season in Japan. Wandering the game’s fictional Tsushima, the player moves between different seasons: abundant pink cherry blossoms bringing a splash of spring to your screen one second, only to be replaced by orangey brown autumn leaves when you enter another area.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Best PS4, Xbox One Games to Play on PS5 and Xbox Series X</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Fox explained, the digital Tsushima was never intended to be a perfect recreation of the island, but it was meant to faithfully capture the spirit of the place. In the PlayStation blog post, he commented: “We felt that by listening to our cultural advisors and by doing research, we could deliver a respectful representation of what made Tsushima so special... For Ghost of Yotei, we’re doing the same thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fox revealed that Sony picked Hokkaido for Ghost of Yotei’s setting because it is “unbelievably beautiful.” Upon visiting the place, Fox recounted that the dev team were struck by the contrast between the majestic views and the potential threat posed by the bears that inhabit Hokkaido’s Shiretoko National Park. “A perfect marriage of beauty and danger, that was the exact feeling we wanted for our game,” Fox enthused. Added to this, in 1603 when Ghost of Yotei is set, Hokkaido was a sparsely populated, harsh northern island, which the developers felt fit with the tale of a female warrior so hell-bent on revenge that the locals start to believe she is a demon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, official information about Ghost of Yotei has yet to mention how and if it will address Hokkaido’s complicated history of eventual colonization by Japan. How will Ghost of Yotei depict Hokkaido’s indigenous people, the Ainu, and their language and culture? Will it portray tensions between Japanese and Ainu populations? This could be a difficult part of the game to get right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After release, Ghost of Tsushima met with mostly positive reception from Japanese gaming media and people, gaining a perfect score from Famitsu and winning two awards at the Japan Game Awards 2021. It has also been embraced by the real life island of Tsushima, with its popularity encouraging more tourists to visit the island. The game’s director Nate Fox and creative director Jason Connell were named cultural ambassadors to the island, for their role in drawing people’s attention to Tsushima and its history. If Ghost of Yotei becomes as successful as its predecessor, it might also bring more overseas tourists to Hokkaido. However, they should probably make sure they are better prepared than <a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/japan-life/news-and-opinion/british-couple-rescued-from-mount-yotei/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the British couple who recently got stranded on Mount Yotei</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-board-game-buying-guide<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When Undaunted: Normandy hit the shelves in 2019, it was an instant smash hit. It's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games"><u>deck-building game</u></a>, a genre where you start with a small deck of weak cards that you can upgrade and tweak during play until you’ve got a much more powerful, reliable engine. But its genius is to twin these mechanics with a squad-level tactical <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board game</a>. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soldier cards let you move and fire with the matching unit on the modular board in pursuit of scenario goals, while officer cards fine-tune your deck, allowing you to focus on particular squads. It's a marriage made in heaven, giving you strategic levers in deck construction, tactical thrills as you maneuver for position on the board, while still basically feeling like a simple simulation of combat where officers bolster the morale and makeup of squads under their command.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undaunted: Normandy's success has led to a slew of games using the same basic system, which now ranges across a much wider variety of settings and complexity levels - even into outer space with a sci-fi variant. Undaunted is a great franchise, and this buying guide is here to help you decide which of its many titles is right for you.</p><p id="undaunted-normandy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Normandy">Undaunted: Normandy</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221009"><div id="221009" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Normandy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: People who want the simplest, fastest version and don’t object to the military theme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first game in the series sets the action in the days after the allied invasion of Normandy during World War 2. While none of its predecessors are particularly complex, it is nevertheless the most accessible game in the series, focusing entirely on different types of infantry units and with a limited range of quick-playing maps. While that has an obvious attraction for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games">casual play</a>, it can feel a bit repetitive if you want to commit to playing all the scenarios in the box. It also has the most realistic historical bent apart from Undaunted: Stalingrad which might appeal to those interested in the military aspects of the series, but which some may find off putting. </p></div><p id="undaunted-north-africa"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: North Africa">Undaunted: North Africa</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221010"><div id="221010" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: North Africa</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: Players who want to see vehicles in their wargames, or who like cinematic action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most frequent asks from fans of the original was the addition of vehicles, and publisher Osprey Games delivered in this sequel, adding armored cars and small tanks to the mix. While these are governed by the same simple card play that drives all the units, they do necessitate a degree of extra rules overhead to cover the difference between anti-armor and small arms fire. As well as moving the setting to the North African theater, this also turns down the scale with the squad-level counters of the original turning into individual combatants. This gives the game a more gung-ho, cinematic feel, heightened by the choice to feature the allied troops as the Long Range Desert Group, the forerunner to Britain’s famous SAS. </p></div><p id="undaunted-reinforcements"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Reinforcements">Undaunted: Reinforcements</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221011"><div id="221011" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Reinforcements</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: Hardcore fans, gamers who want to solo Normandy or North Africa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fans of military games like to be able to play solo, even if it means playing both sides themselves, but Undaunted’s tense initiative bid system made this difficult. As a result, a key draw for this expansion, which – unusually – also supports both the first two games, is the addition of a complex but very effective set of AI routines to allow challenging <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> play. Each scenario in both the original boxes has unique routines tailored for each unit, meaning the automated opposition is very effective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also new units and scenarios for both of the original games, as well as an expanded box that allows you to store both of those titles together. As good as all these features are, however, they’re only really for hardcore fans. You have to own both of the previous games and be interested in solo play to get the most out of this expansion.</p></div><p id="undaunted-stalingrad"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Stalingrad">Undaunted: Stalingrad</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221012"><div id="221012" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Stalingrad</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: Those willing to put in repeat plays for the best Undaunted experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both of the initial games could be played in a loose form of campaign, progressing through the scenarios and keeping a tally of who won what. But Stalingrad kicks things up a notch, featuring a branching campaign with narrative elements and in which the results of each scenario carry into the next. Soldiers gain experience, or carry injuries, while the city itself is slowly reduced to rubble in which troops can find cover or build fortifications. The result is an absolute triumph, earning a 10/10 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-stalingrad-board-game-review"><u>Undaunted: Stalingrad review</u></a> by retaining all the great things that made those first two games such hits, while adding yet another strategic layer to ponder and wrapping the whole thing in a dramatic, unfolding story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is the best game in the series, beware: you and an opponent will need to commit to a lot of repeat games to get the most out of it. </p></div><p id="undaunted-battle-of-britain"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Battle of Britain">Undaunted: Battle of Britain</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221013"><div id="221013" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Battle of Britain</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: Undaunted veterans who want a novel take on familiar mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a major departure from the infantry combat that characterizes most of the Undaunted games, Battle of Britain takes the action to the skies. While the core deck building remains unchanged, the way units behave on the board is very different, reflecting the fact that airplanes can fly! Most notably, units now have a facing and they have to move each time their card comes up, meaning you have to plan more carefully, trying to set up traps for your opponent in the likely direction of travel, just like a real dogfight. However, deck construction just doesn’t fit the theme quite as well as it does in terms of having officer cards direct the combat on the ground but, despite that shortcoming, the game is still fun and full of thrills and, most importantly, feels fresh and different compared to its peers in the franchise.</p></div><p id="undaunted-2200-callisto"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted 2200: Callisto">Undaunted 2200: Callisto</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221014"><div id="221014" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted 2200: Callisto</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: People who want the action and strategy, but not the historical military theme</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the success of the original game, a growing body of gamers started asking the designers for a version that didn’t glory in the horrors of real-world warfare. Their answer was to move the game to outer space in this sci-fi version. It’s a fantastic translation as we explained in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-2200-callisto-board-game-review"><u>Undaunted 2200 review</u></a>: capturing all the great stuff that have made the franchise such a hit, but also learning lessons to improve on the previous entries. There are vehicles to pilot, greater asymmetry between the two factions, and a more varied mix of scenarios to enjoy. So if the military focus of the previous titles put you off, this is a fantastic alternative, and even if you’re not bothered by the theme then, mechanically speaking, it's the best of the series after Stalingrad. </p></div><p id="promo-scenarios"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Promo scenarios">Undaunted Promo Scenarios</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the series might be interested to learn that, in the years since its release, there have been a number of additional scenarios published in magazines and given away at conventions. Over time the publisher has made most of these available to <a href="https://www.ospreypublishing.com/us/discover/gaming-resources/board-card-games/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>download for free on its website</u></a>, so fill your combat boots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance writer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>GTA V was released in September 2013 for PS3 and Xbox 360 and the game grew substantially over the years with more and more content and features for the uber-popular GTA Online mode. Additionally, Rockstar's teams brought GTA V to PS4 and Xbox One in November 2014 and the PC in April 2015. Versions of the game for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S came out in 2022. In total, GTA V has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-has-sold-an-absolutely-absurd-amount-of-copies-in-the-last-three-months/1100-6531582/" data-ref-id="1100-6531582">sold more than 215 million copies. </a></p><p>Another key thing to know is that for the past 10+ years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-more-than-1000-people-made-gtav/1100-6415330/" data-ref-id="1100-6415330">Rockstar's teams across the world have worked in tandem</a> on whatever the studio is making next, and this likely applies to GTA 6 as well.</p><p>Also during the earnings briefing, Take-Two said the "ambition and complexity" of GTA 6 is greater than any past Rockstar release. CEO Strauss Zelnick said GTA 6 was delayed from Fall 2025 to May 2026 due in part to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-reacts-to-grand-theft-auto-6-delay/1100-6531597/" data-ref-id="1100-6531597">a need for additional polish</a> as part of Rockstar's effort to achieve "perfection."</p><p>"In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach," he said. "While of course, delays pain me--how could they not?--the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection."</p><p>Addressing the long wait for GTA 6, Zelnick told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-id-argue-rockstar-has" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> that while fans have been waiting more than a decade for the next entry in the numbered series, he believes Rockstar's teams have been giving fans what amounts to "a new Grand Theft Auto release" multiple times per year via GTA Online.</p><p>"Rockstar has been supplying content to Grand Theft Auto Online, some of which is so robust that if you go back 15 years, it would have counted as a standalone title," he said. "One could really argue that Rockstar has been putting out a new Grand Theft Auto release a couple of times a year. Same thing holds true for Red Dead Online, which has been on-going. And in the most recent quarter, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online has exceeded expectations."</p><p>GTA 6 launches on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. In other Rockstar news, it's been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-feels-really-good-about-switch-2-amid-reports-of-rdr-2-port/1100-6531595/" data-ref-id="1100-6531595">the studio is bringing Red Dead Redemption 2 to Switch 2. </a></p>

Now, just a few years later, and before the team has released its first game, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/playstation-showcase/2023/05/24/sony-announces-heist-video-game-fairgames">an online heist shooter named Fairgames</a>, Raymond has exited the company.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzM0MzgxOSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ3OTQ4NjE5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0JOMllUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.qOIF32mVNJUCz17mJYYZM-YWpEEYhCcjFt6lm8BeeFo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> broke the news, revealing PlayStation leadership didn’t give Haven staff a reason for her departure, but notes that it occurred several weeks after an external test of Fairgames. The publication’s sources say some developers at Haven “were concerned about how the game was received and its progress.”</p><p>A lot is riding on Fairgames as part of PlayStation’s push for live-service games. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/09/sony-has-delayed-half-of-its-planned-playstation-live-service-games">Though many have since been delayed or canceled in development</a>, PlayStation is looking for another hit like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven">Helldivers 2</a>, but has stumbled with recent releases like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/concord">Concord</a>, which shut down less than two weeks after its launch, and a lukewarm reception to Bungie’s upcoming <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/marathon">Marathon</a>, which is now in hot water as a result of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/16/bungie-confirms-unauthorized-use-of-art-after-artist-claims-her-work-is-present">plagiarized art</a>.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l1Jp4K02L1I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l1Jp4K02L1I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Jade Raymond has been an incredible partner and visionary force in founding Haven Studios,” a PlayStation spokesperson told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter.”</p><p>“[PlayStation is] committed to supporting Haven Studios and excited to continue the journey” with the new studio co-heads, Marie Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski.</p><p>Raymond previously spent a decade at Ubisoft as a producer for the early Assassin's Creed games before joining EA in 2015 as the head of Motive Studios. She left Motive in 2018 to join the now-defunct Google Stadia as head of Stadia Games and Entertainment. Following her stint at Google, Raymond created Haven in 2021. Several Stadia executives followed her there, and it was revealed that same year, Haven was already working on a new PlayStation-exclusive game. Roughly a year later, in 2022, PlayStation acquired Haven, and now, Raymond is moving on to something else.</p><p>For more, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/fairgames">read about Fairgames here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/avowed-update-1-4-brings-arachnophobia-mode-to-the-living-lands-promises-new-game-in-future/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/avowed-update-1-4-brings-arachnophobia-mode-to-the-living-lands-promises-new-game-in-future/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Obsidian has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avowed">Avowed</a> Update 1.4, with an arachnophobia mode to turn all those eight-legged frights into strange colourful blobs with floating swords, while also giving a preview of what’s coming down the line with a roadmap.</p>



<p>I actually think that’s more freaky than a spider, but then I’m not aracnophobic…</p>
<p>Update 1.4’s other bullet points include enhancement for map exploration when you visit new areas, critter loot drops, passing time at camp and more.</p>
<p>The complete patch notes on the Obsidian <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134717-patch-140-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forums</a>, but there’s the highlights below.</p>

<p>Looking to the future, and you can expect improvements to cooking and crafting, more NPC abilities and behaviours, new unique weapons and custom map markers this summer. You’ll have to wait longer to the autumn for New Game Plus, a photo mode, new weapon type and more character customisations, but they’ll be welcome additions.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Obsidian is working to localise the game for Korea and Japan, as well as improve the French localisations.</p>
<p>Here’s the cliff notes for Avowed Update 1.4:</p>
<p><strong>Map Exploration Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once most of a map’s accessible areas are explored, the fog of war will now fully clear.</li>
<li>Entering a city on an overland map (e.g. Northern Paradis in Dawnshore) will now reveal that portion of the map.</li>
<li>Increased radius for fog clearing as you explore.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Critter Loot Drops</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Critters can now be defeated—and may drop loot!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Party Camp Feature</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Players can now wait at the Party Camp to advance time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improved Soul Pod Functionality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Soul Pods now dispel illusions (except for Ryngrim’s entrance, which still requires Yatzli’s help).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Settings Options</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chests now optionally appear on the minimap.</li>
<li>Power attacks with the Bow and Arquebus can now be canceled with a new setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avowed has been one of many highlights for Xbox and PC gamers this year (and PlayStation, to be fair), as Microsoft’s many studios and subsidiaries deliver on long-awaited projects, and as they’ve continually stuffed games into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>. “Avowed is an incredible RPG,” we said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/">our review</a>. “Its vibrant world and stellar cast make every moment a joy to take part in, enhanced by a script that gives equal measure to drama, action and humour. Coming hot on the heels of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, Microsoft’s software revival is well underway.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-acknowledges-stolen-marathon-art-promises-thorough-review.1191372/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie has acknowledged that some of the art featured in the game was stolen from an artist who didn't work on the game, promising a "thorough review" of&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s "in-game assets" as a result.</p>

<p>For context, artist Antireal <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">alleged</a> yesterday that&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s environments are "covered with assets lifted from poster designs [she] made in 2017", posting a number of examples of areas in which&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s art was lifted from her own&nbsp;as proof.</p>

<p>In response to Antireal's allegations, Bungie, <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posting</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>development team's account, confirmed that "a former Bungie artist included [Antireal's designs] in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game".</p>

<p>As a result of the stolen artwork's discovery, Bungie says it will now conduct a "thorough review" of&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s asset pool, specifically assets created or contributed by the former artist in question (who isn't named, for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>Additionally, Bungie says it will be "implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions", although I'm honestly pretty shocked those checks weren't in place to begin with and that something so egregious could get through unnoticed.</p>

<p>The studio says it's "reached out" to Antireal to talk about the issue and is "committed to do right by the artist", as well as by "all artists who contribute" to Bungie's games.</p>




<p>Bungie's lax security when it comes to spotting stolen artwork is even more upsetting given that this isn't the studio's first time being accused of stealing from fans. In 2021, Bungie <a href="https://x.com/Cozmo23/status/1442534201165635587" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">used a fan depiction</a> of one of its characters in promo material, subsequently apologizing and crediting the correct artist.</p>

<p>After that incident, in 2023, a&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>fan claimed Bungie had stolen their art for an in-game cutscene, an allegation that Bungie itself subsequently <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1671927000498597888" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed was true</a>. Then, in 2024, artist Tofu <a href="https://x.com/Tofu_Rabbit/status/1833851336607101076" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">accused</a> Bungie of stealing a weapon design they had made in 2015, and again, Bungie copped to doing so.</p>

<p>I don't want to cast aspersions, but I also don't know how many times something has to happen before it can be considered a pattern. Let's just say I wouldn't be surprised if Bungie was caught out for stealing fan artwork again before&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is released.</p>

<p>If this whole thing hasn't left a bad taste in your mouth and you still want to check out&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, you can do so when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marathon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/marathon/9pb32dkqkzdq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 23rd.</p>
