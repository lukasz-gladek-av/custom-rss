			<p>KONAMI recently held a preview event for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, inviting select press to play the game.&nbsp;A few developers were also on hand to discuss the highly anticipated remake.</p>
<p>Producer Noriaki Okamura, for instance, a veteran who worked on Metal Gear Solid V, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/we-didnt-want-to-mess-with-the-original-hands-on-with-metal-gear-solid-3s-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> VGC:</p>
<p><em>This is one of my favorite titles as well, and since the game was already good, to begin with, we didn’t want to mess around the original creative direction of the game. There are a lot of things that we didn’t feel necessary to change.</em></p>
<p>That is not to say there are no changes in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. Okamura said:</p>
<p><em>This is a 20-year-old game. So when we decided to bring to modern platforms, we didn’t want to make it feel like an old game. We did refine a lot of things to make sure that for those who didn’t play the original, it still feels like a game that came out in this day and age.</em></p>
<p><em>We are well aware that some of the expressions may have been outdated. We have a content warning, however, we left the content in out of respect of maintaining the original creator’s vision that he had for the game. That was an executive decision to leave it in. There are parts that have been modernized and players are vastly different than they were 20 years ago, so there are definitely tweaks, but in terms of story and plotline, we left them as is.</em></p>
<p>Okamura also hinted that KONAMI's plan may go beyond Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater:</p>
<p><em>Our focus right now is to rebuild the creative team, we have some of the core members of the original team, but right our focus is making sure we can deliver the Metal Gear series in this day and age if that takes off, hopefully, we can do more with it.</em></p>
<p>At the event, KONAMI confirmed the console graphics modes. On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, users will be able to choose between a dynamic 4K/30 FPS mode and a performance mode targeting 1080p resolution and 60 FPS.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but this event proves we're likely not far from getting an announcement. Pre-orders have already been <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-opens-pre-orders-confirms-battle-scars-will-remain-on-snake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-jam-showdown-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-jam-showdown-review.964275/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-jam-showdown-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If you’re on the hunt for an impractically large, American truck that doesn’t run on conventional fuel and looks ridiculous, are you going to go with a stainless steel Tesla triangle that wants to eat your fingers, or would you opt for an 11-foot tall, methanol-powered brute that can do literal <em>backflips</em>? I know which one I’d choose. If my friends and family are going to dunk on me for driving a truck that looks deeply unserious, it’s going to be because it’s dressed like a spooky pirate.</p><p>Monster Jam Showdown is equally devoted to these five-ton doofuses shaped like dogs and dinosaurs. While it’s very modest in scope, developer Milestone has injected this family-friendly racer with an enjoyably drift-heavy driving feel, a wild range of stunts, and great damage effects.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Monster Jam Showdown ditches the open world approach of the otherwise mediocre Steel Titans games. It’s not something I miss personally, but this may come as a disappointment to anybody that previously relished rampaging around those open environments between curated events.</p><p>The maps in Showdown may <em>look</em> like open worlds with races and events scattered across them, but they’re not. In fact, the map screens could have just been a bar of event thumbnails, or an ordered list; Showdown doesn’t gain anything from having us shuffling around and zooming into maps within maps seeking out the next available event. It actually feels like a waste of time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As with Steel Titans and 2020’s Monster Truck Championship, Showdown features independent rear-wheel steering controlled by the right stick.</p></div><p>The <em>driving</em> feel, however, is very good. I found it particularly nice to have all the handling aids off, and I enjoy the sensation of slinging these huge vehicles into drifts and seeing them squat back and powerslide through bends on the throttle. As with Steel Titans and 2020’s Monster Truck Championship, Showdown features independent rear-wheel steering controlled by the right stick. It’s a great point of difference with these sorts of racers, and it’s a very satisfying extra element of racing to master. My 10-year-old, on the other hand, was more comfortable with some of the assists on – particularly the steering aid that applies <em>some</em> angle to the rear wheels automatically, but also lets him crank a little more on himself as he got more confident using the right stick to really whip around tight corners. Splitscreen has been a success; if he’s losing and still laughing that’s generally a strong signal something is going right.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Crush Hour</h2><p>While the regular driving is rooted in a degree of reality, the stunt controls are far more fantastical and give us total control of the truck’s rotation in the air. Sure, it’s not especially <em>realistic</em>, but it is plenty of fun to string together lengthy, Tony Hawk-style combos in the stunt arenas. It wasn’t particularly challenging to accumulate huge scores (and building and maintaining a combo should be pretty simple for those with plenty of racing experience) but some of the moves do require a fair bit of finesse – like nailing a perfect nose wheelie and moonwalking your truck backwards. One noticeable blemish is the way trucks interact with crush cars; they collide with and bounce off them <em>way</em> too harshly. It made me more inclined to avoid them rather than squish them, which seems antithetical to monster trucking.</p><p>There are two layers of difficulty beneath the normal AI option, including an easy and very easy mode. Showdown does seem suitable for an audience that will invariably include very young players who are just here to see Grave Digger do donuts.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Showdown does seem suitable for an audience that will invariably include very young players who are just here to see Grave Digger do donuts.</p></div><p>On that note, Showdown is admittedly much smarter than Steel Titans 2 when it comes to unlocking trucks. It won’t hand over the keys to kid-favourites like Grave Digger or Megalodon <em>immediately</em>, but they’ll be earned relatively quickly. This gives you plenty of time to thrash with them on the track, well before you run out of events. For its part, Steel Titans 2 completely buried Monster Jam’s most iconic trucks as distant unlocks, meaning that by the time you secured the most famous ones, you were pretty much out of things to do. It was essentially the automotive equivalent of rolling credits with all the rocket launcher ammo still in your pocket.</p><h2>Big Truck Hunter</h2><p>There are 40 trucks in Showdown, many of which are starring in a video game for the first time. This includes independent trucks like Bad Company, which features a full holographic wrap that is recreated very effectively in-game. Showdown also sees the debut of Excaliber, the current version of a monster truck that’s been around since the ’80s. The trucks all feel the same to drive, but Excaliber’s retro livery and boxy, Chevy square body shell (complete with its array of classic KC Daylighters perched on the roof) have made it my favourite.</p><p>Detail is impressive, including small touches like the scuffed paint on the back of the chassis from standing up during wheelies. It’s things like this that help them feel like real, race-worn vehicles rather than big toys. Damage is also well translated as the trucks shed flapping segments of their fibreglass shells.</p><p>You can unlock and apply bonus liveries and buffs, and those buffs tend to give certain trucks better multipliers for specified tricks. This is an effective way to make us switch around , specifically when you’re looking for an edge to net enough points to earn one of Showdown’s many secondary objectives during the events. Winning is one thing, but often you’ll need to win while also racking up a specific amount of points doing a nominated trick.</p><p>However, there’s admittedly nothing else here to really immerse you into the behind-the-scenes world of monster truck competition as an actual <em>motorsport</em>. Monster Truck Championship still stands alone there. At a minimum, Showdown would’ve really benefited from some kind of custom truck system. Maybe an assortment of plain pickup shells that could be painted and thrown on a standard chassis? Milestone does already have a great, working livery editor in its excellent Hot Wheels Unleashed games, after all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It might have also benefited from a format that better reflects Monster Jam as a touring show, rather than a straightforward list of events to tackle. There are just over 120 events in Showdown, split across circuit races, short head-to-head stages, and freestyle arena activities. Events are short and only tend to take a few minutes.</p><p>The racing is frantic and full of contact, and Milestone has done well to imbue it with a nice sense of speed considering monster trucks top out at 100 miles per hour. The head-to-head races on tight, short stages are the toughest to master against the high-level AI; since you can’t really make a single mistake in these instances I found them rewarding to win. It does all get a bit repetitive, though. Monster Jam Showdown’s mid-price sensibilities appears to have kept the selection of tracks a bit modest and, in order to save fresh ones until late in the game, Showdown will have you racing on the same (or mostly similar) courses in consecutive races. The weather conditions may change, but overall this gets a bit tedious. More stadium and arena variety would’ve helped, also.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gundam-breaker-4-review-build-fighters</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gundam-breaker-4-review-build-fighters.964272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gundam-breaker-4-review-build-fighters<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As someone who has been a Gundam fan for a long time, it was always inevitable that I’d cross paths with Gunpla at some point. Gunpla, which is short for Gundam and Plastic Model, has long been a staple of the series and even surpassing traditional media. It’s become fitting then, that it looped back around to the realm of video games with endless customization potential.</p>
<p>But this isn’t the first time that’s happened, as we’re now up to <em>Gundam Breaker 4 </em>– the fourth game in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/new-gundam-breaker-review-gunpla-galore"><em>Gundam Breaker</em></a> series that brings the customization and building aspect of real-life Gunpla into a virtual space.</p>
<p>That virtual space aspect is played up quite a bit in <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> as players are introduced to a digital arcade-like world from the jump, and it’s in this lobby where everything in the game takes place.</p>
<p>The story of <em>Gundam Breakers 4</em> is simple but effective enough in the way it’s told through chapter-based missions. While it is a sequel to the events of the previous game, it’s clear from the jump that it’s not required for any sort of understanding. The player in-game is a newcomer, and they’re here to take part in the beta test version of the Gunpla Battle Simulator that has since expanded to a home console release.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gundam-breaker-4-01.jpg?itok=NWiLCsnw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gundam-breaker-4-01.jpg?itok=BsDal4oq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the game lobby, another newbie known as Tao along with a female fighter known as Rin start up a clan together with the player, and from there, other fighters of all ranks and experience will show up to try and become allies too – all while some mysterious glitches and curious characters keep appearing in the Gundam Battle Simulator.</p>
<p>Certainly, the story isn’t as crazy as something you might see in say, the <em>Super Robot Wars</em> series, but as a vehicle to get Gunpla parts, it serves its purpose enough with more engaging turns happening after a fairly slow start. I was expecting perhaps a little more narrative-driven focus given the concept of <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> isn’t too far removed from what the anime series <em>Gundam Build Fighters</em> did before it, but the most interesting part is meeting all the different quirky characters and the whole concept of them playing a beta test together where things can go awry at any moment.</p>
<p>The gameplay is a little more exciting with an action-focused rogue-like that relies very much on how you customize and put together Gunpla. You’ve got the option to install two ranged weapons such as rifles and other guns, and two melee weapons like the beam saber or axe. There’s actually a huge assortment to choose from and this is the part that makes <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> shine the most.</p>
<p>During missions, the base gameplay loop involves executing combos, and the longer you chain one up, the better rewards you might get, which can in turn give you more options for Gunpla building. The key is to land higher ranks at the end of every mission, with S-Rank being the best. Ranking is also determined by how fast you get through each challenge, and how many enemy parts you can Break off by dealing lots of damage.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gundam-breaker-4-02.jpg?itok=0tJ6BlF6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gundam-breaker-4-02.jpg?itok=ZS4lWE_h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are even additional abilities aside from normal attacks. In the Gunpla build menu, you can set Optional and Builder Part skills, which grant special OP Skills based on how much the EX Guage bar is filled up and can deal out stronger attacks. They’re important to set up because some of the boss battles can be really challenging, and you’ll need any advantage you can get.</p>
<p>That said, the hack-and-slash gameplay can get repetitive over time, even when the missions start mixing it up as part of the main story. There’s also an online mode you can play with other people including online leaderboards, as well as a practice mode to test the waters before taking a new build out into the field.</p>
<p><em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> also has some quests that unlock Gunpla parts and a Diorama Mode that lets you pose your Gunpla after all your hard work.</p>
<p>So there is a decent amount of things to do in <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em>, but again, the biggest draw is the Gunpla building. There are hundreds of kits available, and just as many parts to collect through the course of normal gameplay. I found the most fun I had with the game just trying to make the ugliest, most extra mobile suit I could.</p>
<p>But after a while, you can collect enough parts to have most of them in a set, and they’ve all got different stats and rarity labeled so it makes it easy to build the best one you want to battle with.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gundam-breaker-4-03.jpg?itok=hMidOjO1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gundam-breaker-4-03.jpg?itok=1nCG8ugY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>After playing the story for a while, collected parts can be upgraded using the Synthesize menu, with the ability to swap out traits to build the most powerful Gunpla. I could spend hours just trying to put together the best kit, it’s really impressive just how much <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> lets you customize all while bringing in those familiar mobile suits from the series.</p>
<p>I could spend hours just trying to put together the best kit, it’s really impressive just how much <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> lets you customize all while bringing in those familiar mobile suits from the series. These familiar suits also show up during situations like boss encounters as well, so for example, I ended up having to take on a giant version of the powerful Unicorn Gundam that required a bit more strategy to defeat than the usual grunts.</p>
<p><em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> keeps a somewhat stylized 3D look throughout, with characters appearing in an anime style similar to the modern anime series. The mobile suits have a fairly clean look, but they fit when you realize they’re representing Gunpla.</p>
<p>My only gripe is the environments are pretty basic, there’s not much going on in terms of modeling, but it’s a small complaint when there are so many Gunpla parts in the game.</p>
<p>Overall, <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> is a game designed for the fans of Gundam. There’s plenty to interact with and recognize from the original series, all while spending time making your own custom model with a massive supply of parts to do so.</p>
<p>The story isn’t the greatest and the hack-and-slash gameplay does get repetitive after a while despite the ability to mix up skills. That said, if you’re just looking for a model kit simulator, there’s plenty of fun to be had until the next <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mobile-suit-gundam-extreme-vs-maxi-boost-on">Gundam game</a> comes around.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Gundam Breaker 4 isn't the deepest game when it comes to the narrative or continued gameplay, but the sheer amount of collectibles and customization is a fine achievement. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

            <title><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege: What’s New In Operation Twin Shells?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/operation-twin-shells-need-to-know/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/operation-twin-shells-need-to-know/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On August 30, Rainbow Six Siege’s Operation Twin Shells will be released worldwide, bringing a fresh update to the platform. This major update will bring the new Operator, Skopos, but we’ll also see a range of tweaks applied to existing Operators. In this update, Ubisoft is also introducing enhanced anti-cheat measures and a few quality-of-life features.</p>



<p>Let’s find out what’s coming in Operation Twin Shells.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-plenty-in-store">Plenty in Store</h2>



<p>Operation Twin Shells is the next major Rainbow Six Siege update, and it arrives globally on August 30.</p>



<p>At the top of the update table sits Skopos, an all-new Operator with a unique twist. Owing to a disability, Skopos cannot enter the battlefield directly, but she can control two robot characters, each with their own purpose in the fight. One is more active and can be controlled like a regular Operator, while the other assumes a defensive position and a monitoring-focused role.</p>



<p>Players will be excited to learn that <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6md8NyzcybEjZ2bMROA5fP/rainbow-six-siege-operation-twin-shells-operator-and-gadget-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft is introducing</a> a range of anti-cheat and anti-toxicity measures when Operation Twin Shells is deployed. This includes multiple concurrent detection systems, binary hardening to protect the game’s code, and a faster ‘Time to Ban’ metric.</p>



<p>In terms of anti-toxicity measures, Ubisoft is introducing an overhaul of the Reputation system <strong>and </strong>enhancing reporting systems and censorship mechanics.</p>



<p>Several changes are being made to what’s already in the game, too. For instance, Solis, Dokkaebi, and NOKK are all being balanced to address some ‘overpowering’ elements – or <strong>underpowered</strong> mechanics. Ubisoft has expanded the Versus AI mode, implemented ‘After Action 2.0’, and created something called Siege Cup.</p>



<p>The Siege Cup platform is in beta and will only be available for PC players at present, but it offers a solid competitive structure for teams to take on all comers. Those successful in the Siege Cup will win a new currency that can <strong>only </strong>be unlocked in competitive playlists, and it’ll be used to unlock special packs and boosters.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Operation Twin Shells?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Canadian Leaves DarkZero On Rough Terms After Three Years On the Team]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/canadian-leave-darkzero-three-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/canadian-leaves-darkzero-on-rough-terms-after-three-years-on-the-team.964260/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/canadian-leave-darkzero-three-years/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Troy ‘Canadian’ Jaroslawski, one of the most decorated Rainbow Six players of all time, has stepped back from DarkZero and will be moving to Soniqs to play out the remainder of the season. In 2021, Canadian joined DarkZero after a brief retirement, and not long after he came back, the team won the Six Charlotte Major.</p>



<p>Now, he’s moving away from the team, but it’s not an amicable departure.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-deserved-better">‘I Deserved Better’</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, DarkZero announce the departure of Canadian with a montage of some of the player’s best moments, but the man himself fired back with a damning statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After putting the time, effort, sacrifice, and thought that I did into this team for 3 years<strong> I thought I deserved better </strong>than this coming without any sort of discussion or attempt to resolve issues. I’d be remiss not to say I’m disappointed in how most of the team handled this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He followed up with a post explaining that he ‘didn’t belong’ at DarkZero and that he’s wholeheartedly looking forward to his future at Soniqs.</p>



<p>Canadian is a two-time Six Invitational champion and has picked up countless chips elsewhere during his lengthy career. Earlier this year, I had the pleasure of watching Canadian compete in Manchester, England during the BLAST R6 Major, which now stands as one of his closing events with DarkZero.</p>



<p>There isn’t a whole lot left in the season, but Canadian will play out the remainder of the year with Soniqs before looking to what comes next.</p>

<p>In-car gaming isn’t something that I thought I’d be talking about today, but here we are. In recent weeks, we’ve seen car manufacturers strike deals with game developers to bring titles into the confines of a range of motor vehicles. It’s a growing trend that was somewhat started by Tesla when the titanic EV firm gave users the ability to play Steam games through the in-car computer.</p>



<p>Tesla stripped that functionality from vehicles earlier this year, but other manufacturers have since stepped up their in-car gaming capabilities.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-passing-the-time">Passing the Time</h2>



<p>On August 26, Volkswagen announced a partnership with AirConsole, a platform that recently struck a deal with BMW. Through the AirConsole system, users can park up and enjoy a range of games from the comfort of their car. While the games available are rather mundane, this is serving as a baseline of what’s possible.</p>



<p>Presently, users can take advantage of the likes of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (using speech recognition technology) or family-friendly games like Uno. The latter uses mobile phones as input devices, which means anyone sitting in the car, front or back, can get in on the <strong>action</strong>.</p>



<p>Even though Tesla removed Steam functionality from the line-up it operates, it <strong>has </strong>still left the ability to run many other titles on the in-car screen. These include the likes of Stardew Valley, Sky Force, and Fallout Shelter.</p>



<p>They’re all designed to be played when the car is stationary – which means <strong>parked</strong> and not just sitting in traffic somewhere. The idea is that you’ll power up a game while you’re charging your car or taking a break from driving. It was a year or two ago that we saw the likes of Cyberpunk being played through a Tesla, but the expectation is that we’ll be back there soon enough.</p>



<p>Do you think in-car gaming is a waste of time or are you excited to see where it goes?</p>

<p>It hasn’t been officially announced, but eagle-eyed users have noticed that the PlayStation store page for LEGO Horizon Adventures states the game will be released on November 14. This game was revealed just weeks ago at the Summer Games Fest event, but it garnered a lot of attention given the serious popularity of the wider Horizon franchise.</p>



<p>If the listing on the PlayStation Store isn’t an error, there isn’t all that long to wait before LEGO Horizon Adventures is released worldwide.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-end-of-the-world-but-cute">The End of the World, But Cute</h2>



<p>Horizon is a prestigious franchise that was kickstarted on PlayStation 4 back in 2017 with ‘Zero Dawn’. This gorgeous, post-apocalyptic series has since been expanded with a follow-up title, a VR game, and now, a LEGO title. It has also transcended PlayStation and found its way to PC, and bizarrely, LEGO Horizon Adventures will also be released on Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Netflix was poised to develop a series based on the franchise, but in July, reports surfaced that the production had been canned.</p>



<p>However, according to PlayStation, it won’t be all that long until we’ve got another iteration of the series, this one in the adorable form of a LEGO game. It’s the Horizon that we know and love, and Aloy is still the protagonist, but it’s all a bit more tongue-in-cheek and humorous, such is the nature of a LEGO game.</p>



<p>It’s also the first Horizon game to boast cooperative gameplay elements – <strong>and </strong>it has couch co-op, which is a rarely seen sight these days.</p>



<p>Per the listing, LEGO Horizon Adventures will be released on November 14.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cutest-cards-we-pulled-from-magic-gathering-bloomburrow</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-cutest-cards-we-pulled-from-magic-the-gathering-bloomburrow.964164/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cutest-cards-we-pulled-from-magic-gathering-bloomburrow<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The current&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>&nbsp;set,&nbsp;<em>Bloomburrow</em>, is basically the unofficial&nbsp;<em>Redwall</em>&nbsp;trading card game. It features cute critters, from mice to otters to raccoons, accomplishing adorable and audacious feats. Along with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-helps-new-players-start">recently revealed Foundations Beginner Box</a>, it's the perfect entry point to&nbsp;<em>Magic.</em></p>
<p>But which ones are the most charming, the most precious? As the objective arbiter of all things cute, I've gone through 45 set boosters and both starter decks to serve you only the best that <i>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</i>&nbsp;has to offer.</p>
<p>Instead of breaking things down by mana, I've separated them by animals that stood out to me, with two extra buckets. So without further ado, let's dive into this empirically derived, scientifically sound list of the cutest cards we pulled in&nbsp;<em>Bloomburrow</em>. Spoiler alert: The best ones are at the bottom.</p>

<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Ravishing Rabbits</h2>
<p>Just look at this little dapper gentleman. Intrepid Rabbit is just a sweet little scout, searching for carrots and resources in the forest. I couldn't pull its token, but the general Rabbit token is also an adorable foot soldier.</p>

<p>Something that really stood out to me with the rabbits in&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>&nbsp;is how giddy I get seeing them use human tools. Head of the Homestead is a picturesque representation of a mother taking care of her children, while Druid of the Spade feels like the rabbit is saying, "Look upon my mystic artifact, the spade!"</p>

<p>Continuing the trend of rabbits using tools, look at Finneas, Ace Archer. Finneas looks kind of slick, sort of like a bunny Legolas. And I can't help but think they trained that little tyke on the Short Bow.</p>

<p>To round out the rabbits, Hop to It is such a pure display of celebration and joy, it was hard not to include it here. And the Carrot Cake? My goodness, it's the cutest way to be both incredibly wrong and immensely accurate.</p>
<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Sweet Squirrels</h2>

<p>Moving onto the squirrels, let's start off with Bushy Bodyguard. I'd trust this little guy with my life, along with his somehow even cuter offspring. No, I will not question the ethics of sending squirrel children into the wars of Bloomburrow.</p>

<p>Squirrels are of course known for foraging for nuts, and these two cards capture that perfectly. Thornvault Forager is just hangin' out, searching for his next meal. And once he gets it, Cache Grab (A+ pun, too) depicts the end result. Just look at those pinchable cheeks!</p>

<p>Foraging squirrels are so cute, it even gave black mana cards an opportunity to be on this list. I'll be honest, I didn't vibe with the black mana cards overall as much, but the desperate squirrels in Consumed by Greed made the cut. And Corpseberry Cultivator, while morbid, also made the mark for me.</p>

<p>But the cutest black mana card in&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>&nbsp;is easily Stargaze. This squirrel looks so high out of its mind, it's about to go on a vision quest.</p>
<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Adorable Otters</h2>

<p>Next up are the otters, which I primarily found in red and blue mana. Many are also wizards, and there's something about watching sea dogs be mystical that just hits that cute note so well. Like see how amazed the Coruscation Mage looks?</p>

<p>The Thundertrap Wizard gets ready to cast a spell, whispering to voices only he can hear. Or is he sleeping? Unsure, but when I found the token, I had to put it here. Look at its staff--it's actually an oar!</p>

<p>Daring Waverider and its big brother, Bria, Riptide Rogue, really capture that "dog about to go on a walk" energy. There's so much joy in their faces, and they're just out there, carvin' up some waves.</p>

<p>Otterball Antics, however, was&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>card that made me want to make this list. That otter just wants to play fetch, and he got that ball because he's a good boy (yes he is!). Pearl of Wisdom had a similar energy to me, with that look of pure happiness.</p>
<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Trash Pandas</h2>

<p>The raccoons of Bloomburrow, aka the trash pandas, live up to their stereotypes as the scavengers of this animal kingdom. Take Out the Trash, Keen-Eyed Curator, and Peerless Recycling all capture that, and they're all adorable, especially Peerless Recycling. He's a little guy on a mission!</p>

<p>Wandertale Mentor also stood out to me, because it feels like it's telling a story. This raccoon bard has so many friends and is just trying to bring everyone together! It's so sweet.</p>

<p>But when raccoons need to get down to business, they're still pretty cute. Brambleguard Veteran is keeping an eye out, and Brazen Collector has an&nbsp;<em>Ocean's Eleven</em>&nbsp;vibe going on.</p>

<p>But all the other raccoon cards pale in comparison to Kitnap. Just look at this snoozing little baby! And ignore the Mad Hatter vibes in the background.</p>
<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Mighty Mice</h2>

<p>Finally, we get to arguably the protagonists of this set, the mice. It's honestly unfair--almost all of the mice I found were cute. Like look at Emberheart Challenger; he's definitely a mighty warrior, but I also want to give him pets. Heartfire Hero arguably looks intimidating, but he's a hero. He wouldn't hurt me for petting him.</p>

<p>No matter what these little rascals are doing, they look cute. Brambleguard Captain is rallying the troops,&nbsp; but all I'm doing is staring at its whiskers. And what's Mouse Trapper doing? We caught it mid-Bigfoot walk, and it's owning the moment.</p>

<p>See what I mean? Every one of these mice soldiers are just too sweet, like they're straight out of a children's picture book.</p>

<p>It was really hard to be choosy here. Valley Rally, Blooming Blast, and War Squeak show some of the cutest war criminals ever, but their names are also illustrative of&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>&nbsp;as a whole. There's a cadence to them that's whimsical. There's rhyme, alliteration, and brilliant word choices. A war cry is barbaric, but a war squeak? Perfection.</p>

<p>Even when these mice are injured or challenged, like in Dewdrop Cure and Early Winter, they're still absolutely adorable. No wonder Disney picked a mouse to be their icon. Just look at their big ears!</p>

<p>To put a bow on the mouse chapter, I want to really drive home just how much this set feels like a children's picture book. Heirloom Epic is so meta, showing a scene of children reading a book with art that looks right out of&nbsp;<em>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</em>. And Might of the Meek, despite the snake, shows a brave little hero at the climax of his own tail (pun intended, thanks).</p>
<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Precious Pairings</h2>

<p>Some of the bets of this set comes from the illustrations of unlikely friendships and pairings that tug at your heartstrings. That childlike hunger in the Bakersbane Duo's eyes is just chef's kiss, and the wonder on Lightshell Duo's faces is just as adorable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Ruthless Negotiation is a little more violent than Playful Shove, they both show cute scenes of playful antagonism in the animal kingdom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And between Parting Gust and Brave-Kin Duo, there's a story of a rabbit-rat alliance that has waxed and waned as time has passed.</p>

<p>My absolute favorite card out of all of these, though, is Run Away Together. It's so sweet, the conclusion of a long story about the forbidden love between Libo and Pulla.</p>
<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Other Standouts</h2>

<p>Now, you might be wondering where the frogs are. And there were a few I found cute; but for the most part, they weren't doing it for me. But Polliwallop has some roguish charm to him, with those piercing eyes. And Sunshower Druid makes me laugh, like he's presenting the sky to you.</p>

<p>Splash Portal might be the cutest frog in&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>. It's tiny but with big eyes, which is an instant path to the top of the charts. However, I love Overprotect. I want to protect him. I will always call this card Overprotecc.</p>

<p>There are some possums in in this set, and Tender Wildguide felt like a great representation of them. It's like a parent and child, braving the big forest. And the child! It's adorable and hungry!</p>

<p>Lizards don't do it for me much either, in real life or in this set. But Iridescent Vinelasher looks like he's trying to be intimidating but just really isn't, and that sort of juxtaposition always gets me. And the flying lizard in Feather of Flight is so elated!</p>



<p>Speaking of juxtaposition, hear me out on this one. Yes, this terrifying badger definitely lifts, and he is crushing a skull. But also, his name is Hugs. And a few of his scars tell jokes!</p>

<p>The last card I wanted to share is Sugar Coat. The art style stood out to me as the most different across the 45&nbsp;<em>Bloomburrow&nbsp;</em>boosters I pulled, but the shocked rabbit gingerbread cookie was just too hard to pass up.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are many, many more we probably haven't pulled yet that are just as cute if not cuter. After all, this is the unofficial&nbsp;<em>Redwall</em>&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;set (I mean, have you seen Arthur, Marigold Night?). Now I'm off to build the most adorable, very viable Commander deck out there.</p>

<!-- cache hit 50:single/related:942df40ddd6398714e204081833d3372 --><!-- empty -->
<p>If you read Ars Technica regularly, you've known <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/leaks-from-valves-deadlock-look-like-a-pressed-sandwich-of-every-game-around/">since May</a> that Valve is working on <em>Deadlock</em>, a mishmash of genres that has been slowly amassing <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/#max">SteamDB-tracked players</a> through an invite-only playtest. Over the weekend, Valve took the "hiding" part out of that "hiding-in-plain-sight" test, launching <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/?curator_clanid=4777282">a bare bones Steam page for <em>Deadlock</em></a>, the company's first attempt at developing a new gaming franchise since collectible card game <em>Artifact</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/exclusive-valve-walks-us-through-artifacts-new-demo-leaves-us-wanting-more/">launched in 2018</a> (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/valve-scraps-revamped-artifact-dumps-free-unfinished-2-0-version-on-steam/">fell apart in 2021</a>).
</p><p>The new page, which went up on Saturday, has precious little information about <em>Deadlock</em>, save for a description as "a multiplayer game in early development" and a 22-second trailer that essentially pans over a piece of concept art. Everything from the game's system requirements to the release date is still "TBD," and players who are lucky enough to get "friend invites via our playtesters" are promised "temporary art and experimental gameplay" on the Steam page.
</p><p>Not that a Steam page is strictly needed for more info on <em>Deadlock</em> at this point. Since the first leaks months ago, the playtest has slowly expanded from hundreds of players to tens of thousands, including some who have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game">posted extensive impressions</a> of the game. Valve has also reportedly lifted rules regarding streaming for invited playtesters, leading to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/deadlock-1">a surge of players showing off live gameplay on Twitch</a>.</p>

<p>Those extended streams and impressions show a six-on-six hero shooter (a la <em>Overwatch</em>) but with teams of NPC drones protecting <em>Dota 2</em>-style battle lanes as well. There's also the requisite <em>Fortnite</em>-style cover construction, <em>Titanfall</em>-style double-jumping and air-dashing, melee attacks and parries, and all the unlockable abilities you could hope for.</p>
<p>Given all that direct info, the presence of a new Steam page mainly serves as an anchor for Wishlist-based reminders, user-defined tagging (bot "MOBA" and "cute" are currently popular), and a lot of spammy/scammy invite-begging in the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1422450/discussions/">Community hub</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1422450/discussions/">forums</a>. Still, it's not every day that a completely new title appears on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=Released_DESC&amp;supportedlang=english&amp;developer=Valve&amp;ndl=1">Valve's old Steam developer page</a>—we've set a reminder to check for the next one in 2030 or so.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/atari-announces-fatal-run-revival-fatal-run-2089/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Atari announced its Fatal Run revival, titled Fatal Run 1989. This game was a huge hit globally when it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/atari-acquires-digital-eclipse-to-bolster-its-retro-focused-strategy/">first released in 1990</a>, and it was available on the Atari 7800 and Atari 2600. Fatal Run 2089 is set for a 2025 release on Steam, Epic, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>This title is being developed by MNSTR Studios, and it will be their first game. Their website shows a portfolio full of 3D projects, such as Mech characters, concept art, and illustration. They have helped with a multitude of projects that perhaps haven't been released yet, as they have a banner with Power Rangers on it.</p>
<p>Returning to Fatal Run 2089, the game is being made in Unreal Engine 5, which will make the races much more intense for players eager to get a hit of nostalgia. This game takes place in a post-apocalyptic fantasy landscape, where players will explore four distinctive global regions, each with its own unique characteristics.</p>
<p>Each region will have hairpin turns, branching paths, explosives, and secret routes for players to discover. Fatal Run 2089 will consist of 20 levels in total for players to race through, with a choice between seven different vehicles, which all have their unique specialities, so players will have to choose wisely and experiment with each vehicle to find the one that will secure their victory.</p>
<p>Atari has released the official announcement trailer for Fatal Run 2089, which can be watched below.&nbsp; It showcases the post-apocalyptic world which is now bathed in radiation, and you join a group of determined scientists known as the "Engineers." By joining them, your mission throughout your time with them is to transport ARCs- advanced clean energy devices that will help clear up the radiation and purify the atmosphere so that the earth can begin to be populated once more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fatal Run 2089 - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kXausJuseIM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it is a racing game, that's not all there is to it. Players will get to face off against four difficult bosses, which come with their abilities and strategies that will require you to think outside the box to defeat them. In addition, there are also fun arcade-style challenges to participate in, where you have to race and take shortcuts to beat the clock.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no official store for Fatal Run 2089 as the game is still in early development, and there is no suggestion of its release price. However, an <a href="https://atari.com/products/fatal-run-2089?utm_source=%C3%9CberStrategist+PR+List+-+Leading+Gaming+and+Tech+News+%282023%29&amp;utm_campaign=1a4793c375-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_08_22_05_16&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-1a4793c375-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official page</a> on Atari provides more details about the game.</p>

But then the company took some of that work and began developing 2020's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-the-kotaku-review-1845237873&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-the-kotaku-review-1845237873"><em>Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time</em></a></span>. That game was well-liked by fans and critics, and Toys For Bob began planning a follow-up. </p><p>This new game, known internally as<em> Crash Bandicoot 5</em>, was planned to be a direct sequel to <em>Crash 4 </em>and would be a single-player 3D platformer, like previous entries in the long-running franchise.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/PzHwPNPW2VM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/PzHwPNPW2VM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robertson’s video</a></span> includes concept art and possible story ideas for this never-finished <em>Crash </em>sequel. At one point, the developers were planning to include Spyro in the sequel, with the report claiming that the two would have worked together to save their respective universes from a giant cataclysmic event. Both characters would be playable, and players would even see both characters’ universes in this multiverse pitch. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to Activision about the report. </p><p>According to the report, Toys For Bob only worked on<em> Crash 5</em> for around three to four months and largely focused on concept art and early environments. In the winter of 2020, Activision canceled <em>Crash 5,</em> reportedly due to <em>Crash 4</em>'s low sales and the publisher wanting to focus on online games over single-player titles.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Official Multiplayer Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For those unaware of "dolphin diving", it's when players launch themselves forward, and once they land, they are immediately prone. While they're in the air, players look like dolphins, and that's where the name comes from.</p><p dir="ltr">This wasn't the only trailer Activision has recently released. Earlier last week,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-liberty-falls-zombies-mode-gets-impressive-and-dramatic-cinematic-trailer/1100-6526085/"> the studio released a new Zombie trailer</a>, which picks up after the events of Black Ops: Cold War's Zombie mode. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on October 25, but<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/"> players can try it out early thanks to the beta set to begin on August 30</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a> has arrived, unofficially kicking off this year's busy autumn and holiday gaming season. As a major studio's semi-open-world action-adventure Star Wars game, it's likely going to be a big deal, even as early opinions are somewhat mixed on Massive Entertainment's post-Division effort. In this guide, we'll explain how long it takes to beat Star Wars Outlaws, giving multiple estimates to cover different play styles, while also highlighting the full mission list for the game's critical path.</p><h2>How long is Star Wars Outlaws?</h2><p>Kay Vess' story sees her exploring multiple planets across the Star Wars universe, and in typical Ubisoft fashion, there's a lot to see whether you're on or off the main mission path. Still, for the type of player only in it for the main storyline, Star Wars Outlaws will take roughly <strong>12-15 hours</strong>. But there's a lot more to see for more dedicated players.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> might not have a release date yet, but Konami has released some new screenshots of the upcoming remake and the game looks awesome. </p><p><em>MGS3</em>'s remake was first announced back in May 2023. Since then we’ve seen some gameplay, some trailers, and some screenshots of the impressive-looking remake of the 2004 entry in the stealth action series<em>.</em> That game was initially released on PS2 and while I think it still looks great today thanks to some really smart art and style choices, there’s no denying that this remake looks more “realistic.” </p><p>On August 26, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/26/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-hands-on-report/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/26/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-hands-on-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony and Konami released 10 new screenshots</a></span> for the upcoming remake via the PlayStation Blog. These new looks at the game come alongside a slew of previews from folks who got a chance to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819">the first 90 minutes of <em>MGS Delta Snake Eater</em></a></span><em>.</em> According to those previews, the game is basically the PS2 classic, but with a fresh coat of Unreal Engine paint. And that sounds pretty good to me! </p><p>In the new screenshots released by Konami on Monday, we can see all the detail that is being packed into the remake. Sure, you can argue that the PS2 original still holds up, I think it does, but it’s impressive to see such photorealistic depictions of <em>MGS 3 </em>locations, characters, and moments. I don’t think the upcoming remake will replace the original <em>MGS3</em> at all, but as a new spin on the classic stealth action game, it sounds exciting.</p><p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> is set to arrive sometime this year for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A sandbox adventure, it mixes farming, exploration, and open-world building in a pixel art top-down world. Featuring a compelling story, unique areas, and epic bosses to face down, it offers hours of content for those wanting a different mining experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Core Keeper</em> offers tons of content with over 10 different biomes to explore, each with their own specific resources and enemies. Just getting through the main storyline and defeating the nine different bosses can take upwards of 30 hours. That doesn’t include completing collections, taking on side bosses, building a creative base, or adventuring through the endgame biome, The Passage. For players who want a game that has plenty of bang for the buck, <em>Core Keeper</em> is a solid title.&nbsp;</p>

Your character will start in the dirt biome, but quickly expand into the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="463ddf9e-fce0-47ad-87f9-b33517bcebd6" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/core-keeper-clay-caves-biome-guide">Clay Caves</a> with the Larva Hive and the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="feebb9da-b498-426b-bb53-e3a00c001842" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/core-keeper-forgotten-ruins-biome-guide">Forgotten Ruins</a>. From there, even more variety is found as you travel through a lush jungle, hit the sands with the beach, and mine through rock walls to find the scorching desert. Within the areas are different monsters, vegetation, and ore formations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story itself is an interesting one and is a fun play on Alice falling down the rabbit hole. You end up underground and are looking for a way out. This underground is closer to what you’d find in <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em>, versus an actual cave system. First, you need to power the mysterious Core that you appear near, then vanquish more bosses to help the Core out. The ending has quite a twist, and without spoiling, is definitely worth hunting down all the souls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way bosses are found in the game makes the combat experience more rewarding. You need to farm resources to attract most of the creatures to a specific location or along a path they regularly travel. That doesn’t mean you won’t see them flying above you or swimming below your boat. It does mean you'll need to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e3e21d0d-ff28-47c5-a777-48cb0a33554e" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/core-keeper-monster-farm-guide">farm monsters</a> to call the bosses, even when their shadow follows you. It also means you can defeat them multiple times if you want to challenge yourself or run out of their unique loot.</p>

Popping bubbles on the beach, squelching when facing slimes, and roaring when hitting a boss all add to the immersion. The music tracks are calming and chilling, depending on where you are, and aid in bringing the game to life.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like all sandbox games, the main downfall of <em>Core Keeper</em> is you can end up grinding for resources, especially towards the endgame. Mining for ore, farming specific monsters, and even getting to the areas you want to reach, can add significant time to your playthrough. If you’re someone that doesn’t like grinding or doing the same actions for a length of time, you still want to check out <em>Core Keeper</em>, but should look into <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b83999b8-753b-41f0-9a88-581efe78884c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/core-keeper-guides-guide-hub">various guides</a> to get those items efficiently.</p>

This is especially the case with the inclusion of world seed and difficulty editing. You can create an easier world for your solo game, but an extremely hard world for playing with friends. You can increase the resources, reduce the possibility of grinding, or decrease certain game aspects you dislike. The customization really brings <em>Core Keeper</em> to the next level when it comes to investing in a game you can continuously play.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Core Keeper Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, Core Keeper is a solid mining sandbox game with some survival mechanics mixed in. It has hours of content to explore, multiple bosses to fight, and an interesting storyline to pull you along. There’s endless creativity on display and it’s worth every penny.</p>
<p>Whether you’re looking for a new game to dive into for long gaming sessions or want something that’s easy to pick up and put down, <em>Core Keeper</em> is the title for you.</p>

                <p>GameSpot checked out the life simulation title InZoi at Gamescom, getting up to hijinks like burning down an apartment, forgetting to eat, and riding every single ride at a beachside amusement park.</p><p>In InZoi you manage both individual "Zois" (think Sims) and the world itself. Each Zoi has personality traits which shape their life goals. You can also customize a daily schedule, letting you manage multiple Zois at once more easily. In contrast to The Sims, you can swap between Zois at any time.</p>

      </div>
<p>As for broader management of the in-game world, you can customize the world's appearance down to furniture and decoration choices. You can also tinker with broad aesthetic sliders, which can make the world more apocalyptic or switch it between biomes. You can even change the general "personalities" of AI-controlled Zois to generally make them amorous, argumentative, inconsiderate, and more.</p><p>The game has a free-roaming structure a la The Sims 3, compared to the lot-based structure of other Sims games. You can leave your apartment or home to explore the rest of the city in a car or on foot. While you can do whatever you want, there is an overarching goal to help the Zois live moral and fulfilling lives. If you succeed, your Zoi will ascend to heaven. If you fail, your Zoi will haunt the city as a ghost. However, you can help ghosts move on by doing more good deeds.</p><p>Take a look at the embedded video for more details. InZoi will launch in early access on PC at a to-be-announced date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-ban-list-update-bans-nadu-from-modern<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has updated their <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> ban list. This is a notable update since the ubiquitous card game's banned and restricted list was updated back in June, which was in the middle of its major competitive scene. This new update is part of a new schedule that coincides with major tournaments, and it contains some notable bans.</p>

<p>In an official blog post, Wizards of the Coast explained the update to their <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list schedule. The post begins with updates to the game's different formats, showing cards that have been added or removed from the banned and restricted list.</p>

In Pioneer and Explorer, <em>Amalia, Benavides Aguirre</em> and <em>Sorin, Imperious Bloodlord</em> are banned. <em>Grief</em> has been banned from Legacy. Vintage format has added <em>Urza's Saga</em> and <em>Vexing Bauble</em> to the ban list. Lastly, <em>Grief</em> and <em>Nadu, Winged Wisdom</em> are banned from Modern.</p>
<p>In the rest of the post, WOTC explains changes to when they will be announcing <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list updates. It acknowledges and apologizes for the issues that come with announcing a ban list during the week of Pro Tour, leading to a breakdown of logistics and player comfort during that time.</p>
<p>Going forward, ban list updates will be aligning with the Regional Championship and Regional Championship Qualifier seasons. This will allow for better adjustments to the competitive play environment and more time to collect and analyze play data. It also means there will be fewer update lists&nbsp; The next one is scheduled for December 2024.</p>
<p>As for the bans themselves, the most notable one is <em>Nadu, Winged Wisdom</em> from Modern format. In a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/on-banning-nadu-winged-wisdom-in-modern">separate post</a> dedicated to discussing the ban, Michael Majors stated the card was "a logistical nightmare" and "a design mistake."</p>
<p>A mistake that was demonstrated during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/are-modern-horizons-3-collector-boosters-worth-it" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Modern Horizons 3</em></a> Pro Tour where decks built around <em>Nadu</em> had a 59% win rate thanks to several dangerous combos. Infinite mana, shutting down and sweeping opposition. Furthermore, these combos would slow games to a crawl since implementation required a high number of permanents changing zones.</p>
<p>The updated <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list goes into effect today.</p>
