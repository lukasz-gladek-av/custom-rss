			<p>The<a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-mod-removes-the-psn-account-requirement-patch-2-fixes-nvidia-dlss-frame-gen/"> God of War Ragnarok PC port</a> is most definitely solid, but it offers few options to scale visual settings beyond the PlayStation 5 version and sometimes looks worse than it as well.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Digital Foundry provided an in-depth look at the port, highlighting how the new version of the game is a great way to play it, thanks to shader compilation issues being pretty much non-existent, thanks to the move to DirectX 12 over its predecessor, great support for ultra-wide and super-wide aspect ratios, NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS upscalers, complete with frame generation where applicable and more.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, besides hitting higher resolutions with smoother performance, God of War Ragnarok cannot look much better than the console release, as the port doesn't offer many options to scale beyond it. In some instances, the PC port even looks worse than the PS5 version in Quality Mode, due to the PC release missing the cubemap tracing system, and some effects, such as moving mist in a certain dream sequence. Portal transitions also aren't as smooth as on consoles, which is most definitely weird, as they look better even on PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>The God of War Ragnarok PC port also has some performance issues on Ryzen 3000 series CPUs and some tessellation setting issues, among other things, which could definitely be fixed with future patches. You can find Digital Foundry's full analysis <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-a-quality-port-with-small-issues-and-here-are-our-best-settings-selections">here</a> and its video version below.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fender-monster-hunter-guitar</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fender-monster-hunter-guitar-lets-you-rock-out-with-rathalos.994434/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fender-monster-hunter-guitar<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fender and Capcom have announced a collaboration to create a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-themed guitar, with the King of the Skies himself, Rathalos, providing the principal inspiration for the instrument.</p>
<p>In a press release, Fender and Capcom describe the Rathalos-themed guitar as an "extraordinary instrument for both game enthusiasts and music lovers", which I suppose it had better be, given that it'll cost you a whopping $2000.</p>
<p>The guitar is a special-edition Telecaster, but unlike most Telecasters, it's got a humbucker for its neck pickup and a single coil for its bridge, so you can choose between heavy, chunky tones "perfect for pairing with distortion pedals" and the thinner twang for which the Telecaster is known.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster-guitar.jpeg?itok=7kP3yZFL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster-guitar.jpeg?itok=RMSTcUix 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>Telecaster is a thing of beauty.</figcaption></figure><p>The basic model of this Telecaster features a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-inspired design on both the body of the guitar and its twelfth fret marker, so you can rock out and pay tribute to Rathalos at the same time.</p>
<p>On the special Japan-only Limited Edition model, you'll find "Rathalos' distinctive wings and flame patterns", and the pickguard features "claw marks", as if Rathalos himself has attacked your guitar (or as if he's been playing it).</p>
<p>You can also expect a glow-in-the-dark effect for the fretboard's side dots and twelfth fret marker on the Limited Edition model, so if you're playing this one during a gig and you want the lights to go down, you'll still create a striking impression.</p>
<p>If you pick this one up, you won't just get the guitar; you'll get a black hardshell case as well, in addition to a certificate of authenticity proving that you own a genuine version of the instrument rather than a replica.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fender-monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster.jpeg?itok=wBd6DZc_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fender-monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster.jpeg?itok=pETo26XY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just look at that finish.</figcaption></figure><p>This guitar is just one part of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-series-sales-100-million-anniversary">20th-anniversary celebrations</a>, and the franchise is still very much going strong today; the latest installment,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date">set for release in February</a>.</p>
<p>Fender's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>Telecaster will be available <a href="https://www.fender.com/en-US/electric-guitars/telecaster/monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster-rosewood-fingerboard-rathalos-red/5602600899.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via Fender.com</a> and via "authorized Fender dealers worldwide" starting from March next year. The Limited Edition model will only be available via Fender Flagship Tokyo and Fender's official Japanese online store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24255841/steam-forced-arbitration-policy-lawsuit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam just removed its forced arbitration policy, opening the door for lawsuits against its parent company, Valve. In <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4696781406111167992?utm_source=SteamDB">an update on Thursday</a>, Steam says <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsubscriber_agreement%3Fsnr%3D2_groupannouncements_detail_%2310">its subscriber agreement</a> “now provides that any disputes are to go forward in court instead of arbitration.”</p><p>Many companies include a forced arbitration clause in their user agreement, waiving a person’s right to a trial in court. Arbitration involves settling a dispute outside a legal system before an impartial third party. This method is often faster but may not get the best results for consumers, as arbitrators <a href="https://www.consumeradvocates.org/for-consumers/arbitration/#:~:text=Arbitration%20is%20a%20private%20system%20without%20a%20judge%2C%20jury%2C%20or%20a%20right%20to%20an%20appeal.%C2%A0Arbitrators%20aren%27t%20required%20to%20take%20the%20law%20and%20legal%20precedent%20into%20account%20in%20making%20their%20decisions.%20There%20is%20no%20appeal%20or%20public%20review%20of%20decisions%20to%20ensure%20the%20arbitrator%20got%20it%20right.">don’t need to consider the law</a> when issuing a decision.</p><p>Many services put mandatory arbitration agreements in their terms of service, which <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4521064">people may not even read or fully understand</a>. Disney recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220228/disney-wrongful-death-lawsuit-subscription-terms">attempted to dismiss a wrongful death</a> lawsuit after a woman died following an allergic reaction at one of its Walt Disney World resorts. The company argued that because the widower agreed to a forced arbitration policy when signing up for Disney Plus, he didn’t have the right to sue (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224277/disney-wrongful-death-lawsuit-waiving-arbitration">Disney later conceded</a>).</p><p>Previously, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240901011847/https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/">Steam’s user agreement</a> said that “you and Valve agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us in individual binding arbitration” for all disputes related to Steam, your account, hardware, or the company’s content and services. The new agreement eliminates any mention of a binding arbitration policy.</p><p>Steam doesn’t say why it decided to suddenly remove the forced arbitration clause. <a href="https://www.404media.co/steam-removes-forced-arbitration-clause-gamers-can-now-sue-valve/">As pointed out by <em>404 Media</em></a>, a group of plaintiffs recently challenged Valve’s forced arbitration policy and were able to file a class action lawsuit over Steam’s dominance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And, astonishingly for the increasingly mercenary game, the event is free! To get started, all you need to do is catch eight Pokémon of any type, and you’ll begin the quest, starting with a completely unexplained choice between “Sword Path” and “Shield Path.”</p><p>It’s sadly rather typical of <em>POGO</em> at this point to present players with such a decision without any prompt or warning what difference it’ll make.

So either route means you get a bunch of dreary but incredibly easy tasks—use eight berries, power up eight times, catch eight Pokémon, then explore 3km, use an incense, and catch another eight Pokémon—which will net you encounters with specific Pokémon, a few Great and Ultra balls, and a thimble-full of XP and Stardust.</p><figure id="" data-id="b21f1b926c92dfab70af63e5e92c3e49" data-recommend-id="image://b21f1b926c92dfab70af63e5e92c3e49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zamazenta, sneaking in for balance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zamazenta, sneaking in for balance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Niantic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b21f1b926c92dfab70af63e5e92c3e49" data-recommend-id="image://b21f1b926c92dfab70af63e5e92c3e49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zamazenta, sneaking in for balance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But what are those Pokémon, you cry! Um. Yeah. If you pick Sword you’ll get rewarded with—and I’m not kidding—Koffing, Galarian Darumaka, Deino and Rufflet. If your choice is Shield, then it’s the dizzying excitement of Koffing, Galarian Ponyta, Larvitar and Vullaby. Yeah, no kidding, the rewards contain not one single Pokémon original to Galar, and just two that are at least local variants. Oh, and all of these Pokémon are regularly just found in the wild, some of them in the game <em>right now</em>.</p><p>The path choice will also give you a different set of Pokémon for a collection challenge, although both include the Galarian starters, Grookey, Scorbunny and Sobble, then bizarrely just swaps out the banal gang that make up the rest to be a trade challenge for the opposite path. Imagine having to trade to get a Seedot—that’s a thing here! And the reward for completing the catch challenge? A SKWOVET. You know, the squirrel thing that you see seventeen of every time you play, and <em>was the prize for collecting the eight Pokémon at the start of this bloody thing</em>.</p><p><em>However</em>, there is one aspect about which I don’t feel scorn, beyond that Niantic is at least not charging for this bizarre anticlimax: it’ll be possible to encounter shiny Zacian for the first time, and that’s a cool, blue dog-lion-thing. Zacian is in 5-star raids, so load up Poke Genie and start grinding for your shiny.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pokemongolive.com/post/galarian-expedition-2024?hl=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/galarian-expedition-2024?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiny Zamazenta is arriving in raids October 4</a></span>, with the start of Galarian Expedition, along with yet another $8 Master Ball research task.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">ScarlettVixen has officially released Mario Adventure 3, a ROM hack (the legality of playing games with ROMs is nebulous at best) for Super Mario Bros. 3, which has been in development for 20 years. The developer stated, "It's been an extremely long project, but after 12 years, it's finally here. Many of this game's elements are iterations and polishes on concepts found in prior projects. Mario Adventure 3 is more than a 12-year project, it's a 20-year amalgamation of ideas waiting to see fruition."</p><p dir="ltr">The first version of Mario Adventure debuted in 2002, and subsequent hacks like Luigi's Coin Quest and Luigi vs. Mario continued to build on its foundation. In Mario Adventure 3, ScarlettVixen integrates features from earlier projects, while adding new elements to the game. Check out a trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN1ORLvuamI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VN1ORLvuamI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The hack includes a variety of features, such as a day-and-night cycle, weather effects, an item shop, and exploration-heavy mechanics. Players can traverse and backtrack through worlds without cutscenes, a concept introduced in Luigi's Coin Quest. Hidden collectibles unlock access to otherwise blocked areas, encouraging players to explore deeply.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, Mario Adventure 3 features major technical upgrades, including a custom level format, an optimized tile-collision system, and rebuilt enemies. ScarlettVixen shared in an <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&amp;t=127986" rel="nofollow ">SMW Central forum post</a> that "roughly 75% of the game has been rewritten from the ground up." New power-ups, like the Ninja Mushroom that allows wall-jumping, and a revamped item system are also introduced. The hack pushes NES hardware by displaying up to 28 colors on screen at once and features a full save system, allowing players to revisit completed levels.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's plot centers on the Malice Mushrooms invading Bowser's Kingdom, with Bowser blaming Princess Peach's kingdom for the infestation. Mario must clear the Malice to prevent a war between the kingdoms.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-real-time-combat-mod-now-allows-party-to-get-involved.994377/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-real-time-combat-mod-now-allows-party-to-get-involved/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the release of Patch 7 for Baldur's Gate 3, the modding scene has been inundated with new projects, as Patch 7 saw the release of the official modding toolkit. As previously covered, one particular modder named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tinybike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tinybike</a> is working on turning the combat into <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modder-working-on-real-time-combat-mod/">real-time combat</a>. Originally, they shared a video of how their progress was coming along, and it only showed the main character facing off against an enemy with no sort of party in sight.</p>
<p>There have been many new mods released for Baldur's Gate 3, as well as many being showcased as they are in production. This includes mods such as making new maps, and taking players to lands such as Avernus. This particular mod has been in production since the toolkit came out, and tinybike has released a new YouTube video that shows off the mod in detail, and how the mod has evolved since last time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Real time combat test 3 - companions &amp; timers (Baldur's Gate 3)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C0FBQknd0mU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the description of the one-minute video, TinyBike stated that this was a "very rough draft" and started testing out the companion and ally AI battles in a new campaign on Balanced difficulty. While they've said that this is a rough draft, it still seems rather detailed and actually allows cutscenes to happen without the possibility of imminent death while you're trying to have a conversation. However, the video does take place on the Nautiloid, which doesn't exactly harbor a ton of danger. In the video, the combat is incredibly fast-paced and chaotic, with enemies dying quickly.</p>
<p>"Many people have commented that combat seems really imbalanced, which is 100% true," they stated in a previous test video also posted on their YouTube. Even in the latest test video, this also seems to be true, as combat seems to be swayed in your team's favor. In a previous test video, tinybike commented, saying, "The main challenge right now is that the built-in BG3 combat AI is only accessible during turn-based combat. Just to test things out, I'm using some simple handrolled 'AI' logic, but I suspect this won't work well for more complicated encounters."</p>
<p>The beginning combats are relatively simple to some of the ones that players encounter later on, where it's possible to end up in combat with up to twenty enemies at once. Of course, it only gets harder once you change the difficulty, which would most likely add some extra complications to coding a project as big as this. The project is progressing nicely, but features like multiple attacks, stealth, and initiative all need to be added to this mod.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-studio-poncle-publishing</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-survivors-studio-poncle-moves-into-publishing.994374/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-studio-poncle-publishing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>developer Poncle has announced that it's opening a publishing wing, but it sounds like the indie studio doesn't want to do things the way most traditional publishers do.</p>
<p>Speaking at an investor and publisher event in Liverpool in the UK yesterday (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/vampire-survivor-developer-poncle-opens-publishing-arm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via GamesIndustry.biz</a>), Poncle says that although it's moving into publishing, it doesn't "want IP" in the same way most publishers do.</p>
<p>Instead, Poncle wants to allow developers to "make their games", with the emphasis on "their"; the studio says it wants, in GI.biz writer Vikki Blake's words, to "work more as a label or fund" rather than as a publisher in the traditional sense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-publisher-gameplay.jpg?itok=UVYz61Sp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-publisher-gameplay.jpg?itok=CiIn3jRt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>dev Poncle is branching out into publishing.</figcaption></figure><p>Poncle says it's looking for games made with "sincerity, passion, and depth", according to the GI.biz report. It'll offer those games support for funding, platforms, localization, and more, as well as development advice.</p>
<p>Additionally, Poncle wants to offer its signings marketing support, helping them to create what Poncle says will be "replayable, affordable, and fun" games, akin to the philosophy that birthed&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>.</p>
<p>However, Poncle also says it doesn't want to sign <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-gallowspire-survivors-10-release-date">"Survivor-like" games</a>; that's one of the studio's "insta-nos", so if you've got a&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/temtem-swarm-announced-mashing-together-pokemon-like-creatures-and-survivors-style">esque game</a> to pitch, you might want to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>The newly-minted publisher's other major no-nos include Web3 games, as well as anything that uses generative AI and any kind of free-to-play mobile game. It sounds like Poncle's publishing heart is very much in the right place.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1838926583823831488" rel="noopener" target="_blank">major update "that no-one knows about" for the game</a> is in the works, and&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>is also getting the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-survivors-getting-animated-tv-show" rel="noopener" target="_blank">animated series treatment</a>, although I'm not entirely sure how production company Story Kitchen is going to handle this one. We'll have to wait and see, I suppose.</p>

It’s an unexpected difficulty spike in a game that’s mostly about the simple joys of carving up mob after mob of brutal alien hordes, at least if you’re playing solo with AI-controlled allies.</p><figure id="" data-id="645dc3357e022956dea6d3b8b4600238" data-recommend-id="image://645dc3357e022956dea6d3b8b4600238" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Space Marine fights gargoyles.

In addition to the PVP Sparring Arena, private matchmaking, and ultrawide support on PC, the update tinkers a lot with the AI bots that accompany you during the campaign in single-player. The biggest change is that your space marine brothers will more aggressively aid your during fights without stealing too much glory for themselves:<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Various inhibiting restrictions were lifted, allowing bots to be more helpful and effective, while still not beating the game for the player</li><li>Bots will now help focus-firing zoanthropes when the player attacks them.</li><li>Heavily eased restrictions on bots finishing of enemies instead of leaving them for the player, to reduce annoyance.</li><li><strong>Bots are now allowed to help with Gargoyle objectives</strong></li><li>Fixed a variety of bugs related to bots getting stuck</li><li>Fixed a bug where bots can run out of ammo on weapons without a magazine</li></ul></blockquote><p>While this has consequences for the entire campaign, the developers at Saber Interactive specifically call out the Gargoyle objectives. Previously, the AI bots would follow you around and hang back even when the health bar on one of the towers was plunging to zero. Now, they’ll actually join in the fight, similar to if you were playing with real humans. It’s also interesting to see the restriction “heavily eased” on bots finishing off enemies. Brutal finishers are a way to quickly restore your character’s shield in the middle of a tense fight. I’ll be curious to see if that becomes harder with the renewed bloodlust of the bots. </p><p>The rest of the patch deals primarily with bugs and map fixes. It also improves the customization options for dressing up your marine. Operations Mode spawns for Chaos enemies have been nerfed a lot as well, though elsewhere, enemies like the Hive Tyrant have been made more difficult in the regular campaign. A lot more content is on the way for<em> Space Marine 2</em>,&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http:// https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-faq-pvp-spawns-servers-veteran-co-op-1851652630&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http:// https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-faq-pvp-spawns-servers-veteran-co-op-1851652630" target="_blank">including new classes</a></span>, but for now this looks like a nice set of tweaks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Remedy Entertainment, the developers behind Control and Alana Wake, have entered a loan agreement with Tencent for €15 million ($16.76 million). </p>



<p>The announcement comes <a href="https://news.cision.com/remedy-entertainment-oyj/r/inside-information--remedy-enters-into-a-eur-15-million-convertible-loan-agreement-with-tencent,c4043667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via press release</a> from Remedy on Friday morning. It’s a move that Remedy CEO Tero Virtala says allows the company to move forward with development of games as well as self-publish future titles.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-remedy-partners-with-annapurna-to-bring-control-and-alan-wake-to-film-and-television">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-partner-annapurna-control-alan-wake/">Remedy Partners With Annapurna To Bring Control and Alan Wake To Film and Television</a></h6>



<p>“Part of Remedy’s long-term strategy has been to strengthen our position in the value chain, to have more control over how our games are commercialized, and to grow our share of the value these games can create,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As we move towards self-publishing, this financing will support us in developing and fully realizing the potential of the games we have in development and successfully carrying out the commercial activities of our next self-published games. Tencent’s investment demonstrates strong confidence in Remedy’s long-term vision and strategy.”</p>



<p>Remedy currently has a number of games in development, including Control 2 and Control spin-off game Project Condor. The studio is also working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-2-is-now-playable-as-max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake</a> that is in full production.</p>



<p>The convertible loan agreement carries an 8% annual non-cash interest rate that will convert at €27.2($30.40) per share. The price will allow the loan to be converted up to 811,100 new Remedy shares. That represents roughly 5.98% of all shares in the company.</p>



<p>Tencent currently owns 15% of Remedy.</p>

As part of that, has consolidated the current playlist selection into the following:</p><p> • Battle Royale Solos &amp; Quads</p><p> • Resurgence Duos &amp; Quads</p><p>Plunder, Bootcamp, and active Limited-Time Modes will remain available, and Trios will continue to be available via Ranked Play, with the current season ending on Thursday, October 17.</p><p>However, it’s what Warzone has lost, rather than what it now has, that has sparked a backlash from fans, with Duos and Trios no longer available in Battle Royale mode, and Solos and Trios unavailable in Resurgence.</p><p>This means that from now until at least the launch of Black Ops 6 on October 25, Urikztsan (the current Battle Royale map) only supports Solos, Quads, and Plunder Quads, and Resurgence has a Duos and Quads map rotation, with Trios available in Ranked Play only via Rebirth Island (by far the smallest map in the game).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s fair to say this announcement has sparked a backlash from Warzone’s hardcore community. “This might be one of the worst decisions I’ve ever seen,” said YouTuber Westie. “You’re essentially sunsetting core branches of your game and giving no real explanation at the time the change is being made.</p><p>“Some added context/information would be wonderful.”</p><p>Here’s some more reaction:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is no Way hahahahah</p>— James - JGOD (@JGODYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/JGODYT/status/1839350258339631537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 isn’t even out you don’t have to butcher the playlists till it drops lil bro🙏😭</p>— HunterTV☄️ (@itsHunterTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/itsHunterTV/status/1839350382679773642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just say you dont want us to play Warzone till BO6 drops… this is hilarious</p>— Chris (@STYLERZ97) <a href="https://twitter.com/STYLERZ97/status/1839358649078362262?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m 100% positive people would rather wait 5 minutes to get into a trios or duos than be forced to play quads man down or with randoms. Worst decision I’ve ever seen. Sheesh.</p>— Ral (@Rallied) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rallied/status/1839360922349097070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RIP to the social media guy posting this who had zero influence over this decision 😭 <a href="https://t.co/KwmvHqz3gd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KwmvHqz3gd</a></p>— Isaac (@IceManIsaac) <a href="https://twitter.com/IceManIsaac/status/1839354342027211162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Raven has yet to offer an explanation for its decision, but some are speculating it has to do with a need to maintain fast-filling lobbies amid a perceived shrinking playerbase. Players are also wondering why Raven namechecked the release of Black Ops 6 in its announcement — Warzone is set to incorporate the upcoming shooter’s mechanics, weapons, and gear into the game, but there’s no explanation for why this would require a playlist consolidation.</p><p>For now, Warzone players have no choice but to play with this new, consolidated playlist offering, or, as some are threatening, quit until their favorite ways to play return.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-is-finally-returning-to-call-of-duty-warzone-and-fans-are-delighted">Activision announced that Warzone is bringing back the map that started it all, Verdansk, in spring 2025</a>. Verdansk is the most beloved map in Warzone’s four-year history, and it returns to the battle royale complete with iconic points of interest such as Stadium, the Train Station, and Superstore. Fans are now hoping their favorite playlists will be available in time for Verdansk’s release.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has announced&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian</em>, a followup to this year's&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator</em>.</p>
<p>According to Koei Tecmo, the new game will be "a new adventure from the world of&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana</em>", but it'll feature "new protagonists and an original story", so don't expect to follow up with the characters from the previous game.</p>
<p>All we know about&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>so far is that it's currently in development for PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch (sorry once again, Xbox users), and that it's intended to launch next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-resleriana-the-red-alchemist-and-the-white-guardian-path.jpg?itok=V_03tia3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-resleriana-the-red-alchemist-and-the-white-guardian-path.jpg?itok=oqgzv6fG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>sure looks like an&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>For what it's worth, though, the teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>sure makes it look like an&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>It's got all the idyllic locations, mysterious-looking caverns, and wide, sweeping expanses you'd expect from the series, plus plenty of cozy-looking villages.</p>
<p>The new protagonists look like they fit the bill, too; there's a studious-looking anime boy who wears glasses, and a girl with cat ears who looks like she's going to take the role of&nbsp;<em>Atelier</em>'s familiar sassy protagonists.</p>
<p>You can check out the teaser reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>right here. It doesn't give too much away, but we're not expecting the game until next year, so that makes sense.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo says this game will "build on the experiences of the&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series while also evolving", and also that it'll be "completely offline", so you won't need an online connection to play it.</p>
<p>It's not yet clear whether the game will be a free-to-play title with microtransactions <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-to-play-all-star-jrpg-atelier-resleriana-announced-for-west-by-koei-tecmo">like its predecessor</a>, but given that it's totally offline, it sounds like it'll be a premium JRPG instead. Let's hope so!</p>
<p><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2025. Stay tuned for more.</p>

For the past decade and a half, the studio has largely positioned itself as, above all, a maker of games in which choices matter, and that’s extended across multiple series. Both <em>Dragon Age </em>and its space opera franchise, <em>Mass Effect</em>,<em> </em>have given players universe-bending choices that have carried over between games through save data transfers and external apps that let you craft your world state. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, however, only three decisions from previous games will carry over, and that has fans concerned about the sequel’s handling of continuity.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

In this menu, you’ll have the chance to create your version of the Inquisitor, the protagonist of 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. Then you’ll be able to make three key decisions (or report which decisions you made in these situations when playing <em>Inquisition</em>) that will be reflected in the story: who did the Inquisitor romance, did they disband or maintain the titular organization, and are they still friends with Solas, the party-member-turned-antagonist of <em>The Veilguard</em>? Given Solas and the Inquisitor’s past relationship, these will obviously play key parts in how that character reacts to events in <em>The Veilguard</em>, as you won’t be controlling them this time around. But given how many big events have happened throughout three previous games, fans are wondering just how much, if any, impact their previous decisions will have on the story.<br></p><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, <em>Veilguard</em> creative director John Epler explained that the trimming down of imported choices was partially because the fourth game takes place in a distant region of its universe. <em>The Veilguard </em>is set in northern Thedas, whereas previous games were in the south. So maybe it doesn’t matter whether you ended up with the traditionalist Cassandra or the more progressive Leliana as the church’s leader at the end of <em>Inquisition</em>, because that’s all happening elsewhere.</p><p>On its face, I buy that explanation for why a large swath of choices from previous games are seemingly not brought up in <em>The Veilguard</em>. If BioWare doesn’t bring up these choices in any dialogue or codex entry, does it really matter what, specifically, is going on elsewhere in the world? This approach worked for <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, which was set in a different galaxy from its predecessors, allowing it to carefully write around which of the galaxy-changing choices you made at the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435">end of <em>Mass Effect 3</em></a></span>. What I and several other fans are left wondering is how this will affect returning characters in <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>There are two major figures in this discussion: The Inquisitor and Morrigan, a party member from the original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> and a major supporting character in <em>Inquisition</em>. Both characters have been confirmed to return in <em>The Veilguard</em> and both were part of one of the biggest decisions in <em>Inquisition</em>. Near the end of the game, there is a questline in which either the Inquisitor or Morrigan drinks from the Well of Sorrows. This magical well is said to house elven knowledge, but it will come at a price. Regardless of which of the two of you drinks from the well, one of you is forever tied to Mythal, an elven goddess who has possessed Flemeth, Morrigan’s mother.</p><p>Flemeth is seemingly killed and absorbed by Solas at the end of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> and the decade-long theory has been that Solas may have some kind of magical control of either the Inquisitor or Morrigan after being revealed as a traitor at the end of the game. Now, without the ability to import this decision into <em>The Veilguard</em>, fans worry it might be going absolutely nowhere, which is strange for a game that centers on Solas and the elven gods. The lack of choices that specifically refer to Morrigan is also strange considering she may have a son depending on if the player romanced her in <em>Origins</em> or conducted a ritual to conceive a child in the endgame. In any case, the inability to import any choices pertaining to her has taken fans by surprise.</p><p>The Inquisitor, meanwhile, is one of the biggest question marks leading up to<em> The Veilguard</em>. BioWare has confirmed the character will appear in the game (I may have spent a good 30 minutes trying to recreate mine in the character creator when I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350">played the game earlier this month</a></span>), but has been tight-lipped on what their deal is this time around. But the fact that you only answer three questions about their journey has fans concerned about both the substance of their role in <em>The Veilguard</em> and whether it’s possible for the game to represent all the variations of the hero players have made over the years.</p><p>That’s a tall order, of course. But it understandably matters to players, given that the conflict between the Inquisitor and Solas is one of the most personal in the series. (I’d even argue that they should have still been the protagonist of the game in which you face him, but I digress.) Now, we’ll be meeting a version of our old hero entirely defined by BioWare’s writing team with very little input on our part. If the only questions about them we’re allowed to answer are “Who did they romance?” and “Are they still friends with Solas?” that doesn’t leave a lot of room for nuance. There’s a question now of whether players who weren’t especially invested in Solas are going to get a character who’s a little too different from their own Inquisitor for their comfort level.</p><p>But even if you don’t put the Inquisitor and Morrigan under a microscope, it is questionable that the only choices that seem to have any impact on <em>The Veilguard </em>come from <em>Inquisition</em>. This may make sense in context of the full game, but it does feel diametrically opposed to a series that once let you use an app to import every decision from earlier games, big and small, into <em>Inquisition</em>.</p><p>Though a lot of fans are understandably concerned, others have been more understanding, saying that <em>The Veilguard</em> should focus more on new relationships and choices as they pertain to new protagonist Rook rather than being overly referential. Others are taking the wait-and-see approach, hoping that once the game is actually out these decisions will make better sense in context or that those choices will come up in another <em>Dragon Age </em>project down the line.</p><p>Epler explains that, in selecting which choices <em>The Veilguard </em>would import, the team wanted to pick details that could result in more than just a cameo and some altered dialogue. I could see things like the status of the Inquisition and the Inquisitor’s relationship to Solas having major ramifications, but like many others, I am surprised that some very significant choices aren’t going to be brought up in a game <em>about</em> those related characters and factions. What I played of <em>The Veilguard </em>felt like it had a lot of strong connective tissue between the games of old even without explicitly referencing my choices, but I never met Morrigan or the Inquisitor in my demo. I don’t know how I’ll feel about their roles when all is said and done. We’ll see how it all pans out when <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>launches on October 31.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Fight alongside and against Ancient China’s most feared warriors.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Koei Tecmo Games [3,018 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games">Koei Tecmo</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Omega Force [1,236 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/omega-force">Omega Force</a> have released new information and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Dynasty Warriors: Origins [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a></em> introducing new gameplay details following its Tokyo Game Show 2024 live stream. <span id="more-918291"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>From the “Yellow Turban Rebellion” to the climax of the “Battle of Chibi,” the story of <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> will transport players to the heart of an ancient China in turmoil. Through the eyes of a nameless hero, players will have to make choices in order to restore peace and shape history to their own experience.</p><p>Travelling across the world map as they embark on their epic journey, players can suppress rebellions or choose to rescue government forces during “Missions,” overcome “Skirmishes,” and visit various locations where they will be able to buy weapons. Throughout their quest, players will also encounter a variety of characters familiar to the <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> franchise, such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei. Depending on the bond forged, these characters can become travelling companions, or an enemy.</p><p>Battles in <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> will require players to be more strategic than ever before. A variety of “Tactics” can be used to command their allies and coordinate forces. By gathering a large number of soldiers under their command, fans will also be able to form a “Large Force” which they can lead by deploying “Grand Tactics” maneuvers. This will allow players to radically change the course of a battle. However, users will need to keep an eye on their opponents, who will also be able to form a “Large Force” and will try to deploy their own “Grand Tactics” to win.</p><p>In one-versus-1,000 combat, players will have to master and alternate between swift and powerful attacks that can break an opponent’s guard. Repeated attacks will increase the protagonist’s “Bravery”, enabling them to use powerful and unique attacks called “Arts.” These “Arts” will be unique to each weapon, so it will be crucial for players to master the various arsenal at their disposal, allowing the protagonist to gain “Rank” and thus improving their skills.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Not only will players have to master the protagonist’s various attacks if they want to emerge victorious on the battlefield, but they will also have to strengthen their defense. By blocking enemy attacks at the right moment, they can unleash a powerful riposte, “Parry,” which creates a breach in the enemy’s defense. Some attacks cannot be blocked, so players will have to dodge them before counterattacking.</p><p>Finally, players will sometimes encounter powerful officers protected by an energy called “Resolution.” Players will have to work on reducing this “Resolution” to weaken them before they can launch a powerful “Assault” attack which can sometimes be the decisive coup de grace.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,067 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,157 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,350 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384580/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_ORIGINS/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> on January 17, 2025.</p><p>View a new set of screenshots <a href="//">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>“Ask the Producer Sho!” Live Stream Archive</span></h2><p>(From 3:19:22 to 4:07:28.)</p><p><iframe title="コーエーテクモLIVE! in TGS2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cj3NIx8hEN0?start=11962&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_918292"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Valve's new hero shooter, Deadlock, hasn't even officially launched yet, but cheaters are already becoming a problem. The game is currently in the midst of a closed beta, meaning players can only access the game via an invite from another player. But that hasn't stopped the game from gaining <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valves-new-game-hasnt-been-announced-already-has-almost-17000-concurrent-players/1100-6525718/" data-ref-id="1100-6525718">massive popularity</a>, and as is the case with many online shooters, more players means more cheaters.</p><p>Naturally, Valve is handling the influx of aim-bots and other instances of cheating the way any reasonable developer would: by turning the offending players into frogs.</p><p>"When a user is detected as cheating, during the game session the opponents will be given a choice between banning the user immediately and ending the match or turning the cheater into a frog for the rest of the game and then banning them afterwards," the Deadlock developer known as Yoshi shared in <a href="https://forums.playdeadlock.com/threads/09-26-2024-update.33015/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a forum post outlining a recent game update</a>. "The system is set to conservative detection levels as we work on a v2 anti-cheat system that is more extensive. We will turn on the banning of users in a couple of days after the update is out. When a match is ended this way, the results will not count for other players."</p><p>The frogs in question are essentially defenseless, unable to do damage or use the abilities of the character they were playing prior to being frog-ified. Non-cheaters can easily kill a frog, or simply choose to let it leap around the arena for the rest of the match.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-finally-acknowledges-deadlock-a-new-game-people-have-been-playing-for-months/1100-6526115/" data-ref-id="1100-6526115">Deadlock was officially announced</a> in late August, when Valve uploaded an announcement trailer and lifted the NDAs signed by streamers and other playtesters. The game's official release date has yet to be announced, but one thing is certain: No fairytale princesses will ever plant a kiss on any of Deadlock's frogs, especially given their history of cheating.</p>

<p>Version 5.1, which is titled "The Rainbow Destined to Burn", launches across all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available on October 9th. It follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-50-release-date">August's Version 5.0</a>, which brought the nation of Natlan with it, as well as a number of other new features.</p>
<p>This update isn't quite as major as the last one, but it does continue the Natlan storyline, asking you to help rescue the nation from "destruction and the looming threat of the Abyss". We've all been there.</p>

<p>She can debuff enemies, heal her teammates, and deal area-of-effect damage to enemies, making her a versatile (if somewhat tricky to get to grips with) character for your team.</p>
<p>Xilonen will be available as part of the first half of Version 5.1's Event Wishes, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-showcases-new-5-star-geo-character-chiori">Chiori</a>. The second half will bring reruns of Nahida and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-hu-tao-build-guide">Hu Tao</a>.</p>
<p>Version 5.1 also introduces the Sabzeruz Festival in Sumeru, where you'll get the chance to take part in a number of minigames and extra activities for the chance to claim some rewards, including an opportunity to recruit Candace.</p>

<p>Of course, HoYoverse has also released a number of codes to help you grab some free goodies, as is customary when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update announcements. Here are today's codes!</p>

<p>A new patch update in Deadlock has announced that cheaters in the can can now be turned into a frog before being banned.</p>



<p>The new update came from the Deadlock patch notes, which reveals that Valve has added an initial anti-cheat detection system into the game. “When a user is detected as cheating, during the game session the opponents will be given a choice between banning the user immediately and ending the match or turning the cheater into a frog for the rest of the game and then banning them afterwards.”</p>



<p>Valve describes the new system as its first step in being able to detect cheaters and is “set to conservative detection levels” while the team work on a v2 anti-cheat system. One of the biggest questions here though is, will we still be able to turn cheaters into a frog in the new system?</p>



<p>Despite Valve saying that the update will roll out in a couple of days, one X user (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/poggu__/status/1839438568110031076" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@poggu__</a> has been able to snap some footage of what it will look like:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Deadlock is still in its ‘early access’ stage but has already seen an all-time peak of 171,000 players on Steam, with a daily concurrent peak of around 100,000 as of late.</p>



<p>As of the time of writing, Valve is yet to officially announce its full release date, but assumptions are that it’s likely to be sometime in 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of Deadlock? And what do you think of the new anti-cheat system that’s been implemented to turn cheaters into a frog? Let us know in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/deadlock.17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a>!</p>
