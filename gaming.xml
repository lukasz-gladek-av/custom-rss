Thankfully, we know how to mute players in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> so you don’t have to listen to the white noise of someone’s oscillating fan if you don’t want to.</p><h2 id="h1794"><a id="console"></a>How to mute players on PS5 and Xbox</h2><figure id="" data-id="dc5476381867950c83a43bab6b58adaa" data-recommend-id="image://dc5476381867950c83a43bab6b58adaa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Match Settings screen, with the cursor highlighting one teammate's muted voice chat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Match Settings screen, with the cursor highlighting one teammate's muted voice chat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc5476381867950c83a43bab6b58adaa" data-recommend-id="image://dc5476381867950c83a43bab6b58adaa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Match Settings screen, with the cursor highlighting one teammate's muted voice chat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> makes great use of the many keys on a keyboard, but quite a few functions aren’t included as part of the default controls on PlayStation or Xbox. </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Press the Menu/Options button on your controller during a match.</li><li>Select Settings and you should be taken to the Match Settings tab which lists the players of both teams.

Fortunately, there’s a shortcut.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Go to the Settings menu during a match or on the main menu screen.</li><li>Move over to the Controller tab using R1/RB.</li><li>Move to the Communication sub-tab using R2/RT.</li><li>Scroll down until you find the option to remap a button for the Voice Chat Menu.

If you’re unsure of what to get rid of for it, I recommend remapping it over the Chrono Vision button. Developing a general knowledge and familiarity with the maps will make that ability redundant anyway. Chrono Vision is set to the right Directional Pad/Button by default.</p><h2 id="h1795"><a id="pc"></a>How to mute players on PC</h2><p>Muting a toxic player is a lot faster on the PC version of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. For starters, you can do it the longer way console players use. That means navigating to Settings, Match Settings, and then choosing who to mute. Who has time for all that though? Any time spent on a menu is time you could be making use of your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182">Team-Up abilities</a></span>. Luckily, the PC version already has a default key that leads right where you need to go.</p><p><strong>Press the P key and you’ll find yourself at the Match Settings screen.</strong> Look for the player(s) who are disrupting your play, and click on the message or speaker icons next to their usernames to mute text and voice chat from them. </p><h2 id="h1796"><a id="text"></a>How to disable text chat</h2><figure id="" data-id="df8cea084a8a4996d396ccd6bf5b9fb7" data-recommend-id="image://df8cea084a8a4996d396ccd6bf5b9fb7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Social Settings tab, with the cursor hovering over the Chat submenu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Social Settings tab, with the cursor hovering over the Chat submenu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="df8cea084a8a4996d396ccd6bf5b9fb7" data-recommend-id="image://df8cea084a8a4996d396ccd6bf5b9fb7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Social Settings tab, with the cursor hovering over the Chat submenu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Any form of chat is important for Competitive matches, but I won’t judge you for preferring to rely on the Ping system in Quick matches. If you just want to avoid seeing particular types of messages in general, you can filter out what goes through the chat. Simply go to the Settings menu and move over to the Social tab. The Chat submenu allows you to enable or disable the following message types:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Friend Whisper Messages</li><li>Team Messages</li><li>Event Messages</li><li>Faction Messages</li><li>Spectator Messages</li></ul><p>Curiously, there doesn’t seem to be a way to automatically disable chat from the enemy’s team. The only way to stop seeing trash talk from the opposing side is to individually mute them as we covered above.</p><p>Muting players might feel like a mean thing to do, but it’s worth it if you don’t think it will be a major detriment to the team. And it’s certainly the right thing to do if someone’s being toxic. There is nothing wrong with zoning out during some quick matches and just having fun with your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-free-skins-ps5-psplus-1851721614&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-free-skins-ps5-psplus-1851721614">free skins</a></span>. Either way, the option to mute players is present for multiple reasons, so don’t feel bad about using it.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With the absolute smash month that is February 2025, in which we see the release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Civilization VII, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, and Avowed, March may appear like a lightweight initially. The month does feature a few big releases, like Two Point Museum and Atomfall, but they’re more niche. No matter, the biggest video game releases in March 2025 still look enticing!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-hottest-game-releases-of-march-2025">The Hottest Game Releases of March 2025</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for a slew of AAA releases in the month of March, then you’re going to be sorely disappointed. But if you want a few indie and AA titles to round out your library and provide a little break from the big studio releases before summer, then March definitely has you covered!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Two Point Museum</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 4, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Split Fiction</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 6, 2025</li>



<li><strong>FragPunk </strong>(PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 6, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 18, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</strong> (Nintendo Switch) – March 20, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – March 21, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls </strong>(PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 21, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Tales of the Shire</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – March 25, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Atomfall </strong>(PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S) – March 27, 2025</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, a handful of titles are expected in March 2025 but with no official release date, including <strong>Commandos: Origins</strong>, <strong>Football Manager 25</strong>, and <strong>Killing Floor 3</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-looking-forward-to-april-2025">Looking Forward to April 2025</h2>



<p>Before anyone gets too excited, April looks like a light month—at least for now. The most significant releases aren’t that major and include:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Last of Us Part II Remastered (PC)</li>



<li>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</li>



<li>Tempest Rising</li>
</ul>



<p>This is the lull before summer pops off; just wait and see!</p>

It was a sad ending for a once-popular franchise. But a small indie team’s new game might provide a happy ending after all. </p><p>Announced way back in 2020, <em>Restitched </em>is an upcoming PC game that looks a lot like<em> LittleBigPlanet</em>. It features a stuffed teddy bear as its main character and will let players create new levels and maps to share online via the Steam Workshop. </p><p>Here’s the new trailer for <em>Restitched:</em></p><p>It’s impossible to not notice how similar this game is to Sony’s <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>. According to Trixel Creative, the small team behind the project, they were fans of <em>LBP </em>and many played it years ago. But Trixel Creative claims <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/press&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/press" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Restitched</em></a></span> isn’t just about remaking <em>LBP </em>on PC. </p><p>“Some may think we’re creating <em>Restitched </em>just to bring the same experience to the PC, but that couldn’t be further from the truth,” explained the studio in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/faq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ on the game’s website</a></span>. “This genre of gaming is largely unexplored, and we love the concept so much that we think there is room for multiple titles to explore it!”</p><p>“Games like <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>have nurtured many creative minds and offered a way for all ages to realize their imagination,” the FAQ continues. “We aim to make a game that can do the same for PC players, albeit with our own unique innovations. We will always have massive admiration and respect for the genre-pioneer that is <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, along with its many talented developers.”</p><p>The devs also claim this new game isn’t connected to a fan remake of <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>which was also called “Restitched” that was canceled by Sony lawyers in 2020. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-littlebigplanet-pc-fan-game-sony-shut-down-with-a-cease-and-desist&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-littlebigplanet-pc-fan-game-sony-shut-down-with-a-cease-and-desist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trixel Creative was the team behind that project</a></span>, too, and exactly how they are separated isn’t made clear on the team’s website. </p><p>When Trixel Creative starting working on <em>Restitched </em>in 2020, the <em>LBP </em>franchise was on life support. Now, four years later, Sony has pulled the plug on <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, and <em>Restitched </em>could be the closest thing fans get to a full-on sequel. </p><p>There’s still no release date for <em>Restitched </em>and it sounds like the game won’t be arriving on consoles anytime soon. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361090/Restitched/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361090/Restitched/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can, however, wishlist it on Steam now</a></span>.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Initially, a banner at the top of the site read “Independent gaming news powered by Walmart,” but it was later changed to “Triple-I gaming news powered by Walmart.” (This, editor-in-chief Brandy Berthelson told Aftermath, was both an acknowledgement of the criticism and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/is-dave-the-diver-an-indie-game-i-would-say-no-says-game-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a nod to <em>Dave The Diver</em></a>, which similarly took flack for embracing an indie aesthetic while owing its existence to a corporate benefactor.)&nbsp;</p><p>Despite that bit of front-and-center branding, Restart staff attempted to distance themselves from Walmart’s influence out the gate.</p><p>“Restart is powered by Walmart, but Restart operates as an independent site,” editor-in-chief Brandy Berthelson wrote in <a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/welcome-to-restart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post introducing the site</a>. “When we mention a game, we'll provide purchase links that will take you to Walmart using a partner tracking code. This link provides us with 0% of the sale if you decide to buy the product, but it does help Walmart see exactly how customers arrived at the product. Walmart doesn't influence our editorial direction. We hope you can see this gives us zero incentive to provide biased review scores or other information about a game.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>I'd just rather them position themselves as that explicitly – an entertainment venture that might get some access because they're a marketing arm – rather than something 'independent.'</p></blockquote></figure><p>This disclaimer only led to more questions: Why stress that you’re not getting affiliate dollars from Walmart when the company is still ultimately footing the bills? How do you avoid a conflict of interest when, as stated, Restart is at its most beneficial to Walmart when people are clicking affiliate links and generating data? What, with that in mind, would incentivize you to ever publish negative reviews? And above all else, why suggest to prospective readers that you are “the video game industry’s latest (and in our humble opinion, greatest) independent source for gaming analysis and entertainment” when your corporate connection is clear as day?&nbsp;</p><p>John Warren, who headed up Tencent-owned gaming publication Fanbyte until the mega-corporation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/15/tencent-lays-off-nearly-all-of-staff-at-its-gaming-site-fanbyte/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off nearly all its staff in 2022</a>, can’t help but feel skeptical.</p><p>"While [Restart's] arrangement is different than Fanbyte's, in which Tencent directly owned and ultimately controlled the fate of the site, I still see parallels that tell me the positioning of Restart as ‘independent’ is extremely odd,” Warren told Aftermath. “Independent how? I'm not going to go to Restart for hard-hitting investigations or opinions because they've essentially stated we shouldn't expect it. ... That's actually totally fine! I'd just rather them position themselves as that explicitly – an entertainment venture that might get some access because they're a marketing arm – rather than something 'independent.'"</p><p>Waters were further muddied by the discovery that Restart is the product of Moonrock, a strategy and content marketing agency – something which, at first blush, would not seem to share the same goals as a more traditional news publisher. But those who run Restart – Berthelson and two other full-time writers, as well as editorial director John Benyamine and managing editor John Gaudiosi – have deep roots in games journalism, and they want to build a publication that serves readers, not just Walmart.</p><p>“When I left Gamer Network (which I loved), I went into content marketing with another company and, eventually, my partner and I started Moonrock. We wanted to use our now-50+ years of collective experience to help connect brands to gamers, and we decided we wanted to do that for brands that already understood the importance of gaming," Benyamine, who got his start at Nintendojo and went on to work at places like GameDaily, AOL Games, Joystiq, and the Gamer Network, told Aftermath. "There was also serendipity, as the same layoffs that prompted Moonrock’s creation also meant some amazing writers lost their jobs. We worked our asses off to make this natural connection happen. Talented, passionate writers who can create great content for an audience who will hopefully buy and preorder their games from the retailer funding the effort.”</p><p>As for why Benyamine chose not to go the <em>wholly </em>independent route, he’s seen – and worked at – too many sites that have crashed and burned while charting their own course.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“While launching Restart without a sponsor may be looked at as preferable, there’s the danger of getting into the trap of chasing traffic, making a poor user experience through more and more ads, and giving more work to fewer staff to make ends meet,” he said. “We weren’t interested in following the same path that has proven very difficult and sometimes fatal to some amazing publications."</p><p>But big money backers – even those who “get it,” as Benyamine insists Walmart does – don’t always make for lasting foundations. Restart’s closest well-known analog, Game Informer, <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-closed-layoffs-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently folded</a> despite a decades-long lifeline from GameStop, and major publications like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2023/03/31/launcher-mission-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a> (disclosure: I worked there) and <a href="https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> have abandoned gaming verticals at various points.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>We weren’t interested in following the same path that has proven very difficult and sometimes fatal to some amazing publications.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Restart’s staff isn’t harboring any delusions that Walmart will provide unconditional support.</p><p>“We would be naïve to think Restart can last forever if it underperforms, but thus far, through the building of the site and our few months in soft-launch, Walmart has been nothing but a supportive partner,” Berthelson told Aftermath. “‘Why would Walmart continue to fund Restart if the site underperforms?’ is a bridge we would cross if and when we had to cross it, but it helps that we – the Restart team at Moonrock – have our own standards and metrics for success we hold ourselves to, rather than being beholden to a list of [key performance indicators] from Walmart. The editorial team isn’t even aware of how poor the numbers would have to be before Walmart would consider pulling its funding.”</p><p>When it comes to affiliate links, Walmart’s main horse in this race, the matter is a little more complicated. In short, readers don’t have to click them, but it would be good if they did, and that would almost certainly please Walmart. Still, Berthelson believes that if she and her team create something worthwhile, the rest will come.</p><p>“If we can build a community of passionate gamers by sharing our opinions and recommendations, then of course we hope those readers will look to support our work by clicking the affiliate links we offer, and they will always have a choice regarding whether or not to do so,” Bertheleson said. “We can’t and would never force people to click our affiliate links or make a purchase after clicking them, but we will have those links there if they’re interested. Restart doesn’t receive any money when someone uses an affiliate link and buys a product on Walmart’s website. The links will simply tell Walmart where the shopper came from and will help Walmart see whether or not the site is achieving its goal of community building and outreach."</p><p>Berthelson added that Restart won’t shy away from negative reviews. Though the site’s review system only includes three badges – Required, Recommended, and Respectable – games that miss the mark won’t be awarded with any badge. She offered <a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/funko-fusion-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a (gently) critical review of <em>Funko Fusion</em></a> as an example.</p><p>“The three review badges are an alternative to having a 5- or 10-point scale, or a star-based scale, and is similar to how other sites may use word-based quality descriptors,” she said. “We took some inspiration from Eurogamer’s previous scoring system for that. If a game receives a negative review, it simply doesn’t receive a badge."</p><figure><blockquote><p>We would be naïve to think Restart can last forever if it underperforms, but thus far ... Walmart has been nothing but a supportive partner.</p></blockquote></figure><p>If you’ve made it this far and have come to the conclusion that Restart isn’t especially well equipped to challenge an industry prone to exploiting workers and audiences alike, you are correct. But as with spiritual forebears like Game Informer – or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kyleor.land/post/3ldhddje7ea2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart’s own in-store magazine</a>, GameCenter, which ran until 2023 – that’s not really the goal.</p><p>“We know sites like Aftermath are better equipped for hard-hitting journalism,” said Benyamine. “Our focus is a bit simpler in covering and celebrating this passion of ours from a consumer perspective.”</p><p>Freelancers like Jason Fanelli also understand the assignment.</p><p>“From my experience, they have news pieces handled in-house for the most part, so whenever I pitch them, it would be for a review or preview opportunity. The occasional feature might play there too, but admittedly I pitch elsewhere for pieces like that,” Fanelli, who’s been writing about video games for 16 years and who has contributed to Restart, told Aftermath. “I'd agree that Restart isn't looking to do what [Jason] Schreier is doing, and that their content is more focused on the games themselves: news, reviews, previews, etc. I could be wrong, of course, and they could be working on the biggest exposé the industry has ever seen as we speak, but I wouldn't hold my breath.”</p><p>This gets to the core of the conflict around Restart: On one hand, a publication like this is far from unprecedented; just speaking from a personal standpoint, I grew up obsessively poring over Game Informer and its lesser-known Electronics Boutique equivalent GMR while, especially as I got older, recognizing that they existed in part to help sell video games. But while video game magazines and websites have always ridden various cascading waves of marketing hype, there used to be alternatives. Now publications fold on what feels like a regular basis, and traffic/SEO mandates have big sites cozying up more and more closely to corporate interests. </p><p>With a growing number of journalists out of work, companies like <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic</a>, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a>, and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> have also launched their own editorial efforts that use a similar voice and draw on some of the same talent primarily to sell games. Independent sites are few and far between because – per the <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">object lesson we’ve provided</a> – it’s really hard to do this kind of thing in the current landscape. That tension, perhaps more than Restart’s existence in a vacuum, has left a bad taste in the mouths of some industry figures.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Walmart money could fund valuable journalism, but it never will. That's the truth that's so frustrating for me and many others as it relates to Restart.</p></blockquote></figure><p>"My issue is, no one seems to want to fund investigations, reporting, and criticism,” said Warren. “Journalism is obviously in a terrible place everywhere, but games journalism is especially anemic right now. With all respect to the staff of Restart, I didn't recognize any of them as established journalists known for the kind of reporting that is being underfunded right now. Walmart money could fund valuable journalism, but it never will. That's the truth that's so frustrating for me and many others as it relates to Restart."</p><p>Does the video game industry at large <em>need </em>another Restart-shaped publication when the internet is already inundated with enthusiast sites, sludge farms, and content creators? No, probably not. But with walls closing in on writers of all stripes, the site offers <a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/restart-is-now-accepting-freelance-pitches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fresh source of income</a> for those still trying to hack it atop a rapidly-melting ice floe. That’s not nothing, especially considering <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the state of things elsewhere</a>.</p><p>"As a freelancer, my options for pitching features is a very small list – and most of the time I don’t even get a response. My options for pitching features that pay well? It’s like two places," writer, author, and friend of Aftermath Aidan Moher <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aidanis.fun/post/3ldhd2voslk2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Bluesky. "So, honestly, Restart will go on my list and its turn-order placement will be dictated by pay rate."&nbsp;</p><p>“The funding from Walmart, coupled with Moonrock's other work, does scream corporate influence, and the skepticism is understandable. However, in my working with them, it seemed above board,” said Fanelli. “Working with them on the pieces they commissioned was a respectful experience where I was given the freedom to write however I want, Brandy's editing process was quick and simple, and the rates were solid. I never felt limited by them while I worked for them; they trusted me, and I wrote what I wanted to write. I enjoyed writing for them, and I'd do it again if the opportunity arose.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-games-journalism-2024-game-informer-ign"><h3>The Best And Worst Games Journalism Moments Of 2024</h3></a><p>It was the worst of times, it was the less-worst of times</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/26/24329530/western-digital-2tb-wd-black-c50-expansion-card-umbra-cono-smart-lamp-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’ve just unwrapped a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">Xbox Series X</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review">Series S</a> for Christmas, you’ll have enough storage out of the box to download several games. But you’ll quickly feel the squeeze from 100GB-plus installs, especially if you tend to keep a heavy rotation. Expansion cards are your only relief on Xbox consoles if you’re playing titles optimized for Series X/S. Thankfully, you can get a 2TB expansion card cheaper than ever, with <strong>Western Digital’s WD_Black C50</strong> going for $189.99 ($70 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-WDBMPH0020BNC-WCSN/dp/B0DK74LG91?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>. You can also get it in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-WDBMPH0020BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44B1VSH?tag=theverge02-20">512GB for $69.99</a> ($10 off) and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-WDBMPH0020BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=theverge02-20">1TB for $109.99</a> ($48 off). That said, the 2TB model is the better deal in the long run.</p><p>Because the Series X and Series S use a proprietary storage format, you can’t use an external SSD, an internal NVMe SSD (as you could on the PS5), or a standard external hard drive to play newer games that are optimized for those consoles. You can use those hard drives to <em>store</em> Series X/S games, but expansion cards like the C50 are the only ones you can actually play them from. That’s because they support the platform’s “velocity architecture,” which has a minimum speed requirement and uses unique hardware and software tricks to enable console features like Quick Resume, not to mention other benefits for developers. Anyway, you don’t need to be a computer science major to understand the bottom line: if you want more storage for your Series X/S games, you’ll need an expansion card.</p><div><p>Western Digital’s storage expansion cards for Xbox Series X / S consoles are speedy, plug-and-play cards that match the performance of the consoles’ onboard SSDs. They offer a slightly lower-cost alternative to Seagate’s expansion cards, which were the only game in town for years.</p></div><p><h3>A few more deals</h3></p><div><ul><li>Now through December 31st, home decor brand <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.umbra.com%2Fcollections%2Fend-of-year-sale"><strong>Umbra is running a sitewide sale</strong></a> that takes 20 percent off most products in its store, including the <strong>Cono portable smart lamp</strong> we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23863589/favorite-smart-home-gadgets-ifa-2023-tech-show">fell in love with at IFA last year</a> that’s down to $76 ($19 off) at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.umbra.com%2Fproducts%2Fcono-lamp">Umbra’s online store</a>, for example.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-corrupted-blood-classic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you lived through&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft</em>'s Corrupted Blood incident, you'll probably remember it as one of the most memorable (and potentially terrifying) moments in online gaming history. This week,&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft Classic&nbsp;</em>players got a chance to experience that very same plague anew.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1hkxzs5/looks_like_we_are_going_back_to_2005_someone_in/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Redditor Lightstruckx</a> (via <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2024/12/26/wow-classic-players-manage-to-recreate-the-infamous-corrupted-blood-event/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Massively Overpowered</a>), players on&nbsp;<em>Classic</em>'s Season of Discovery server managed to recreate Corrupted Blood a few days ago, carrying the eponymous debuff into the Alliance capital of Stormwind City, where it proceeded to decimate the population just like the first time.</p>

<p>Lightstruckx's accompanying video shows exactly the kind of carnage you'd expect from Corrupted Blood; players are taking periodic damage ticks from the debuff and dropping like flies as healers fail to outpace the relentless disease.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/world-of-warcraft-classic-corrupted-blood-lightstruckx-video.jpg?itok=yKpjNjvt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/world-of-warcraft-classic-corrupted-blood-lightstruckx-video.jpg?itok=_7-pJfT8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's chaos out here. Screenshot courtesy of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1hkxzs5/looks_like_we_are_going_back_to_2005_someone_in/" rel="nofollow">Lightstruckx on Reddit</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>One commenter beneath Lightstruckx's video <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1hkxzs5/comment/m3i00t7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">imagines the carnage</a> if Corrupted Blood somehow made its way to one of&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft Classic</em>'s hardcore servers, which feature permadeath; you've got one life, and after you lose it, it's over for your character.</p>

<p>Of course, I hope this doesn't happen for the sake of everyone who's managed to build up a treasure trove of loot and gear in hardcore mode, but on the other hand, I can't deny it'd be fun to watch.</p>

<p>In case you aren't familiar, the Corrupted Blood incident happened back in 2005. Hakkar the Soulflayer, a boss in the Zul'Gurub raid, inflicted a debuff on players called Corrupted Blood, which caused their health to tick down periodically.</p>

<p>While players themselves couldn't carry the debuff out of Zul'Gurub, their pets could, and adventurers quickly found that resummoning their deactivated pets outside of the raid would cause Corrupted Blood to be applied in areas it should never have appeared in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/world-of-warcraft-classic-corrupted-blood-zulgurub.jpg?itok=Fy9DN1YX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/world-of-warcraft-classic-corrupted-blood-zulgurub.jpg?itok=pONpp9hN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pictured: the&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>population after Corrupted Blood was done with it.</figcaption></figure><p>The event led to widespread sociological interest, with <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(07)70212-8/fulltext" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some epidemiologists</a> looking to Corrupted Blood in order to try and understand how a real-life pandemic on a similar scale might play out.</p>

<p>Sadly, the scope and breadth of the original Corrupted Blood incident isn't likely to be repeated today; Blizzard is far more vigilant about such things than it once was. Still, it's almost nostalgic to see this disease murdering player after player yet again, so many years later.</p>

                <p>A giant robotic frown is the first thing you see while flying behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/astro-bot/" data-ref-id="5000-630892">Astro Bot</a> into a droopy, rain-stricken tropical island. A handful of glowing purple locks hold the colossal metal creature to the ground. Destroy them, and the entire world around glows with transformation.</p><p dir="ltr">Free Big Brother--a standout Astro Bot planet--sees a level transform with emotion. Beginning as a darker tribute to Shadow of the Colossus, it evolves into the epitome of platforming joy that rivals exploring the sunkissed secrets of Super Mario Sunshine's Delfino Plaza. Raindrops grow fewer and fewer before the colossal and friendly creature becomes the final stages of the level itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether it's Ape Escape or Uncharted, Astro Bot is adept at recreating the feelings that the franchises it showcases made us feel. The adrenaline of ruin-destroying gun battles or the awe inspired by the scale of a toy-sized Jörmungandr are both apparent, even if the feelings only last for a few moments.</p><p dir="ltr">Free Big Brother achieves something even more impressive, imbuing the somber themes of Shadow of the Colossus into a platformer that elicits nothing but smiles, and still makes that sadness feel genuine.</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as Astro Bot, complete with his umbrella hat, touches the sand, the main goal is to destroy each lock holding Big Brother down as soon as possible. The gigantic mech pulls at your heartstrings as it struggles and groans as each lock cracks. Exploring every nook and cranny of this island isn't a priority: Saving Big Brother comes before all else.</p><p dir="ltr">PlayStation fans will immediately recognize the somberness as a tribute to Team Ico, the creators of Shadow of the Colossus. Images of Wander, Mono, Dormin, and the 16 colossi come flashing in as soon as reality sets in.</p><p dir="ltr">It felt fitting to see a piece so clearly inspired by Fumito Ueda, especially as Team Ico used to work alongside Team Asobi before a Japan Studios merger in 2021. Some of the Japan Studio developers were "re-centered" around Team Asobi. Of the 69 credited developers who worked on Astro Bot, one worked on Shadow of the Colossus and 12 worked on The Last Guardian, Team Ico's last game before many of its developers joined Ueda at his new studio.</p><p dir="ltr">This crossover is part of the reason all these tributes feel so incredible. Besides the fact that studios like Naugthy Dog and Santa Monica Studio consulted on the sections that paid tribute to their games, developers who worked on Ape Escape, Gran Turismo 5, Knack, and other games are all credited as developers on Astro Bot. The tributes feel wonderful because some of the people who created the originals created the tributes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4416538-free_big_brother_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416538" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4416538-free_big_brother_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416538"></a><figcaption>The opening segment of Free Big Brother | Credit: Team Asobi</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4416538-free_big_brother_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As soon as Big Brother is freed, the titanic metal man wades out into the ocean as fresh sunlight begins to soak the island. Once the tropical locale has been explored, he beckons Astro Bot to join him in the water. Astro Bot then ascends the limbs, neck, and head of Big Brother as the entire island comes into view on the horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">The sunlight, view, and music come together--combined with the natural fun of just navigating the tiny robot around a unique space--to create the best moment in Astro Bot.</p><p dir="ltr">It feels especially joyful now that we know that Ueda has been working on a successor of sorts at his new company, GenDesign. He, along with many former members of Team Ico, recently showcased their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-of-the-colossus-creator-reveals-untitled-new-game/1100-6528438/">untitled new project at The Game Awards</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The magic in Astro Bot is that it's more than 50 levels, which packs over 15 hours of gameplay time, and still feels incredibly brief. There are dozens of moments with something as meaningful as that somberness found in Free Big Brother, although nothing reaches the emotional peak that the Team Ico tribute does. Each moment is short, sweet, and leaves you wanting a whole lot more.</p><p dir="ltr">”Having something that’s 12 to 15 hours of condensed fun, where there wasn’t five minutes in which you felt it was long or lacking, is much more valuable than 40 hours when you have some moments that you feel like skipping,” said Astro Bot creative direct Nicolas Doucet in an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-06/playstation-s-astro-bot-is-a-model-for-the-video-game-industry" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Free Big Brother stands out in that 15 hours because of the brief sadness experienced. It's unlike anything else in Team Asobi's adventure. The combination of a narrative beautifully woven into level design, a genuine tribute to a beloved franchise, and fantastic moment-to-moment gameplay makes it one of the standout moments of 2024.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

			<p>2024 has seen some great horror games. From eldritch horrors to a girl with superpowers, to surviving horrific trials and, of course, the release of the highly-anticipated Silent Hill 2 remake. If you've been wanting some new scares but aren't sure what games are hot off the press and perfect to play, this list sums up the best horror games that came out this year. We've been spoiled for choice with the games that have been released, especially with titles like Still Wakes the Deep and Silent Hill 2.</p>
<p>For more of our lists of the best games released this year, make sure to check the website regularly, as more lists are released by our team in the final days of the year.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a></em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Silent Hill 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">9/10</a>)</h2>
<p>It's no surprise that we're listing Silent Hill 2 first. While it performs better on PlayStation 5 than it does on PC, the game is still a great experience and has helped introduce new people to the franchise, as well as provide nostalgia to those who were already deep in the Silent Hill fandom. With the history of Bloober Team, a lot of fans were very nervous about how this game would pan out. However, it turned out to be a faithful remake, with some extra easter eggs from the original that made fans happy with the product they received. Overall, it was an incredibly well-done job, and we can only hope that they will remake the others in the future.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective1.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>
<p>It's a surprising title to make it onto the list, but this exclusive Nintendo Switch title has been one of the best horror game releases of 2024. The Famicom Detective Club series was first started in 1988, with the original titles getting a remake for the Nintendo Switch in 2021. Fast forward to now, and we have Emio - The Smiling Man. This game felt like it came out of nowhere, but it was also an exciting title for those who managed to play the originals or for those who enjoyed horror in the form of a visual novel. While it may not be everyone's typical horror cup of tea, it's definitely worth a shot if you want to feel on edge and creeped out by the atmosphere.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/The-Casting-of-Frank-Stone.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>The Casting of Frank Stone (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-casting-of-frank-stone-death-is-not-the-end/">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The Casting of Frank Stone was a highly anticipated game by fans of Dead by Daylight and was titled Supermassive Games, as this would be the first collaboration between Behavior and Supermassive. The collaboration resulted in a choice-matter horror game based on the world of Dead by Daylight, but those unfamiliar wouldn't need any prior knowledge of the game. Below is an excerpt from Francesco De Meo's review of The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p><em>The story of The Casting of Frank Stone is definitely among the game's best features, if not the very best. Supermassive Games managed to create a story that, while rooted in the lore of Dead by Daylight's universe, is thoroughly enjoyable even by those, like myself, who aren't too familiar with it.&nbsp; The multiple timelines also work quite well, and it is extremely interesting to see how characters have changed over the years.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Crow Country</h2>
<p><a href="https://crowcountrygame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crow Country</a> came as quite a surprising hit, as the game set out to be a love letter to original survival horror games from the 90s. It had the same aesthetic as the original Resident Evil and Silent Hill games and somehow managed to provide that familiar feeling of nostalgia while keeping you on edge and fighting for your survival in a horrifying theme park full of monsters. This game also made it onto our l<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-horror-games-to-play-this-halloween/">ist of games to play for Halloween this year</a>, where you can find more horror games to check out if you're in need of a scare.</p>
<p>Crow Country was released in May and has been a highly successful horror indie game since then. On Metacritic, it has a score of 84 and a User Score of 7.9.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Alone in the Dark (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alone-in-the-dark/">7/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Alone in the Dark features a star-studded cast, with David Harbour (Stranger Things, State of Affairs) and Jodie Comer (Killing Eve, Doctor Foster) as the main characters. This title is a re-imagining of the original 1992 Alone in the Dark and is also the seventh installment in the franchise. If you're a fan of eldritch horrors, this game is something that you're going to enjoy, as they uncover hideous monsters, horrifying environments, and a lot more terrifying things that will keep you on edge. Admittedly, this game wasn't as popular with critics and the general audience, receiving a score of 63 on Metacritic and a user score of 7.4. Unfortunately, the studio (Pieces Interactive) was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/alone-in-the-dark-developer-pieces-interactive-has-been-shut-down-by-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a> shortly after the game's launch due to its commercial performance, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alone-in-the-dark-and-outcast-a-new-beginning-sales-were-underwhelming-says-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deemed unsatisfactory by parent company Embracer</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-forest-hits-new-steam-player-record-ten-years-after-early-access-release.1069425/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-forest-steam-player-count-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>has hit a new concurrent Steam player count record a full ten years after the game's original release in Early Access, and it's all thanks to the ongoing Steam Winter Sale.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/242760/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a>&nbsp;shows that the game is currently sitting at a rather impressive 91,370 players on Steam, and that its 24-hour peak player count is 98,323, which also happens to be its all-time peak.</p>

<p>Interest in the game has been steadily climbing since the Steam Winter Sale started last week, and it's not hard to see why; you can currently grab&nbsp;<em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>at a whopping 90% off. That's right: the game will set you back only $2 at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-forest-steam-player-count-record-sale.jpg?itok=RM-nzIqS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-forest-steam-player-count-record-sale.jpg?itok=Rox0qTUp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>is currently on sale at a deep, deep discount.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only has&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>'s player count skyrocketed, but the game has also attracted almost <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/242760/The_Forest/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">13,000 recent reviews</a> at time of writing, and they are, of course, overwhelmingly positive.</p>

<p>Admittedly, many of the reviews are essentially one-liners or memes rather than genuine assessments of the game, but still, it's clear that&nbsp;<em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>has the kind of staying power many indie games can only dream of.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Sony doesn't make its PS4 player metrics public, so we don't know how many people are enjoying the game on console right now. Still,&nbsp;<em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>isn't on sale on Sony's machine, so if you want to enjoy it for an absolute pittance, you're best off on PC.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>is, it's a horror-themed open-world survival-crafter that sees you "in a mysterious forest battling to stay alive against a society of cannibalistic mutants".</p>

<p>The game can be enjoyed either solo or in multiplayer co-op, and if you're of a squeamish persuasion, you might want to recruit a friend to survive with, because&nbsp;<em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>can get pretty scary.</p>

<p><em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/242760/The_Forest/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0238-CUSA12398_00-THEFOREST0000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a> (and PS5 via backwards compatibility). Sequel&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sons-of-forest-10-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">hit its 1.0 release</a> in February, is also available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1326470/Sons_Of_The_Forest/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's currently up for grabs at 50% off as well.</p>

Riot is a mission driven company where Rioters are constantly striving to make it better to be a player.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-director-says-no-plans-for-series-sort-of.1069416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-director-no-plans-series<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>director and Studio Zero head Katsura Hashino has revealed some rather disappointing news regarding the potential future of what we might have called the&nbsp;<em>Metaphor&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>In a new interview with Famitsu (via <a href="https://personacentral.com/metaphor-refantazio-director-future-development/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Persona Central</a> and Japanese gaming news leaker <a href="http://ryokutya2089.com/archives/82367" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ryokutya2089</a>), Hashino says that there are no "concrete plans" to make&nbsp;<em>Metaphor&nbsp;</em>into a series, although he hopes that this will happen someday.</p>

<p>Rather confusingly, however, Hashino also says that development on&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>&nbsp;began with a view to making "a third JRPG series alongside&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>", so presumably, either the scope of the project changed or Atlus decided against this direction.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor-refantazio-sequel-director-comments-strohl.jpg?itok=g5jPjzmH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor-refantazio-sequel-director-comments-strohl.jpg?itok=bKD8J9eH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Quite right, Strohl.</figcaption></figure><p>We can assume that if there are no plans to make&nbsp;<em>Metaphor&nbsp;</em>into a series, that also means there isn't currently a&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio 2&nbsp;</em>in the works, although that doesn't mean Studio Zero isn't working on something entirely different, of course.</p>

<p>Hoshino says that if a sequel were to be made, he might "decide that the best setting for a future [<em>Metaphor</em>] title is the Sengoku period", which, he says jokingly, would create "a JRPG with a world like the&nbsp;<em>Basara&nbsp;</em>series".</p>

<p>He's almost certainly referring here to Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Sengoku Basara&nbsp;</em>games, hack-and-slash action titles which have a rather spotty history of Western localization. One can only imagine that this might mean a Sengoku-set&nbsp;<em>Metaphor&nbsp;</em>game could struggle to get the localization nod as well.</p>

<p>If a&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>sequel is, indeed, not currently in the works, that would come as a surprise from a business perspective at the very least; after all, the JRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already" rel="nofollow">managed to rack up a million sales in just a few hours</a>, so a sequel seems like a no-brainer for Sega and Atlus.</p>




<p>Of course, if a sequel is in the works, it wouldn't be the first time a major Japanese developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">apparently openly lied</a> about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">not creating more games</a> in a series anytime soon. We can only hope.</p>

<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2679460/Metaphor_ReFantazio/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/metaphor-refantazio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/metaphor-refantazio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-most-anticipated-game-of-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As we gear up for 2025, the hype around upcoming games is reaching a fever pitch. There are games coming in the early part of the year like Avowed and Civilization 7 that look like potential Game of the Year candidates. Then you have titles like Borderlands 4, Fable, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A that are fanbases eager for the next adventure. Still, no game seems to have a stranglehold on the community more than Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6. And that’s why GTA 6 is Insider Gaming’s Most Anticipated Game of 2025.</p>



<p>In a member vote on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>, it wasn’t even close. The most anticipated game category was the most lopsided of all the questions with GTA 6 receiving 87% of the vote. Death Stranding 2 came in a very distant second with 7% of the vote.</p>



<p>As far as why GTA 6 won by as much as it did, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone.</p>



<p>A decade in the making and cloaked in mystery, Rockstar Games’ next blockbuster isn’t just the most anticipated release of the year, it’s poised to become a cultural phenomenon that sets the standard for open-world gaming for years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of writing, all fans have had to quench their thirst for the upcoming game is the reveal trailer from 2023. Since then it’s been silent at Rockstar with various rumors taking up the bulk of the talk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-about-grand-theft-auto-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game will feature</a> two characters, including the franchise’s first female protagonist named Lucia. We also know that it’s set in a fictionalized version of modern-day Florida called Leonida and features parodies of some real-life characters. Lastly, the game will launch only on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Those hoping for a PC release will have to wait, similar to the launch of GTA 5.</p>



<div><p>Other than those few things, there’s really nothing else we know. What will the game’s story be about? How will Rockstar expand the gameplay? What will happen to those who have spent years in GTA Online?</p><p>All of these questions lead to GTA 6 being at the top of everyone’s minds going into 2025 when we’ll (hopefully) get confirmation of a release date sooner rather than later. That is, of course, the game does get delayed until 2026. For right now, however, it’s still scheduled for fall 2025.</p></div>

<p>Design documents for several Grand Theft Auto titles, including GTA 3, have leaked online, showing ambitious plans for the franchise.</p>



<p>According to multiple reports, the design documents date back to 2001, but were uploaded on December 17, 2024 by a GTAForums user named <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/300544-collectors-general-chat/page/123/#findComment-1072480714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FrankieLiberty</a>. According to the user, he uploaded the files because other users were selling the documents for profit.</p>



<p>The documents reveal that GTA 3 and GTA 3 Online had ambitious plans for the time, which would have included a faction system, a skill system, the ability to own properties, and more. The documents also show that Barking Dog Studios, who would be acquired by Take-Two Interactive in August 2002 and morphed into Rockstar Vancouver, were intended to be the game’s original developers. </p>



<p>As always, design documents are always overly ambitious, but the design documents are a unique glimpse into how ambitious Rockstar Games were even in the early 2000s. You can view and download the documents (at your own risk), <a href="https://archive.org/details/jane-doe-gift" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. </p>



<p>As for Rockstar Games, which is the Grand Theft Auto franchise at the time of writing, fans are eagerly awaiting the next GTA 6 trailer, which should hopefully give us a more accurate release date. At the time of writing, GTA 6 is currently scheduled to release in 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of the design documents? Are you looking forward to GTA 6? Let us know in the comments below! Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/11-bit-studios-ceo-teases-two-new-projects-explains-project-8-shutdown.1069401/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-project-8-shutdown-new-projects<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios CEO&nbsp;Przemysław Marszał has provided some more context regarding the studio's recent cancellation of its story-based, console-focused game&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>, and he's also teased two new projects in the works at the studio.</p>

<p>In an interview with Polish publication <a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/11-bit-studios-rozpoczelo-prace-nad-dwiema-grami-nie-planuje-emisji-akcji-wywiad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PAP Biznes</a> (via <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2024/12/25/games-industry-severe-crisis-11-bit-studios-ceo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game World Observer</a>),&nbsp;Marszał says that the gaming industry is "going through a severe crisis" at the moment, and that 2024 was a tough year for 11 bit "in some areas".</p>

<p>As a reminder, 11 bit revealed the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8" rel="nofollow">last week</a>, along with a reduction in staff that would see several of the project's developers laid off. Others, however, would apparently be reallocated to other 11 bit projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/11-bit-studios-project-8-cancellation-ceo-comments.jpg?itok=0fcecYBN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/11-bit-studios-project-8-cancellation-ceo-comments.jpg?itok=1rQfOnOh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>11 bit studios recently canceled&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>, calling the project too risky to continue with.</figcaption></figure><p>In the PAP Biznes interview,&nbsp;Marszał says that&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>'s reference points would have included the likes of Ninja Theory's&nbsp;<em>Senua&nbsp;</em>games, as well as the&nbsp;<em>Plague Tale&nbsp;</em>series; specifically, the gameplay would have been more similar to the latter than the former.</p>

<p>However,&nbsp;Marszał reiterates that he believes the market has changed since&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>began development, and that games like the aforementioned titles aren't doing particularly well in the current climate.</p>

<p>He says that&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>was suffering from a number of issues both big and small, and that correcting them would have required more development time than management was comfortable with, so the game was shelved.</p>

<p>Marszał also reveals two new 11 bit studios projects, although he doesn't go into detail about either of them. The first is a 25-developer project with a smaller budget that's targeting a 2027 release, while the second will be "bigger" and take around "four years" for production.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/11-bit-studios-the-alters_0.jpg?itok=Uw2q529R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/11-bit-studios-the-alters_0.jpg?itok=AIZMvMLX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of 11 bit studios' next projects will reportedly be on a similar level to the upcoming&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to&nbsp;Marszał, 11 bit is also about to announce a change in its publishing strategy, which the CEO says is a "direct consequence" of its experience in this area so far.</p>

<p>To remind you, the studio doesn't just publish its own games; it's also a third-party publisher, with games like surreal adventure&nbsp;<em>Indika</em>, sci-fi head-scratcher&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/invincible" rel="nofollow"><em>The Invincible</em></a>, and CRPG&nbsp;<em>The Thaumaturge&nbsp;</em>being some of the games on its publishing slate.</p>

<p>In any case, it sounds like both of the newly-revealed 11 bit projects are still a little ways away from being ready, so it might be a while before we hear what they are. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It’s also full of rich metaphoric language ripe for creative license and re-interpretation. The movie is set to begin filming next year. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/26/game-of-the-year-2024-best-video-game-adaptation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It definitely feels like Hollywood and TV companies have figured out video games in the last few years. No, they don’t always get it right, but between huge, blockbusting animated films for Sonic and Mario, and TV and streaming series like Castlevania, The Last of Us and the following selection of shows, we’re a world away from the bad times of Doom, Prince of Persia and Mario… the live action one.</p>

<p>The Last of Us changed gaming in 2013 with its unparalleled story telling and, a decade later, HBO’s The Last of Us rewrote the script on how to make a TV adaptation of a video game. The team behind Amazon’s Fallout TV show were clearly taking notes, as it does exactly what The Last of Us did, taking the world of the game for your setting but make sure to focus on the characters. We follow a trio of protagonists, all of which were created for the show but are based on archetypes found in the games, with their stories crossing over at various points as the mystery of a vault is gradually revealed.</p>
<p>The show also has a strong emotional centre which unexpectedly comes from Walton Goggins’s character, the Ghoul. The radioactive gunslinger is the star of the show, his tragic story from television star to reviled outcast is spread across the episodes and neatly dovetails in the story of &nbsp;Lucy, played by Yellowjackets’ Ella Purnell.&nbsp; Rounding out the trio is Aaron Moten who manages to bring to life the weakest of the three, Maximus, a squire of the Brotherhood of Steel who steals a set of Power Armour after Knight Titus exits stage left, killed by a bear.</p>
<p>Everything you love from the franchise is on screen, even down to the smallest detail like the door handles being the same as in the game, it is extraordinarily faithful to the games but is careful to keep the fan service to background details. The show doesn’t shy away from some spectacularly gory sequences which like the game are mostly played for laughs but there are some very real moments of danger, the psychotic Snip Snip, a Mr. Handy turned organ harvester is the stuff of nightmares.</p>

<p>Series 2 was confirmed by Amazon just nine days after the show premiered but with filming only just starting it’s going to be a while before we settle down with a Nuka Cola and enjoy it.</p>
<h2>Arcane: League of Legends – Runner-up</h2>
<p>The two series of Arcane on Amazon’s Prime video service cost more than a live action Marvel movie and for once it actually shows – every single shot in the series could be framed and hung in an art gallery. The first series was slightly laboured and took a while to set up things up, but that’s allowed series two to race ahead, barely taking time for breath as it throws in multiple plot lines with witches, bio tech experiments and an awful lot of trippy dream sequences.</p>
<p>Clearly influenced by the Spiderverse movies, the show changes art style to emphasise character moments, switching in an instant from lush, almost water coloured paintings to frantic neon scribbles and, just like the first season, the needle drops are perfect. If you haven’t caught up with Arcane then you really should, you don’t need to know a thing about the game, and it’s genuinely good.</p>
<h2>Secret Level – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Amazon nailed the video game adaptation with Fallout, but Secret Level had more mixed reviews. That’s almost purely because there are so many different games and styles covered.</p>
<p>Some of the episodes stick slavishly to the lore of the games and wider universes, notable the Dungeons and Dragons and Warhammer 40K stories, but I personally found the more obtuse reimaginings to be the highlights.&nbsp; Two really stood out for me, the Pac-Man episode takes the little gold disc and turns them in to evil AI who encourages a humanoid clone to kill and eat everything in his way, and with shots of the clone devouring gore and intestines so they can grown bigger and stronger for the body horror finale.</p>
<p>In a complete change of pace, the PlayStation episode is an family friendly original story which just happens to feature a few characters from famous Sony franchises. The Helldivers are a hoot, speaking just like they do in the game: “What is that?”, “I don’t know…. SHOOT IT!”</p>

<p><em>Those are our highlights from the various film and TV game adaptations this year, but what were you watching?</em></p>

If you paid more, you got PC and streaming games, too.</p><p>But in the summer, Xbox announced a big price hike for all Xbox plans. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, the plan that included everything, went from $17 to $20. Meanwhile, the console-only plan, which previously cost $11 a month, was being retired and replaced with a new “Game Pass Standard” tier that cost $15 a month and would no longer include day-one releases. Xbox explained that eventually some day-one releases would land on Standard, but didn’t specify a timetable. </p><p>To sum it up: Everyone is paying more for Game Pass, but not everyone gets access to big new games like <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> at launch. Not great! For as long as Game Pass has been a thing, the promise of day-one first-party titles like <em>Halo </em>has been its big selling point. But in 2024, seemingly to help cover the cost of spending nearly $70 billion on Activision, Xbox has ruined what was once the best deal in gaming.</p><h2 id="h877522"><a id=""></a><strong>Everything Is An Xbox, Including Your PS5 And Switch</strong></h2><p>Maybe the weirdest Microsoft storyline that unfolded in 2024 is the way the company tried to navigate its dwindling console sales numbers while telling Xbox fans not to worry. </p><p>I mean, if you look at everything that happened in 2024, it doesn’t paint a good picture for Xbox consoles.

It can’t seem to support all of these studios, however, and keeps closing them or laying people off. </p><p>Game Pass is now a questionable and expensive subscription plan that is a very shitty version of what we used to have, and which is only likely to get worse as Microsoft looks to keep numbers growing amid a lack of new users. </p><p>And if you’re looking to buy a new console, it almost seems like a gamble at this point to invest in an Xbox Series X/S. I’m not suggesting Microsoft will flip a switch and kill its consoles overnight. But as the company invests more and more into streaming and makes more of its exclusives multiplatform, there are fewer and fewer reasons to own an Xbox, whatever that even means in 2024.</p><p>2025 could also be a massive year for Xbox. It has new games coming from Bethesda, Activision, and its own many studios in the next few months, and will likely announce more as the year goes on. But 2024 was also a big year for Xbox; it’s just that the cost was massive job cuts, big price increases, and multiple studio closures. So while some Xbox fans might be excited for another big year, I’m truly concerned about how much more blood will be spilled to pay for it. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s wipe is here and it’s coming hand-in-hand with the 0.16.0.0 update. Amongst other things, this patch introduces a Custom rework, winter weather, new quests, and several new weapons. It’s also ushering in the global reset that typically brings hundreds of thousands of players back to the game every six months or so.</p>



<p>Read below to check out the most important aspects of the 0.16.0.0 patch notes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-0-16-0-0-notes-key-changes">Tarkov 0.16.0.0 Notes – Key Changes</h2>



<p>The winter season is in full force in the 0.16.0.0 patch, with winter weather being brought back into the game. It’s a little more granular than last year’s snowy update, though, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Khorovod, a new winter-themed event</li>



<li>‘Frostbite’, a new status effect that reduces players’ visibility and stamina. The effect goes away in shelters, near burning barrels, or when drinking alcohol</li>



<li>Updated the winter environment visual effects;</li>



<li>Added snowdrifts in various areas for more variety;</li>



<li>Added a winter theme Factory, including snow and matching elements;</li>



<li>Added a unique winter sound design for all locations</li>
</ul>



<p>At the heart of the update sits an overhaul for Customs, one of the most popular maps in Escape from Tarkov. In the 0.16.0.0 patch notes, it was confirmed that Battlestate Games has:</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated the old textures and materials on the location, and replaced the old objects with more up-to-date ones;</li>



<li>Fully updated some of the buildings on the location;</li>



<li>Replaced all opaque glass blocks on the location with transparent ones;</li>



<li>Opened three buildings on the industrial territory;</li>



<li>Added new objects to the location, including exploding propane cylinders;</li>



<li>Added new points of interest;</li>



<li>Added a transit to Shoreline;</li>



<li>Added new exfils</li>
</ul>



<p>When players reach level 55 in Escape from Tarkov’s PvP mode (and complete many other prerequisites), they’ll now be able to enter ‘Prestige’ mode. This is present in Tarkov Arena, also. For the full details on Tarkov’s Prestige mode, check out <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/323?lang=null" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the breakdown provided by Battlestate Games</a>.</p>



<p>Here are all the new weapons coming to Tarkov in 0.16.0.0:</p>



<ul>
<li>RShG-2 72.5mm rocket launcher;</li>



<li>Sako TRG M10 .338 LM bolt-action sniper rifle;</li>



<li>Aklys Defense Velociraptor .300 Blackout assault rifle;</li>



<li>Saiga-12K 12ga automatic shotgun;</li>



<li>FN SCAR-H X-17 7.62×51 assault rifle;</li>



<li>Akula push dagger;</li>



<li>V40 Mini-Grenade</li>
</ul>



<p>On the topic of weapons, Battlestate Games has also overhauled how visual recoil works in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li>Added random weapon sway and horizontal rotation;</li>



<li>Implemented the visual effect of the bolt hitting the receiver;</li>



<li>Added a camera shake effect, reflecting the buttstock hitting the shoulder;</li>



<li>Added slight barrel sway effect for pistols;</li>



<li>Shotguns now have the inertia and calibre power effect;</li>



<li>Updated the 3rd person aiming animations</li>
</ul>



<p>On top of all that, BSG has added further customisation options for the Hideout, balanced countless weapons and items, and tweaked how AI enemies work. For instance, Partisan, Raiders, Rogues, and other bots can now use UBGLs, and they’ll start flanking, suppressing, and becoming more aggressive in fights.</p>



<p>And of course, hundreds of bug fixes and quality-of-life changes have been applied, such as increasing the ruble stack limit from 500,000 to one million.</p>

<p>Every six months or so, Escape from Tarkov undergoes a ‘wipe’, a global reset that level the playing field for everyone on the platform. It’s also the time when Tarkov becomes more popular than ever, with hundreds of thousands of players flooding the game to get their early wipe tasks completed all over again.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m walking you through the best Escape from Tarkov starter tips that you can use to get ahead of the competition at the start of the wipe. If you’re a new Tarkov player looking for the best tricks and tips possible, look no further than this guide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-tarkov-starter-tips-for-a-new-wipe">Best Tarkov Starter Tips for a New Wipe</h2>



<p>Whether you’re a first-time Tarkov player or a veteran in need of a refresh, here are the best Tarkov tips you can use to get a foothold in the wipe as early as possible.</p>



<h3 id="h-run-your-gear">Run Your Gear</h3>



<p>When the wipe hits, don’t be afraid to run those T4 rigs and vests – everyone else will be relying on their PACA vests (if they’re USEC) because they don’t want to risk losing the good stuff, so you’ll be going in with an advantage. If you do lose your T4 vest, you’ll just have to work harder to make it back, soldier.</p>



<p>Similarly, if you open a cache or a box and find a T5 – or by some miracle, a T6 – then don’t be afraid to run that, either. It’ll make you hugely more resilient than the rest of the players running around.</p>



<h3 id="h-understand-the-mechanics">Understand the Mechanics</h3>



<p>In recent years, Escape from Tarkov has undergone several major changes that have brought about new mechanics. For instance, in 0.12.12.0, ‘inertia’ was added, giving players more weight and making them slower. These days, players are utilising movement mechanics like mantling and vaulting, and in the latest update, 0.16.0.0, new recoil-based changes have been implemented.</p>



<p>From new ways to use hotkeys to bipods that can drastically improve your accuracy at long range, Tarkov has had several new mechanics hit the platform in the last few updates. If you’re coming in from a hiatus, you might be left confused by some of them, so take the time to understand what has changed.</p>



<p>If you’re a new player, make sure you devote time to understanding how some core elements of Tarkov work:</p>



<ul>
<li>Healing</li>



<li>Inventory management</li>



<li>Insurance</li>



<li>Weapons and ammunition</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-shopping-list">Shopping List</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t let the quiet streets fool you; danger is everywhere in Escape from Tarkov</figcaption></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov is a looter-shooter for some, with many players darting around the map eager to secure the most high-value items. There are many things that you’ll want to start collecting early on to help bolster those early-game tasks, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Salewa medkits</li>



<li>Morphine injectors</li>



<li>Gas analysers</li>



<li>Flash drives</li>



<li>Module 3M body armor</li>



<li>TOZ-106 shotgun</li>



<li>Small ‘Tushonka’</li>



<li>Toolsets</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, there are several items you’ll want to keep an eye open for as you traverse the many maps of Tarkov. They’ll be hugely helpful in getting the earliest parts of your Hideout constructed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Leatherman Multitool</li>



<li>M-Tape</li>



<li>Car battery</li>



<li>Awl</li>



<li>Lightbulbs</li>



<li>Corrugated hose</li>



<li>Screws</li>



<li>Nails</li>



<li>Medical tools</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s worth using a resource <a href="https://tarkov.dev/maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">like Tarkov Dev</a> to learn the maps and to pinpoint where these items spawn.</p>



<h3 id="h-prioritise">Prioritise</h3>



<p>Prioritisation is key in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Should you run towards the gunfire and potentially scoop some kills, or live to fight another day by running in the opposite direction? Should you take that loot and risk being heavy as hell, or leave it and hope to find some lighter goodies?</p>



<p>At the start of the wipe, you don’t want to loot <strong>everything</strong>. Use a resource <a href="https://tarkov-market.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">like Tarkov Market</a> to identify what’s selling and what’s worth the most to help with inventory management. If you have the opportunity, you should always be extracting with every slot filled, but you won’t always have the luxury of leaving with a full backpack.</p>



<p>This new Tarkov wipe guide is centred around prioritisation when you think about it:</p>



<ul>
<li>Prioritise high-value, necessary loot such as quest items and Hideout components</li>



<li>Prioritise quest completion over gunfights</li>



<li>Prioritise your route before loading onto a map</li>



<li>Prioritise one-time quests over daily or weekly tasks</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-get-busy-tasking">Get Busy Tasking</h3>



<p>One of the best Escape from Tarkov starter tips is to start grinding tasks as early as possible. By doing this, you’ll get a leg up on your opponents and start earning massive chunks of XP. Within a few raids, you’ll have the Flea Market unlocked – which is massively important and a key part of this early wipe start guide.</p>



<p>To that end, you’ll be heading to Ground Zero, the newest Tarkov map, to complete five tasks:</p>



<ul>
<li>Burning Rubber</li>



<li>First in Line</li>



<li>Shooting Cans</li>



<li>Saving the Mole</li>



<li>Luxurious Life (unlocks after some pre-requisites)</li>
</ul>



<p>Ground Zero is effectively a starter map, and it offers a small-form, rapid introduction to Escape from Tarkov. If you’re a new Tarkov player, it’s where you’ll get your first taste of combat and exploration.</p>



<p>If you’re sneaky or talented, you can get these tasks completed in one raid. It’ll mean you’ll leave your first Tarkov raid with thousands of XP points, and you’ll go on to unlock some great early-wipe gains. It’ll be a nice confidence booster for the road ahead, too.</p>



<h3 id="h-build-up">Build Up</h3>



<p>The Hideout is hugely important in Escape from Tarkov. It offers many benefits, such as item crafting, skill growth, and boosts that you’ll come to rely on later in the game. It’s a good idea and one of the best Tarkov tips to get started building your Hideout as soon as possible.</p>



<p>The shopping list I’ve detailed above gives you some idea of where to start, but you’ll need <strong>a lot </strong>of resources to make the most of your Hideout. Keep an eye open for the things you need to get the biggest boosts and benefits from your Hideout as you play.</p>



<p>Some of the key constructs you’ll want to focus on in the Tarkov Hideout are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Workbench (weapon customisation)</li>



<li>Medstation (health regen and med crafting)</li>



<li>Intelligence Center (money gain boost)</li>



<li>Library (experience gain boost)</li>
</ul>



<p>Before you get to some of these, you’ll need to work on everything from power to security, and from lighting to home comforts like a rest area and food production systems. By the end of a Tarkov wipe, you’ll have a Hideout that’s worthy of the most accomplished PMC.</p>



<h3 id="h-stash-management">Stash Management</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Will a nice weapon stay in your stash or be taken out on raids?</figcaption></figure>







<p>In Escape from Tarkov, successful stash management is key to your financial success, especially if you’re a standard user with the default stash size. This is where you’ll keep the spoils of your raids, along with weapons, ammunition, healing items, food, and everything else you find or craft in Tarkov.</p>



<p>Here’s a solid new wipe Tarkov tip: Buy the Lucky Scav Junkbox as soon as possible. Once you’ve got the 1.1 million rubles needed, acquire the box to stash a stunning amount of quest, Hideout, and miscellaneous items that you’ll bring back from your raids. It’ll stop your stash from getting overwhelmed in the first days after the wipe.</p>



<p>Remember to also:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Backpack stack’, putting backpacks inside of each other to increase storage space</li>



<li>Strip guns, removing their magazines and grips to make them only one line deep. If it’s a cheap weapon, you can scrap or sell the magazines, putting on new ones later for just a few rubles</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-make-gains">Make Gains</h3>



<p>When you start playing after a wipe, one of the best Tarkov tips is to sell everything you don’t need very early on. This will reward you with plenty of easy cash right off the bat.</p>



<p>For instance, the Edge of Darkness and The Unheard Edition pre-order bonuses include a lot that you might not want or need, such as baseball caps, one-use healing items, alcohol, certain weapons, cheap attachments, and some crafting components. If you don’t think you’ll need them, you’re probably right, and once you start getting better stuff in the wild, there’s no point hanging on.</p>



<p>For instance, if you find one ‘CALOK’ hemostatic dressing, you’ll use that over a CAT or an Esmarch tourniquet as it has three uses before it’s gone. That’s the same for an AI-2 medkit, which will quickly be replaced by IFAK, AFAK, Salewa, and Grizzly medkits.</p>



<p>If you find a Grizzly, you’ll be soaring – that can heal heavy bleeds, light bleeds, injured limbs, concussions, and broken bones.</p>



<h3 id="h-running-guns">Running Guns</h3>



<p>The best early-game guns in Escape from Tarkov can be the difference between winning and losing a fight. Early on, the starting weapons after a wipe will be everywhere, and you’ll typically see people using:</p>



<ul>
<li>SKS</li>



<li>AKS-74U</li>



<li>M4A1</li>



<li>Mosin</li>
</ul>



<p>They’re cheap, easy to maintain, and the ammunition for them will be everywhere at the start of wipe, on account of many other people using them. As I mentioned above, you shouldn’t be afraid to run better equipment than everyone else – it’ll give you an edge in the early days.</p>



<p>Also, make sure you’re using the right weapons for each Tarkov map. If you’re going onto Woods, you’ll want a rifle, a marksman rifle, or a sniper rifle. If you’re running through Customs or Factory, you’ll be better off with a high-ergo assault rifle or an SMG. </p>



<p>When it comes to loading into a raid, make sure you’re insuring your gear with <strong>Prapor </strong>rather than <strong>Therapist</strong>, but don’t feel the need to waste money insuring very low-level equipment.</p>



<h3 id="h-preparation-is-everything">Preparation is Everything</h3>



<p>If you’re new to Tarkov and you’re looking for the best tips for your first wipe, you’ll ideally want to have a second monitor – or a tablet, or something similar. Having a second screen is huge in Escape from Tarkov, as it lets you have maps, market screens, and quest guides to help you out.</p>



<p>Tarkov is <strong>not </strong>an easy game, and it’s designed to be unwelcoming and a little awkward at times. That’s why it’s a good idea to use a second screen when you play.</p>



<p>Here are the best sites to use when playing Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://tarkov.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tarkov.dev</a> (maps, item guides, profit trackers, loot tiers)</li>



<li><a href="https://tarkov-market.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tarkov Market</a> (Flea Market tracker)</li>



<li><a href="https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Ballistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wiki Ballistics</a> (Ammo stats)</li>



<li><a href="https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Quests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wiki Quests</a> (quest guides)</li>



<li><a href="https://mapgenie.io/tarkov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Map Genie</a> (interactive maps)</li>



<li><a href="https://tarkov-changes.com/changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tarkov Changes</a> (patch notes)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re <strong>brand new </strong>in Tarkov, it’s a good idea to either invest in PvE access or play ‘offline’ games against bots. This will allow you to learn the maps. Don’t make a habit of playing against bots, though. You’ll gain nothing but a little game knowledge – combat experience is everything and you’ll only get that against real players.</p>



<h3 id="h-buddy-up">Buddy Up</h3>



<p>It’s a good idea to play Escape from Tarkov with other people. Having that extra set of eyes and ears – and an extra gun – can be pivotal to your success in the game. Plus, there will be people to cover you when you complete certain tasks, and they’ll be able to ‘hide your gear’ when you die and they stay alive.</p>



<p>With that in mind, plenty of Tarkov groups exist on social media platforms, and there are many Discord servers live that offer buddy-up opportunities. Most of the biggest Tarkov streamers have Discord servers that you can lean on to find Tarkov players to play with.</p>



<p>If you want to find Tarkov players to run with, try some of these servers:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/2gCdVEJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Landmark</a></li>



<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Pestily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pestily</a></li>



<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/glorious-e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Glorious_e</a></li>



<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/redSVXhFMm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gingy</a></li>



<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/5HZP9Mv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WillerZ</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-run-your-scavs">Run Your Scavs</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Scavs have bad weapons and almost no equipment, but they’re still valuable</figcaption></figure>







<p>This is a divisive Tarkov starter tip as not many people agree with it, but it’s a solid recommendation to run your Scav character. In Escape from Tarkov, you can play as a temporary ‘Scav’ or your persistent PMC character. Playing as a Scav will see you assigned a one-shot build that you can take on any map – except Labs.</p>



<p>When you play as a Scav, you can’t complete tasks and your PMC character won’t grow, but it’s a fantastic opportunity to seek out task items and equipment without worrying about losing your equipment or incurring a loss on your PMC character.</p>



<p>If you’re on a PMC losing streak, consider running a Scav to change the pacing a bit. Scavs spawn later in the raid, so the bulk of the action should have passed and only a few PMCs will be running around, giving you the opportunity to scoop up leftover loot and the remnants of fights.</p>



<h3 id="h-quick-settings">Quick Settings</h3>



<p>Here are some quick settings changes you should make when you start playing Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Autohide’ Quick Slots to increase visibility</li>



<li>‘Always Shown’ Stamina and Stance icons</li>



<li>‘Always Shown’ Health Condition</li>



<li>‘Polychrome’ Health Color Scheme, making it easier to see what’s injured</li>



<li>‘Head Bobbing’ set to 0.2, as low as possible</li>



<li>‘FOV’ should be between 66 – 70</li>



<li>‘Malfunction Notifications’ On</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s the full breakdown of the best Escape from Tarkov starter tips. I hope this helps you get started in your first wipe – or your first wipe <strong>back</strong>. Have fun out there!</p>

<p>2024 didn’t live up to the heights of 2023, but it certainly produced bangers. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is most definitely in the “banger” category. While I can understand the titles superseding it in 2024, in some ways, Rebirth ended up being a “failure.”</p>



<p>I’ll preface by saying Final Fantasy 7 was one of my childhood games. I played it several times, adored the combat, and grew very attached to the characters. The remake trilogy is at the forefront of my wishes, so there’s an inherent bias between myself and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. </p>



<p>However, this doesn’t mean I can’t be objective here, and I recognize why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-new-dlc-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a> won Game of the Year (It was my pick too!) For all the effort and time that went into FF7 Rebirth though, the post-launch rewards didn’t justify the final product.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-the-perfect-rpg">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is The Perfect RPG</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I’m as peeved as you, Cloud. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>A 92 rating on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a>, a 99% Critics Recommend score on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/15136/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpenCritic</a>, and seven nominations at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a> should feel like a big W for Could Strife and his crew. Yet, I’m sitting here, and it feels like no one is talking about an all-time JRPG great.</p>



<p>Rebirth has coherent storytelling with epic twists and turns, a deep and intuitive combat system, a gorgeous palette of extensive biomes, and Red XIII walking upright in a side-splittingly comical fashion spectacularly paying homage to the original.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth may have collapsed under the weight of expectation. I would argue this installment is the most important of the three and covers one of the most talked-about segments in video game history. I’d say Rebirth handled it brilliantly and hits all the right notes: The Gold Saucer, Barret’s story in Mt. Corel, and the introduction of fate into the core narrative.</p>



<p>When it comes to Game of the Year and Best RPG of the Year, Rebirth feels like it’s been forgotten about in favor of another. </p>



<h2 id="h-rebirth-or-refantazio">Rebirth or ReFantazio?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-metaphor-refantazio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is published by Atlus—developers of the legendary Persona franchise—and their trademark influences are all over Metaphor. Atlus’ newest project received similar reviews and praise to Rebirth but is deemed a superior game in almost every way. Furthermore, it swiped three Game Awards—including “<strong>Best RPG” ahead of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</strong>.</p>



<p>I’ve invested over 100 hours in FF7 Rebirth and seen most of its content, and honestly believe Astro Bot is the only contender that pipped it as the year’s best content—each to their own of course. Shadow of the Erdtree is DLC, I won’t hear anything else; whereas Metaphor: ReFantazio is an exceptional JRPG, and its stylistic choices are down to personal choice, but many agree with its idiosyncrasies.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s lack of praise and love can’t be down to the perception of JRPGs, as Metaphor falls under this category too. No Metaphor: ReFantazio means more awards and praise for Rebirth. But it doesn’t change the fact Square Enix also perceives its own game as a disappointment in some ways. The company believes Rebirth did not meet sales expectations, and I’m hoping this doesn’t impact the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-final-fantasy-7-remake-already-under-way-uematsu-possibly-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third and final Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>.</p>



<p>Was Rebirth released at the wrong time of year? Did the feel of a fresh IP in Metaphor: ReFantazio supersede a franchise where people know what they’re getting? I’ll be left twiddling my thumbs and asking these questions until part three hits the shelves. Big congratulations to Metaphor of course, but I’d keep a watchful eye out for a long silver-haired assailant with a long sword.</p>



<hr>



<p>Did Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth deserve more recognition in 2024? Or was it simply bested by a better RPG and needed to do more to sell more copies? I’m keen to hear what you have to say.</p>

		<p>Welcome once again to the annual TheSixthAxis Alternative Game of the Year Awards, in which we recognise some of the more obscure achievements of gaming in 2024. Join us as we look back at a year that was, with more remasters and remakes than you can shake a stick at – how long before we get some remasters of remakes? – companies deciding to burn their business model to the ground, and our yearly hunt for the most ridiculous video game title.</p>
<h3>Most Obvious Backtrack Award</h3>
<p>It might have looked like Microsoft were building a games industry Death Star with last year’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, but unlike the fantasy of Star Wars’ evil Empire, Xbox now has to face up to reality. They’ve spent an awful lot of money building this thing, but now they want to make that back, and PlayStation has been absolutely thrashing them in terms of console sales. So, after years of saying this was all about Xbox exclusives, they’ve started releasing those games on the “rival” platform.</p>
<p>But wait, it’s only going to be for<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/15/four-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-not-starfield-or-indy/"> small indie games and absolutely not Indy games</a>, said Phil Spencer. Fast forward six months and Microsoft <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-is-coming-to-ps5-but-only-after-xbox-and-pc-december-release/">cheerfully announce</a> that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is coming to PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>That’s opened the floodgates and now Doom: The Dark Ages, The Outer Worlds 2 and more are coming to PS5. We’re still waiting for Starfield and Hellblade 2 to be announced, but there’s apparently no “red lines” for what will come to PlayStation in future.</p>

<h2>Most Persistent Refusal To Announce Something Obvious</h2>
<p>This was a pretty close run thing this year, a two horse race between Sony and Nintendo, but with the reveal and release of the PlayStation 5 Pro, there can only be one winner here. Nintendo… why won’t you just announce the Nintendo Switch 2 already?</p>
<p>You basically have already, with every single Nintendo Direct since the middle of the year also coming with a disclaimer that there definitely wouldn’t be a new console announcement.</p>
<h3><span><span>The</span> <span>Why</span> <span>Didn’t</span> <span>It</span> <span>Do</span> <span>That</span> <span><span>i</span>n</span> <span><span>t</span>he</span> <span>First</span> <span>Place</span> <span>Award</span></span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-portal/">PlayStation Portal</a> was released at the start of this year to a collective “meh”. Sure, it’s a nice device, but you had to stream games from your own PS5, even if you have Sony’s PlayStation Plus streaming subscription – not so useful if you want to game while on holiday and have not-so-great internet.</p>
<p>In November this year Sony <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/the-playstation-portal-is-finally-getting-ps-plus-cloud-streaming/">announced an update</a> and at last you can stream over 120 PS5 games from the PS Plus Game Catalogue, but for some reason not older PlayStation games. Your guess is as good as ours…</p>

<h3>Best Xbox Game on PlayStation</h3>
<p>Yep, we’re doing this one to death this year because even two years ago this would be unthinkable. Rare’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> has been selling by the bucketload on the PlayStation Store and is a very welcome addition to the family. Yo ho ho!</p>
<h2>Best Video Game Delay</h2>
<p>Delays are a pretty much inevitable part of video game development, but only Devolver Digital would be so bold as to weaponise them as part of the marketing plan, making an annual “awards” show as they bump a bunch of games back to next year.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The 15th Annual Devolver Delayed Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OR366e-oKY4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>Most Pointless PS4 Remaster</h3>
<p>The Last of Us Part 2 had already been enhanced with a free update to run on PS5 and looked great, it really didn’t need a remaster, even if it did throw in a roguelike mode and some documentary stuff.</p>

<h2>Most Ridiculous Video Game Title</h2>
<p>While there’s occasionally some Western developers challenging for this category, this almost always comes down to Japense devs who are happy to make up words, shove colons in places they shouldn’t go, leave the caps lock on and throw around square brackets.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/24/under-night-in-birth-ii-sysceles-review/">Under Night In-Birth II [Sys:Celes]</a> is pretty strong in all those counts, and then there’s Yeah! You Want “Those Games,” Right? So Here You Go! Now, Let’s See You Clear Them! 2, but we’re going to ding those for being sequels. No, you need a bit of originality round here, so we’re going with a deckbuilder roguelite spin-off to Love Live! Sunshine with『Yohane the Parhelion – NUMAZU in the MIRAGE -』.</p>
<p>Congrats, BeXide Inc., on the exquisite use of corner brackets, hyphens and capitalisation.</p>

<h3><span><span>The</span> <span>Most</span> <span>Surprising</span> <span>Thing</span> <span>That</span> <span>Is</span> <span><span>a</span>n</span> <span>Xbox</span> <span>Award</span></span></h3>
<p>Talking of Microsoft’s change of direction it’s become very clear that if you can play games on it, Microsoft want it to be an Xbox. Your TV’s an Xbox, your PC, your phone, your PlayStation, and probably even your smart fridge or toaster, which can probably play that popular Microsoft game Doom.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Xbox - This Is an Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYBSNQLsBKk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Microsoft are completely focused on Game Pass and streaming from now on, it seems, so Xbox is no longer about the console under your TV. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer revealed Xbox spends over $1 billion a year on third-party content for Xbox Game Pass and the service itself is profitable. However, the service has 34 million subscribers as of February this year and MS are targeting 100 million by 2030 which seems.. a lot. Will the gamble work? Only time – and the ability to play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/04/skyrim-now-available-on-toilets/">Skyrim via Game Pass on your Smart Toilet</a> – will tell.</p>
<h3>The Saddest Use of $200 Million Award</h3>
<p>We have Overwatch, Destiny 2, Fortnite, and COD: Warzone, if you are going to enter the hero shooter arena you had better have something special up your sleeves and more importantly, make it free to play. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage Concord, a generic slightly cartoony looking shooter than you have <em>*gasp*</em> pay money for!</p>
<p>The game was dead in the water before it even launched as your Average Joe took one look at and thought “Well yeah, but The Rivals and Splitgate and Overwatch are all free, I’m not paying for that”. The Concord team did have a plan, with weekly episodes telling a story to keep players interested but that only works if you players in the first place, and I don’t know where that $200 million went but it certainly was not on marketing. this game needed to by hyped to the heavens and beyond to have a fighting chance when it launched and it just.. arrived.</p>

<p>The horrible thing is Concord was actually quite good, we gave it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">8/10 </a>and the recent episode of Amazon’s Secret Level based on the game was a lot of fun, it gave us a tantalising peek at the characters and how they would interact in the weekly episodes they had planned.</p>
<h2><span><span>Most</span> <span><span>Baffling Reason</span></span>&nbsp;<span><span>N</span>ot</span> <span><span>T</span>o</span> <span><span>D</span>o</span> <span>a</span> <span><span>S</span>equel</span></span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/11/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> was a critical hit when it launched right at the start of the year, and a modestly successful game, even if Ubisoft chose not to put it on Steam more than half a year later. A good jumping off point for a sequel, then? And especially when Ubisoft has partnered with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/12/dead-cells-co-devs-reveal-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-roguelike-alpha-sign-ups-now-live-with-early-access-in-may/">Dead Cells co-devs Evil Empire for The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>.</p>
<p>But no, Ubisoft’s bean counters apparently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/23/ubisoft-has-disbanded-the-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-team/">didn’t want a sequel because it might “cannibalize” long term sales</a> of The Lost Crown.</p>
<p>Those same money-men probably thought that Assassin’s Creed 2 was a terrible idea, and aghast at what has become of Far Cry in the past 15 years. Strangely they’d be pro-Rainbow Six (completely misunderstanding the title), and Star Wars being re-branded as Episode IV. Can’t cannibalise an original’s sales if you start off with a sequel, can you?</p>
<h3>Most Improved Awards Ceremony</h3>
<p>After ten years, and somehow by making it 50% longer than last year, Geoff Keighley actually got The Game Awards right. It was well paced with musical breaks that were actually interesting, it had a sense of humour with Statler and Waldorf seemingly reading my tweets from last years show (“It’s more like the Game Adverts with some awards”), and this time Geoff actually read the room.</p>
<p>The Game Changer Award went Amir Satvat for setting up a community to help those affected by the mass layoffs and it was genuinely touching and a brought a tear to the eye. You can check it out below, and just watch when he takes to the stage and all the developers at the back immediately give him a standing ovation and the suits at the front look very uncomfortable and eventually join in.</p>

<p>It’s a tie this year, we couldn’t decide between the “managed democracy” of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> or the clearly massively xenophobic totalitarian regime of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. But don’t decide for yourselves, that would be undemocratic, just do as you are told by your leader, he’s there for you, he has your best interests in mind, do not question anything, do not look for facts, facts are lies. All hail the glorious leader!</p>

<h3>The Half-Life 3 Award</h3>
<p>This year is the first year I can remember since I started doing this back in 2012 in which two thousand “tipsters” on Twitter have not claimed that Half Life 3 is on the way. It will probably turn up next year.</p>

			<p>One of the new features introduced in Unreal Engine 5.5, MegaLights, promises to be a game changer in terms of both performance and image quality over Lumen, as highlighted by a new tech demo now available online.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube this week by MxBenchmarkPC, which can be watched below, compares <a href="https://www.fab.com/listings/836ed2f8-e2d6-49be-98d3-59d104bd351e">Quixel's Unreal Engine 5.5 Dark Ruins tech demo</a> running with software Lumen, hardware Lumen only, and hardware Lumen with MegaLights, highlighting how the new tech introduced in the latest version of the game engine by Epic not only brings a considerable performance improvement of up to 50% but also improves image quality at 4K, 1440p and 1080p resolutions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Unreal Engine 5.5 MegaLights Demo - Massive Up to 50% Performance Boost and Better Image Quality" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXnhKix16UQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5/">MegaLights</a>, an experimental new feature dubbed the Nanite of lights, which enables developers to add hundreds of dynamic shadow-casting lights without constraints, isn't the only thing that Unreal Engine 5.5 brings. The latest version of the engine brings significant improvements to Sequencer, the engine's nonlinear animation editor, MetaHuman Animator, which now allows developers to generate high-quality facial animations just from audio performances, a Mutable character customization system that can be used to generate dynamic skeletal meshes, materials, and textures for characters, animals, props, weapons, and more with optimized memory usage that keeps shader cost low and more. More information on all the new features and improvements featured in the new version of the engine can be found on its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-5-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

<p>We like having banger after banger after banger. Unfortunately, things don’t always work out this way, which is why we’ve had the difficult decision to pick our top six most disappointing games of 2024—stay tuned for supreme heartbreak.</p>



<p>It’s easy to talk about the best games of 2024, but many like to leave it there. No, we need to talk about these things and remind you it’s not all roses. 2024 has had stinkers too, and I’d rather forget about the outright worst games, and fixate on the releases people were excited about, but it left them down in the dumps.</p>



<p>Like a bed-ridden Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, here’s our carefully selected assortment of most disappointing games in 2024 that didn’t deliver.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-disappointing-games-of-2024">Most Disappointing Games of 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-concord">Concord</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What else is left to say? Credit to Firewalk Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>I feel Concord’s significance will still echo a decade or two from now. When I first played the Concord beta, I genuinely thought to myself, “This is pretty solid, but nothing special.” I reiterated these comments to my peers, and I didn’t think Concord would last long, but I didn’t think I would be as right as I was. </p>



<p>Concord’s core gunplay mechanics are solid, but it didn’t do anything special that Overwatch, Valorant, or the now-released Marvel Rivals doesn’t already do. Its content was lacking—as most free-to-play, live-service titles seem to be on release—and the minimal interest in the beta was telling. People didn’t ask for Concord, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nobody-wishlist-concord-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nobody wishlisted it</a>, and their reluctance to invest time and money is why I now refer to Concord in the past tense—it’s dead.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation shut Concord down</a> within two weeks of its launch. Its reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-cost-over-400-million-to-develop-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$400 million budget</a> makes the shooter a catastrophic failure and one of the worst ever, and developers are likely to learn a lot from Concord’s mistakes for years to come.</p>



<h3 id="h-skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Trust me, this is a rare moment of exhilaration. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>I put around 20 hours into Skull and Bones, and the moments of genuine enjoyment were fleeting at best. Skull and Bones was first announced in 2017 to much hype and excitement, with players ready for a full-blown, pillaging, and pirating adventure akin to Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. Instead, Ubisoft ended up making a much more boring version of its own game.</p>



<p>You can’t fight other crews as the action is relegated to cutscenes, harvesting resources can be done from your ship via a simplistic mini-game, and everything about Skull and Bones is uninspired: The story, the gameplay, the lackluster visuals, and the progression. The ill-conceived fast travel system forces you to regularly travel enormous distances on your ship—where very little happens.</p>



<p>Skull and Bones had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-players-total/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than one million players at launch</a> and shows no signs of improving. It started a familiar trend of disappointing AAA games—or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-aaaaa-games-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAAA in Skull and Bones’ case</a>—with many games underperforming—such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Beauty with no brains. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oh, look, another Ubisoft game. The festering stink of a Ubisoft open-world lingers all over Star Wars: Outlaws. It looks pretty on the outside, but inside, a hollow, familiar journey awaits. It makes The Force Awakens’ derivative clone of A New Hope look faultless—I do love The Force Awakens, by the way, but still.</p>



<p>Outlaws promises a new story in which we get to be bandits. It’s a novel idea and a welcome one, but throughout Outlaws’ development, trailers, and gameplay reveals, it was hard to shake the feeling we were getting a reskinned Far Cry and Assassin’s Creed entry. Again, by nature, it’s a “good” game, but not one likely to live long in the memory.</p>



<p>Worse still, its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=outlaws" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lukewarm launch caused Ubisoft’s stock to plummet</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales underperformed</a> big time. Ultimately, it pales in comparison to EA’s Star Wars Jedi series and shows you need more than an IP to become a true Jedi.</p>



<h3 id="h-lego-horizon-adventures">LEGO Horizon Adventures</h3>



<figure><figcaption>This hurts my Thunderjaw. Credit to Guerrilla Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The LEGO video game franchise has sold millions of copies rehashing a successful formula. Take a popular film series or game, LEGO-ify it, turn it into a collect-a-thon with amusing cutscenes and basic gameplay, and it sells like hotcakes. LEGO’s Horizon Tallneck model is excellent, and little did we know this would prompt a crossover (like Concord) no one was asking for.</p>



<p>On paper, LEGO Horizon Adventures should be a success. I don’t think Horizon gets the praise or adulation it deserves, Aloy is a great hero to follow, and its world is captivating. But when it got the LEGO-ify treatment, people didn’t gravitate toward it. Its OpenCritic rating stands at a decent 71/100—with its “Critics Recommend” score plummeting to a lowly 53%.</p>



<p>This might be a lesson to not stick “LEGO” in front of a franchise and expect gold studs to spew out.</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection">Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Lazy. Credit to Aspyr</figcaption></figure>



<p>I lost so many hours to Galactic Conquest and Hero Assault in Battlefront II, and when I heard it was getting newer and, hopefully, more polished ports, I was excited to revisit it in 2024—especially after 2017’s dismal reboot disaster. I was all ready to splash out the cash on the Classic Collection, only to study the vehement backlash to its release.</p>



<p>Currently, the Classic Collection has a “Mostly Negative” verdict under its 7,000 “All Reviews” on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446550/STAR_WARS_Battlefront_Classic_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The Battlefront games launched with the smallest licks of paint to polish, broken servers, missing modes featured in the original, and sus AI. Curiously, despite the full-price tags, you can actually buy “STAR WARS Battlefront (Classic, 2004)” and “STAR WARS Battlefront II (Classic, 2005)” on Steam for far less than the disastrous collection.</p>



<p>The Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection has gone under the radar somewhat, but it can’t escape the grasp of our most disappointing games of 2024 list.</p>



<h3 id="h-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Justice League didn’t need to die for this. Credit to Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Admit it, you were getting worried I wasn’t going to include this. How I could not feature Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League—the live-service atrocity <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-pulls-suicide-squad-just-one-hour-into-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled from Early Access barely one hour into its launch</a>. Suicide Squad was supposed to be the video game adaptation somewhat based on the movies, only, we have the fascinating plot about killing each member of the Justice League due to Brainiac’s evil influences controlling them and making them evil.</p>



<p>Instead, Kill the Justice League is full of copy-and-paste missions, painfully slow XP grinds, repetitive content, and heinous narrative decisions undermining and destroying Rocksteady’s beautifully molded Arkham universe. I also can’t forgive Suicide Squad for being the last-ever credited role of the legendary Kevin Conroy as Batman—truly lamentable in its own right.</p>



<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League bombed, and is another entry on this list <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-reportedly-says-suicide-squad-fell-short-of-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling short of expectations</a>. Furthermore, it lost Warner Bros. over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$200 million</a>—resulting in many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady layoffs</a>—and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-updates-will-end-with-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 spells its end</a> within a year.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-could-be-revealed-on-january-8th-alleged-first-image-of-the-dock-surfaces-online.1069311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could finally be revealed in less than two weeks, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hl5l1u/chinese_weibo_leaker_who_leaked_the_whole_june/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hlp8zn/the_chinese_weibo_user_has_deleted_all_previous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> subreddits, Chinese Weibo leaker 荷姆荷姆嗼, who previously correctly revealed all the June Nintendo Direct announcements before the presentation aired, recently started a countdown based on the Fibonacci sequence numbers that will end on January 8th, which could be when the Nintendo Switch 2 will be revealed. Since having been discovered, the user deleted all of their posts, changed their profile pic, and said that the countdown was for something else, but this could be an attempt to cover things up and avoid getting identified.</p>
<p>The past few days have also heated up in terms of Nintendo Switch 2 leaks with the first alleged images of the system and the dock shared by a user going by the name of <a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextHandheld</a>, who garnered increased attention following<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-4k-30-fps-only/"> a report</a> from The Verge, which believed the supposed leaker had indeed access to the yet to be revealed new system from Nintendo. After sharing an image of the<a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> system itself</a>, which doesn't look exactly legit, the leaker shared a <a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1872092668551176251?t=BgCKgr3jtPRxnDOHi8Zfog&amp;s=19">second image</a> showcasing the dock, which definitely looks more believable. Still, given how wild the alleged leaks are getting, we must take everything with a huge grain of salt until Nintendo finally lifts the lid on its next-gen system.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but the moment we finally see the system may not be<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/"> too far off</a>. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
