		<p>Airship Syndicate has announced that its MMO Wayfinder will become a single player, with co-op options, offline game called Wayfinder Echoes. Sales for Wayfinder were stopped in April when the game’s ownership transferred from Digital Extremes to Airship Syndicate, while those who owned the game could play as normal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wayfinder - Extended Gameplay Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkN0faBRyjg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Wayfinder Echoes will be available from June 11th on Steam, and it will remove all online requirements for the game, including not needing an account and log in to play. It will also be Steam Deck verified. Any progress people have made in the original Wayfinder will not carry forward to Wayfinder Echoes due to saves not being on a server any longer. There will be no in game purchases or microtransactions either, with Wayfinder Echoes having a price of $24.99 while in early access, and this price will increase when the game leaves early access. Founders Packs will not be going back on sale either. Those who purchased Runesilver will have this converted to a new in game currency that can be used on exclusive cosmetics. The update will be soft launched on May 31st.</p>
<p>Wayfinder Echoes gameplay has also been tweaked and changed. Airship Syndicate have said,<em>“We’ve touched every major system in the game, and as a result, the gameplay is not only more refined, but through our various playtests with those outside the studio, the game performs and plays better than before. Some of these changes include all weapons becoming randomized drops with various slots, armor now having stats and being collectible, thousands of cosmetics and housing items available to collect, the removal of the grind to get new characters, eased requirements for awakening characters, increased housing item limits, adding four difficulties to choose from, incorporating traditional RPG talents into your progression, and much more. This update will also launch with the latest Wayfinder: Grendel, as well as brand-new Hunts and a new Overlands zone (three times the size of our last!) that’s overflowing with content and points of interest.”</em></p>

<p>PS4 support for Wayfinder will be ending but everyone who bought a PS4 version will get a copy of the PS5 version for no cost. The PS5 version of Wayfinder will not go back on sale until later this year, along with an Xbox Series X|S version.</p>

		<p>Tango Gameworks has released one last patch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> today, the final act of the studio after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">the announcement of its closure</a> by Microsoft last week.</p>
<p>This isn’t quite the end of the story for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/29/game-of-the-year-2023-best-xbox-game/">the award-winning game</a>, as it’s been re-confirmed that a physical edition of Hi-Fi Rush is still coming via Limited Run Games. Announced back in February, this will be available for both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>. Some have noted that this will likely be the one real way to preserve the game’s legacy, thanks to the licensed soundtrack meaning it will likely end up removed from sale in a few years – there are non-licensed alternatives in a Streamer mode, but without Tango being around to modify the game as licenses expire, Microsoft is likely to simply pull the game from sale, as it does with its Forza games.</p>


<p>“Thank you all for your continued support.” The <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1790728899875213673">team writes on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>“We’re working to release the physical edition of Hi-Fi RUSH with our partners at Limited Run Games, as well as a final patch to address some minor issues releasing later today.”</p>
<p>Patch notes have been released for these “minor issues”, and they really do seem quite minor. Here’s the Hi-Fi Rush Update 9 patch notes:</p>

<p><strong>PLAYSTATION 5 AND PC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Track 01) After reducing QA-1MIL to zero health, a collision issue would occur where players would fall out of the geometry. Chai will now properly fall to the ground, instead of into the abyss.</li>
<li>(Track 01) Fixed an issue during the latter half of the 2D area whereby the camera would not follow Chai when the elevating lift falls.</li>
<li>(Track 02) Corrected a defect whereby if you touched Rekka during her electric charge, your final Rank would not correlate with the Chorus score.</li>
<li>Some issues would occur when trying to use Macaron’s Gravity Well while Rhythm Parrying an enemy. Well, this is now fixed!</li>
<li>(Track 03) Cutscenes previously would not play correctly if a Health Tank was consumed during the fight with the HG-0G. Feel free to block a few more hits with your face because this bug is fixed!</li>
<li>Fixed various text issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PLAYSTATION 5</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Track 01) During the “Dodge Attack” tutorial, there was a discrepancy between what Smidge said and the text. The text will .</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ALL PLATFORMS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Track 01) We also QA’d some other issues during the QA-1MIL fight, particularly around transitions between phases.</li>
<li>Fixed even more text bugs! They just don’t stop!</li>
<li>Drink prices adjusted in Vandelay vending machines to reflect local currency conversion.</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online%E2%80%99s-new-update-is-quietly-3-classic-mario-games.871755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157336/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-update-super-mario-land<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ogKJ0H">Nintendo’s latest additions to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23591771/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-gba-games-list">Nintendo Switch Online lineup of Game Boy games</a> is led by <em>Super Mario Land</em>, the 1989 platformer made exclusively for the company’s handheld system. <em>Super Mario Land</em> is joined by two other Game Boy launch titles now available for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/10/17336126/nintendo-switch-online-app-service">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, and they’re both Mario games too.</p>
<p id="PcoGBv"><em>Alleyway</em> is Nintendo and Intelligent Systems’ take on classic brick-breaking games like  <em>Breakout</em> and <em>Arkanoid</em>. It’s less obviously a Mario game, though the Super Mario brother is featured on the game’s box art and there’s even a little in-game animation of Mario hopping into the paddle-ship to drive home that, yes, one of the plumber’s many jobs is slamming energy balls on the Vid-Grid. Various sprites based on Bloobers, Bullet Bills, and Bowser also serve as the design for the blocky structures you need to smash.</p>
<p id="Z5Uu4K">(<em>Why</em> is Mario in a spaceship in the mysterious zone known as the Alleyway smashing stuff? The Game Boy game’s manual never says, but it probably has something to do with Nintendo wanting to position <em>Alleyway</em> as something more than a <em>Breakout</em> clone.)</p>

<p id="3D3Lev">Mario is also featured in the Game Boy version of <em>Baseball</em> that’s now available through Nintendo Switch Online. He’s featured front and center in the North American version of the box art, and is included among the pitching staff for the USA’s White Bears. Luigi is a pitcher on the Red Eagles team, though <em>Baseball</em> uses a common sprite for all pitchers — they don’t look anything like Mario and Luigi in the game itself.</p>
<p id="FE3Z6r">Those three Game Boy launch titles are now available to play with a Nintendo Switch Online membership. They join <em>Tetris</em>, another Game Boy launch classic, as well as 20 other 8-bit handheld games.</p>
<p id="T9ghSS">Nintendo Switch Online costs $19.99 annually, and in addition to online multiplayer access, gives Switch owners a library of games from the original NES, Super NES, and Game Boy. A second tier, Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22747408/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-faq-price-cancel-guide">the premium upgrade to Nintendo’s online subscription service</a>, and offers a variety of expansions and downloadable content and access to a library of Game Boy Advance, Nintendo 64, and Sega Genesis games. Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack costs $49.99 annually for an individual user, and $79.99 annually for a family plan (for up to eight users).</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24157232/kickstarter-wonders-of-the-first-forsaken-controversy</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-did-kickstarter-pull-down-2-high-profile-tabletop-campaigns-this-month.871752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157232/kickstarter-wonders-of-the-first-forsaken-controversy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="aE5Kfr">Late last year, Polygon showed that Kickstarter’s earnings from tabletop games were <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24054381/kickstarter-top-10-biggest-most-backed-board-games-campaigns-2023">down for the second straight year</a>, an abrupt change following more than a decade of uninterrupted growth. Our analysis also showed that the number of successful campaigns was up sharply compared to previous years. Now two high-profile campaigns, both removed from the website for different reasons, show how this increase in velocity may be straining the Brooklyn-based crowdfunding pioneer’s resources.</p>
<p id="VxAHEL">The first campaign that Kickstarter elected to bring down was for a game called <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gametrayz/forsaken-5"><em>Forsaken</em></a>, a sandbox adventure board game from the team at <a href="https://gametrayz.com/">Game Trayz</a>. On May 7, Game Trayz <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3297299/re-ks-intellectual-property-dispute">explained</a> that a legal dispute over 10 pieces of art had thrown a wrench in production. According to a statement provided by Kickstarter, the artist in question issued a copyright claim through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) that obligated the platform to pull the<em> </em>campaign down. After Game Trayz swapped out the art, however, Kickstarter was able to return the campaign’s web page to the internet. All in all it’s nothing that unusual, and similar issues have gotten campaigns pulled down plenty of times in the past.</p>
<p id="uMVHE8">However, the issue with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wondersccg/wonders-of-the-first-ccg-canceled/description"><em>Wonders of the First</em></a>, a new collectible card game that features art created using commercially available artificial intelligence tools, was considerably more complex. </p>
<p id="4p0G0t">When the CCG launched on April 30, the project met its funding goal in less than 30 seconds. It’s a testament to the fledgling team’s ability to get its backers in line on day one. The momentum continued to build, until by the end of the first week the campaign was closing in on $1.5 million — quite the haul for a first-time effort. </p>
<p id="WSPNhg">Given the attention being paid to AI on the global stage, that haul also brought intense scrutiny from all around. Many on social media and in the campaign’s comments were there to complain about the use of AI art. Like it or not, that’s something <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23873453/kickstarters-ai-disclosure-terraforming-mars-release-date-price">Kickstarter has allowed since 2023</a>. But the campaign got pulled down anyway, not because of AI but because of expressly prohibited items: non-fungible tokens, also known as <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22313936/non-fungible-tokens-crypto-explained">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p id="EJq0J3">In a statement provided to Polygon, Kickstarter said that <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/rules/prohibited?ref=rules">NFTs simply aren’t allowed on its platform</a> citing a rule against offering “financial services, money processing, credit offerings, travel packages, phone services, and business marketing services” to backers. Reached for comment, the publishers of <em>Wonders of the First</em> reiterated that they believed <a href="https://wondersccg.com/2024/05/10/we-are-back-on-kickstarter-with-a-launch-date-of-tuesday-may-14th-at-2pm-est/">the wording of that rule was unclear</a>. But, after a bit of <a href="https://twitter.com/WondersOTF/status/1788037013720990072">grandstanding</a>, they eventually removed the NFTs and Kickstarter allowed them to relaunch the campaign.</p>
<p id="zUnP5b">But why was a campaign that offered prohibited items allowed to go live in the first place? According to a statement provided by Kickstarter, as the number of campaigns launched each year continues to increase its oversight team is having a difficult time keeping up.</p>
<p id="rbX32f">“We conduct initial reviews of all projects before they go live on Kickstarter to ensure they comply with our community guidelines and terms of service,” said the Kickstarter spokesperson. “However, given the large volume of project submissions we receive daily and the fact that projects can evolve or new information may emerge, our job doesn’t end with these initial reviews. In the case of this project, our continued monitoring and review processes later identified a violation. We take these subsequent reviews seriously to ensure all projects comply with our guidelines. It’s a reflection of our commitment to maintaining the integrity of our platform.”</p>
<p id="75pjXF">Given the trajectory of Kickstarter’s business, we expect the company to field more tabletop campaigns this year than ever before — at least 5,500 successful tabletop campaigns alone. That’s more than 15 successful campaigns <em>every day</em>. With that kind of volume, and with campaigns this complex, there is every potential that backers will see more disruption going forward.</p>

That remains true even when you aren’t actively playing it, and continues long after you’ve solved its final puzzle.</p><p>Allow me to illustrate what I am saying the way the game would:</p><hr><p><em>Int.

I can’t quite remember if I ever had coffee that morning.<br></p><p><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is a puzzle game unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.

The game’s logic-heavy mechanics will immediately draw parallels to Lucas Pope’s seminal <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/return-of-the-obra-dinn-the-kotaku-review-1829797772&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/return-of-the-obra-dinn-the-kotaku-review-1829797772"><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em></a></span>. But just as that game’s innovations and influence made it a common point of reference for critics when reviewing games that followed, I can only assume we will start seeing critics drawing comparisons to <em>Lorelei</em> in much the same way. Simogo’s accomplishment is a step forward for not only the puzzle genre but video games as a whole.</p><h2 id="h3300"><a id=""></a><strong>Real eyes</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ce5dfc04babdaf133a51e11d7818a3c6" data-recommend-id="image://ce5dfc04babdaf133a51e11d7818a3c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman stands outside a hotel" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman stands outside a hotel" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ce5dfc04babdaf133a51e11d7818a3c6" data-recommend-id="image://ce5dfc04babdaf133a51e11d7818a3c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman stands outside a hotel" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every good story, regardless of the medium, needs a good hook. It’s the thing that draws the audience in for the rest of the tale. Oftentimes the best hook is a simple question. In <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, that hook is a handful of questions: Who are you? Where are you? What are you doing here? Did I suddenly develop amnesia? Your goal is to find the truth to all these questions and more in a twisting narrative touching on the nature of art and its spectators. Grab a pen and paper, you’re going to need it.<br></p><p>Much of <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is hard to put into words. It’s a visual and mechanical feast for the senses. But here are the facts as I know them. The game takes place at a seemingly abandoned hotel and its surrounding grounds. The year is… well, that is a little harder to answer. Time is malleable within <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>. While the hotel remains constant, the people and events within it seem to shift between decades and even centuries. But all of these realities live within the same physical space at once. The closest comparison I can make is to Tom Stoppard’s play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_(play)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_(play)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Arcadia</em></a></span>, in which two stories in different time periods play out in parallel on the same stage, nearly interacting with each other at all times. It’s discombobulating but purposefully puts you in a particular mindset. Things here defy easy explanations, so look beyond what your two eyes see.</p><p>Unraveling these questions requires progressing through the hotel’s many rooms, all of which are locked behind a series of exceedingly complex puzzles in a mazelike structure. Mazes are a running theme, and you’ll have to navigate a few of them in <em>Lorelei and The Laser Eyes</em>. While there are some padlocks and safe combinations you must crack, progressing is rarely that simple. To describe the puzzles you encounter in detail would ruin much of the fun, so I won’t spoil them here in detail, but they feel more akin to the ones in cult mystery puzzle book <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain%27s_Jawbone&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain%27s_Jawbone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cain’s Jawbone</em></a></span> than those I’ve seen in any other video game. Most often, <em>Lorelei</em> will present you with a puzzle and you either know what you need to do or you don’t. The puzzles are so compelling that you’ll often find yourself thinking about them even when you’re not playing, and though realizing the solution might take you hours, it feels so good when your subconscious finally hits on a likely solution as you’re just going about your day.</p><figure id="" data-id="559eb3683d57a9f0d4619a4b2cbf0cbc" data-recommend-id="image://559eb3683d57a9f0d4619a4b2cbf0cbc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman walks through a shattered red maze" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman walks through a shattered red maze" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="559eb3683d57a9f0d4619a4b2cbf0cbc" data-recommend-id="image://559eb3683d57a9f0d4619a4b2cbf0cbc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman walks through a shattered red maze" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To ensure that you always have information on hand, the game’s protagonist has a photographic memory. Every image you look at or document you read is available to reference from the game’s menu. However, even with this information, every puzzle requires some real problem-solving on your part. No single puzzle is necessarily “easier” than another, they are just different, and your experience of them will vary based on your own skillset. Are you good at recognizing patterns? Do you have a solid inner compass? Have you memorized your Roman numerals? Some people will solve certain puzzles long before others, which leads to an interesting diversion in paths from player to player that only confirms how intricately crafted every part of the game is. The feeling of satisfaction I felt at solving a puzzle never went away, and it’s only encouraged by the game’s split-second pause between entering a solution and learning if you were correct or not.<br></p><p>Still, it’s not entirely without its pain points. While backtracking through the hotel between puzzles isn’t tedious, the constant backtracking between menus and puzzles is. You constantly need to reference in-game documents in your photographic memory, but there is no back button for menu navigation. It’s not game-ruining by any means, but after navigating through menus for sixteen hours, I really wished I could just press a button to exit my photographic memory instead of navigating to the exit button every time. That problem also extends to puzzles, which require you to enter a solution to exit the puzzle screen. That can grow annoying when you know you don’t have the answer yet but you just want to give the puzzle a look in order to do some brainstorming.</p><h2 id="h3301"><a id=""></a><strong>Realize</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="f4f688f09019ccb4b87f6ceeb6b6c0d8" data-recommend-id="image://f4f688f09019ccb4b87f6ceeb6b6c0d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A low-poly model of a man in a suit points a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A low-poly model of a man in a suit points a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f4f688f09019ccb4b87f6ceeb6b6c0d8" data-recommend-id="image://f4f688f09019ccb4b87f6ceeb6b6c0d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A low-poly model of a man in a suit points a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The aesthetic and mechanical layers of <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> are just as impressive as the puzzles. The game is entirely rendered in greyscale, except for the occasional pop of red. But if the color palette seems reserved, it’s only because that isn’t the limit of the game’s art direction. It took me walking through a handful of different environments to realize that there’s a layered effect at play. Every 3D environment has a photo projection laid behind it. For example, the facade of the central hotel has a photo of a similar-looking building’s facade laid behind it. It gives an uncanny feel to every room you step into, blurring the lines between fiction and reality.<br></p><p>But Simogo didn’t stop at just two layers. The deeper I went into<em> Lorelei and the Laser Eyes,</em> the more layers there were. Again, describing exactly what those layers are risks spoiling the best moments of the game, but they are there and they are expertly woven in.<em> Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> continues to shift its form in new and unexpected ways. It takes the form of game design and uses it as a puzzle in itself. </p><p>Of course, the grandest puzzle of <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is the story, a fact which highlights another masterful trick the game pulls off. As you solve puzzles, you’re also absorbing morsels of information that will finally lead you to answer those questions that hooked you in the first place. The puzzle solutions are the narrative at play. They feed the story, and the story feeds the puzzles in a perfect symbiotic relationship. And it’s a compelling narrative that will likely be a treat for fans of metanarrative games about art like last year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a></span> or 2022’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/immortality-sam-barlow-horror-video-game-ps5-pc-1849470910&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/immortality-sam-barlow-horror-video-game-ps5-pc-1849470910"><em>Immortality</em></a></span>. </p><p>The game’s clashing and changing mechanical and visual styles are a reflection of the central conflict the characters within are struggling with. It’s a question of art. Each character within the game has their own concept of what the purpose of art is and who, if anybody, it is for. “A piece of art exists in itself and for itself,” one in-game document reads. “All art can and should not be for mankind.” But that’s just one of several conflicting ideas on display. Another character discusses art as a vital resource for life, something that must be consumed. Wrapped up in this are questions about artistic legacies, the preservation of digital art, and more. It’s enough to make your head spin, and it likely will for a good chunk of your playtime. But it’s always fascinating when you find a kernel of the story that digs into these themes more.<br></p><p>Once you reach the last moments, the game asks you one final question: have you been paying attention? It’s a stunning test not only of your own logic-solving skills but also of your deductive reasoning in regards to events within the game. Creating an ending for a mystery game is a puzzle in itself because so much of a player’s time is spent theorizing how the story will end, only for their theory to potentially be better than the final reveal. <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is so confident that it does not feel the need to show the cards up its sleeve in service of wrapping things up neatly. Instead, <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> gives you enough answers for that much-needed catharsis of a mystery solved, but still leaves some questions as to the exact details of events. By keeping some cards up its sleeve, as opposed to wrapping everything up neatly, the game perfectly pulls off its tricks.</p><h2 id="h3302"><a id=""></a><strong>Real lies</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="160283822714218ad00e5f5ef8ed09e6" data-recommend-id="image://160283822714218ad00e5f5ef8ed09e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman with red glowing glasses stares at a floating man with a maze as his head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman with red glowing glasses stares at a floating man with a maze as his head" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="160283822714218ad00e5f5ef8ed09e6" data-recommend-id="image://160283822714218ad00e5f5ef8ed09e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman with red glowing glasses stares at a floating man with a maze as his head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve made a lot of comparisons between <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> and other pieces of media in this piece. That’s because the game is so hard to get a handle on. It’s so incredibly multifaceted and pulls on so many artistic mediums. It is one part memory play, one part puzzle game, one part mystery novel. It is the way all of these puzzle pieces fit together that shows Lorelei’s true art, and the act of being the one to connect them that makes it all so satisfying.<br></p><p><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is an amalgamation of influences living alongside one another in the same way the hotel in which it is set seems to hold so many times at once. It’s a reflection of the game’s biggest questions. What is the point of creating and consuming art? Is it a curse, or a gift? That’s the big mystery at the heart of <em>Lorelia and the Laser Eyes</em>. The answer is up to interpretation, but as it exists within such a carefully crafted maze of twisting puzzles and story beats, I can only assume this kind of gift for creating art is just that, a gift. And we, the players, are its lucky recipients. At least that’s my perception of it, and that’s about as close to the truth as I’ll get. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Those little crowns you see next to certain players’ names indicate that they are Mentors, who are (in theory) experienced players who can show newer players the ropes in Eorzea. It’s a neat status symbol, and that alone may be enough for some to want to get the accolade.

For jobs up to ten levels below the current expansion’s level cap, the biggest of these is an EXP bonus that will apply when a Mentor groups with players who have the <strong>New Adventurer</strong> (Sprout) or <strong>Returner</strong> status. (Note that this bonus only activates in preformed parties, so Mentors won’t gain any perks from joining a new player via Duty Roulette.) As well as gaining re-entry into the Novice Network, the chat channel dedicated to helping new players, there are a bunch of other benefits to becoming a Mentor, but believe me when I say you’ll have to <em>work </em>for them. Let’s get into how to become a Mentor.</p><figure id="" data-id="dd80aa15778661f3046b883ef220a7eb" data-recommend-id="image://dd80aa15778661f3046b883ef220a7eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1790" data-height="1007" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Smith in New Gridania" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Smith in New Gridania" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd80aa15778661f3046b883ef220a7eb" data-recommend-id="image://dd80aa15778661f3046b883ef220a7eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1790" data-height="1007" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Smith in New Gridania" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h3461"><a id=""></a>How to become a Battle Mentor in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2><p>There are two paths you can take to become a Mentor. The more straightforward and significant of these is to become a Battle Mentor, which has the following requirements:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Complete 1,000 dungeons, raids, or trials</li><li>Receive 1,500 player commendations</li><li>Level a Tank, Healer, and DPS job to the current expansion’s level cap and complete their corresponding role quests.</li></ul><p>Make no mistake, this is a hefty grind. However, you’ll clear dungeons and receive player commendations as you play, so you <em>can</em> passively hit these requirements. Leveling three jobs to max level takes time too, but to be fair, if you want to be a decent mentor you’ll need to know the basics of each role.</p><p><strong>Once you meet these requirements, you’ll need to talk to The Smith</strong>. You can find this NPC inside the Adventurer’s Guild of Gridania, Ul’dah, or Limsa Lominsa.</p><p>If you want to achieve Battle Mentor status ASAP, here are some tips to help you out.</p><p>1) The first prerequisite is linked to the achievement <strong>Dungeon Master</strong>. If you want to know how close you are to hitting that milestone, search for that name in the achievement menu to see your progress.</p><p>2) If you’ve <em>never</em> played tank or healer roles in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, you should start with level 1 classes so you can learn the ropes. However, if you feel confident and just want to minimize the grind, consider using jobs that have the highest starting level. The “best” jobs in this regard will change as more are added to the game, but typically the last jobs listed in each subsection of the “Classes/Jobs” tab in the Character menu will be your best bets.</p><p>3) There’s no guaranteed way to get player commendations, aside from just being good at the game. Speaking anecdotally, tanks and healers typically receive more player commendations. If you’re playing a ranged DPS class, using a limit break in dungeons on especially large groups of enemies tends to garner player commendations as well. Otherwise, just have a good attitude while you play and stick around for a minute after each dungeon to give other players a chance to commend you (if they want to).</p><figure id="" data-id="6d0ffe1f4bf0050a244e0414e1a7f63d" data-recommend-id="image://6d0ffe1f4bf0050a244e0414e1a7f63d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two very differently-sized players stand near a workbench." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two very differently-sized players stand near a workbench." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6d0ffe1f4bf0050a244e0414e1a7f63d" data-recommend-id="image://6d0ffe1f4bf0050a244e0414e1a7f63d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two very differently-sized players stand near a workbench." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h3462"><a id=""></a>How to become a Trade Mentor in Final Fantasy XIV</h2><p>If becoming a Battle Mentor sounds like too much of a grind, you can opt to become a Trade Mentor instead. To be clear, even if this is a different variety of grind, it’s still a grind. You’ll need to meet the following requirements:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Gather or catch 300 collectibles</li><li>Synthesize 100 collectibles</li><li>Level at least one gathering class to the current expansion’s level cap</li><li>Level at least one crafting class to the current expansion’s level cap</li></ul><p>Once again, these requirements require hard work, but a lot of it is work that comes naturally as you play. You’ll want to craft and gather a ton of collectibles after you hit level 50 with any crafter or gatherer, both for experience points and endgame currency. Also, the many Custom Deliveries NPC questlines you can unlock after finishing <em>Heavensward</em> require turning in collectibles. If gathering and crafting bore you to tears, hitting the Trade Mentor requirements will feel like a chore. But if you really enjoy this part of the game, you’ll naturally hit these goals over time, making this a natural choice for a Mentor path.</p><p>Like the Battle Mentor requirements, the collectible milestones correspond to the achievements <strong>I Collected That 1</strong> and <strong>I Made That (Worth Collecting) 1</strong>. Check those if you want to see your progress.</p><p>Also, yes, Trade Mentors can still get that EXP bonus when grouping up with New Adventurers and Returners. Your crown next to your name will look a little different, though, in case that matters to you.</p><figure id="" data-id="ff220ce077f3c0235f1b74d8a2258c48" data-recommend-id="image://ff220ce077f3c0235f1b74d8a2258c48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mentor Roulette option in the Duty Roulette menu" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Mentor Roulette option in the Duty Roulette menu" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff220ce077f3c0235f1b74d8a2258c48" data-recommend-id="image://ff220ce077f3c0235f1b74d8a2258c48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Mentor Roulette option in the Duty Roulette menu" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h3463"><a id=""></a>How to unlock Mentor Roulette</h2><p>Okay, so you’ve become a Mentor. Now what? Well, if you became a Battle Mentor, you’ll see Mentor Roulette appear in the Duty Roulette. However, you’ll need to clear an enormous number of duties to properly unlock it; way more than any other roulette in the game. While the goalposts for Mentor Roulette change with nearly every major update, your requirements to unlock it will consist of clearing the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Every dungeon (excluding those outside the duty finder system, such as deep dungeons or criterion dungeons)</li><li>Every normal and hard mode trial</li><li>Every extreme trial, excluding those from the current expansion</li><li>Every guildhest</li><li>Every alliance raid</li><li>Every normal mode raid (excluding the Coils of Bahamut)</li></ul><p>If you’re a Mentor and you don’t know what you need to clear to unlock Mentor Roulette, your first line of business is what any <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> player should do: <strong>clear the main story</strong>. After that, you’ll want to scour every overworld area and check for any lingering quests with a “+” marker, since those lead to unlockables that may involve new dungeons or trials. That’s a big ask for sure, but you’ll want to clear all those quests regardless of the Mentor Roulette.</p><p>If you’re <em>still </em>missing requirements, there are two questlines with unique trial battles that players can easily miss. The first is the initial step of the Relic Weapon questline in <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, which contains two unique trials. You’ll clear these as part of the <strong>A Relic Reborn</strong> quest. The second is the long-running <strong>Hildibrand </strong>series of quests that begins in <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, which features unique trial battles even in the <em>Stormblood</em> and <em>Endwalker</em> expansions.</p><h2 id="h3464"><a id=""></a>Let’s talk about extreme trials in the Mentor Roulette</h2><p>Mentor Roulette is the only roulette that contains extreme trials, and clearing these is obviously no small feat. Fortunately, <strong>Unsynced/Undersized clears still count towards completion</strong>, so you can solo many of these by the time you achieve max level. You <em>will</em> need other players to help you clear the higher-level extreme trials, so you’ll need to use the Party Finder or ask players in your Free Company to help you out. Experienced players may want to help just to get your new player bonus.</p><p>As a cautionary reminder, <strong>you can roll any of these extreme trials once you use Mentor Roulette</strong>. And since you’ll have to complete these while level synced in this context, you <em>will </em>need to learn the mechanics of these fights. <strong>Anecdotally, the extreme trials you roll will predominantly consist of those from <em>A Realm Reborn</em></strong>, presumably since players learn to use Party Finder or Discord to organize parties once they get into expansion content. So take some time to learn those fights, and accept you’ll really need to coordinate your party in encounters like The Striking Tree (Extreme). That is the responsibility of a Mentor, after all.</p><figure id="" data-id="ebecb4aa2e4a815f39598260037c556e" data-recommend-id="image://ebecb4aa2e4a815f39598260037c556e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The &quot;I Hope Mentor Will Notice Me&quot; series of achievements" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The &quot;I Hope Mentor Will Notice Me&quot; series of achievements" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ebecb4aa2e4a815f39598260037c556e" data-recommend-id="image://ebecb4aa2e4a815f39598260037c556e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The &quot;I Hope Mentor Will Notice Me&quot; series of achievements" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h3465"><a id=""></a>What are the benefits and rewards of Mentor Roulette?</h2><p>On its own, Mentor Roulette only offers a paltry amount of endgame currency that you can earn once a day. You <em>must</em> use a max level class as well, so there’s no EXP to gain here like you’d find in the other roulettes. You can still grab the gear and tomestones you’d normally get from whatever instance you wind up rolling, but that’s it.</p><p>The real benefit of running Mentor Roulette comes from the <strong>I Hope Mentor Will Notice Me</strong> achievements. Each of these achievements after the first comes with a unique reward that you can’t get anywhere else. </p><p>Here are all the perks you can get, along with the number of Mentor Roulette clears you need to unlock them:</p><p><strong>50</strong>: The <strong>Mentor</strong> title<br><strong>200</strong>: The cosmetic headpiece <strong>Expeditioner’s Flyers</strong><br><strong>500</strong>: The <strong>Mentor of Mentors</strong> title<br><strong>1,000</strong>: The cosmetic headpiece <strong>Dragon Monocle</strong><br><strong>2,000</strong>: The unique mount<strong> Astrope</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="c4d81c10e604143e2553f77c57f1b2bf" data-recommend-id="image://c4d81c10e604143e2553f77c57f1b2bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Astrope mount." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Astrope mount." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c4d81c10e604143e2553f77c57f1b2bf" data-recommend-id="image://c4d81c10e604143e2553f77c57f1b2bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Astrope mount." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h3466"><a id=""></a>Is running Mentor Roulette worth it?</h2><p>This is a fairly subjective question, since your biggest rewards from Mentor Roulette are cosmetic. The Astrope mount is clearly the prize here; it remains one of the rarest mounts in the game, despite being introduced back in <em>Heavensward</em>. However, clearing Mentor Roulette 2,000 times is a <em>massive</em> grind. To put that number in perspective, if you ran Mentor Roulette daily, it would still take you about <strong>five and a half years</strong> to get Astrope.</p><p>Mentor Roulette is also inherently inconsistent. If you get lucky, you may roll a Guildhest and complete your Mentor Roulette duty in a few minutes. On the other hand, you could bash your head against an extreme trial for 90 minutes, or get one of the lengthy Main Scenario roulette duties. Again, the rewards from Mentor Roulette by themselves are paltry, so you are sacrificing other rewards in the game you could be chasing instead.</p><p>This isn’t to say that Mentor Roulette isn’t worth your time. It’s a system that lets experienced players help new adventurers, and the rewards should be seen as a thank you gift for helping out. In other words, if you have fun by lending a helping hand, then go chase those Mentor Roulette achievements. You could complete <em>Persona 3</em>, <em>Persona 4</em>, and <em>Persona 5 </em>in the time it’d take to earn Astrope, so I only recommend chasing this one to the most hardcore <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>fans out there.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I am an incredibly strong person and I have been streaming for a very, very long time. But absolutely nothing prepares you for someone saying this to you.”</p><p>Morgan went on to argue that account suspensions aren’t enough to combat behavior like this, and called for hardware-level bans that would keep toxic players from continuing to play. “If this goes unpunished I am taking this as an active act from you that you do not give a single fuck about any of the women and minorities that play your game, and I will rally to boycott,” her tweet continued. Later, after leaving the match in question, she received an AFK penalty from Riot games for disconnecting. “Teamwork and respect are essential,” it read in a notice that required her to click “acknowledge.”</p><p>Responses poured in on social media in the aftermath of the exchange. “This Andru Tayte mentality can go fuck itself into oblivion,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/DaveJonesActor/status/1790381828940914798&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/DaveJonesActor/status/1790381828940914798" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span><em> Baldur’s Gate III</em>’s Halsin voice actor, Dave Jones. “The toxic players you tolerate are costing you billions of dollars a year,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/zette16/status/1790410820737970368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/zette16/status/1790410820737970368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> Cornerstone Studios CEO and art director on <em>Psychonauts 2</em>, Lisette Titre-Montgomery. “True story.

Plenty of other online users tried to defend the remarks, claim they weren’t that bad, or argued that the streamer should have just shrugged them off. “Women are so fragile. Just banter back and top frag,” read one heavily-upvoted response by someone with “incel and proud” in their bio. “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. Stop invading men’s spaces,” read another.</p><p>“Taylor, I’m so sorry you had to experience this,” <em>Valorant</em>’s executive producer, Anna Dolan, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/Guizzsan/status/1790568856622174273&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/Guizzsan/status/1790568856622174273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted back</a></span> the next day. “We’re taking actions against this account, but I also know that’s not enough. Our teams are always working on our behavior tools, but we have room to improve…and we will. I know we’ve never met—I hope we can fix that at some point—and you don’t have any reason to believe me, but I promise this means a lot to us and is a big priority.”</p><p>One player in the thread asked Dolan if Morgan’s call for hardware-level bans would be one of those tools. “We’ve actually considered this approach,” she said. “There are some complexities we’re navigating, but it is for sure an option in the future.”</p><p>A spokesperson for Riot Games told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email that the AFK penalty against Taylor has since been lifted, and that the company will be taking action “against the egregious behavior in the video.”</p><p>“We’re constantly evaluating our internal systems to move swiftly against disruptive behavior,” they wrote. “As much as we invest in them, unfortunately our systems will never catch everything so we have to be willing and ready to take corrective action manually when needed.”</p><p>One mechanism for clamping down on toxic speech in online gaming could be AI related. Microsoft has been using generative-AI to try to more quickly identify and sanction behavior on Xbox that violates its terms. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-enforcement-strike-system-toxic-voice-chat-ban-1850740195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-enforcement-strike-system-toxic-voice-chat-ban-1850740195">Microsoft announced last year</a></span> that it would use a new voice reporting feature to issue up to eight strikes against players before eventually banning their accounts. “Since its launch, 138k voice records have been captured utilizing our ‘capture now, report later’ system,” the company wrote in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-transparency-report-may-2024/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-transparency-report-may-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new transparency report</a></span> released today. “When those reports resulted in an Enforcement Strike, 98% of players showed improvement in their behavior and did not receive subsequent enforcements.”</p><p>Of course, even those tools still rely on players’ proactively submitting reports of voice clips. It’s unclear what percentage of people who experience toxic voice chat in games like <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> or <em>Overwatch 2</em> actually do that. No doubt some just instantly mute team chat and never turn it back on, while others simply log off altogether and don’t bother coming back. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Last of Us’ second season is in production as we speak, and fans are hot on the heels of any leaks, judging early images way ahead of time. The second season of the award-winning live-action adaptation of the same name isn’t due to be released until 2025, but that hasn’t stopped fans from forming early opinions of the shots seen so far.</p>



<p>Recently, HBO revealed two production stills from The Last of Us, showcasing what the lead characters – Joel and Ellie – are shaping up to look like in the second season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-early-issues">Early Issues</h2>



<p>In the two shots <a href="https://twitter.com/streamonmax/status/1790749925417910442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">showcased by Max on Twitter</a> today, we see Joel (Pedro Pascal) – now sporting a little more hair – assumedly at the tavern in Jackson, if the background of his image is anything to go by. He’s staring someone down in the shot, but it’s not possible to identify them in the image provided.</p>



<p>By contrast, Bella Ramsay’s Ellie is in more of an action sequence in her shot. She’s clutching a shotgun and making her way through some kind of store, dressed head-to-toe in winter garb and wearing a lit torch, which suggests she’s creeping through somewhere long abandoned. She’s wearing an intense look on her face; a burning focus that indicates she’s moments from potential danger.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Recently, fans <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-fans-concerned-set-shots/">have expressed concerns</a> about Bella Ramsay’s ongoing portrayal of Ellie in The Last of Us. In the second game (2020), Ellie is around 19 years old and has been noticeably aged by her apocalyptic environment. Bella Ramsay, unfortunately, still looks very baby-faced and not as ‘rough’ as Ellie appears during the second game.</p>



<p>Time will tell how the second season shapes up, but it’ll be a long time before we see the finished product.</p>

                <p>A new Destiny 2 expansion means new Exotic weapons, and for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-release-date-new-exotics-and-everything-we-know/1100-6517377/" data-ref-id="1100-6517377">The Final Shape</a>, Bungie is resurrecting the very first gun that players ever got their hands on. Now sporting an updated look and a brand-new weapon perk, the Khvostov 7G-0X is making its debut in Destiny 2 as one of the Exotics that you'll be able to unlock. For its new ability, Bungie is teasing a powerful ricochet round that can shred through enemies.</p><p>The Khvostov 7G-0X was a reliable auto rifle for the first hour of Destiny back in 2014, although it was quickly replaced by weapons with higher stats and better perks early on in the game. Years later, the Khvostov would get a remake in Destiny's final expansion, Rise of Iron, and would serve as a Jack-of-all-trades weapon with multiple firing modes. The quest to unlock it was fun and would go on to serve as a template for other Exotic weapon missions in Destiny 2, as players had to travel to the Plaguelands in the Cosmodrome, collect parts, and fight some powerful Splicers before the Khvostov could be turned into a powerful addition to your arsenal.</p><p>The Exotic mission ended with a touching moment between you and your Ghost, creating a surprisingly tender finale to Rise of Iron. Since then, the Khvostov has been absent throughout the years that Destiny 2 has been active, but at long last, the circle will be complete when it is added to the game in The Final Shape, the conclusion to the Light and Darkness Saga.</p><p>Big changes are in store for players when the expansion launches, as not only will the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-new-prismatic-subclass-fuses-light-and-darkness-for-the-first-time-ever/1100-6522514/" data-ref-id="1100-6522514">Prism subclass</a> allow for Light and Darkness powers to be mixed, but new Exotic class items will also offer a potentially powerful tag team of perks.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/from-ascii-to-pixel-art-and-back.871728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/from-ascii-to-pixel-art-and-back<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hello everyone! I'm developing a new game called Coin-Op Vice on my old text-mode engine. However, this is a pseudo-3D (2.5D) pixel art game with perspective. It turns out that a character-based ASCII engine can handle this task, it just needs a couple of upgrades.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Upgrade number one: custom font">Upgrade number one: custom font</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each character in the font is simply an image. In my case, it's pixel art. If we replace the characters with arbitrary images, we can create cool Pixel Art from this font. However, this method has two limitations:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My font is originally monochromatic. Each letter can only consist of pixels of one color. While there is information about the color of the character, there is no information about the color of each pixel within the character. This is due to the way the font is created in the engine. I've decided not to change this part of the engine.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The character set is limited. If we replace the "/" character in the font with a sprite of a right leg, then all "/" characters on the screen will become right legs. And if this character was used to create an arm (as in the animation below), it will now turn into a leg. At the moment, I'm already using characters from the entire ASCII range to create images.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p>I made this animation as a gift for my future wife.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Due to the monochromatic nature of the characters, the image has a Spectrum-style look. And because of the character set limitation, I can edit and test various configurations right in the code using the keyboard. Essentially, each image in the game corresponds to a key on my keyboard. Lots of benefits!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Upgrade number two: multiple alphanumeric layers with variable grid size">Upgrade number two: multiple alphanumeric layers with variable grid size</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's say it's 1978, and you're sitting in front of an alphanumeric display (like a VT100). Let's assume it can display 24 rows by 80 characters. The characters are arranged in a grid with a fixed and uniform size for each cell.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now we create multiple alphanumeric layers, as if several computers (or video adapters) were sending signals to your display. The signals combine, and you see a composite image - multiple text layers superimposed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now let each text layer have its own smooth offset on the screen, as well as its own cell size for characters. That's it. Now you can make a 2.5D Top-Down game with perspective. You just need to calculate the offsets of the alphanumeric layers correctly and set the sizes of their grids.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Upgrade number three, non-authentic">Upgrade number three, non-authentic</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Couldn't resist adding CGA palette graphics to the game. I really like the colors, and the faces turn out particularly vivid. I hope the retro style vibe isn't compromised by this eclecticism. What's your opinion?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Back to ASCII">Back to ASCII<br></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One day, during endless testing and debugging of the game, my custom font switched back to the original - character-based one. I really liked the image. It was like being in another world. The Matrix.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I decided to implement a special mode. If you approach the terminal in the game, you can switch to a "matrix" mode. Since it's better not to use the name "Matrix," I named the mode "Neo-N." It's a reference to the main character of the movie, and the name also emphasizes that everything is illuminated with neon. My wife came up with it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Being in this mode offers many advantages: monsters don't inflict damage (while I can still harm them), hidden passages become visible, and you can collect special cartridges to build a deck. After 15 seconds, there's an automatic "emergence" from this mode.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the transition to this expanded text mode, I tried smoothly changing the parallax parameters. The image seemed to, sort of, expand. Isn't that interesting?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Such a comeback in ASCII, even if only at 15-second intervals. I decided to tell you about this unusual game design. I hope you liked the style. Visit the game's page on Steam, where a demo with this feature is already available.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722640/CoinOp_Vice/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722640/CoinOp_Vice/</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Does such a retro design have the right to exist in our era? What do you think?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thanks everyone, bye for now!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/half-life-inspired-survival-sim-abiotic-factor-has-sold-250000-copies-already/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=half-life-inspired-survival-sim-abiotic-factor-has-sold-250000-copies-already<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="380" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Deep Field Games’ indie “survival crafting experience” <em>Abiotic Factor</em> has been doing a bit of alright lately. It came out a couple of weeks ago, and is currently showing as “Overwhelmingly Positive” on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>. It might not be setting the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Top Sellers</a> alight (it’s currently at number 56), but it’s been selling pretty well, make no mistake.</p> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">In a recent post on X, the team behind <em>Abiotic Factor</em> were excited to announce that the game had sold more than 250,000 copies since launching on May 2. To go along with this, there’s also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4170973472361720259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">message posted to the Steam page</a> that gives thanks for this 11-day achievement.</p> <figure data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">It’s always a positive moment when an indie outfit gets to see the fruits of their labor reach lofty heights. It’s a tough ol’ world out there in Video Game Land, so it’s encouraging to see these bursts of non-AAA titles have their moment in the spotlight, even if it’s sometimes short-lived.</p> <h2 id="h-half-life-meets-rust" data-injectable="false"><em>Half-Life</em> meets <em>Rust</em></h2> <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">For those who haven’t played it yet, <em>Abiotic Factor</em> is essentially a survival sim with crafting elements. It tasks 1-6 players with working together “against the universe’s biggest threats.” The story reads thus:</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false"> <p>As a GATE employee you extend the bounds of human knowledge, and seek to explain the unexplainable – including anomalies and paranormal entities: from gravity-distorting artifacts to supernatural creatures with an unbridled instinct for violence. Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importance… usually.</p> </blockquote> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">Thematically and almost visually, it takes a lot of cues from <em>Half-Life</em>, Valve’s maiden release from back in the day that went on to become one of the most influential first-person shooters in gaming history. Who wouldn’t want a piece of that action?</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Developer Deep Field Games also released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4170973472349895596?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the “First Week” update</a> a few days ago. There’s also a roadmap showing what’s being planned, which includes a Crush Depth update coming this summer, as well as a Halloween patch. Marvelous.</p>

<p data-characters="226" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Is there a better feeling in<em> Call of Duty</em> than hitting a sweet one-shot Sniper Rifle kill? If that sounds like your kind of thing, then you should try out this KATT-AMR <em>Warzone</em> loadout which is a good alternative to the MORS. </p> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">Just because a gun is popular with the community, it doesn’t mean it’s going to be perfect for you. For example, the DG-58 LSW LMG is the most picked weapon in the game, but I just can’t use it, and stick with my tried and true MCW instead. </p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">That could be you with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-new-mors-sniper-one-shot-down-loadout-for-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MORS</a>, the most popular sniper rifle in the game. If it’s just not working for you and you fancy trying something else, then this KATT-AMR class, including a full loadout with attachments and perks, could be the sniper rifle for you. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>This loadout is all about accuracy. Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-best-katt-amr-warzone-attachments" data-injectable="false">Best KATT-AMR <em>Warzone</em> attachments</h2> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Sonic Suppressor XL</li> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>ZANG-34 Barrel</li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>Heinrichter Hybrid Scope</li> <li><strong>Ammo: </strong>.50 Cal High Velocity</li> <li><strong>Bolt: </strong>Ephemeral Quickbolt</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">This loadout is mainly focused on improving the gun’s accuracy, as while the <strong>Ephemeral Quickbolt </strong>does increase the KATT-AMR’s fire rate, it does hurt its accuracy stats overall. Thankfully, the <strong>ZANG-34 Barrel </strong>and <strong>Heinrichter Hybrid Scope</strong> both help with that.</p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">The <strong>.50 Cal High Velocity</strong> ammunition helps with range, while the <strong>Sonic Suppressor XL</strong> will keep you off enemy radar, which is a big help if you’re set up somewhere and don’t want to move. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best KATT-AMR perks and equipment</h2> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Perk 1: </strong>Fast Hands</li> <li><strong>Perk 2: </strong>Ghost</li> <li><strong>Perk 3: </strong>Double Time</li> <li><strong>Perk 4: </strong>Quick Fix</li> <li><strong>Lethal: </strong>Proximity Mine</li> <li><strong>Tactical: </strong>Smoke Grenade</li> </ul> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true">As you’ll be running a sniper, your class needs to be set up specifically for that style of play, and the issues that come with it. <strong>Fast Hands</strong> lets you swap weapons faster, which is hugely important if an enemy gets close to you, as the KATT-AMR is not the weapon you want to use in that scenario. <strong>Double Time </strong>can also be useful in this regard, as the doubled Tactical Sprint duration can help you escape if you’re being closed down. </p>
 <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="267" data-injectable="false"><strong>Ghost </strong>will keep you off UAVs, Portable Radars, and Heartbeat Sensors, which should help you stay hidden from enemies while you try to pick them off at a distance, while <strong>Quick Fix</strong> immediately starts health regeneration when you kill an opponent or use an armor plate. </p> <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="false">Finally, I like placing a Proximity Mine just as a protection tool when I’m bunkered down with my sniper, while the Smoke can get you out of sticky situations. </p>

<p data-characters="186" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While there’s sadly still no trailer for the second season of <em>The Last of Us</em>, HBO has given fans the next best thing and shared a first glimpse of Season 2 ahead of its 2025 debut.</p> <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">It’s nothing too exciting, only consisting of a pair of images <a href="https://twitter.com/StreamOnMax/status/1790750902862631369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared to Twitter</a> that show returning protagonists Joel and Ellie, who are obviously being played once again by Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey respectively. Maybe it’s just me, but Pascal’s Joel does appear slightly older than he did in Season 1, which makes sense since <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Part 2</a></em> (which Season 2 will be based on) takes place four years after the first game.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true">Ramsey, by comparison, doesn’t seem any different from her Season 1 appearance. Although that’s kind of funny, since Ramsey is much closer to Ellie’s age in real-life now than in Season 1 (Ellie is 19 in <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>, whilst Ramsey is 20). Considering the sort of things Ellie will eventually go through in Season 2, maybe Ramsey we’ll see her demeanor and appearance change as events transpire.</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">Honestly, I’m far more intrigued to see how <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kaitlyn-dever-cast-as-abby-in-the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo/">Kaitlyn Dever will look as Abby</a>. I won’t spoil anything for those who haven’t touched the games and are only familiar with the show, but Abby is a very important character in <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>. She’s expected to play a similarly big role in Season 2. Plus, Abby is noticeably buff in the game, with her body based on <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3azvwy/gamers-are-mad-a-woman-in-a-video-game-has-muscles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">athlete Colleen Fotsch</a>, so I wonder if Dever will have put on some muscle for the part.</p>
 <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="false">While Season 2 will be drawing from <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>, it’s been suggested the show will get at least <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-season-2-3-abby-tv-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a third season</a>. This’ll likely mean the plot of <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> will be expanded upon and stretched out to cover two seasons, or maybe the show will feature a few new original storylines to pad things out. Either way, certain key events will probably be saved for Season 3, though I can think of a fantastic stopping point for Season 2 that’ll leave fans unfamiliar with the source material on the edge of their seats.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24157264/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-studio-closure</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hi-fi-rush-gets-one-last-patch-before-studio-closure.871698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157264/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-studio-closure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NPzQHq">Tango Gameworks will update <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23574584/hi-fi-rush-review-game-pass-xbox-series-x-pc"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a> one last time before Microsoft shuts the door on the studio. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151045/microsoft-xbox-studio-closures-tango-gameworks-arkane-austin-redfall">Microsoft announced earlier in May</a> that it was closing three studios, including <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> developer Tango Gameworks. Shortly after the news of the closures, <a href="https://twitter.com/TangoGameworks/status/1787837929332601189">Tango Gameworks confirmed the game</a> will “remain available and playable everywhere” it's already accessible.</p>
<p id="uP1nCQ">The final patch is expected to fix “minor issues” in <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, and will be deployed later on Wednesday. Tango Gameworks will continue to work in partnership with Limited Run Games to release the physical version of the game. “Thank you all for your continued support,” <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1790728899875213673">Tango Gameworks posted from its X account</a>.</p>
<p id="aXk4gr">Microsoft’s decision to close Tango Gameworks came as a surprise to many in the industry; the Japanese studio surprise launched the game early last year to critical and — what seemed like — commercial success. <a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1649431572137779203%7Ctwgr%5E664a50cfe28361006abf8068a7e0d7e777ff3dac%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fsuccess-cant-save-your-favorite-game-studios-anymore">Xbox marketing director Aaron Greenberg posted on X in April 2023</a> that <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> was “a breakout hit” in “all key measurements and expectations” at Microsoft. Just a day after the closure was announced, Xbox Game Studios lead Matt Booty told staff that Microsoft needed “smaller games that give us prestige and awards” — a message that was surprising to employees, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">according to The Verge</a>, because <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> is exactly that. <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1691846131548913781"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> had 3 million players</a> and won plenty of awards, <a href="https://www.bafta.org/games/awards/animation-2">including a prestigious BAFTA win for its animation</a>.</p>
<p id="04wkBA"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> fans showed their displeasure with the closure by review bombing the game on Valve’s Steam platform — but opposite of how it’s usually done. Review bombing is usually a negative act — people attempting to tank a game’s review score on a platform like Steam. But <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> players added more than 2,000 <em>positive</em> reviews to Steam in an attempt to show Microsoft how much they loved it and to thank Tango Gameworks for their work. Several reviewers commented on the ironic nature of the studio’s closure: <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> is “a power fantasy about tearing down an evil corporation whose executives treat workers like fodder in the endless pursuit of wealth,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23574584/hi-fi-rush-review-game-pass-xbox-series-x-pc">as Polygon said in its review</a>.</p>
<p id="QpToQ5"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> was originally an Xbox exclusive, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24063938/microsoft-xbox-exclusivity-playstation-5-nintendo-switch">but was released on PlayStation 5 in 2024</a>. It’ll remain available on all current platforms, despite the studio’s closure.</p>

  <p id="HOe9ZG">Cameos: They’re not just videos that actors do in their living rooms for money! In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24126226/x-men-97-genosha-e-extinction-morlocks-cassandra-nova">its excellent first season</a>, the <em>X-Men </em><strong>’</strong><em>97 </em>writers have had a lot of fun giving viewers little views into the Marvel Universe beyond the X-Mansion. A quick glimpse of Spider-Man here, a conversation between Rogue and Captain America there — it’s a thrilling old-school approach to comic book cameos that signals the scale of what’s happening instead of teasing the potential for spinoffs.</p>
<p id="43BR8Y">Those cameos step up big time in the three-part “Tolerance is Extinction” finale, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24139132/x-men-97-bastion-ozt-operation-zero-tolerance">as the human-machine hybrid Bastion</a> plunges the world into chaos. As a result, we get some neat cutaways to Marvel heroes around the world reacting to a pending apocalypse — Daredevil fighting crime, Doctor Strange mid-surgery — and one that implies something kind of big. Take a look at these two:</p>

<p id="1v3OZl">Marvel animation heads will recognize them as Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson as they appeared in <em>Spider-Man: The Animated Series, </em>which was set in the same continuity as <em>X-Men</em>. What’s notable here is that both MJ and Peter are seen here, <em>together</em>, in a show that’s a sequel to their cartoon contemporary.</p>
<p id="giUxuo"><em>Spider-Man</em> famously ended on a cliffhanger, as escalating threats led to the webslinger bopping his way around the multiverse (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23281477/mcu-multiverse-saga-phase-5-and-6">I know</a>) with Madame Web (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24071362/madame-web-review-post-credits-scene-sequel-teaser-bad">I <em>know</em></a><em>) </em>to find Mary Jane. The reason? Earlier in the series, Peter learns that the Mary Jane he married at the start of the final season was in fact a clone (relatable, as Scott Summers would say), and the real Mary Jane was lost in limbo after getting pulled through a portal two seasons prior.</p>
<p id="eAueMl">So yeah: in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it scene, <em>X-Men </em><strong>’</strong><em>97</em> gives Spider-Man a happy ending, showing Peter and Mary Jane reunited at last. But there’s a bit more to the story if you’re curious.</p>
<p id="7mmLRT"><em>Spider-Man </em>producer and head writer John Semper has <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/87-a-chat-with-john-semper-jr-part-1/id1331891115?i=1000563186237">spoken quite candidly</a> about his time running the animated series (not a picnic) and how his intended plans to end the series were disrupted by the network wanting to reboot the show into the bizarre <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23718878/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-high-evolutionary-spider-man-unlimited"><em>Spider-Man Unlimited</em></a>. After notably beating <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23742233/spider-man-across-spider-verse-review"><em>Spider-Verse</em></a> to, well, the Spider-Verse with a final story that had his Spider-Man meet multiversal versions of himself, Semper <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/spider-man-animated-series-cast-745604/">left the door open</a> for a final story that would depict Peter’s search for MJ. Over the years, Semper has said varying things about that final story — one version was a journey through history that would include Jack the Ripper — but ultimately, it’s hard to imagine the story ending in anything other than a reunion, even if it was off-screen. </p>
<p id="ieozFz">Well, until now.</p>

Based on the hanging lights in the background and the brown jacket he’s wearing, this is very clearly the dance scene that takes place the night before Ellie’s revenge tour is set into motion. He’s looking at who appears to be Ellie with a sad look on his face. We won’t spoil what’s going on for those who haven’t played the game, but just know the scene is incredibly dramatic.</p><figure id="" data-id="c0a445cccc53b9ea5d6d070265da1026" data-recommend-id="image://c0a445cccc53b9ea5d6d070265da1026" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel being a sad dad." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel being a sad dad." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0a445cccc53b9ea5d6d070265da1026" data-recommend-id="image://c0a445cccc53b9ea5d6d070265da1026" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel being a sad dad." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The second photo of Ramsey as Ellie is a bit harder to discern. Ellie is in a winter outfit with a beanie and a fur-hooded jacket.

Riffing even further on the <em>Dishonored</em> comparisons, another user made a short video of protagonist Corvo stealing the portrait as he does with many in-game pieces of art. </p><p>However, the jokes don’t stop at <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>. Other comparisons arose, and not all of them were to video games. </p><p>So, all this is to say the portrait’s vibes are rancid in the eyes of the public, and maybe it inadvertently and humorously plays into what many see as the cartoon villainy of the British monarch. Though if I’m being honest, I think the portrait kind of goes hard.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Madden NFL 25 Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reveals-madden-25/1100-6403229/" data-ref-id="1100-6403229">EA revealed Madden NFL 25 in January 2013</a>, meaning the game skipped being called Madden NFL 14 with that entry. Marking the franchise's quarter-century milestone, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/barry-sanders-named-madden-25-cover-athlete/1100-6407557/" data-ref-id="1100-6407557">NFL legend Barry Sanders was named the cover star for that game</a> after winning a voting contest. The former Detroit Lions running back beat out other Hall of Famers like Joe Montana and Jerry Rice.</p><p dir="ltr">If this year's edition goes ahead with Madden NFL 25 as well, it wouldn't be the first time EA has used the same exact name for a video game. For instance, the publisher had no problem launching Need for Speed in 2015 (a reboot) or even Need for Speed: Most Wanted in 2012, separate from the same-named game in 2005. Additionally, Activision Blizzard has gotten into this habit recently with the Modern Warfare subseries in Call of Duty. Other high-profile titles following this format include God of War (2018) and Saints Row (2022).</p><p dir="ltr">With that in mind, it's likely EA just goes ahead with Madden NFL 25. Over a decade has passed since the 25th-anniversary edition, and it's not like that version is available these days to confuse consumers. It shouldn't be long to find out for sure, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/15/heres-your-first-look-at-joel-and-ellie-in-season-2-of-hbos-the-last-of-us<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>HBO/Max has <a href="https://x.com/StreamOnMax/status/1790750902862631369">released</a> the first look at Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsey's Ellie in Season 2 of <i>The Last of Us</i>, and the scenery looks familiar. As Season 2 shoots are underway, images from filming have begun to leak, but today's images are the first official shots from the upcoming season, which is due out next year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pascal's Joel appears to be in the barn where a very important and intense scene between he and Ellie takes place, while Ellie appears to be inside a wintery location, likely somewhere in the game's beginning where snow is abundant.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out the first official look at Season 2 of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>for yourself below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pascal and Ramsey are obviously returning cast members for the series, and they'll be joined by various newcomers in the show next year.&nbsp;<em>Booksmart's&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/09/kaitlyn-dever-joins-the-last-of-us-tv-show-as-abby">Kaitlyn Dever will play Abby</a>, while <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/10/hbos-the-last-of-us-young-mazino-cast-as-jesse-for-season-2">Young Mazino joins as Jesse</a>. Manny, Mel, Nora, and Owen will be played by Danny Ramirez (<i>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</i>,&nbsp;<em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>), Ariela Barer (<em>Runaways</em>), Tati Gabrielle (<em>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</em>), and Spencer Lord (<em>Riverdale</em>), respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We won't spoil these characters' roles in The Last of Us Part II, which is likely to match their roles in HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>Season 2, but if you know, you know.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fans of Naughty Dog's Last of Us games eagerly await the second season of HBO's&nbsp;<i>The Last of Us</i>. The first season debuted in January of last year, covering the events of the first game and its Left Behind DLC.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2023/01/27/hbos-the-last-of-us-will-return-for-a-season-2">HBO quickly confirmed the show would be getting a second season</a>, which is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/03/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-2-set-to-premiere-in-2025">set to premiere next year</a>.</p>

            <p>
Final Fantasy 14 is getting an official TTRPG, but it's already sold out and set to receive a second print run.
</p>
<p>
The tabletop game based on the MMORPG was announced last September and is based on the base game A Realm Reborn, allowing players to take on the role of a pre-made Warrior, White Mage, Dragoon or Black Mage, or make their own character from scratch.
</p>
<p>
Its release is later this month, but already sold out and with a second print coming due to popular demand (thanks <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-ttrpg/news/final-fantasy-14-trpg-reprint-after-selling-out">Dicebreaker</a>).

</figure>
<p>
The game remains available to <a href="https://gb.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-xiv-ttrpg-starter-set---wave-2">pre-order on the Square Enix website</a>, priced £50.99. The set contains all the necessary pieces, including books, character sheets, and dice. However, it remains unclear whether the game is based on an existing system like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, or something new.

<p>
It's no surprise, really, that it's proven so popular, considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">Final Fantasy 14 is Square Enix's most profitable game</a>.

</p>
<p>
The MMO proved so popular after Endwalker's release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-so-popular-its-been-pulled-from-sale">game was removed from sale</a>. A sell-out TTRPG requiring a second print is a fitting parallel.

</p>
<p>
The TTRPG also fits with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's new strategy</a>, unveiled earlier this week alongside its latest financial report.

</p>
<p>
While video games struggled to drive profits due to high development costs and underperforming sales, Square Enix's merchandise sector saw a 52 percent increase in profit year-on-year.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix will also "leverage IP across media formats", boosted by an integration with merchandise. In short, expect more initiatives like the Final Fantasy 14 TTRPG in the future.

</p>
<p>For Final Fantasy 14 itself, next expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-everything-we-know-so-far">Dawntrail</a> is set to release next month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dinkum-autumn-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cozy Aussie farming sim&nbsp;<em>Dinkum&nbsp;</em>has received a brand new update, and since it's autumn (or fall if you're in the US) right now in Australia, that's exactly what you're getting in the update too.</p>
<p>Like last November's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dinkum-summer-sun-update">summer update</a>, you can expect a bunch of seasonal changes, including golden and orange leaves on trees, as well as a brand new weather event.</p>
<p><em>Dinkum</em>'s autumn update also introduces mushrooms that sprout up from the ground around you, and if you harvest them, you'll be able to use them to make brand new recipes and crafting items.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dinkum-autumn-update-hand-trolley.jpg?itok=-LUlayBO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dinkum-autumn-update-hand-trolley.jpg?itok=CJTS6bQE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Dinkum&nbsp;</em>update isn't just bringing weather changes.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Dinkum&nbsp;</em>update without some much-needed quality-of-life changes. First and foremost, the new Hand Trolley item is available at John's shop, and you can use it to lug containers around without emptying them first.</p>
<p>If you've obtained a level 3 building license, you'll now be able to create Advanced Crafting Tables, which will draw ingredients from nearby storage chests so you don't have to painstakingly take them out yourself.</p>
<p>Additionally, Bendon says Franklyn "now offers a new contraption" that should make sorting your inventory easier, but you'll need to "give him a shiny disc" to access this ability. Bendon says he wants to leave the mechanics of this exchange as a surprise.</p>
<p>A new Wish Fountain feature has also been introduced, and it brings a number of modifiers you can use to make your island "behave" differently. For instance, you can stop animals from attacking you first, or if you're the warrior sort, you can make them even more dangerous, increasing their loot drops.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-multiplatform-plans-playstation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-multiplatform-plans-reportedly-don%E2%80%99t-have-a-%E2%80%9Cred-line%E2%80%9D-regarding-which-games-to-bring-to-playstation.871647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-multiplatform-plans-playstation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox multiplatform plans reportedly have no "red line" regarding which games could be released on PlayStation consoles, as they revolve around a simple, short-term mandate.</p>
<p>In a new post shared on <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows Central</a> today, Jez Corden revealed some new details on the Xbox multiplatform plans, which are known internally as "Latitude". According to the report, these plans have sparked a debate inside Microsoft about whether or not they are a good idea, as Microsoft is pushing for no "red line" regarding which games could be released on competing hardware, including PlayStation consoles. This approach is centered around CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood's mandate to increase every department's margins, but it may end up damaging the Xbox brand even more, especially if franchises like Halo and Gears of War become multiplatform.</p>
<p>As of now, only a few former Xbox exclusives have been released on competing hardware, like Rare's Sea of Thieves, which is selling <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-most-downloaded-playstation-5/">quite&nbsp;well on PlayStation</a>, Obsidian's Grounded, and Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush. Despite not being cornerstone franchises, their multiplatform release did tarnish the perception of the Xbox brand, alongside <a href="https://wccftech.com/xboxs-sarah-bond-tango-gameworks/">bad communication</a> and the abrupt closure of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/">multiple studios</a>, including the aforementioned Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin, developer of Prey and Redfall. As such, if Master Chief ever ends up appearing on PlayStation, it would most definitely be a massive blow to an already tarnished reputation that Xbox may never recover from.</p>

As such, developer Capcom decided to reference different real-life models to ensure it got each fighter’s build right.

These nuances are how Ryu and Zangief can both be muscular but have distinct body types, a clear example of how different training methods have different results.

<p>Despite its immense popularity within certain circles, NieR: Automata always came across as a niche, cult-classic type of game. It’s a fever dream of a game with so many unique and compelling systems, and that’s what makes its post-apocalyptic world and frantic, action-heavy gameplay so enticing. But we want more. So, is there a new NieR game coming out soon?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-we-see-a-new-nier-game-coming-soon">Will We See a New NieR Game Coming Soon?</h2>



<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nier-veterans-possibly-working-on-new-project-in-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent report</a> originally published by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/yosuke-saito-working-on-new-project-with-yoko-taro-and-keiichi-okabe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>, NieR studio veterans recently started working on an upcoming project. They didn’t state precisely what that project is, but it’s been quite some time since NieR: Automata launched in 2017. If we’re counting the most recent title in the franchise, then NieR Reincarnation, a mobile RPG, didn’t fare well.</p>



<p>While talking about his next project, Saito said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m doing various things with the idea of creating something that does not yet exist. I can’t devote my time to that fully, so most of it has been left to the staff, but it’s turning into something quite interesting. I’m looking forward to the day we can announce it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, something “new that does not yet exist” could reference an entirely new story, either completely separate from the NieR series or within its world. But he continued with the interview, stating:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now. I’ll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, sp please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. That’s all I can say for now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It sounds like it might be NieR, but that’s anyone’s guess for now. We’ll have more information for you as it comes!</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-hack-and-slash-games-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Best Hack-and-Slash Games, Ranked</a></p>



<h2 id="h-will-2b-star-in-the-next-nier-game">Will 2B Star in the Next NieR Game?</h2>



<p>Seeing as you can play as 2B in the last few NieR games, it’s highly likely that the iconic female protagonist will return. If she’s not the main character, then you can bet she’ll appear at some point in the story.</p>



<p>Of course, nothing, including story details, has been confirmed for the next NieR game, so we’ll have to remain patient for the time being!</p>



<hr>



<p>We’re big fans of NieR and Yosuke Saito in general here at Insider Gaming and are looking forward to more from the NieR universe. For now, check out what else we’re talking about:</p>

No queues, no login, no accounts. You can choose to play solo on your Steam Deck while on the go or engage in peer-to-peer cooperatively with friends from your home PC.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We realize this is a big shift, but a necessary one to guarantee that the game is around forever. This also means that all progress will not be carried forward due to saves being local and not on a server. This major change will be the basis for what we’re calling <em>Wayfinder</em>‘s “Echoes” update.</p><p><strong>One Price, Not Microtransactions</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wayfinder-Update_05-15-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Removing the online requirement wasn’t our only major change. The industry has also shifted in recent years. With more and more games coming out, they’re all fighting for player’s time and attention. Players have more to play than ever, and they’re being asked to log into multiple games to check their daily quests, look at a store rotation, and be drip-fed content. Players today are more apt to outright purchase a game they know is full of content and also respectful of their time.</p><p>In the “Echoes” update, we’ll be charging one price—$24.99 USD during Early Access (increasing upon full release). No in-game microtransactions or in-game purchases, just one price. Founders who have already purchased the game will have access, and all the exclusive items included in each pack. Our Founder’s Packs will not be going back on sale. For anyone that supported us by purchasing in-game Runesilver, we’ve converted that Runesilver into a new in-game currency used to acquire exclusive cosmetics.</p><p><strong>Major Gameplay Changes</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wayfinder-Update_05-15-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>These aren’t the only changes, though. We’ve touched every major system in the game, and as a result, the gameplay is not only more refined, but through our various playtests with those outside the studio, the game performs and plays better than before.</p><p>Some of these changes include all weapons becoming randomized drops with various slots, armor now having stats and being collectible, thousands of cosmetics and housing items available to collect, the removal of the grind to get new characters, eased requirements for awakening characters, increased housing item limits, adding four difficulties to choose from, incorporating traditional <a title="Genres > RPG [16,250 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> talents into your progression, and much more.</p><p>This update will also launch with the latest <em>Wayfinder</em>: Grendel, as well as brand-new Hunts and a new Overlands zone (three times the size of our last!) that’s overflowing with content and points of interest.</p><p><strong>When Can I Play?</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wayfinder-Update_05-15-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>While we have lots more to share on these changes in the coming weeks, we have always felt that <a title="Genres > Action [1,833 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s speak louder than words. Therefore, we’ll be soft launching the <em>Wayfinder</em> “Echoes” changes on May 31. From that point forward, all online requirements tied to Steam, including all player data, will be removed, and the game will be available for anyone that currently owns any version of <em>Wayfinder</em> on Steam.</p><p><em>Wayfinder</em> will once again be available for purchase on Steam in Early Access on June 11. These changes will come to PlayStation 5 later in the year, and we’ll keep players updated once we have a concrete timeline.</p><p>PlayStation 4 support will be discontinued, with all PlayStation 4 versions being upgraded to PlayStation 5 at no additional cost. In the meantime, PlayStation 4 and 5 players can continue to access the game as normal.</p><p>Relaunching in Early Access on a single platform also allows us to be agile and make changes at a faster pace than before. We plan to leave Early Access later in 2024, but during that time, we’ll be adding gameplay refinements based on feedback, a new Wayfinder, a new location to explore, new expanded housing, and more.</p><p>We’re also formally announcing that <em>Wayfinder</em> will be coming to <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,304 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series X|S</a> during Early Access, and we’ll provide an update on timing later in the year.</p><p><strong>The Path Ahead</strong></p><p>We know that the path to get here hasn’t been easy, and the game has had a rocky past. We also know that this wasn’t the original game that we envisioned or that our fans bought into. When faced with the reality of where we are, we saw our options as shuttering the game fully as other online games have done before or making this pivot and releasing the “Echoes” update. During this process, we quickly came to the realization that we’re making a superior game for both current and future players. We’d love to support <em>Wayfinder</em> for years. We have ideas for additional characters and new content, and we have the intent to do so if the players demand it and <em>Wayfinder</em> finds a new audience.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sony's PlayStation 5 console is heavily outselling Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S, according to Daniel Ahmad, director of research at <a href="https://nikopartners.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Niko Partners</a>, a firm that aggregates data on video game and console sales.</p><p>4.5 million PlayStation 5 consoles were shipped in the first quarter of 2024, with Sony selling roughly five times as many units as Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S console in the first three months of this year, Ahmad said. Sony's console has sold a total of 59.2 million units in total since its launch in November 2020.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1790464368494191043" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">4.

The PS4 sold 60 million units in the same timeframe after its launch, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-names-two-playstation-ceos-says-ps5-growth-is-likely-over/1100-6523439/" data-ref-id="1100-6523439">Sony does not expect that the PS5 will outsell the PS4</a> over the next year when compared to the same point in the PS4's life cycle.</p><p>The report also revealed that digital sales are up in a big way. In 2023, the digital ratio for game software sales on PlayStation consoles reached 70%--a massive increase from 2015, when digital sales accounted for only 19% of game purchases. According to Ahmad, Sony partially attributes the uptick in digital sales to the COVID-19 pandemic, but notes that players were already beginning to lean toward digital purchases over physical purchases in the months prior to the pandemic.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox's hardware revenue was down 31% during the January - March 2024 window, according to the company's recent third-quarter earnings report.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/hi-fi-rush-is-still-getting-a-physical-release-despite-the-death-of-its-developer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hi-fi-rush-is-still-getting-a-physical-release-despite-the-death-of-its-developer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="331" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Just last week, Microsoft announced it would be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/">closing <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> and <em>The Evil Within</em> studio Tango Gameworks</a>, alongside a few others, much to the despair of pretty much everyone. While Tango Gameworks will soon be no more, it still has a couple of things planned for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-hi-fi-rush-destructoid-tango-gameworks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a></em>, including its previously promised physical release.</p> <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> initially launched as a digital-only title last year, but a couple of months ago Tango confirmed it had partnered with Limited Run Games to launch physical copies. Not just for the Xbox version, but also the PlayStation 5 port, which arrived digitally this past March. I wouldn’t blame people for wondering if Tango’s closure meant the physical release would be cancelled, but Tango has assured via <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1790728899875213673" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a May 15 Twitter post</a> that isn’t the case.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you all for your continued support. </p><p>We’re working to release the physical edition of Hi-Fi RUSH with our partners at Limited Run Games, as well as a final patch to address some minor issues releasing later today.</p><p>❤️</p></div>— Hi-Fi RUSH (@hifiRush) <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1790728899875213673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true">It’s still unclear when exactly these physical versions will come out, with Tango only adding that it has one last patch it plans to release later today. Don’t expect anything major from the patch either, as Tango says it’ll just address some of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>‘s lingering minor issues.</p>
 <p data-characters="601" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true">While it remains a tragic shame that Tango’s future has been cut short, presumably ruling out any potential <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> sequel along with it, it’s good to know that there’ll be an option for those who prefer to own their games physically. It’s also a better alternative than keeping <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>digital-only, since Microsoft could wind up de-listing it, thus rendering <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> forever unavailable. It’s certainly a better outcome than the one <em>Redfall</em> is facing, since it’s stuck as an online-only game and is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-killed-redfall-right-before-arkane-could-save-it-from-online-only-fate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doomed to become unplayable once its servers shut down</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">There was speculation that <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> would eventually see a port to the Nintendo Switch, much like other <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xboxs-grounded-and-pentiment-head-to-nintendo-switch/">former Xbox exclusives </a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xboxs-grounded-and-pentiment-head-to-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grounded</em> </a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xboxs-grounded-and-pentiment-head-to-nintendo-switch/">and <em>Pentiment</em></a>. In fact, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> outright claimed this would be the case. Now, though, it’s entirely possible any Switch port of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> will be scrapped.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/15/f1-manager-24-preview-making-andrettis-dream-come-true/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/f1-manager-24-preview-%E2%80%93-making-andretti%E2%80%99s-dream-come-true.871611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/15/f1-manager-24-preview-making-andrettis-dream-come-true/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Will there ever be an 11th team of the Formula 1 grid again? Andretti is trying their damnedest to make it a reality, but in the meantime, video games are here to let us all live the fantasy of having and managing our own custom team.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 Manager 24 Preview – Create a Team, Mechanical Failures, Mentality &amp; more" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VqW2ED6_pJE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Launching on 23rd July, F1 Manager 24 will bring a new Create A Team option to the career, letting you found a brand new team to join the grid, set liveries, team suit colours, and create a new logo using some solid and pretty comprehensive layering tools. Alongside that, there’s also a background and origin for your team to choose from, giving scenarios that dictate some of the initial financing and the story that you’re telling.</p>


<p>Compared to just hopping into one of the real world teams, you’ve got a few more things to look after through each season, namely sponsors. As you’d expect, these give you a healthy injection of funding, with more on the table if you can hit your goals and targets.</p>


<p>A lot of the UI and general interface will feel instantly familiar to those who played the first two games – as with so many sports game series, there is an evolutionary approach to F1 Manager 24. However, Frontier has made some clear changes to improve and clarify the experience, which is always important for a game that’s going to be stat and menu-heavy. The financial screens now have pie charts to better show the incomings and outgoings of your money. The R&amp;D screens that show your various car attributes and how they relate to other teams now better point you toward the upgrades and areas you could work on to improve performance.</p>
<p>Alongside that is the new Mentality system, which shows how each driver and team member is doing, what they think about you and their general happiness. Are there some changes you can make to improve their mood and get the best from them through a race and season? Well, that’s the mark of a great manager, and you’ll have to make those kinds of decisions if you want to retain your brightest stars and talent.</p>

<p>Or you can look to stars of the future, with the new Affiliates system letting you sign young F2 and F3 drivers to your team while letting them carry on in the lower categories. Through this you can overlook their training and development, guiding their path to the top tier, and hopefully on to championships for your team!</p>
<p>There’s also mechanical failures that can now throw a spanner in the works for you, or any of the AI cars. As someone who lived through the tyre puncture pandemic of Codemasters’ F1 2010, I can tell you that random damage is difficult to accept when actually driving a virtual car, but makes more sense if it’s tied in with car wear, damage and more, as a way to deepen the recreation of reality.</p>
<p>We were put in a particularly extreme example scenario to demonstrate this, with both Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez coming into the Australian GP with a lot of heavy wear on their cars. The likelihood of engine, ERS and gearbox failures was through the roof here, with management the order of the day to simply try and make it to the end.</p>
<p>s</p>
<p>Both cars saw the ERS die, initially with reduced output and eventually with a total system failure. One of the pair then had engine failure reducing power, and with Perez out of the points I figured it best just to retire his car. Of course, Max being Max and the RB20 being the RB20, he was slicing through the field even while I was telling him to seek clean air and not to stress the ERS deployment. It wasn’t quite enough to get him up on the podium, but it honestly wasn’t far off!</p>
<p>Some of this still felt quite work in progress, and there’s some room for improvement between now and launch this summer, or into future games in the series. Dealing with mechanical failures is a neat idea, but you don’t get many additional tools to deal with issues. Some issues won’t be critical and can resolve themselves in time, and you can advise to avoid kerbs, drive in clean air, not use ERS in battle, but that’s the same set of instructions from last year. It would great to see some more specific ways to crisis manage, tell your team to work on a solution, shuffling engine mode and engage mitigations, just as we hear teams doing in real life. I’d even be up for a cheesy Pipe Mania minigame, to be honest!</p>
<p>F1 Manager is steadily growing into the role of capturing all the ins and outs of the motorsports soap opera that is Formula 1. OK, it probably won’t ever capture all the drama and snippy infighting that goes on (and that’s before Netflix comes along to cook up its own narratives), but F1 Manager 24 is bringing a good set of new features, requested changes, and general improvements to the table.</p>
