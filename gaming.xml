<p>Screenshots from Rare’s cancelled multiplayer title Everwild have surfaced, one report claims.</p>



<p>Revealed in 2019, Everwild was set to be the next big thing from Rare under Xbox. With multiplayer and a forest-themed premise, the game had been silent for quite some time. It was still in the works whenever asked and development had seemed to be progressing. Unfortunately, due to Microsoft layoffs, multiple titles were cancelled, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-and-xbox-no-longer-working-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark</a>, Project Blackbird, and Everwild. However, a credible report shows some screenshots of the game’s gameplay and UI that never made it to the public.</p>



<h2 id="h-everwild-reportedly-leaked-screenshots-include-gameplay-ui-elements">Everwild Reportedly Leaked Screenshots Include Gameplay, UI Elements</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/screenshots-rares-everwild-featuring-ui-gameplay-details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Mp1st</a>, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reboot-concept-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked Perfect Dark concept art</a>, the site obtained in-progress screenshots of Rare’s Everwild. In the pictures, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/screenshots-rares-everwild-featuring-ui-gameplay-details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available here</a>, there are plenty of things to go off of. We get a look at some of the menu designs and characters, which seem on par with the reveal trailer. We also see some scenery and the playable protagonist alongside a gardening-esque system. Of course, these pictures are not yet verified, so take the news with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>Everwild, last time it was reported, was in a playable state. While we don’t know how far along it was, it seems it was shaping up quite nicely. Unfortunately, we may never be able to play it, though it is cool to see what it could’ve been. Rare has only shipped a handful of games under Microsoft and, given it’s only new notable IP is Sea of Thieves, Everwild would’ve been a nice breather. It’s unknown what is next for Rare and Microsoft, despite rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-banjo-kazooie-game-is-coming-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banjo-Kazooie returning</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think of the screenshots for Everwild? Do you hope it sees the light of day again? Are you sad that Xbox cancelled it?

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has issued a fix for an issue where jump momentum gets "unintentionally interrupted" depending on what weapon you have equipped.</p>
<p>Battlefield Studios didn't go into too much detail about what caused the issue, or what weapons were at the root of it, but rapidly deployed a fix "across all platforms" so that you can now keep your momentum when moving from a sprint into a jump.</p>

            <p>Designer and creator of ToeJam &amp; Earl, Greg Johnson, has confirmed a new ToeJam &amp; Earl game is "in the planning stage".</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1o0pmea/im_greg_johnson_designer_of_starflight_and/">AMA</a> to promote the Kickstarter for his new game, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/humanaturestudios/dancing-with-ghosts">Dancing with Ghosts</a>, Johnson also talked openly about his time developing Starflight and ToeJam &amp; Earl, and teased that he was planning a fifth TJ&amp;E game, too.</p>

<p>Asked to comment on recent "whispers" that a new ToeJam &amp; Earl game was on the way, Johnson replied: "I can say that the new game is in the planning stage. We intend to make it happen.</p>
<p>"It's going to be developed by a third party, design led by the infamous and talented producer of [ToeJam &amp; Earl: Back in the Groove], Nap [Anthony Napolitano], and will be a combo of games one and two and incorporate some of the design ideas of the original game 2 that never got made," he added (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-new-toejam-earl-game-is-in-the-planning-stage-co-creator-reveals/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>Throughout the AMA, Johnson offered plenty of insights into the original development process, too, saying "TJ&amp;E was just cutting loose" after developing Starflight 1 and 2.</p>
<p>"I wasn't trying to make something that the market would want or that would sell. [Development partner] Mark was so cool. He let me run with whatever I wanted. Super supportive.</p>
<p>"We actually had two great producers. Matt Conn was the original producer, and the game never would have been released if it weren't for him, too. Matt and Nap are both TJ&amp;E superstars."</p>
<p>Matt Conn founded GaymerX (formerly known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gaymercon-achieves-kickstarter-goal">GaymerCon</a>) and MidBoss, but stood down as CEO in 2018 <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/midboss-ceo-accused-of-exploitative-practices-sexual-harassment">following allegations of sexual misconduct, harassment, and underpaying staff</a>. It's thought Napolitano alone will assume the producer's role for this title.</p>
<p>ToeJam and Earl earned themselves a cult following back in the early '90s as two aliens with a love of funk music who crash-landed on Earth. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">The new Amazon movie based on the series, announced in late 2022,</a> was also discussed, and though Johnson admitted much is "out of [his] control", he confirmed he's read the script and expects it will be animated, but it "could be a mix like Sonic, as it's primarily on Earth".</p>

<p>Avatar: The Last Airbender is finally getting a fighting game from Gameplay Group and Paramount.</p>



<p>The Avatar: The Last Airbender series, which ran from 2005-2008 on Nickelodeon, remains a beacon of animation to this day. The elemental-combat and charming characters worked then and made a huge resurgence during COVID-19. With a new movie and series in the works, the franchise is still going strong. While games haven’t been a strong suit, a new title has been revealed, and it’s a genre fans have been waiting for.</p>







<figure><p>
<iframe title="Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmBG-Bi7Dmc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://youtu.be/CmBG-Bi7Dmc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, we get our first look at an Avatar-set fighting game, simply called Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game. Along with the announcement, we see some interesting hand-drawn 2D gameplay with fan-favorite characters like Aang, Zuko, Sokka, Azula, and Toph. It also looks like Korra from the sequel series The Legend of Korra, will be present, but no characters from the show were revealed as fighters. It will launch with 12 playable characters, with more released on a seasonal basis.</p>



<p>Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game will feature movement-centric gameplay and an original story. Alongside the additions are net code and crossplay, now must-haves for new fighting titles. The game is being developed by Paramount and Gameplay Group, who helped develop Them Fighting Herds. As of now, the title, Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game, is not official and may change. New features are also set to be announced later, though no hints were given. It will release on Nintendo Switch 2, PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in Summer 2026.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2424420/Avatar_Legends_The_Fighting_Game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Steam page</a> was also released for players to wishlist the title. The Avatar series is way past due for a fighting game, so Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game is sure to hit the spot. While it’s not coming until Summer 2026, it looks like it will be well worth the wait.</p>

		<p>A brand new Avatar game has been announced, with Gameplay Group International announcing Avatar Legends: The Fighting game, with the game set to release in 2026 on PC via Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2. The announce trailer shows some of the gameplay along with some of the 12 launch characters that will be available, including Aang, Korra, Zuko, Katara, Toph, Sokka, and Azula. Aside from Korra, no other characters from The Legend of Korra were shown though, it is likely at least Tenzin will be on the roster.</p>

<p>The description for Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game says, <em>“Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game is a fighter rooted in the spirit of elemental mastery. Designed for both newcomers and veterans, it channels the energy of classic fighting games while breaking new ground in movement, style, and combat expression. Built with a focus on fluidity, responsiveness, and online integrity, the game invites players to discover what it truly means to fight with purpose. Hand-drawn in 2D, it is crafted to preserve the style and expressive animation of the original series.”</em></p>
<p>As mentioned Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game will launch with 12 characters on the roster, though this roster will be expanded through a season model. Players will also be able to select support characters that will be able to provide assistance in fights, and there will be a single player story mode too. The development team also mention a movement centric “Flow System” for the gameplay. The development team also mentions cross play, and there maybe a name change as Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game is a working title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In just over two weeks, Obsidian will release The Outer Worlds 2, the second triple-A RPG of its outstanding year (which also includes <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-wuchang-fallen-feathers-robocop-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the early access launch of Grounded 2</a>) after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a>.</p>



<p>As we get closer to launch, Game Director Brandon Adler <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v9_FNFEm0c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was interviewed by Danny Peña</a> and discussed how this sequel improves upon the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019 original</a>, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-has-way-more-expansive-worlds-filled-with-fun-stories-and-cool-stuff-to-find-says-obsidian/">bigger worlds</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-features-much-greater-reactivity-and-third-person-view-says-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greater reactivity</a>, and deeper RPG mechanics. The latter was a particular focus area, as Adler openly said that roleplaying games fans are looking for deeper games.</p>



<p><em>I would say that the biggest thing for me is that players want deeper RPGs. I think a lot of time there's the thought just being in this industry for so long, being in RPGs for so long, it seems like in many cases we've tried to smooth down the rough edges and streamline things a little bit. And that's fine for some games, but also players just really want to be able to get in there. They want to just be able to get the crunchy number stuff, but also just make all the different types of builds they can. They want all of the RPG options that a lot of times we've been kind of slowly removing or streamlining and slimming down. So I think, again, that the big lesson from the first game to the second is let's give the players those options. Let's give them that stuff to interact with, and I think that they'll be appreciative of that. </em></p>



<p><em>The Outer Worlds 2 is the first time I've been a game director on a major project. I've done game direction before on DLCs, in particular for Pillars of Eternity: Deadfire. I was working on those, but this is the first time I've had a larger project to work on. For me, it’s been, again, I think looking back toward old Obsidian games and the style of game we used to do a lot and kind of just, all right, well, how can we bring that back to the forefront, modernize a little bit, but really get back to those sensibilities of a really strong RPG that really focuses on player agency and player choice and the consequences of those things and just making sure that all of our content really leans into that like that. That’s been the thing that’s been a lot of fun for me.</em></p>



<p>Being a big fan of deep RPGs, I'm really glad about that. The first The Outer Worlds was certainly a bit lacking in this area, and the enormous success of Baldur's Gate 3 demonstrates that Adler is correct about the audience's desires. I didn't quite notice those deeper mechanics in the preview demo, but then again, that was just the game's prologue. </p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is out on October 29 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>Slater confirmed the news himself at a panel at New York Comic-Con. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/mortal-kombat-iii-jeremy-slater-writing-new-line-1236582473/">Deadline</a> has also confirmed New Line is "already gearing up" to expand the franchise.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-2">Mortal Kombat 2</a> movie was set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-ties-down-release-date-but-its-not-out-until-next-year">hit cinemas on October 24th</a>, but it has now been delayed by several months to May 15th, 2026. Test screenings have reportedly been "strong", but a busy October schedule is likely behind the decision to push back the release date to a more favourable mid-year position.</p>
<p>A follow-up to 2021's live-action Mortal Kombat movie was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-movie-sequel-on-the-way-with-a-script-from-the-writer-of-moon-knight">announced back in January 2021</a>, with Slater - head writer on Disney+'s Moon Knight series - confirmed to be handling the script. Simon McQuoid remains on directing duties after helming the first movie. To date, New Line's three Mortal Kombat-flavoured movies have generated $257.8m (£190.9m) collectively, with its Red Band trailer – embedded above – racking up a record-breaking 106.8m views in just 24 hours.</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has revealed a new fighter for Tekken 8 Season 2, and that is Madagascan Miary Zo who will be coming to the roster this December. To be more precise, December 2nd for those with early access and available for everyone else on December 5th. Miary Zo has a bit of an advantage, as she has the powers of the fighting god, Ogre, who was killed by Jin. You can check out a five minute gameplay reveal of Miary Zo reveal.</p>
<p><iframe title="TEKKEN 8 — Miary Zo Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7y2eDbqONc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the gameplay trailer, you can see Miary Zo uses martial arts like capoeira and involves parkour too. In addition, Miary Zo has the ability to summon a staff to help pull off additional moves as well as use that power to use moves based upon the animals she has studied through her life to learn moves from.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/23/tekken-8-review/">Tekken 8 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tekken 8 review, Nick said, <em>“Tekken 8 has started 2024 off with a bang, proving once again why this fighting series is great! It’s maybe not quite as newcomer friendly as Street Fighter 6, but has a bevy of modes and new tweaks that means it’s going in the right direction to be a game for all players, old and new, and will only get better over time.”</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-jackery-power-station-can-save-you-during-winter-outages-and-its-selling-for-pennies-2000634478</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-jackery-power-station-can-save-you-during-winter-outages-and-it%E2%80%99s-selling-for-pennies.1323019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter storms have a nasty habit of knocking out power right when you need it most. Your heating system goes silent, the fridge starts warming up and suddenly you’re digging through drawers for flashlights while your phone battery ticks down to single digits. The <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000</strong> exists to keep your essentials running when the grid fails, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">and it’s currently sitting at an all-time low of $429, slashed from $799</a>. It’s Amazon’s number one best-seller in portable power stations, with over 3,000 reviews averaging 4.6 stars.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious Power in a Package You Can Actually Carry</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 has 1,070Wh storage<strong> with a 1,500W continuous and 3,000W surge output</strong>. Those specs translate to real capability during cold winter power shortages: you can heat a room with a space heater, power your fridge to prevent food spoilage, charge several devices at a time and have lights throughout a house.</p>
<p>The pure sine wave AC output translates to sensitive equipment like laptops, medical equipment and modern appliances receiving clean power with no voltage spikes that will destroy equipment. You can <strong>power up to seven devices at a time with three AC outlets, two 100W PD fast-charging capability USB C ports, a single USB A port, and a DC car port</strong>.</p>



<p>The one-hour charging capability is game-changing and addresses the biggest weakness of traditional power stations: If you hear a winter storm warning and realize your backup power is sitting at 20%, you can fully charge the Explorer 1000 in just 60 minutes using the emergency charging mode activated through the Jackery app. Most competing units need 5-8 hours to reach full capacity which means you’re often caught unprepared. The default charging mode takes 1.7 hours which balances speed with battery longevity but having that emergency option provides real peace of mind when severe weather is approaching fast.</p>



<p>The LiFePO4 chemistry makes this unit distinct from more affordable lithium-ion competitors: The LFP batteries support in excess of 4,000 charge cycles with 70% or higher retained original capacity, which translates to a period exceeding a decade in continuous reliability. Common lithium-ion batteries significantly lose their integrity following 500-800 cycles.</p>
<p>Weighing a mere 23.8 pounds, the Jackery Explorer 1000 is incredibly portable for its capability. The collapsible handle makes moving a breeze from your garage to your living room during a power outage, or your trunk to a backcountry camping trail away from the power grid. <strong>Compare that to gasoline generators that weigh 50-80 pounds with storage for gasoline and maintenance</strong>, and that put fumes and noise throughout your home. The Jackery is silent as a whisper, zero emissions, and can be safely moved indoors where a gasoline generator would be lethal.</p>
<p>At $429 down from $799, you are receiving the portable power station that thousands rely on to power their homes in the winter months when power reliability is most critical. Make sure you don’t miss that opportunity before it runs out of stock.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-128gb-wifi-ipad-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-just-hit-a-record-low-while-apple-keeps-it-full-price-2000634474</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-128gb-wifi-ipad-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-just-hit-a-record-low-while-apple-keeps-it-full-price.1323016/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s something about owning an iPad that feels like stepping into the Apple ecosystem the right way. It’s the device that bridges the gap between your phone and a full laptop and it’s perfect for taking notes in class, watching Netflix in bed or getting actual work done without lugging around a heavy machine. The problem has always been the price tag that comes with that Apple polish.</p>
<p>Right now, though, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Amazon has slashed the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip, 128GB storage and WiFi option down to $279 from $349</a>, and this is a very rare opportunity. Apple doesn’t love discounts and you won’t find this price on their official website where it’s still sitting at full retail.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A More Balanced Power and Portability</h2>
<p>A16 chip on this iPad is the same processor that was used to power the iPhone 14 Pro so you have f<strong>lagship power in a tablet form</strong>. The processor handles intensive processes like Lightroom photo editing, iMovie video editing or multitasking with dozens of apps without skipping a beat or lagging behind. 6<strong>-core CPU and 5-core GPU deliver seamless power across everything</strong> from casual web surfing to CPU-intensive creative work.</p>
<p>The <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display offers a 2388 x 1668-pixel resolution</strong> or 264 pixels per inch. Text is clear and readable, colors spring to life with precision and the True Tone technology dynamically adjusts the white point to complement your environment lighting. That means the screen appears natural under direct sunlight, soft interior lighting or the bluish tint of night. The full P3 wide color gamut is also incorporated into this display, so photos and videos are shown their full complement of colors instead of the squeezed palette found on lower-end tablets.</p>



<p>Touch ID built into the top button gives you <strong>secure and one-touch access to your iPad</strong>. A press of your finger and you’re in, no typing passwords or remembering complex passwords required. And yes, even for making App Store purchases and confirming payment methods, and offers a sense of security that feels convenient.</p>
<p>The 12MP rear and 12MP ultra-wide-angle front camera are found on the landscape edge of the device: That placement of the front camera is smarter than that might sound because if you are holding the iPad in landscape to Zoom or FaceTime, the camera is centered above the display rather than awkwardly positioned off to the side. The Center Stage feature uses machine learning to zoom and pan automatically during Zoom or FaceTime calls, and keeps you in the picture as you move around.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi 6 capabilities translate to faster wireless throughput and higher throughput in busy network scenarios such as college campuses or busy coffee shops where dozens of devices are competing with each other for bandwidth. Greater efficiency translates to greater battery life with ratings by Apple at a full day of use. In the real world, that t<strong>ranslates to up to 10 hours of video playback</strong> or web surfing per recharge cycle.</p>
<p>At $279, we are getting the iPad experience at a price that at long last makes sense, and with Apple’s typical reluctance to depreciate their merchandise, this deal will not last long.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-is-going-nuts-the-macbook-air-2025-is-now-cheaper-than-a-random-mid-range-windows-laptop-2000634464</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-is-going-nuts-the-macbook-air-2025-is-now-cheaper-than-a-random-mid-range-windows-laptop.1322995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You know that feeling when you walk past an Apple Store and imagine what it would be like to own one of those sleek MacBooks but then you remember your budget and keep walking? That mental barrier just got a lot easier to cross: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">brand-new 2025 MacBook Air with the M4 chip and 256GB storage is currently $799 on Amazon, down from $999</a>. We’ve n<strong>ever seen a MacBook this new drop this low</strong> and even older models never hit prices like this.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This MacBook Air Is a Game Changer for Average Users</h2>
<p>The 2025 MacBook Air answers a question that has been plaguing laptop shoppers for years: how do you achieve a machine that is powerful enough to do actual work, thin enough to take everywhere with you and runs cool enough that sitting on your lap won’t make you feel as though you are holding a space heater? The M4 chip does them all with ease. <strong>Built on a 3-nanometer process</strong>, this chip packs serious power.</p>
<p>The<strong> 13.6-inch Liquid Retina screen puts a 2560×1664-pixel</strong> <strong>resolution</strong> at your fingertips, translating to very clear text and rich color. The screen is able to reproduce more than a billion colors and 500 nits brightness so you can really see what you are doing even next to a sunny window. The thin-bezel design uses the minimum amount of physical space to achieve maximum screen area without bulking up the laptop itself.</p>



<p>Apple has <strong>boosted the base level RAM to 16GB of unified memory</strong> for this refresh that is a notable increase from the 8GB that previous base levels shipped with. Unified memory is not the same as regular RAM as the CPU and GPU share the same pool of resources and allows for faster access to data and easier multitasking. In everyday experience, that translates to the ability to edit photos in Adobe Lightroom while keeping open Spotify, Slack, and Safari with dozens of tabs without the stuttering that is otherwise a given. The<strong> 256GB SSD is quick storage for your most critical files and apps</strong>.</p>
<p>The 12MP Center Stage camera is a nice touch that alters the experience of video calls: Machine learning powers Center Stage to zoom and pan dynamically and keeps you in-frame no matter where you move. If you are the type that gestures with their hands or moves back and forth in their seat during long Zoom calls, this camera moves with a silky-smooth flow that keeps you in-frame at all times.</p>
<p>At $799, you are getting the latest technology from Apple at a price point that makes the MacBook Air affordable for anyone that was priced out of the world of Apple up until this point.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Sentence is The First Game That Journalists Are Guaranteed to Be Good At]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/final-sentence-game-journalists-good-at/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-sentence-is-the-first-game-that-journalists-are-guaranteed-to-be-good-at.1322992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone knows that video game journalists aren’t good at games, right? It’s as true as the sun rising in the morning or the knowledge that it was <strong>lag </strong>that led to you losing your match, and not your abilities (or lack of). That’s why it’s exciting that a game is coming out that journalists <strong>must </strong>be good at – <strong>Final Sentence</strong>.</p>



<p>In Final Sentence, up to 100 players face off in a battle royale like no other. It features typewriters, revolvers loaded with a single bullet, and a warehouse full of bodies… Except for one person, that is. As you advance through the rounds, you have to type as though your life depends on it (which it does), and a single typo could mean a bullet to the head.</p>



<h2 id="h-in-final-sentence-a-single-tpyo-could-mean-death">In Final Sentence, a Single Tpyo Could Mean Death</h2>



<p>Final Sentence is slated to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2413950/Final_Sentence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch on Steam</a> in Q4 2025, but until now, no concrete release date has been lined up for the title. Several months ago, the game’s solo developer, operating under the name Button Mash, revealed Final Sentence, explaining why the idea of the game surfaced in the first place:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am notoriously bad at typing myself, so I searched for the entertaining ways to improve. That’s when the idea of Final Sentence was born.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Final Sentence, players wake up in a warehouse full of people, all sitting at desks topped with a typewriter from days gone by. There’s a clock that ticks down seconds, and a masked man standing at every desk with a revolver. In that revolver sits a single bullet, and each mistake could mean <strong>death</strong>.</p>



<p>As you type, the other 99 (<em>up to</em>) do the same thing, and shots echo out around the room as a fatal mistake brings them to a grisly end.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a Russian Roulette of sorts, and it could be your first mistake or your sixth mistake that sends you to an early grave.</p>



<p>What’s bizarre is that the prompts you need to type in Final Sentence appear to reference pop culture classics and movies, with lines such as ‘Press F to pay respects’ and ‘Hide yo kids, hide yo wife’ being prompts.</p>



<p>Button Mash has explained that Final Sentence uses a ranking system that evaluates your performance and lets you know where to improve, so this is one battle royale title that has real-world, practical applications.</p>



<figure><p>

Cinematic Trailer" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2mclKfAWUM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It also runs on an utter potato, which is great news for PC gamers without the best equipment.</p>



<p>Games journalists can finally enjoy a title that they’re good at, without worrying about pretending that they like games just to appease the masses.</p>



<p>Let me know if Final Sentence looks like your kind of game over on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Age of Empires Games Are Seemingly Powered by Unreal Engine 5]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-age-of-empires-games-seemingly-powered-by-unreal-engine-5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-age-of-empires-games-are-seemingly-powered-by-unreal-engine-5.1322983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a <a href="https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1887907/Principal-Unreal-Engineer%2C-Gameplay---World's-Edge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job listing posted this week</a>, a new Age of Empires game is in development at World's Edge. This, by itself, is no big surprise, since Microsoft's historic real-time strategy franchise has enjoyed a quiet renaissance in the last few years. Between 2018 and 2024, all previous installments have received their own Definitive Editions and/or remasters, of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Age of Mythology: Retold</a> is just the latest. Most of them, especially Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, are still getting new DLC, too.</p>



<p>However, unless they're going for a full-fledged remake of an existing game that was already remastered, chances are this is going to be a brand new game. The biggest surprise from that job listing, though, is that it reveals that the title will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology.</p>



<p><em>At Xbox Game Studios, we are hard at work continuing the great legacy of Age of Empires, our beloved RTS (Real Time Strategy) franchise. We are a passionate group responsible for this amazing franchise and are expanding our team looking for a wonderful colleague that will be responsible for planning and building our future tech stack. We are looking for a Principal Unreal Engineer with background in all aspects of Unreal Engine game development and experience leading external resources.</em></p>



<p>Internet sleuths have also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1o3ylx1/more_evidence_about_worlds_edge_studio_behind_age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> the LinkedIn page of World's Edge Principal Build Lead Engineer, which tells us that the team has been developing a triple-A pipeline support for 'unannounced titles using Unreal Engine 5', plural. This particular developer has been with World's Edge since December 2023.</p>



<p>The first candidate is, of course, Age of Empires V. The fourth mainline installment <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-iv-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did well enough</a>, receiving several awards for the best strategy game released in 2021. Its fourth expansion, Dynasties of the East, will release on November 4 (the same date as <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-announces-two-titles-coming-to-playstation-5-updates-and-expansions-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game's debut on PlayStation 5</a>), adding Golden Horde, Macedonian Dynasty, Sengoku Daimyo, and Tughlaq Dynasty as well as a roguelite single player mode.</p>



<p>Age of Empires IV was developed by Relic Entertainment. As far as we know, World's Edge is not big enough to make a new installment on its own, so it'll be interesting to see if they partner with Relic once again. As a reminder, the Vancouver-based studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became independent from SEGA in March 2024</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="e2323cab41215"><a title="Fatal Fury Special - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e2323cab41215/fatal-fury-special-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are back, back, back with another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-teleroboxer-virtual-boy">Last time</a>, it was the Virtual Boy in the spotlight, as we matched up a duo of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/teleroboxer">Teleroboxer</a>. It was two very different designs and they pulled in very different results, but the North American variant took the dub with 69% of the vote, leaving the Japanese box with 31%.</p>
<p>We're sticking with a one-on-one duel this week, jumping ahead to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-three-more-titles">recently announced NSO newbie</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/fatal_fury_special">Fatal Fury Special</a>. Originally released on the SNES in 1994 ('95 in North America), this fighter bundled characters from the series' two previous games into one 'everyone is here' package — okay, it obviously wasn't <em>everyone</em>...</p>
<p>Europe and North America opted for the same design on this one (excluding the NA variant's classic black borders, obviously) so we've got just two covers to choose between this time. Ready? Vote!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:192341 @ 1760297718 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>

<p>What's happened to classic hand-drawn covers, eh? This design pits six fighters against each other, spinning off into three pairs. It's awash with close combat poses, rippling muscles and more ripped sleeves than we ever thought possible — heck, only Tung Fu Rue has his shoulders covered, but that's only because his spectral form has the full gun show on display.</p>
<p>Throw in some lightning in the background and an ablaze series logo for good measure, and you've got a pretty badass design.</p>

<p>Do we wish that Terry Bogard and Joe Higashi's eyes were burrowing into our souls's <em>slightly</em> less? Of course we do. But there's no denying that it's cool.</p>

<p>Mortal Kombat 3, stylized as Mortal Kombat III, is now greenlit at Warner Bros and New Line, according to the screenwriter.</p>



<p>The Mortal Kombat film series is rather new, starting in 2021. The newest entry, Mortal Kombat II, is currently in post-production, having been delayed to May 15th, 2026. However, it seems the reception from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-mortal-kombat-2-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its huge red-band trailer</a> was enough to get another entry going before the sequel hits theaters.</p>



<h2 id="h-mortal-kombat-3-confirmed-by-screenwriter-at-comic-con">Mortal Kombat 3 Confirmed by Screenwriter at Comic-Con</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Jeremy Slater, screenwriter for Mortal Kombat II, announced at New York Comic-Con that Mortal Kombat 3 is officially in the works. Furthermore, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/mortal-kombat-iii-jeremy-slater-writing-new-line-1236582473/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusive news from Deadline</a> confirms that New Line and Warner Bros will return to distribute and produce the film. As the sequel isn’t out, no story details or casting have been confirmed. Even more so, there is no release date for the film, as it’s in the writing stages. </p>



<p>At the Comic-Con panel, Jeremy Slater stood with the cast and crew of Mortal Kombat II, like Karl Urban and Tati Gabrielle. As he was telling the audience about Mortal Kombat II, he revealed the third entry’s existence. He says,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our friends at New Line and Warner Bros. are so happy with this movie,” Slater remarks. “They are so excited. They are so convinced that there is a giant fanbase waiting for it that they have already hired me to start writing the next installment of Mortal Kombat.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a pretty good sign when Mortal Kombat III is greenlit before Mortal Kombat II is even out. While the delay from October 2025 to May 2026 is a big leap, it seems Warner Bros. is happy with the film enough to do another. The original Mortal Kombat film did quite well at the box office, so perhaps we can see the series get another lease on life in film.</p>
