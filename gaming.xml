It replaced the ARPG's straightforward battle pass system with a more confusing one that broke rewards into multiple different categories. Players have complained about fewer rewards and less premium currency offered as part of the overhauled system, even if Reliquaries do technically give players more control and agency over which rewards to target.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 x Berserk | Official Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As highlighted by Loika on the Diablo 4 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1l9hng1/i_think_its_devious_of_blizz_to_put_buy_with/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> and broken down by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/is-diablo-4s-new-reliquary-battle-pass-predatory-377282" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, the issues with the Reliquary system actually go deeper. While players can earn "favor" tokens for free while playing to unlock some rewards, the game also prominently presents the option to buy those same rewards with Diablo 4's premium currency.</p><p dir="ltr">In the example screenshot Loika gives, one set of armor can be redeemed for 15 tokens or 750 Platinum (roughly $7.50). The option to spend Platinum is featured prominently in the middle of the screen, and spending Platinum can be done without a confirmation screen. It's easy to see how players might accidentally click the wrong button one time and suddenly be out $7.50.</p><p dir="ltr">Another player points out in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1l9hng1/comment/mxcvm69/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">comments</a> how when using a controller, the button used to claim rewards with tokens or buy with Platinum actually changes. Initially, the left face button is used to "Claim" a reward, but upon pressing the button, another menu appears where "Claim with Favor Token" instead moves to a different button and purchase with Platinum is instead on the left face button. This issue was corroborated by GameSpot. Once again, it's easy to see how someone just clicking through the menus could easily spend money without meaning to.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's bundle system is also drawing criticism. Players can purchase individual premium Reliquaries separately for 500 Platinum or 1,500 Platinum for all three. However, the game offers a "Battle Pass Bundle" (confusingly named, since the battle pass terminology is no longer found anywhere else in the game) that nets players all three premium Reliquaries for 1,000 Platinum. Buying the bundle is definitely the way to go and saves players 500 Platinum, but if a player already bought one Reliquary (whether intentionally or by accident) they become locked out of the 1,000 Platinum bundle and instead are forced to buy each Reliquary individually. That means players who purchase one Reliquary but then later decides they want the others are essentially forced to spend an extra $5.</p><p dir="ltr">Then there's the Deluxe Battle Pass Bundle. One might think that for 2,800 Platinum (nearly triple the price of the standard bundle) that the number of new rewards would be significant, but that's not the case. The Deluxe Battle Pass Bundle grants instant access to an armor set already available in the standard bundle, as well as two additional rewards--a pet and a pair of wing cosmetics. That means players are spending an extra 1,800 Platinum, nearly $20, for just two minor cosmetic items.</p><p dir="ltr">During a recent Campfire Chat livestream, Blizzard stated it has heard "overwhelming feedback" about the Reliquary system and is looking to improve it, but that changes won't be coming in Season 9. Diablo director of social and content marketing Adam Fletcher further elaborated in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1kt05z4/comment/mtsld3l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit comment</a> that the goal of the Reliquary system is "to add something for all players and not just paid." Additionally, Fletcher said for future IP collabs Blizzard will look to bring "better options and value, so players aren't only given some higher priced tier options and are left with that only." That came in response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-berserk-crossover-is-a-huge-wasted-opportunity/1100-6531373/" data-ref-id="1100-6531373">Diablo 4's disappointing Berserk crossover</a>, which was largely just an opportunity to buy high-priced cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Blizzard releasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4 2025 roadmap</a>, players already know what to expect for the rest of the year in terms of new content. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">Diablo 4 Season 9 will let players craft their own spells</a>, including one <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-may-introduce-a-game-changing-teleport-spell-if-blizzard-doesnt-nerf-it/1100-6531986/" data-ref-id="1100-6531986">teleport spell that might be a tad overpowered</a>. Another IP crossover is also slated for later this year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">Diablo 4's second expansion, however, isn't coming until 2026</a>.</p>

"We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion. After much discussion within our Dev team, we've made the decision to delay the September 23rd release."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvbEnWLRo1s"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvbEnWLRo1s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Bungie continues, stating the recent Alpha test period created an opportunity for the Marathon dev team to calibrate and focus on what will make the game compelling in the survival FPS genre. It will use additional closed testing (including Alpha participants) to deploy gameplay updates and test new features as they come online over the next few months. Those features include "upping the survival game, doubling down on the Marathon universe, [and] adding more social experiences."&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding upping the survival game, Bungie plans to add "more challenging and engaging AI encounters, more rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events, [and] making combat more tense and strategic." For doubling down on the Marathon universe, the developer plans to increase visual fidelity, add more narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with, and a darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy. And finally, in terms of adding more social experiences, Bungie wants a better player experience for solos and duos, and to add proximity chat, "so social stories can come to life."&nbsp;</p><p>Bungie says players will hear from it this Fall when it can share its progress alongside the game's new release date. This indefinite delay follows news last month after an artist online <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">claimed</a> Bungie had stolen her work and used it in Marathon, which <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/16/bungie-confirms-unauthorized-use-of-art-after-artist-claims-her-work-is-present">Bungie confirmed as an "unauthorized use" of art shortly after</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn the new release date, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/12/bungie-shares-first-marathon-gameplay">check out this Marathon gameplay trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Do these improvements for Marathon sound like something you want?

The deal will result in AMD technology powering the next generation of Xbox hardware.</p><p>In a new video, Xbox president Sarah Bond explains that the partnership will see AMD co-engineer silicon for a range of devices, including the next generation of Xbox consoles.</p><p>"Together with AMD, we’re advancing the state of art in gaming silicon to deliver the next generation of graphics innovation to unlock a deeper level of visual quality and immersive gameplay and player experiences enhanced with the power of AI, all while maintaining compatibility with your existing library of Xbox games," says Bond.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOCtRanwXrA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOCtRanwXrA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Bond says this move reinforces Xbox’s mission to build a platform where players can take their games anywhere across multiple devices, such as handheld, PC, and cloud.</p><p>“The next generation of Xbox is coming to life, and this is just the beginning,” says Bond. “We can’t wait to show you what’s next.”</p><p>Of course, the big news here is Microsoft confirming another generation of Xbox consoles is in the works. Many have wondered what the future of Xbox as a console platform would be following the Xbox Series X/S' weaker sales compared to the PlayStation 5 and Switch. Combined with the publisher’s increasing focus on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service and its recent initiative to bring its exclusive franchises to rival platforms, such as Forza and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-makes-its-playstation-debut-this-summer">Gears of War</a>, some have questioned the long-term viability of Xbox as a console ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Xbox’s deal with AMD is the second major partnership announcement this month. During Summer Game Fest, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/microsoft-partners-with-asus-for-dedicated-handheld-xbox-device">revealed a partnership with Asus</a> to produce an Xbox-centric model of the company's ROG Ally handheld systems.

						<h5>Mario Kart World</h5><p><span>June 5, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>It’s been a while since Mario upgraded his wheels. To be fair, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-kart-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart 8</a> is a pretty tough act to follow, selling over 75 million copies between its Wii U and Switch iterations, but with the long-awaited launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the Mushroom Kingdom crew are once again hitting the asphalt in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Does Mario Kart World successfully expand the beloved franchise's horizons? Or does this open-world variation on the series take a wrong turn? Buckle up racers, it's time to find out...</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As its title implies, Mario Kart World goes the full-on open-world route, stitching all of its 30 courses together into one interconnected sandbox covering the usual array of biomes (city, beach, jungle, desert, Bowser’s castle, and beyond). While you’ll mostly stick to the track while racing, a new Free Roam mode allows you to go offroad and drive wherever your heart desires.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, vehicle handling feels quite similar to Mario Kart 8, with all the standard techniques, such as drifting and hitting tricks to earn mini turbo boosts, still being intact. That said, some MK8 features, most notably the game’s trippy anti-gravity racing, have been left in the toybox this time around. There are additions as well, including a doubling of the number of competitors per race (up to a full 24) and a number of new techniques. The most important of these added techniques is the Charge Jump, which allows players racing in a straight line to build up and release energy in order to jump and get a small speed boost. The boost isn’t terribly useful, but the jump plays into two other techniques, as you’ll usually need that hop to pull off new-to-Mario-Kart-World rail grinds and wall rides.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld11.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Mario Kart World’s new techniques definitely don’t come as naturally as classic moves like drifting, and most of the time you don’t actually need to do them to best the AI, but they’re fun to do and great for bragging rights when playing against friends. Perhaps most importantly, new moves like rail grinding and wall riding introduce another level of skill to a series that has often been criticized for being a bit too random, so I welcome their addition, even if you can largely ignore them unless you’re looking to dominate online.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld12.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, solid racing mechanics only matter if you have a good set of courses to race on, and, thankfully, Mario Kart World largely delivers. Nintendo has really gone all out with interesting and varied course themes, with the game’s new tracks taking you through an animal-filled safari, a ghostly living movie, and a spaceport lorded over by a giant robotic Donkey Kong, just to name a few. A number of classic courses, such as the OG Mario Circuit and Dino Dino Jungle, also return, but in most cases their layouts have been significantly updated, to the point they feel like completely new experiences. I’d be lying if I said the removal of anti-grav racing isn’t felt, as most courses don’t quite have that instant mind-bending wow factor Mario Kart 8’s tracks did a decade ago. That said, many of Mario Kart World’s courses are plenty memorable in their own right, as Nintendo has gone out of their way to really push each track’s specific theme, serving up plenty of unique sights, features, and hazards.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld13.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Many of Mario Kart World’s courses are also downright gorgeous. When the first trailers and clips for Mario Kart World dropped, there was some grumbling that the game didn’t look that much better than Mario Kart 8 (partly because Nintendo decided to debut the game with a look at one of its least-visually-interesting tracks for some reason) but let me assure you, playing the full game on a big 4K HDR-enabled screen is a treat. From the rich autumnal colors and rushing rapids of Cheep Cheep Falls, to the cloud-shrouded Great ? Block Ruins, to a truly epic version of Bowser’s Castle, Mario Kart World is a consistent stunner and never drops below its 60fps target no matter how much bedlam is on screen.</p>
<p>While most of Mario Kart World’s main courses are good to great, changes to classic modes like Grand Prix brought about by the game’s new open-world structure don’t always serve the racing experience that well. While each Grand Prix cup begins as they always have, with players taking three laps around an opening course, you’re then required to actually drive to each following course, with the first two or three “laps” of the second, third, and fourth Grand Prix races consisting of transitional routes followed by a single lap around a more traditional track.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld14.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While these connecting routes are fine, they also serve a utilitarian purpose – to get you from one place to another in the open world – and thus tend to be filled with a lot of lengthy straightaway sections. Now, in most racing games, straightaways are fun! They’re the place where you get to build up speed! But in Mario Kart games, you tend to get up to maximum speed quickly, with most challenge traditionally coming from skillfully navigating hazards and drifting around corners. As such, straightaways can sometimes feel kind of dull, particularly if you’re at the front of the pack and can’t even ping anyone with a red shell for laughs.</p>
<p>It seems likely these transitional routes were one of the reasons Nintendo added some of Mario Kart World’s new maneuvers, as finding a new rail to grind adds a bit of challenge to these otherwise undemanding stretches of straight track. That said, sometimes these straightaways don’t even <em>have</em> rails to grind, leaving you to just hold the acceleration button for seconds at a time. Now, don’t get me wrong, these transitional bits don’t <em>ruin the game</em> or anything so dramatic, but I’ll admit, while connecting all the tracks together within a larger world is a neat trick, most of the time, I’d probably prefer to just do three laps on each of the Grand Prix’s main courses as that’s where the best racing moments are concentrated.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld15.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>But Grand Prix isn’t the only big single-player mode this time around, as Mario Kart World adds the new Knockout Tour. This mode is a battle royale of sorts, consisting of a continuous race through six interconnected courses, with the four bottom racers eliminated at each checkpoint. Survive to the final four and come in first to win. It's an interesting new idea, and the fact that you always have to be concerned about your placement in the pack does ratchet up the intensity, but the mode has a few issues. For starters, the mode focuses even more heavily on those so-so connecting routes than Grand Prix, and secondly, the mode doesn't really mesh well with Mario Kart's inherent randomness. You can play through an entire 6-race Knockout Tour Rally only to be hit with a red shell right before the final finish line and come in second (something that's happened to me more than once). Knockout Tour is a promising concept worth keeping around and refining, but, at least for now, I still prefer Grand Prix, even if it has its own issues.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld16.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>So, if Mario Kart World’s sandbox doesn’t necessarily benefit its traditional racing experience, is it at least worthwhile in its own right? How does Free Roam mode stand up? You can enter Free Roam any time you want from the main menu and there really are very few restrictions on where you can go – if you see something, and you’re clever enough, you can probably drive there. As for what you actually do in the open world beyond just driving around, it’s somewhat limited as there’s no story mode nor any NPCs you can interact with in a meaningful way. Players can find P Switches scattered around the world, which allow you to tackle simple missions (collect the blue coins, drive through the checkpoints, etc.) You can also find ? Panels and Princess Coins hidden in out-of-the-way locations. You don’t get much reward for doing these things – mainly, you unlock stickers, which can be affixed to your kart but mostly act as a basic achievement system.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld17.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As simple as Free Roam is, I’ll admit, I still found myself quite enjoying my time with it. It brought to mind Peach’s Castle from the classic Super Mario 64, in the sense that there’s not a lot of structure to driving around Mario Kart World’s sandbox, there’s not a lot of traditional <em>reward</em> for doing it, but it’s still fun to do for its own sake. The world is packed with nooks and crannies to explore, tricks to pull off, and often-gorgeous vistas to take in. Are you going to spend hours straight totally immersed in Free Roam mode? Probably not, but it’s an entertaining and relaxing way to spend a few minutes when you’ve had enough of Grand Prix or battling online.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld18.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And hey, if you’re not that into Free Roam, there are other traditional Mario Kart distractions to take part in. Mario Kart World gets a full Battle Mode right from the get go, with players being able to jump into Balloon Battle or Coin Runners matches in one of eight modestly-sized closed-off arenas. Battle Mode is surprisingly old-school in its approach, but that isn’t a bad thing, as it remains good, simple fun, with the increased 24-player limit adding some intensity to the proceedings. Of course, Time Trials also return, so get ready to take on those ghosts.</p>
<p>Most of Mario Kart World’s modes can be tackled online or against bots, if you’re the antisocial type. Online play felt nice and smooth to me, and certain modes, Knockout Tour in particular, really take on a life of their own with a crew of rowdy online opponents. That said, the larger player count meant I was often left waiting for minutes at a time for a race to start (thankfully, you can mess around in Free Roam while you’re in the queue).</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mario Kart World – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3pE23YTYEZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s certainly no shortage of things to see and do in Mario Kart World, but the big-money question is… is it worth the big 80 coins? Mario Kart World’s collection of 30 courses is nothing to sniff at, but they are less than the 48 you get with the $60 Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. How much does the game’s open world count for? And, of course, we can’t pretend inflation doesn’t exist -- that $60 you paid in 2017 (the year MK8 Deluxe came out) translates to around $80 today. Personally, I’m not really a fan of breaking down a game’s worth in such a mercantile way. What I can say, is that Mario Kart World feels like a very full-featured ride, one that will hopefully end up even more tricked out as additional updates roll out. But, at the same time, I definitely understand if the game’s price tag makes you pump the breaks.</p>

Perhaps you liked the idea of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">bigger <em>Mario Kart</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/681222/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-hands-on">smoother <em>Fortnite</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on"><em>Pokémon</em></a>; perhaps you liked the idea of taking graphically intensive games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the go.</p><p>Unfortunately, the $450 Nintendo Switch 2 is sold out everywhere as of this writing, and its alternatives may not offer the experience you’d hope.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">$550 Steam Deck OLED</a> is the best, most Switch-like handheld you can buy thanks to its pick-up-and-play SteamOS operating system, its similarly decent battery life, and an eye-popping HDR OLED screen. You might even be happier with a Deck OLED than a Switch 2 if you prefer the freedom of PC gaming to Nintendo’s first-party games. But the Steam Deck OLED, too, is entirely <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck" rel="sponsored">out of stock</a> in the US and Canada. You’d have to wait.</p><div><p id="the-second-best-handhelds-just-got-more-expensive"><h2><strong>The second-best handhelds just got more expensive</strong></h2></p></div><p>If I were buying today and couldn’t get a Switch 2 or Deck OLED, what would I buy instead? A few months ago, the choice seemed clear: I would personally spend a bit more money for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the $800 Asus ROG Ally X</a>, the best Windows gaming handheld yet — and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">arguably the best PC gaming handheld period</a> once you replace Windows with the SteamOS-like Bazzite. </p><p>If I couldn’t afford that, I would have waited for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">$500 Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, the first true Steam Deck competitor authorized to use SteamOS. </p><p>But both of those prices no longer apply. Ahead of the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch on June 5th, Asus and Lenovo’s handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/682594/asus-rog-ally-x-price-hike-legion-go-s-steam-deck-oled-supply">suddenly cost $100 more</a> than promised in the US. So does their rival the MSI Claw, with both 7- and 8-inch models $100 pricier than originally communicated. It’s possible these increases are tied to China tariffs and could go down again, but neither company would tell us so. </p><div><p id="third-tier-handhelds-are-riddled-with-compromises"><h2><strong>Third-tier handhelds are riddled with compromises </strong></h2></p></div><p>If money were burning a hole in my pocket, the next thing I’d probably do is talk myself into buying a first-gen handheld PC. I’d (correctly!) point out that the original $650 Asus ROG Ally and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">original Lenovo Legion Go</a> have the same AMD Z1 Extreme chips as the newer Ally X and Legion Go S. But I’d be tricking myself into buying dramatically shorter battery life and a less comfortable experience. </p><p>Both the Ally X and the Legion Go S are better than the originals, with slightly better performance and <em>far</em> longer playtime from the Ally X’s doubled battery pack. Asus and Lenovo have made their cooling systems quieter and more efficient, the Legion’s speakers and charging are improved, and its lower-res variable-refresh-rate screen can sometimes make games run smoothly that’d be choppy on its predecessor.</p><p>In some cases ignorance is bliss; some power users would be perfectly happy if they found a good deal on the original Ally or Legion Go. But for a new buyer, the totality of these changes could be profound — the difference between “I don’t know why anybody would want a PC gaming handheld” and “where has this been all my life?” </p><div><p id="the-entire-state-of-gaming-handhelds-will-improve-if-you-wait"><h2><strong>The entire state of gaming handhelds will improve if you wait</strong></h2></p></div><p>But the most profound change, for many gamers, would be having a potent portable game system that just works. The original Nintendo Switch offered portability and ease of use, but it’s never been a powerhouse; almost all of today’s Windows handhelds are more powerful than a Switch 2 or a Steam Deck, but I can’t rely on them to wake and sleep and launch games reliably. </p><p>Excitingly, both Valve and Microsoft finally appear poised to fix that.</p><p>Valve is finally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/673114/valves-huge-steam-deck-update-is-now-ready-for-everyone-including-rival-amd-handhelds">bringing its pick-up-and-play SteamOS to other handhelds</a> beyond the Steam Deck, including official support for the Legion Go S and unofficial support for the Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally line. (But as I’ll explain, you might not want to rush out and download Valve’s recovery image just yet.)</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft has announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">a stripped-down version of Windows for gaming handhelds</a>, one that ditches the desktop in favor of an “Xbox full-screen experience” that will come to various handhelds next year, including the existing Ally and Ally X. It promises to improve sleep, wake, performance, and battery life while making non-Steam storefronts into first-class citizens. </p><p>Presumably, any major PC handheld will soon let you choose between Windows and Steam. But that’s not a reason to buy them today.</p><p>For one, it seems that both Microsoft and Valve are prioritizing their partners’ flashiest hardware launches first. The new Xbox-ified Windows will first arrive on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">a pair of “Xbox Ally” handhelds co-developed with Asus</a> this holiday season, which could suck all the air out of the room for rival Windows machines, particularly if Microsoft decides this is the moment to compete with Valve’s Steam Deck on price.</p><p>And while you can indeed install Valve’s big SteamOS update on rival Windows handhelds with AMD chips, it only fully supports the SteamOS version of the Lenovo Legion Go S at this point. When I tried installing it on an Asus ROG Ally or even the Windows version of the Legion Go S, it was missing necessary power modes to keep it from unnecessarily draining its own battery and had some bugs as well.</p><p>Here’s Valve’s Lawrence Yang to <em>The Verge</em> on the rollout plans:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>Currently, the SteamOS model of Legion Go S (dark purple model) is the only officially supported non-Steam Deck device with SteamOS. We are continuing to improve compatibility with more devices, starting with other AMD powered handhelds like the ROG Ally. Features like RGB controls and power management for the Ally are in the pipe, and will be noted in patch notes as we ship updates. </em></p><p><em>We’re looking at support across AMD powered handhelds, including Legion Go, Legion Go S + Windows, and ROG Ally models.</em></p></blockquote></div><p>Even the SteamOS version of the Legion Go S didn’t launch 100 percent baked: I keep seeing the tiny trackpad stop working properly (Valve tells me it’s investigating), and there’s no official way to control the RGB lighting. </p><p>Speaking of fully baked, it seems even Nintendo launched its Switch 2 with notable issues. We’ve heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQG7R5mcHPE">reports of crashes</a> and freezes, an issue <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fau%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-freezes-locks-up-or-will-not-power-off%2F" rel="sponsored">that has its own Nintendo support page</a>, and some (including me) have found intermittent issues getting a system to stay connected to wired ethernet. Many are having trouble <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688152/nintendo-switch-2-hdr-washed-out-bright-fix">getting content to display properly on a TV</a> without washing out or oversaturating. </p><p>It’s not clear when the biggest issues facing today’s gaming handhelds will get fixed, or how evenly distributed the fixes might be. I’m not saying that’s a reason to stay away for <em>long</em> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">nobody’s expecting a Steam Deck 2</a> or a Switch 2 OLED anytime soon, so I don’t fear that particular flavor of buyer’s remorse. </p><p>But knowing what I know today, I wouldn’t rush to buy a handheld now. I’d wait a month or three until Switch 2 and Steam Deck OLED supplies return — or at least until the future of Windows and SteamOS get a little less fuzzy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The final phase of <em>Hades II</em> development involves adding the story’s true ending and other finishing touches. Some additional details are in the in-game Development Roadmap.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luy1bWjMOeA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luy1bWjMOeA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A dramatic reading</a></span> of the new patch notes runs over 38 minutes and includes things like revamping The Flames of Ygnium for snappier combat, new final forms for Nocturnal Arms, and enemies spawning in faster during waves to limit downtime. Probably most noticeable at the outset is that Narcissus has an actual 3D model, animations, and an updated portrait now. No more being self-obsessed with placeholder art. The game’s main menu has also been updated to state that the next update will coincide with the 1.0 launch on PC, Switch 1, and Switch 2 (PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S will come later). </p><p>While <em>Hades 2 </em>is confirmed to be coming out in full sometime in 2025, Supergiant Games isn’t ready to reveal the exact timing just yet, and I wouldn’t necessarily be surprised if it slips to 2026. “We really appreciate your patience on this,” Kasavin wrote. “Sometimes the last stretch of development on a game can make all the difference, so we have always taken this phase seriously and appreciate your continued support.” We also don’t know what the final price will be. <em>Hades 2</em> is currently $30 on Steam ($27 with the current 10 percent discount), but it could go up to $40 once it’s out on consoles.</p><p>The action roguelite is launching simultaneously on both Switch 1 and Switch 2, with improved visual fidelity and framerate on the newer hardware. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-switch-2-exclusivity-pc-steam-1-0-date-1851775233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-switch-2-exclusivity-pc-steam-1-0-date-1851775233">Supergiant hasn’t confirmed yet whether that “next-gen” upgrade will cost more</a></span> or be a free upgrade. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a></span>, another sequel to a critically acclaimed indie action game, is also set to arrive later this year.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Prior to the official launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-gamestop-exclusive-collectors-edition-preorders-live-now/1100-6532454/" data-ref-id="1100-6532454">Borderlands 4 preorders</a>, most of the questions were about how much the game was going to cost. But perhaps the questions players should have been asking were about the game's system requirements. Gearbox has disclosed the PC specs for Borderlands 4, and they're pretty eye-popping. But the requirements may not be as strict as they initially appear.</p><p>The specs were shared earlier today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Borderlands 4's Steam page</a>, and the stats are reproduced below.</p><p>Recommend:</p><ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li><li>Memory: 32 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</li><li>Storage: 100 GB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8+ CPU Cores for processor. Requires 12+ GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</li></ul><p>Minimum:</p><ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li><li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</li><li>Storage: 100 GB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8 CPU Cores for processor. Requires 8 GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</li></ul><p>Though it looks like there isn't much wiggle room for the storage, the 64-bit processor, and the 8 CPU Cores, there may be some for the processor and graphics chips. As noted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/borderlands-4-system-requirements-demand-8-cpu-cores-and-8-gb-of-vram-but-the-reality-is-probably-a-bit-more-forgiving-than-that/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, the minimum requirements would accept an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, which can't support ray tracing like the Nvidia RTX 2070. That suggests ray tracing support isn't necessary for the graphics chip. The outlet also suggests that the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X CPU should be good enough to run Borderlands 4, even though it isn't listed in the minimum specs. Both lists require SSD storage between 8-12 GB VRAM for the graphics.</p><p>Earlier this week, Gearbox disclosed its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-post-launch-plans-include-new-vault-hunters-but-they-wont-be-free/1100-6532453/" data-ref-id="1100-6532453">post-launch plans for Borderlands 4</a>, but if you want the new Vault Hunters then you'll have to pay for the $130 Super Deluxe Edition. It's currently unclear if Gearbox will sell the new additions as standalone DLC. There will also be additional storylines and side missions as well Bounty Packs that introduce new areas and missions that will lead to unique boss fights and the chance to earn more loot. Bounty Packs will be included with both the Deluxe and Super Deluxe Editions.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will hit PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Switch 2</a> on September 12.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is launching a fourth battle royale mode with its June 18 update--Blitz Royale, a smaller scale version of BR with 32 players and rounds intended to last five minutes or less. While Epic Games is pushing Blitz Royale as being geared toward mobile players, the mode is playable on every platform Fortnite works on. Blitz Royale is available in solos and four-players squads, and is zero build only.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4516165-fnblitzroyalekeyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516165" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4516165-fnblitzroyalekeyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516165"></a><figcaption>Blitz Royale will be Fortnite's quickest battle royale mode yet.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4516165-fnblitzroyalekeyart.jpg"></figure><p>So how does it work? Well, it's a no-builds version of battle royale on a much smaller map than the main Fortnite island. But this isn't a tiny version of regular Fortnite Battle Royale. All players will start each match with a boon and/or weapon--everybody in a given round will get the same item--and as they survive and eliminate enemy players, they'll increase their Blitz Level, which immediately grants more weapons and gear at each level.</p><p dir="ltr">The new mode is bringing some free cosmetics with it, including a new skin, the Blitz Knight. To unlock the Blitz Knight, you'll need to either gain 15 levels once Blitz Royale goes live, or place in the top ten in 20 different Blitz rounds. There's also, of course, a unique victory umbrella glider, the Blitz Brella, that you can earn by winning three Blitz matches.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uKYynyozO8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3uKYynyozO8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Blitz Royale is not a permanent mode, at least not yet. Initially, the mode is set to last just for the next four weeks, and will go away on July 15. Though it's clear that Epic would like for Blitz Royale to stick around, they'll presumably want to see both how well it does and how it affects the player populations of the existing modes before committing long term.</p><p dir="ltr">While it'll only stick around for four weeks, each of those weeks will have a wildly different theme and loot pool. After launch week, Blitz Royale will be themed after Avatar: The Last Airbender for Week 2, which will bring back those bending scrolls that were introduced in Chapter 5 Season 2. Week 3 will be full of weapons from the main Battle Royale mode that were dropped from bosses, like Thorne's Vampiric Blade, and the TMNT-themed Week 4 will be all about punching folks, with a loot pool full of melee weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big week for Fortnite. In addition to Blitz Royale, the June 18 update includes a new Fortnite Festival Season <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bruno-mars-is-your-next-fortnite-festival-headliner/1100-6532488/" data-ref-id="1100-6532488">with Bruno Mars headlining</a>, and a permanent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-fortnite-expeditions-is-the-co-op-action-adventure-mode-youve-been-waiting-for/1100-6532482/" data-ref-id="1100-6532482">new co-op Lego mode</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/xbox-and-amd-sign-a-new-multi-year-partnership-for-next-gen-gaming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Xbox has announced a new “multi-year strategic partnership” with AMD, securing the chipmaker to develop the processors for the next-generation of Xbox devices, which will include consoles, PC, handheld and cloud gaming.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox + AMD: Powering the Next Generation of Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOCtRanwXrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>President of Xbox Sarah Bond announces the partnership and confirms that AMD will co-engineer silicon with Microsoft for a wide portfolio of devices, which does include the next-generation Xbox console.</p>
<p>This confirms that Microsoft is sticking around in the console-making business and will release a successor to the Xbox Series X|S to go up against the inevitable PlayStation 6.</p>
<p>Bond promises that this will enable “deeper visual quality, immersive gameplay, and AI-powered experiences”, as well as noting that the platforms and the ecosystems will “not tied to a single store or device, and fully compatible with your existing Xbox game library.”</p>

<p>This is largely a confirmation of the direction that Microsoft is heading in, following on from the announcements at Summer Game Fest. There Microsoft revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/xbox-just-announced-their-first-ever-handhelds-the-rog-xbox-ally-and-ally-x/">ROG Ally X</a>, a new Windows PC handheld developed by Asus and with Xbox branding and integration. They also doubled down on Xbox Play Anywhere, a scheme in which you can purchase a game from Microsoft and play it across both Xbox consoles and Windows PC… except that they now brand this as Xbox PC to unify the approach.</p>
<p>Sticking with AMD makes an awful lot of sense. AMD’s CPUs are market leading on PC at the moment and their GPUs have made great strides with the most recent generation to catch up with Nvidia in areas like neural upscaling and ray tracing. Their work is continuing with <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/337062/amd-announces-fsr-4-updates-project-redstone">Project Redstone for the Radeon 9000 series</a>, though Microsoft is obviously privvy to behind-the-scenes work being done for future generations as well.</p>
<p>Similar to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, Microsoft and AMD will co-develop future chipsets for Xbox consoles and devices – just as AMD and Sony co-develop the chips for PlayStation consoles in the last two generations. What this generally looks like is AMD providing the technology and Microsoft fine-tuning the configuration, potentially pushing to include certain key features that could be coming from future CPU and GPU technology, rolling it back into the fixed platform of a console.</p>
<p>So, Microsoft’s sticking around with a more traditional console, it sounds like, and it will be backward compatible. Good news!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-party-preview-proves-theres-room-for-more-than-just-mario-party<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Lego seems to snap into yet another genre pretty seamlessly.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The humble party game genre has connected people throughout gaming generations. And while nobody really considers it whenever a new one hits the fray, the results are usually an enjoyable time. That’s true for Lego Party, the mini brick’s seemingly successful attempt to Lego-fy Mario Party so that fans of the tiny constructables can get together in a group of four and proceed to ruin their friendship over minigames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review">Mario Party</a> you know exactly what to expect for Lego Party. A group of four players will drop onto a boardgame-like table and roll numbers to advance the requisite number of spots. Some spots will have special prizes, some will hide traps that will steal your hard-earned Stars, or in this case, a golden Lego Brick. After every player rolls their turn, they’ll all drop in to compete in one of 60 Lego-themed minigames.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And to Lego Party’s credit, the minigames is where this effort can differentiate itself from Mario Party. There are some standard-fare activities, like a game where players jump over a swinging octopus tentacle until the last player is left standing, to some very off-kilter ones. One I tried is a Bennett Foddy-style unicycle racing game where players must use the joysticks to balance atop a very fiddly unicycle and inch their way towards the finish line. We only played about eight minigames total, so I’m very excited to see what else Lego Party has in store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Lego innovation is how Lego Party leans into the creative aspect of the toy bricks. While the overworld maps are themed after fun concepts like “Pirates,” they can also be modified if certain conditions are met within the game. Landing on a specific spot will let players create unique elements to add to the map like a pirate ship that wasn’t there when the game began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visually, Lego Party has the crisp, colorful aesthetic Lego games have come to be known for, though the party game aesthetic means that these Legos lean towards more whacky designs than something I’d consider charming. That is to say, these Legos are all about being zany and loud, which is perfect for the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing with three other players (my two IGN colleagues and a developer), we found ourselves immediately sucked into its playful orbit. The goal is to collect as many Gold Bricks by the end of the game. Winning minigames on their own will only award you Lego bits that you can turn into ways to score Gold Bricks, such as movement modifiers that will help you land on the spot where a Gold Brick has spawned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’re also traps you can purchase (don’t worry, it’s not in a microtransaction way) to potentially steal Gold Bricks from other players, and unique spots on the board that will initiate a special 2v2 game where the winning team will both get Gold Bricks as a reward. These 2v2 rounds include special minigames where, for example, both players each control one half of a car and must coordinate their controls to drive to the designated goal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we did complete a small game ourselves, we only saw a fraction of what Lego Party has to offer. If the rest of the games are anywhere near as fun as the handful that we played, I can see Lego Party having the kind of addictive appeal Mario Party has had – which is especially good news for PlayStation and Xbox players that don’t have access to Mario Party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress.1221123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A solid way to judge a co-op shooter is by how many inside jokes you and your mates come up with while you play. And after around seven hours working in The Oldest House, it’s safe to say that if that were the only metric to judge FBC: Firebreak on, it would be an easy 10. Of course, it helps that the setting and the enemies you face are so curiosity-inducing. So far, I’ve encountered a sticky note behemoth, an evil drum kit, and a possessed traffic light. I’ve also carved a path through pink goop and loaded mannequins into ski lifts. Do I understand why? No. Does it matter? Not at all. With slick combat, striking graphical effects and diverse objectives, FBC: Firebreak is a first-person shooter that’s a load of silly fun with your friends. The main question I’m still figuring out is: how far can Remedy sustain this wackiness to keep me interested in the long term?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FBC is set six years after the events of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/08/26/control-review-2">Control</a>, and invites you back to the wonderfully strange architecture of The Oldest House under wildly different circumstances. Instead of saving the day as upstart director Jesse Faden, you’re a trio of first responders attending to oddball emergencies that would make an OSHA officer wince. When radioactive leeches have infested a quarry and need to be thrown into a furnace on wheels that resembles Team Fortress 2’s Payload, it’s you and your team that receive the call. And once you’ve finished your Jobsite shift, your team will also have to trek back to the elevator you arrived in and survive until it reaches your station. Hey, it’s hard work, but someone's gotta do it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FBC: Firebreak PC Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the time since Control, that game’s interdimensional antagonist, The Hiss, also remains ever-present. As such, while you’re trying to tackle the quirky jobs at hand, you’ll also need to manage hordes of possessed office employees hellbent on your disposal. While there hasn’t been a vast range of enemy types to tackle, at least so far, there is enough diversity to keep gunplay interesting. And, whether it was a glowing ghoul sprinting at me, or flying desk jockeys zooming through the sky, I found plenty of joy in taking them out all the same. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To pull off these expedition, you call in the help of two additional players, with each member of the squad wielding a specialised ‘Crisis Kit.’ Similar to the class systems found in other cooperative shooters, each kit equips you with a unique skill set that can expedite key tasks throughout jobs. For example, on the map called Hot Fix, the player wielding the Fix Kit can speedily repair the internals of a broken fan with their quick-fixing wrench, while the Splash Kit crew member can provide support by keeping them from heat death thanks to their globs of healing ammunition. Meanwhile, the Jump Kit player can sprint around activating the generators with their electro-kinetic charge impactor, using their secondary fire to rocket jump around the map and control the field. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s plenty of replayability in the current Jobsite lineup already.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth mentioning that there are no restrictions on repeating roles, and your crew can triple down on one skillset, rather than diversifying the team. You’ll still be able to finish jobs, though the approach you’ll need to take will be drastically different depending on the specific composition of your team. While the gunplay across each role is identical (depending on your choice of loadout), the mixture of your cohort's Crisis Kits do well to tailor expeditions around your team’s preferences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of how your team pick powers between the roles, though, FBC provides opportunities for each role to shine, especially as you start to level up and invest in the upgrade trees to unlock perk-based modifiers and new weaponry. As the resident Fix Kit operator and player most likely to get into sticky situations, I funnelled my Lost Assets (the currency that allows you to progress the upgrade tree) into perks like ‘Shower Thoughts’, which enabled me to expedite recovery when using healing sources, as well as ‘Greasy Fingers’, which allowed me to switch between my tools faster. While I was initially sceptical that these additions would make any tangible difference, I immediately noticed a positive change in my performance, especially during high-octane combat encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of now, FBC has five unique Jobsites to choose between, with more expected to arrive after launch. And, despite the small pool of options, there’s plenty of replayability in the current lineup already. The pink goo level, which my friends lovingly dubbed the Mr Blobby level in homage to the British children’s TV mascot from the early 90s, became the bane of our existence – primarily due to our clumsy play leading us right into explosives. The sentient sticky note-infested Paper Chase mission, on the other hand, provided the right amount of risk vs reward, and we revisited that map frequently in search of more Lost Assets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each Jobsite in FBC offers three unique ‘Clearance Levels’ that expand on the base job, and as you progress deeper into these levels, the number of Hiss agents and objective criteria increases in both number and intensity as the map expands. Soon enough, the infected office workers make way for winged eldritch horrors and tanky beasts, and your team will be forced to communicate to avoid being downed. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>FBC is an engaging extension of the Control universe.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is some reprieve from the constant combat, and in each Clearance level, you can find healing decontamination showers and ammunition bays. Though in the FBC, not even safe zones are truly safe, and these life-saving stations can also break and falter, demanding a quick fix from a certain kit or a more lengthy button-pressing session if you’re caught in a bind. Attempting a repair without the appropriate kit in FBC leads to a rhythmic quick-time event where you have to tap Q and E (or L1 and R1) in sequence without making errors to progress the meter. I wasn’t expecting to encounter a stressful rhythm game in my cooperative shooter, but I was pleasantly surprised by how it ramped up the anxiety of completing essential tasks nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps what makes FBC so morish, though, is how quickly poor communication can turn a level upside down. During one such mission, I found myself caught between enemy fire and literal flames while attempting to retrieve Lost Assets. In response to my screams, my Splash Kit teammate valiantly came to my rescue, putting out the fire and starting to revive me… that was, until a second horde of Hiss appeared, and the fire restarted without warning. As you could expect, my teammate fell to the same fate I did while trying to revive me. At any point, I could have said, ‘Leave me, save yourself.’ But, naively, despite the flames and enemies, I thought it was going to be okay. Thankfully, FBC isn’t keen on punishing you for your poor planning, and depending on your difficulty setting, you’ll have a series of lives to expend before it’s a total game over.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">FBC is an engaging extension of the Control universe, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time blasting through the Oldest House with friends in tow. Unfortunately, beyond the initial exhilaration, I was disappointed to find that I didn’t feel as embedded in the Remedy Connected Universe as I was expecting. It is the nature of the replayable co-op shooter genre, I suppose, but the story only appears in loading screens and the occasional voice line on the main menu. So far, it’s left me with many stories, but I’m still keen for a little bit more lore, and hoping that it arrives as I push deeper into the difficulty modifiers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of this writing, I’ve completed the final stage of each Jobsite and am now messing around with Corruption and Threat-based difficulty modifiers to unlock rare Research Samples that will allow me to specialise my perk build. There’s still a lot more to explore before I deliver my final review, like playing on my own and the forthcoming weapon upgrades, like the ‘Functional’ Submachine Gun that I’ve yet to unlock. But right now, despite how sparse the story can seem in moments, there’s a lot of fun to be had wrangling erratic monsters in Remedy’s spectacularly absurd bureaucratic setting. I’ll be playing more this week and wrap up this review as soon as I’ve tested the limits of Remedy’s chaotic cooperative job simulator.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sarah's favourite co-op games</h3></p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When most people say their game is retro, they mean a particular era of game ranging from the NES to the PlayStation. That timespan encompasses the heyday of pixel-art gameplay and the burgeoning 3D revolution. It's not common for games to look even further back for their inspirations, to the earliest days of home console gaming. But that's exactly what Adventure of Samsara does, and it makes for a curious blend of motifs and mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">Adventure of Samsara itself has a relatively long history. The game was pitched as a Kickstarter project in 2016, under the name <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/774101425/tower-of-samsara" rel="nofollow ">Tower of Samsara</a>. It had set a modest (and very precise, numerically) goal of $48,561, but failed to achieve a third of that number. That may have been the end of the story, as just another indie game that never got off the ground. But Brazilian studio Ilex Games continued to pitch it until landing at Atari, where it morphed into a sci-fi offshoot of the classic Atari 2600 game Adventure. Adventure of Samsara is a marriage of the two, an Atari spokesperson told me--the game is as Ilex originally envisioned it, but it has weaved in story elements from Adventure to make it part of that universe.</p><p dir="ltr">That blend of inspirations means that it carries visual similarities to an Atari 2600 game. The pixel art is large and blocky and visual elements carry a flat layer of color that looks reminiscent of those early video games, while also looking much more advanced and modern than anything the original Atari could have produced. This is a retro pixel-art throwback, but the look is striking by being modeled after and modernizing such an early version of pixel art.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bta4dx3sgYc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bta4dx3sgYc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, the movement and combat itself feels reminiscent of Adventure or Prince of Persia, or for a somewhat more modern reference point, Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery. Everything from your walk cycle to the swing of your swords is deliberate and chunky, matching the visual style. A parry system rewards quick reflexes with a powerful strikeback, which is extremely necessary given the methodical movement of the hero.</p><p dir="ltr">And within this context it's a metroidvania, consisting of a wide-open map to explore as you unlock more tools and options. I only got to play a short guided demo, with an Atari rep directing me where to go to maximize what I could squeeze out of my time with it. But I got the sense that more than many modern metroidvanias, there were dangers lurking around the unseen corners. I was warned that if I had gone this way or that, I would've met a quick end--an approach that carries a refreshing old-school sensibility to the much more guided and safe metroidvanias that we've gotten accustomed to in modern games.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Atari hooks extend beyond the look and feel of the game, though. While Samsara retains its original plan for a sci-fi story that takes place on Pluto, the partnership with Atari has weaved in story hooks and Easter eggs from Adventure. I saw one such little treat during my brief time with it, by finding a dragon hidden among the Plutonian ruins. That combination gives the game an eerie, otherworldly feel, blending genres and continuities together within the isolated landscape. It's all a promising start for a game that, nearly 10 years ago, looked like it would never see the light of day.</p><p dir="ltr">Adventure of Samsara is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in 2025.</p>

The update also includes some big content additions, including new aspects for all of its weapons, new optional dialogue and objectives for side characters, more powerful enemies in certain regions, and one special new song from the game's most popular band.

Supergiant Games states that its next objective is completing the game's true ending, adding achievements for all platforms, and doing a final pass on all of the game's elements to polish it as best as possible for launch. Despite the announcement, the post stresses that there is still no firm release date for Hades II, with word on that coming at a later date.</p><p>"Sometimes the last stretch of development on a game can make all the difference, so we have always taken this phase seriously and appreciate your continued support," the post concluded.</p><p>Hades II has been feature-rich since its initial launch into early access and has been greatly expanded on with each of the game's three content updates. It now features a wealth of content you can play as you wait for the game's official release, with GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231">early-access review</a> noting that "Hades 2 improves upon its predecessor in every way, making it a masterfully crafted sequel."</p>

            <p>
If recent reports are true, we likely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">won't be seeing Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console until 2027</a> at the earliest. But that hasn't stopped the company from teasing a couple of details - including backward compatibility and vague handheld allusions - as it announces a partnership with AMD to co-engineer the bits inside.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-next-xbox-will-deliver-largest-technical-leap-seen-in-a-hardware-generation">confirmed an Xbox Series X/S successor was in the works</a> last February, as the company rushed to assure fans - amid the start of its multi-platform release strategy - that it wasn't abandoning the console market. At the time, Xbox president Sarah Bond insisted Microsoft was "invested in [its] next-generation road map" and "focused on... delivering the largest technical leap that you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."
</p>
<p>
And it now transpires AMD will be the company helping make that bold promise a reality. Microsoft announced its "strategic, multi-year agreement" with AMD in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOCtRanwXrA">short video shared earlier today</a>. In it, Bond explained Microsoft is "investing in [its] next-generation hardware line-up across console, handheld, PC, cloud, and accessories", and would be working with AMD to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices including our next-generation Xbox consoles in your living room and in your hands".
</p>

<p>
There is, of course, quite a bit to unpack in that last sentence, starting with Bond's clear reference to multiple next-generation "consoles", and continuing on with the distinction between a machine "in your living room" and "in your hands". While it's entirely possible "consoles" refers to a dual release strategy similar to the Series X and S, it's hard to ignore the additional allusion to an Xbox-branded handheld. But whether that might be an internally development machine - as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">previously rumoured</a> - or something similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-xbox-ally-handhelds-microsoft-takes-its-next-step-towards-a-windows-driven-future">AMD's recently unveiled Xbox Ally</a>, remains to be seen. Notably, Windows Central recently reported Microsoft's internal handheld project <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad">had been "sidelined"</a> in favour of more third-party partnerships, while The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad">went further</a>, saying the project was "essentially cancelled".
</p>
<p>
Bond's spiel continued by insisting Microsoft's new AMD partnership would result in "the next generation of graphics innovation" and will "unlock a deeper visual quality". That's alongside "immersive gameplay and player experiences, enhanced with the power of AI", and "compatibility with your existing library of Xbox games".
</p>
<p>
"This is all about building a gaming platform that's always with you, so you can play the games you want across devices anywhere you want, delving you an Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device," Bond concluded. "The next generation of Xbox is coming to life and this is just the beginning. We can't wait to show you what's next."

		<p>Bungie has announced the delay of Marathon, their upcoming extraction shooter. The game will no longer release on 23rd September, and no new date has been given by Bungie for the game’s release.</p>
<p>“Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear,” the team writes in a Marathon Development Update. “We’ve taken&nbsp;this&nbsp;to heart, and we know we need more time to craft&nbsp;Marathon&nbsp;into the game that truly reflects your passion.&nbsp;After much discussion within our Dev team,&nbsp;we’ve made the decision to delay the September 23rd release.</p>


<p>“The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling—survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s genre-defining FPS combat.</p>
<p>“We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like Marathon is built around. This means deepening the relationship between the developers and the game’s most important voices: our players. ”</p>
<p>The blog post also highlights areas that the studio is looking to improve before the game can be fully released, and which will be put under the microscope in upcoming testing. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upping the Survival Game
<ul>
<li>More challenging and engaging AI encounters</li>
<li>More rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events</li>
<li>Making combat more tense and strategic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Doubling down on the Marathon Universe
<ul>
<li>Increased visual fidelity</li>
<li>More narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with</li>
<li>A darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adding more social experiences
<ul>
<li>A better player experience for solo/duos</li>
<li>Prox chat, so social stories can come to life</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bungie likely won’t give further updates on the game’s development for the next few months, as they say, “You’ll hear from us again later this Fall when we can share the progress we’ve made, alongside the game’s new release date.&nbsp;Thank you again for your patience and— much more importantly— your passion. Your continued feedback will help us make&nbsp;Marathon the&nbsp;incredible gaming experience we all know it can be.”</p>
<p>A lot is riding on Marathon for the Bungie team and PlayStation alike, as console maker looks to avoid having another ignominious flop of a live service title – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>, of course, was a huge financial write down when the game was released, quickly pulled from shelves, and shut down last year. Bungie has endured <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">rounds of layoffs</a> over the last year, following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, with numerous projects cancelled or spun-off after a couple years of underperforming profits. With the initial reaction to Marathon since the gameplay reveal being rather mixed, Sony has put on a brave face for the game’s future, but it makes sense that the game is delayed to try and stick the landing.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that a delay could see Marathon miss the boat even further and fail to capitalise on the interest that there is in a new extraction shooter.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing more later this year.</p>

It plans to make AI encounters “more challenging and engaging” and make combat “more tense and strategic.” It’s “doubling down on the <em>Marathon</em> Universe” by increasing “visual fidelity,” including “more narrative and environmental storytelling,” and will introduce a “darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy.” (Bungie may also be making these visual changes after an artist said the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668449/bungie-marathon-art-plagiarism-ps5">lifted her artwork without permission</a>.)

Yet, the legendary author who’s published 65 books and has dozens of films inspired by his imagination machine of a mind has found time for one more first: his first animated feature. <em>Lily</em> became King’s first-ever animated short, and its origins trace back all the way to his high school days.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,197585,197583" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In the pop-up-book-styled animated short, a young student named Robert is stuck between a rock and a nightmare as he has to deal with his cruel teacher, Ms. Sidley, and a large tiger named Lily in the bathroom. After his teacher berates him for choosing to urinate outside to avoid the tiger, her inspection of his claims has a devastating consequence for her. There’s no blood or gore—trademark components of many of our favorite Stephen King visual adaptations. There’s just kid-friendly horror in the Kate Siegel-directed short, which is exactly how King intended for it to be when he wrote the script according to <em>Lily</em>’s animator Pete Scalzitti, who spoke with <em>Kotaku </em>after the short’s screening at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival.</p><p>“Last summer Stephen wrote our screenplay, adapting it himself from one of his earliest stories ever, <em>Here There Be Tygers</em>, which he actually wrote when he was in high school,” Scalzitti explains. “Deep cut fans of his short stories will notice he changed some of the plot, as well as the names of the main characters, using instead the names from another of his darkest short stories, <em>Suffer the Little Children</em>. But the plot is all <em>Tygers</em>.”</p><p><em>Here There Be Tygers</em> was released in 1968 when the prolific author was only 20 years old, and <em>Suffer the Little Children</em> was published four years later in 1972, making <em>Lily</em> a sterling example of the timelessness of King’s work. The hand-drawn animation makes <em>Lily</em> feel like it was pulled from a time capsule unblemished, and also makes it reminiscent of children’s picture books. All of this was intentional, even down to the way Siegel’s voice guides you through the horror.</p><p>“Kate chose to leave in Stephen’s screen directions and use them as narration, which she discussed with Stephen. This made the film feel like King was reading us a bedtime story, which gave me my solution for how to animate this in 21 days—I treated it like I was creating a pop-up book.”</p><p><em>Lily</em> is part of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@darkcornersfilms/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@darkcornersfilms/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dark Corners</em></a></span>, a series created by Siegel and Krsy Fox, which features eight animated horror shorts meant to “gently or not so gently introduce children to the world of horror.” While there isn’t any official word on if and when King decides to drop another, don’t put it past the master of horror to dig back into his treasure trove of stories for an animated feast of terror for the eyes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Long before the Switch changed everything, I found myself more drawn to handheld gaming than the home console. I remember feeling more passionate about my Game Boy Advance library than the PlayStation 2. So it didn't come as much surprise to me when the Switch, and then the Steam Deck, captured so much of my attention and gaming time. The Steam Deck has since become my primary gaming device, due to its level of adaptability and wealth of cheap games on Steam. But even as a devoted Steam Deck acolyte, the ROG Xbox Ally X made an impression on me. There's a lot to be seen about the quasi-Xbox handheld, but it may even make a convert out of me.</p><p dir="ltr">I was able to try the ROG Xbox Ally X briefly at the Xbox showcase adjacent to Summer Game Fest. The presentation was mostly hands-off, with a brief period in which we were allowed to play Gears of War: Reloaded on it. So my impressions are a mixture of practical experience and big promises, but so far I like what I've both seen and heard.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ROG Xbox Ally World Premiere Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For starters, the actual ergonomics of the device feel very nice by default. I've equipped both my Steam Deck and my Switch 1 with third-party grips, increasing their bulk in exchange for a better feeling of holding it. The ROG Xbox Ally X cuts out the middleman and just includes the more substantial handles from the start, making it a little larger and weightier than competing devices, but no more than I've already been doing for myself with add-ons. As someone who primarily plays handheld systems at home or while traveling, I usually have a place to rest my arms while I play, so the increased weight won't be a problem.</p><p dir="ltr">The controller layout is meant to emulate the familiar Xbox controller, and to that end, it looks to succeed reasonably well. The Xbox button is no longer centered--obviously, since there's a screen in the middle--but its new placement within a ROG trapezoid shape makes enough sense. Everything else, from the sticks to the face buttons to the triggers, felt to my hands just like you were holding onto an Xbox controller, albeit one that had been stretched out in the middle to accommodate a screen.</p><p dir="ltr">The user interface, too, looks very similar to the current Xbox UI. That means the same large square icons to represent games in your library, with a sequence of panels to reach different areas of the interface. Impressively, though, Microsoft is promising that it will bring together all of your third-party libraries in one place. That means your Xbox and Game Pass library, naturally, but also storefronts like Epic and Steam. (The presentation didn't call Steam by name, but a Steam logo was prominently displayed in its slide about third-party storefronts).</p><p dir="ltr">I've gotten Xbox streaming and storefronts like Epic running on my Steam Deck, but it took a bit of setup, and I still forget which games I already own in Epic because I have to launch into its own storefront to see that library. Having all of my owned games across a variety of platforms is the kind of quality-of-life feature that makes the ROG Xbox Ally X feel more like what you would expect from the console experience: It just works the way you think it should work.</p><p dir="ltr">Likewise, elements like system performance are foregrounded in a way that feels more approachable for gamers who may not want to delve deep into system menus. Tapping or holding the Xbox button brings up different contextual menus showing things like power, RAM usage, and more. This is similar to the "..." button on the Steam Deck, but being tied to the main Xbox button makes it feel less like an afterthought.</p><p dir="ltr">When the Xbox representatives handed the ROG Xbox Ally X systems for us to demo, they were being treated very delicately, and our time was fairly short. It does feel like this is a piece of in-development tech and we were warned there could be hiccups. I didn't experience any, but the warning itself goes to show that the product isn't finalized. And later in the day when I went to play an extended Gears of War: Reloaded demo, the ROG option was just there alongside the Xbox and PS5 versions, so that gave me a bit more time with it.</p><p dir="ltr">Gears of War: Reloaded is, at its heart, still a game from the Xbox 360 era, but it's gotten a series of visual improvements that really stand out when shown side by side to the original. Everything is cleaner, and while the world is still grim, both Ultimate Edition and Reloaded have made it less muddy and brown. So it's hard to know how this should be judged as a benchmark compared to more modern performance-pressing games like Cyberpunk 2077. But the game looked and ran beautifully, and on top of that, the fan was nice and quiet.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a lot of unknown elements to the ROG Xbox Ally X, not least of all being its price tag. The 2024 Rog Ally X, sans Xbox elements, starts at a whopping $900, so we can probably expect the ROG Xbox Ally X to demand a similar price tag, if not more. Still, my brief hands-on did something that I haven't experienced since falling in love with my Steam Deck in 2022. It made me feel jealous.</p>

                <p>Battlefield 2042 was released back in 2021, but it's still getting new DLC, and the newest batch of add-on content is a crossover with another popular EA franchise: Mass Effect.</p><p>The Galactic and the Scoped &amp; Dropped bundles are now available to purchase in Battlefield 2042. They include new cosmetics that make your character look like a soldier from the Mass Effect series. These items came to Battlefield 2042 as part of the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-8-9-0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8.9.0 update</a> that arrived today, June 17.</p><p>The Galactic bundle costs 1750 BFC and the Scoped &amp; Dropped bundle is priced at 2,000 BFC. Alternatively, players can buy them together in the Citadel bundle for 3,000 BFC, which represents a savings compared to buying them individually. BFC can be purchased with real money or earned by progressing through Battlefield 2042's battle pass.</p><p>Battlefield 2042 is also rolling out a mode called "Conquest Ascension," which is inspired by Mass Effect. "<span>Rise above the rest and train for a new century of warfare. Use Ascension tactics with added crawl and squad spectating mechanics to assure the future for humanity that any commander would be proud of," reads a line from its description.</span></p><p>Before this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-crosses-over-with-dead-space-bringing-necromorphs-to-the-military-fps/1100-6524681/" data-ref-id="1100-6524681">Battlefield 2042 had a crossover with EA's Dead Space franchise in 2024.</a></p><p>While there are still people playing Battlefield 2042, many are eagerly awaiting the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, or whatever the next entry in the series is called. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reveal-still-happening-this-summer-ea-assures/1100-6532481/" data-ref-id="1100-6532481">EA will officially reveal the game this summer</a>, but it remains to be seen exactly when that might happen.</p><p>As for the Mass Effect franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">BioWare is now working on the next game</a>, while a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-show-brings-on-one-of-its-most-important-creative-roles-report/1100-6532187/" data-ref-id="1100-6532187">Mass Effect TV series is also in the works. </a></p>

                <p>One of the Switch 2's features is a much-improved kickstand, providing a more sturdy and durable way of propping the screen up in comparison with the original Switch. Some Switch 2 owners have realized that this kickstand can essentially be used as a mounting arm, leading to the creation of ways to attach the consoles to increasingly ridiculous places.</p><p>Some of these mounting methods are genuinely cool and useful, such as clamping the kickstand in between a tray table and a seatback in an airplane seat, as shown by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l9rqno/new_use_for_the_switch_2_kickstand_on_a_plane/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/NintendoSwitch2 user Lokeze</a>. While many people will have no problems using the Switch 2 on a tray table, having the screen higher up and further away might be slightly more comfortable.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/player-finds-new-way-to-use-the-nintendo-switch-2-on-a-steering-wheel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Soup</a> reported, though, there are also some people coming up with downright dangerous places to mount the console. One player figured out how to attach it to a car steering wheel--leading to a "setup" that, if driving, is almost certainly illegal throughout the United States and is definitely not something to try. I can imagine that it might be useful if you find yourself sitting in the driver's seat while parked for a long period of time, such as waiting in an airport cell phone lot... But be 100% certain that the car is not moving if you decide to check this out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4515996-new-hollow-kickstand-is-perfect-for-car-mode-v0-22tuub5a9b7f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4515996" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4515996-new-hollow-kickstand-is-perfect-for-car-mode-v0-22tuub5a9b7f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4515996"></a><figcaption>Don't try this while moving.

Booo!</p>
<p>However, there's a silver lining — it's also getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Switch 2 Version</a>. The catch is that Switch 2 version is a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a> release. <em>Sigh</em>.</p>
<p>Confirmed for a Western release back in March 2025, Trails Beyond the Horizon is the 13th entry in the long-running series that started back with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">Trails in the Sky</a> in 2004 — which, coincidentally, is getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">remake in September</a>, published by GungHo.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067owxipj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>NIS America also revealed <a href="https://store.nisamerica.com/products/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon?variant=42117184127024">its store-exclusive Limited Edition</a> for the game; it'll cost $99.99 on Switch, and $109.99 on Switch 2.</p>

<p>The Game-Key Card part <em>is</em> disappointing, but we're looking forward to seeing how the game looks and runs on the newer console, at the very least. It doesn't look like this is a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, so we don't know if there's an upgrade path, but <em>hopefully</em> there will be a way for fans to have that physical and have the Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>Plus, the delay gives fans (like this writer) a chance to catch up on the series, especially with Trails in the Sky and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_vs_trails_in_the_sky_alternative_saga">Ys vs. Trails</a> spin-off coming out this year.</p>
