<p>Launching in Japan next month</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c9f951f7c1376"><a title="Sakurai Manga" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c9f951f7c1376/sakurai-manga.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/images/202510/55235/506461">East Press / Famitsu</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>After <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> streams, Direct presentations and more YouTube uploads than we can count, we'd wager that you probably have a pretty good understanding of who Masahiro Sakurai is by this point. But seeing his life story told through a manga? Now that's new (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-manga-based-on-the-life-of-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-is-out-next-month/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55235">Famitsu</a> has revealed that the legendary creator of <strong>Kirby</strong> and Smash will soon have his very own manga biography, titled "Masahiro Sakurai: Making the World More Fun with Games' (via Google Translate). The book, on which Sakurai has lent a helping hand, traces his life from a childhood passion for gaming, through the creation of Kirby and Sora, and up to the present day. There's even a conclusion that Sakurai himself appears to have written.</p>
<p>According to Famitsu, the manga's six chapters are titled as follows (again, via Translate):</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1: "Boy Sakurai and Games"</li>
<li>Chapter 2: "The Birth of Kirby of the Stars!"</li>
<li>Chapter 3: "The Beginning of the Great Battle"</li>
<li>Chapter 4: "Sora Limited Company Established!"</li>
<li>Chapter 5: "Inheritance"</li>
<li>Chapter 6: "A Light for the Future"</li>
</ul>
<p>The book will launch in Japan on 18th November for 1,430 yen (roughly Â£7 / $9), and while an English translation hasn't been announced at the time of writing, Famitsu has revealed a peek at the following three pages:</p>

<p>Sakurai's YouTube channel provided us with an unparalleled look into the developer's mind, so we're not exactly sure what else there is to know. That said, a manga biography wouldn't have made our bingo card any time soon, so it sure is a cool announcement.</p>
<p>The next time we see Sakurai will likely be in his second <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Direct, which was teased last month. The pink puffball's upcoming racer arrives on Switch 2 on 20th November, so there's only so many weeks left for another info dump from Sakurai himself. Keep those eyes peeled for a Direct announcement!</p>

                <p>Two prominent video game industry veterans have voiced their opinions on AI, with both people--Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield--declaring that AI should not be feared but embraced.</p><p>Kojima, for his part, said AI is already used in a lot of creative work to "come up with ideas." But Kojima himself sees AI "as more of a friend." Kojima said he would use AI to "boost efficiency" but that he himself would continue to "lead the creative part" of game development.</p><p>"I'd like AI to handle the tedious tasks that would lower cost and cut down on time. It's more like co-creating with AI instead of just using it," he told <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPECvLZjFzO/?igsh=MWp2Y25jcHV1djZvMA%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired.</a> "I see a future where I stay one step ahead; creating together with AI."</p><p>Another game developer who talked about AI recently was Schofield, the Dead Space co-creator and Call of Duty veteran. He said at Gamescom Asia this week that he's been tinkering around with generative AI for two years and maintains that it can help "fix" the games industry's issues.</p><p>"AI isn't here to replace us: It's here to make us better, faster, and more efficient," he said, as reported by <a href="https://x.com/andy_vgc/status/1978676771496063399?s=46&amp;t=KA0eXy1Spm71dnMQdFC23A" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "It's a tool."</p><p>Before this, Schofield talked about how "everybody's spouting out about AI" but he's actually doing work with it. "We're always trying to make it cheaper, more efficient, faster, and better," he told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-and-dead-space-creator" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>.</p><p>Regarding fears of job losses, Schofield said he's old enough to remember when people thought the emergence of Photoshop and motion-capture technologies would "take jobs away." However, what Schofield said he's observed over the years is that new technologies create more jobs overall.</p><p>Schofield also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_a-discussion-on-games-ai-is-everywhere-right-activity-7367994127319298049-X879/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">holds the belief</a> that the massive investments into AI companies and technologies could lead to a bubble, and when it bursts, "a lot of smaller AI companies will disappear," but the "strongest systems will remain." This is not unlike the dot-com bubble, when many internet companies scaled back or went out of business, but those left standing thrived and helped shape the internet of today.</p><p>"I don't buy into the idea that AI will permanently take jobs away. Disruption in the short term? Yes. It hurts. But history shows us that every major technological leap creates whole new industries, opportunities, and specialists," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_a-discussion-on-games-ai-is-everywhere-right-activity-7367994127319298049-X879/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said in a LinkedIn post</a>. "When cell phones appeared, people worried about operators and pay phones. Instead, we ended up with billions of devices, new apps, streaming, and millions of jobs that didn't exist before. The internet, the PC, even the automobile all followed the same pattern."</p><p>The video game industry has undergone mass layoffs recently, with numerous companies slashing jobs.</p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a> Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a></p>

<p>But you have to beat it first</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> already looks incredible, but a new trailer from IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025 showcases the awesome feature in which you can actually change key moments from the original story.</p>
<p>You need to beat the game once first, during which you'll experience the story from Judgement Day in its entirety, but once you've done that, you're free to mix things up. Doing so will actually open up new levels and opportunities, so for example, instead of sparing the police that show up at Cyberdyne, you can eviscerate them with a mini-gun. Brutal.</p>
<p>There's also a short clip in which the T-1000 impales Sarah Connor, which is obviously quite a departure from how the original movie plays out. We can't wait to what kind of opportunities this might open up for the rest of the story.</p>
<p>As long as it's executed well and it's not, y'know... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/walking_dead_destinies">The Walking Dead: Destinies</a>, then we're all good.</p>
<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate recently suffered a delay, but is still scheduled to launch this year on <strong>26th November 2025</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-15-portable-monitor-turns-your-nintendo-switch-into-a-big-screen-console-for-pocket-change-2000635990</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-15%E2%80%B3-portable-monitor-turns-your-nintendo-switch-into-a-big-screen-console-for-pocket-change.1326373/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Nintendo Switchâs built-in screen is fine for quick sessions on the couch, but squinting at that 6.2-inch display during long gaming marathons gets old fast. The <em>MNN</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/">15.6-inch portable monitor has dropped to an all-time low of $59 on Amazon, down from $89</a>, and it transforms your handheld console into something that feels closer to a proper gaming setup without sacrificing portability.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Whatâs especially desirable about the monitor in its own right, is its real plug-and-play ease: The <strong>dual USB-C receptacles let you connect your Switch with one cable</strong> that handles power and video signal simultaneously. Not a distinct power brick in play, no HDMI converter to carry around but one cable from the Switch dock to the monitor.</p>
<h2>Why Size and Portability Actually Matter</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch display produces 1920Ã1080 Full HD resolution</strong> which is an enormous leap from the Switchâs native display at 1280Ã720. Text becomes crisper, game worlds display more detail and the experience becomes more immersive in general. The IPS panel technology allows for stable colors and<strong> clarity throughout a 178-degree viewing angle</strong> so you can see the display from the side without the colors washing out or contrast changing. The large viewing angle becomes beneficial in the case that youâre playing with friends huddled around a small table.</p>



<p>The screenâs <strong>matte finish cuts down glare from ceiling lights or windows</strong> which becomes essential in rooms you canât completely control. Glossy screens are wonderful in lightless rooms but become mirrors in well-lit rooms. The diffusing effect the matte coating gives this MNN monitor prevents the picture from being obscured in well-lit rooms such as coffee houses, air terminal lounges, or sunlit hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Internal speakers reduce one cable and device from your carry-on equipment. Audio quality wonât be the same as with dedicated gaming headsets but the fact that you can have audio without the added hardware makes spontaneous gaming sessions easier. Speakers are loud enough for personal use in quiet spaces and headphones can always be plugged in via your Switch if you want superior audio or prefer the stealth.</p>



<p><strong>HDR support improves compatible games</strong> with increased contrast and wider range of colors. Games developed with HDR in view feature brighter highlights and richer shadows at the same time, and the result is more visual complexity. The contrast becomes particularly apparent in highly lit games such as Breath of the Wild or neo-noir games where atmosphere relies so highly on light and shadow interaction.</p>
<p>The monitor weighs <strong>a little more than two pounds and less than half an inch thick</strong>, so it can fit in laptop bags or backpacks right next to your Switch. The built-in smart cover shields the display in transport and doubles as a stand that tilts the monitor up at a comfortable viewing angle. Since the stand solution is built right in, youâre not searching for something to prop the monitor up against or wrestling with a standalone kickstand accessory.</p>
<p>At $59, this is fantastic value for a transportable display which really enhances your mobile gaming experience.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ego-ai-create-human-like-ai-characters-with-personalities/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98human-like%E2%80%99-ai-characters-with-memories-and-personalities-created-by-ego-ai.1326370/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today, a San Francisco-based AI company has announced the launch of character.world, an AI engine that allows for the creation of âhuman-likeâ characters with memories, personalities, and the ability to form relationships with users.</p>



<p>This technology is built on the Character Context Protocol (CCP), an open-source product from EGO AI, which allows for the seamless integration of powerful and authentic AI-powered NPCs across various games, apps, and platforms, including Discord and Twitch.</p>



<p>The announcement went hand-in-hand with the unveiling of almost $7 million in seed funding to further bolster these AI-driven creations entering the market.</p>



<h2 id="h-living-persistent-characters-who-can-make-games-richer">âLiving, Persistent Characters Who Can Make Games Richerâ</h2>



<p>In a press release, the CEO of EGO, Vishnu Hari, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Games and digital worlds have always struggled with flat, scripted non-player characters (NPCs) that feel mechanical and forgettable. EGO AI is tackling that head-on with characters who act, react and remember like real players.</p>



<p>Our mission is to move beyond chat windows and give people living, persistent characters who can make games richer, worlds more alive and interactions more meaningful.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a short video presenting the abilities of EGO AI, the company showcased how a user can talk directly to an AI NPC powered by the CCP technology, getting an instant response thatâs contextualized and makes sense. The AI NPC remembered the conversation and referred to it later, even recalling a topic when talking to the user <strong>outside </strong>the initial game.</p>



<p>Hereâs the video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="What is ego?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0dDGktWqUMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>These are very early days for EGO AI, but investors are excited about the potential. In a statement, Adam Draper of Boost VC, one of the investors in EGO AI, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What excites me about Ego is their approach to one of gamingâs biggest challenges: creating characters that truly feel alive.</p>



<p>Their foundation model is a breakthrough in AI character behavior. Weâre entering a new era where AI characters will carry personality, memory, and emotionâindistinguishable from human playersâand Ego is positioned to lead it. And Vish is the most resilient founder in the space.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an extensive whitepaper, EGO AI explained everything that goes into the technology driving these AI characters and laid out the benefits, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>More authentic gameplay</li>



<li>Automatic population of game worlds</li>



<li>Automated play and balance testing</li>
</ul>



<p>Each AI character will have a personality, needs, emotions, and memory features that enable them to feel as human as possible, and EGO AI has promised that this is the ground floor for this technology.</p>



<p>It obviously has some concerning elements circulating around it, the most critical of which is the inherent threat to human actors who would otherwise play these roles. This will likely fire up a debate when EGO AI becomes more public.</p>



<p>Are you eager to see more technology like this surface, or would you rather stick to traditional methods of portraying NPCs? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

And each time heâs asked, Zelnick dances around the question, pointing to delivering value for customers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding fuel to the scrutiny is the industry's recent jump from $70 to $80 for some games. If Nintendo is charging $80 for Nintendo Switch 2 games like Mario Kart World, and Microsoft, as many expect, jumps to $80 for its games from next year after backtracking on doing just that this year, then it's hard to see GTA 6 priced any cheaper.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans often baulk at the idea of forking out $100 for GTA 6. But according to Chris Stockman, the design director of the first Saints Row game, GTA 6 âdeservesâ to be $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esports Insider</a>, Stockman responded to the suggestion that GTA 6 will be the first $100 video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">âTheyâre the only ones that can get away with it, Stockman said. âI donât think itâs a rising tide that floats all boats. I think that thereâll be a tremendous amount of backlash if everyone switched to $100. Not all games are created equal. I think GTA is the only one that can get away with it, and I hope they do. I really hope itâs $100. I think it deserves to be $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">âThe scope and magnitude of this production deserves that price tag, but not everything is treated equally. It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them.â</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stockman here is saying the sheer scope of GTA 6 will be of a magnitude higher than any video game before it. Certainly itâs rumored to have the largest development budget of all time. Rockstar has barely shown any of the game, so itâs unclear exactly how big and varied an experience it will be. But it seems like a safe bet that barring the worst disaster in video game history, GTA 6 will rewrite the record books when it comes to critical and commercial acclaim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is the world ready for the jump to $100? Earlier this year, a $100 GTA 6 was mooted by Epyllion CEO and analyst Matthew Ball in a <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lengthy presentation on the state of gaming in 2025</u></a>. Near <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-price-many-in-the-video-game-industry-hope-for-80-if-not-100-analyst-says"><u>the end of the presentation</u></a>, Ball said that âsome gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80 to $100, breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to do $70, $70 to $80 etc."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">âPackaged game prices have never been lower in real terms than they are today â even though budgets are at all-time highs and player growth is stalled,â Ball wrote. âGTA 6 could re-establish packed video game prices after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.â</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto"><u>Other analysts have poured cold water on the $100 suggestion though</u></a>, saying that such is the huge excitement around GTA 6 that thereâs simply no need to limit the gameâs potential audience by pricing some out of the experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, recently published research claimed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-gta-6-cost-new-research-claims-100-price-point-would-actually-leave-money-on-the-table">if Rockstar were to go with $100 for GTA 6, it would actually cost the company money</a>, with the revenue âsweet spotâ remaining $70.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Price is just one of the many unanswered questions swirling around GTA 6. Another is what Rockstar plans to do with GTA Online. Could the company charge more for access to GTA Online? Will it be a standalone free download? Could Rockstar sell a subscription? Will Rockstar and Take-Two really keep GTA Online available at no additional cost, as before?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully it wonât be long before we get answers. GTA 6 is due out May 26, 2026, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You, too, can be Nurse Joy!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The PokÃ©mon world can feel a bit idyllic at times to imagine, especially when you think of the free universal healthcare via magic healing machines provided to all PokÃ©mon at any PokÃ©mon Center. Since the very first games, these PokÃ©mon Centers have been staffed by a roster of completely identical women (skin, hair, eyes, expression, everything!), all known in the anime as Nurse Joy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A, for the first time, working Nurse Joys can be a little different.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074504-01k7h8gfppvwt1x8pcq13w39ep-1760445962517.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A introduces unique Nurse Joys at every PokÃ©mon Center for the first time in a PokÃ©mon game. While the first one you're likely to encounter looks like a fairly standard Joy, every woman staffing a Center has slightly different features: different skin tones, different eyes, different mouths, and different eyebrows. They're all still in the same uniform and still sporting the same red loopy pigtails, but they now are giving a lot less pre-1980s Rockette.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074510-01k7h8kvje3ty85f9mg0h8f4gt-1760445973448.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is in keeping with one of the features I've really enjoyed about Z-A so far: its character diversity. In past Pokemon games, towns could start to look a little samey, as every character of a single trainer class would have the exact same features copy-pasted. That has started to change in more recent games, but Scarlet and Violet took a bit of a step backward by dressing most of its cast in samey uniforms, again creating the illusion that every character looked the same.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074506-01k7h8haxt6zfk1n7n6s1zb79w-1760445984566.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Z-A, though, not only do NPCs all have different facial features, their outfits can change things up a bit too. You still might see a couple of matching characters here or there, but I've spotted athletes sprinting through town in different colored workout gear, and artists with different colored aprons. It's a small touch, but it adds a lot to the feeling that Lumiose City is actually populated by real people and not a lot of weird clones.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074509-01k7h8jbfn3de0vymx10rezge0-1760445998106.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So congrats to every woman who didn't look exactly like the original Nurse Joy in PokÃ©mon Red and Blue (read: every woman), the job is now open to you, if you want it! Sorry to the gents though, as I still haven't seen any men in the profession.

            <p>
In Crisol: Theater of Idols, you fire bullets of your own blood at frenzied wooden puppets while exploring an island saturated with unpleasant Spanish folklore. As elevator pitches go, I like the immediacy of this one's trade-offs. Blood? But I need that stuff inside my body to convey oxygen and vital nutrients to my trigger fingers. Surely there are other fluids I can fill the bullets with. I get that it would prompt the less sexy kind of revulsion, but Norman Reedus <em>did</em> get away with lobbing cannisters of piss and dribble in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Crisol has a demo on Steam as part of this week's Steam Nexus Festering. Being a fan of hideous marionettes and foetid folkliquorice, I was about to download it. But then my powerful journalistic brain kicked into gear, and I realised that I'd already tried Crisol at this year's Summer Game Fest. My belated verdict from back then: the doomy circus setting and scarlet-gold aesthetics are appetising, but the controls are tanky in a way that is sometimes more annoying than thrilling. It's also a bit creaky and forced in terms of scenario design.
</p>
<p>
Here is one such scenario, which also appears in the below trailer: at one point I had to pass through a tumbledown high street area patrolled by a colossal and unkillable jugger-puppet. This objective saw me alternating between crouch-walking through the mud and ducking into shops along the route to scoop up some consumables. Then I came to a gate I had to raise by laboriously turning a crank for a moment or two. Doing this locked me in place, unable to keep an eye on the street behind. You get the idea. 
</p>

<p>
It took me three attempts, with the jugger-puppet chasing me back indoors each time. While hiding inside shops, I had the pleasure of staring absently at the creature's crotch while it bellowed hoarse threats through windows that were surely large enough to admit its frame. After 20 seconds of this, the roided-up Guignol would go back to its patrol. I guess this kind of ponderous scripting makes sense when you're actually held together by strings. 
</p><p>
Cristol's overall tone veers a bit uncertainly between Guillermo del Torrid art-housiness and House of the Dead. Still, I quite like the wincing restraint imposed by the literal plasma gun gimmick, and the associated pressure to delve around in the crannies for sources of blood besides yourself. I like the webbed and brassy lustre of the vampiric weapons, especially the shotgun, with its double-barrelled syringes. And I quite enjoy the puppets, even though they are functionally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>'s villagers in their plodding relentlessness and susceptibility to limbshots. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1790930/Crisol_Theater_of_Idols/">Find the demo here</a>.

              <p>Misplacing your keys five minutes prior to when you must go, desperately searching for your wallet in advance of a meeting, or walking up to baggage claim and questioning which carousel will produce your suitcase â these daily terrors have an easy cure. Good news is, Appleâs <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">AirTag 4-pack has reached its lowest price ever at $64 at Amazon, down from its regular $99 price</a>. Thatâs $16 per tracker which is less expensive than the price of replacing a lost wallet and the hassle of making a lost luggage claim. In the single-pack size, the solo AirTag can be found at its lowest price ever too at $24, down from $29.</p>

<p>The brilliance behind AirTags is their compatibility with Appleâs current ecosystem. Installation takes quite literally one tap when you press an AirTag close to your iPhone or iPad. The device automatically shows up in your Find My app which you can then assign a name and emoji to. No pairing menus, no setting up an account, no fussy configuration: <strong>In a matter of seconds, that AirTagâs ready to track anything you attach it to</strong>.</p>
<h2>How AirTags Tap Into a Massive Network</h2>
<p>The actual magic occurs via Appleâs <strong>Find My network</strong>&nbsp;which depends on the hundreds of millions of Apple devices globally in order to find your belongings. Hereâs the process: your AirTag broadcasts a secure Bluetooth message that can be picked up by Apple devices in close range. Those Apple devices then report the location of your AirTag anonymously back to you via the Find My network. Itâs all anonymous and encrypted and therefore no one else can see the location of your AirTag or exploit in an attempt at tracking you. Even Apple canât see the location of your AirTag or which device assisted in tracking it.</p>
<p>This crowdsourcing model enables AirTags to be extremely efficient in highly populated locations.<strong> Leave the backpack at the popular coffee shop in town and thereâs a high possibility an iPhone-carrying person will pass by the backpack in minutes and report its location without ever realizing they assisted</strong>. The network also functions when your AirTag is outside the range of your own devices, which happens to be essential in pinpointing luggage in planes and identifying things left behind while you are moving from point to point.</p>



<p><strong>Precision Finding</strong> goes one better on iPhone 11 and later with Ultra Wideband technology: When youâre near a target item with your AirTag, your iPhone can also report directional arrows and distance in feet and inches, and leads you straight to the item with remarkable precision. Take the example of searching for your buried keys in the couch cushions: Precision Finding lets you know the exact direction in which the keys are and how far away in inches the keys are.</p>
<p>Each AirTag also comes with a <strong>internal speaker that produces a tone when you activate it from the Find My app</strong>. The tone enables you to locate things in close range, such as keys that went down in the space between the car seats or a wallet kept in a coat pocket that hangs in your closet. The speaker produces a tone that can be heard in the next room and enables very swift searches compared with having to search each possible location manually.</p>



<p>Battery life is extraordinarily sensible. The AirTags are powered by a standard <em>CR2032</em> coin cell battery<strong> which lasts around a year</strong> with normal usage. You can buy these batteries anywhere: supermarkets and gas stations and so on. Replacing them only takes a second: push down the stainless steel rear and turn counterclockwise. No spanners required, no shipping devices back to Apple, no annual fees in order for them to stay operational.</p>
<p>At $64 for a set of four AirTags on Amazon, you can protect your most commonly lost belongings without spending too much money. Hook one onto your keys, put one in your wallet, add one in your daily tote and have a fourth for suitcases or seasonal gear.</p>

                <p>Veteran video game developer Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at the age of 58. Famous for his work on the Dead or Alive fighting game franchise and the revival of Ninja Gaiden in the 2000s, Itagaki's death was confirmed on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tomonobu.itagaki/posts/pfbid02kPXD7uXWaU3ZrRTXB1x2kYPH9SXjakibwS2poX8QU6oPXC7w5occ4GuidXECSUpZl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook profile</a> where he left a final message.</p><p>"Final Words, the flame of my life is about to go out. The fact that this message has been posted means that my time has finally come. I am no longer in this world--I have entrusted someone important to me with this final message," Itagaki's post read (via Facebook translation).</p><p>"My life was a continuous battle which I kept winning. I caused a lot of trouble for others too. I take pride in having fought to the end, and having followed my convictions. I have no regrets, but I am deeply sorry that I could not deliver new works to my fans. I'm sorry. So it goes."</p><p>Itagaki's video game career kicked off in 1992 with Tecmo Super Bowl where he served as a graphics programmer, and in 1996, he rose to fame with the release of Dead or Alive. In 2001, he was placed in charge of Team Ninja--the studio that he founded originally as Tecmo Creative #3 in the '90s--and he led the production on the modern-day revival of Ninja Gaiden. Itagaki also served as both producer and director on multiple games like Dead or Alive Ultimate, Dead or Alive 4, and Ninja Gaiden 2.</p><p>By then, Itagaki had become infamous for not holding back his comments on the state of the video game industry at the time, and he later resigned from Tecmo amidst claims of the company withholding a bonus that he had been promised. He'd later found Valhalla Game Studios and release Devil's Third for the Wii U and PC, but the game was met with negative reviews upon release.</p><p>After leaving Valhalla in 2017, Itagaki returned to video game development with a new studio in 2021, Itagaki Games. Tributes have begun pouring in for the legendary developer from across the industry, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milkman.bsky.social/post/3m3c3gq5q7c2k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and James Mielke</a>--co-founder of Tigertron and BitSummit--was one of the first to talk about the loss of Itagaki. "RIP, senpai. You will always be a ninja," Mielke wrote.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1978756897231798606" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are deeply saddened by the passing of Team NINJA's first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki.<br>We will carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began and continue to create games that many gamers will enjoy. <br>Our deepest condolences for his loss.<br>From everyone at Teamâ¦</p>  â Team NINJA (@TeamNINJAStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1978756897231798606?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1978728626838294647" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">No way, Itagaki-san<br>you said, âLetâs grab a drink sometime,â didnât you?<br>I donât believe it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Switch 1 was home to plenty of <strong>Warhammer 40,000</strong> titles, so it was only a matter of time before Switch 2 got in on the fun. Well, that time is finally upon us, and the first series title on the new hardware is... the classic RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>! Wait, that's not <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Space Marine II</a>.</p>
<p>Yep, there was a part of us that expected to see the immensely popular 2024 shooter as the one to lead the 40k charge on Switch 2, but it looks like we're going for something different.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is a story-rich RPG, where you'll explore the outer space perils of the Koronus Expanse. It boasts all the hallmarks of the genre, with crew-building, tough decisions that have a real effect on the story, and classic isometric turn-based battling. What's more, it seems to do them really rather well.</p>
<p>The game launched on PC, PlayStation and Xbox at the end of 2023 and, while this writer hasn't sampled it himself, it has gone on to rack up almost 15,000 '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/#app_reviews_hash">Very Positive</a>' reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/">Steam</a>. That's not bad going!</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explore the Koronus Expanse</strong><br>
Begin your adventure aboard your personal, giant voidship, traveling between the multitude of systems within the Koronus Expanse, a barely charted and incredibly perilous region of space. Despite being considered a backwater of the Imperium, this region encompasses an enormous stretch of the void, filled with dangerous creatures and prodigious opportunities for profit and exploration.<br>
<strong>Gather your Crew<br></strong>Rogue Traders never travel alone. Gather your retinue of righteous heroes, twisted psykers, and perfidious xenos. All of them are ready to follow you into the darkness between the stars. They will offer you counsel, aid you in battle, and allow you to amass ever more power. In return, you can guide them through their own personal journeys, changing their destinies forever.<br>
<strong>Your Decisions Matter<br></strong>During quests show your subjects mercy or disdain, stay faithful to the God-Emperor, or consort with enemies of Mankind - your every decision and every act, even in character creation, is changing the in-game open world and those who inhabit it.<br>
<strong>Plan your Actions Carefully</strong><br>
Slaughter the enemies of Mankind in a fully-fledged isometric turn-based tactical combat. Take advantage of cover, the environment, and careful positioning to overpower your enemies. When that is not enough - use your companion`s powerful abilities to turn the tide of battle and achieve victory even in the direst of situations. Our video game adaption of the classic Rogue Trader ruleset allows an enormous number of possibilities for you to explore.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>OwlCat hasn't provided a specific release date for this one just yet outside of the teasing "coming soon", but we'll be keeping an eye out over the coming months for more info.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sonic Rumble will finally be released next month, following a number of delays.</p>
<p>The mobile and PC party game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a> maker Rovio was originally intended for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-rumble-segas-mobile-party-game-from-angry-birds-studio-delayed-into-spring">release last winter</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-mobile-party-game-sonic-rumble-lands-release-date">delayed until May</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/angry-birds-maker-and-sega-delay-sonic-rumble-release-once-again">delayed once more</a> without a launch date.</p>
<p>Now it's finally due in November and it's "seriously evolved" over the last few months following various playtests. "This extra development time allowed us to roll out several, player-focused updates that refined the core game from the ground up," the developer said in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000209/">new blog post</a>. "The goal? A super smooth, intense, and incredibly fun game right from the jump."</p>

<p>Specifically, Rovio has updated the game in three key areas.</p>
<p>Firstly, the core of the game has been made deeper and more dynamic with iconic skills, new stages, and new game modes. Secondly, the player onboarding journey has been revamped and the UI has been drastically improved.</p>
<p>Lastly, the cosmetic and character progression systems have been updated and simplified to ensure "every unlock feels meaningful and impactful". The rewards and shop systems have also been fine-tuned.</p>
<p>"These adjustments were key in making Sonic Rumble awesome for the long haul," said the developer. "Even as we get ready for launch, our commitment continues and there will be plenty more to come!"</p>
<p>While the blog post doesn't provide a specific date, the iOS App store lists 30th November as the expected release. It's available to <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/special/register/en/?referrer=singular_click_id%3D2aecdffa-3ac6-4708-b5e2-a8d8d0794317">pre-register now</a> and will be coming to iOS, Google Play, and Steam.</p>
<p>As the new trailer (above) shows, Sonic Rumble is a battle royale party game for up to 32 players online competing in minigames and platforming challenges for rings. Think <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> with a blue blur twist - I think it could be a lot of fun!</p>
<p>This will also be the first new game from Rovio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-buys-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-625m">since it was acquired by Sega</a> back in 2023 for Â£625m.</p>

<p>You better boo-lieve it</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're after something spooky to play in the run up to Halloween this year, then you might want to consider <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/an_english_haunting">An English Haunting</a> from developer Postmodern Adventures.</p>
<p>Available via the Switch eShop now, this is a classic point-and-click adventure with retro-inspired visuals and a dark, spooky atmosphere. It kinda reminds us of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darkside_detective">The Darkside Detective</a>, which was an excellent entry to the genre back in 2017.</p>
<p>You've got touchscreen support with this one in handheld mode, but for those who prefer docked, you can also connect a USB mouse for proper PC-like controls. As for the story, An English Haunting sees you step into the shoes of Professor Patrick More, who "teams up with a deceptive medium to create an extraordinary device that can reveal what lies beyond our world".</p>
<p>In short, it sounds like a delightfully traditional horror story, and we're here for it. Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Point &amp; click adventure gameplay based on inventory puzzles.</p>
<p>- More than 60 detailed pixel art backgrounds to explore.</p>
<p>- A cast of more than 70 characters to interact with, including real figures from the period, such as the medium Florence Cook, physicist William Crookes, illusionist Harry Houdini, and even writer Arthur Conan Doyle, whom you will control to solve one of the gameâs mysteries.</p>
<p>- Inspired by the works of the greatest horror authors from the beginning of the 20th century, M.R. James, Algernon Blackwood, and Arthur Machen.</p>
<p>- Text available in English or Spanish</p>
</blockquote>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 holds its own quite well against the ROG Xbox Ally X, delivering generally better image quality than the ASUS handheld system, thanks to NVIDIA DLSS.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits"> ElAnalistaDeBits</a> compares the two handheld systems on pretty much every front, starting from general system performance before delving deeper into how the two systems handle games such as the demanding Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, Hitman World of Assassination, and Star Wars Outlaws and the undemanding Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>

<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-vs-rog-xbox-ally-x-resolution-performance-and-graphics-comparison">Nintendo Switch 2 vs ROG Xbox Ally X Resolution, Performance, and Graphics Comparison</h2>



<p>The comparison video shared by ElAnalistaDeBits gets more interesting when it compares how the Nintendo Switch 2 and ROG Xbox Ally X run games. </p>



<p>Regarding resolution, the Nintendo Switch 2 leverages NVIDIA DLSS support to deliver impressive image quality, which the ROG Xbox Ally X doesn't match with AMD FSR in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Hogwarts Legacy. In Star Wars Outlaws, with NVIDIA DLSS, the Nintendo system delivers significantly cleaner image quality at dynamic 635p resolution against the static 635p resolution of the ASUS system, especially for far-away elements, whose details are better resolved by the NVIDIA upscaler.</p>



<p>Regarding graphics settings, the Nintendo Switch 2 delivers solid results. The system runs games at the rough equivalent of PC medium settings and does so convincingly, which is still impressive, considering the hardware differences with the ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>However, the Xbox ROG Ally X has a clear advantage in terms of performance, but not as much as one might have expected. In Hogwarts Legacy, for example, the performance differences are minimal, especially in the open world, where the Switch 2 sticks to its 30 FPS cap while the ROG Ally X only manages to run at higher than 40 FPS in Turbo Mode, and barely higher than 30 FPS in Performance Mode.</p>



<p>In Star Wars Outlaws, the comparison is even more interesting, as the ROG Ally X needs FSR in Performance Mode and Frame Generation to run in the ballpark of 30 FPS at low settings, highlighting once again <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">how good the Switch 2 port is.</a></p>

            <p>Another group of workers at Microsoft-owned Blizzard have voted to form a union, with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) set to represent them. The CWA say that this union will be made up of "nearly 400" workers across Blizzard's platform and technology department.</p>
<p>Their action follows the formation of a number of other unions at Blizzard over the past couple of years, with developers on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">World of Warcraft</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-devs-have-formed-an-almost-200-person-strong-union-with-the-cwa-called-the-overwatch-gamemakers-guild">Overwatch</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-450-diablo-developers-vote-to-unionise-because-passion-cant-protect-us-from-job-instability">Diablo</a> all having recently secured representation.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to a CWA press release, this latest union is made up of software engineers, project and product managers, graphic designers on Battle.net, localisers, QA testers, and customer support staff.  It's already been formally recognised by Blizzard parent company Microsoft.</p>
<p>"Iâve seen too many of my talented coworkers leave the company, either due to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">layoffs</a>, a lack of fair compensation, or proper accommodations not being met," said Blizzard senior quality analyst and organising committee member Timothy Biley. "Iâm extremely happy that we, the workers, have greater control over our workplace and that we finally have a seat at the table to truly make Blizzard a company we are proud to work for."</p><p>"Blizzard workers in Texas are joining a new generation of video game developers who know their worth and are standing up for it," the CWA's Ron Swaggerty added. "Together with our siblings in California and beyond, theyâre proving that no matter where you work, organizing is how we make this industry sustainable for the people who power it."</p>
<p>A large number of staff at Microsoft have unionised in recent years, from workers at Call of Duty developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raven-software-qa-staff-win-their-fight-for-union-vote">Raven Software</a>, to Fallout and Elder Scrolls studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">Bethesda</a>, and Elder Scrolls Online developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-ceos-got-dressed-up-for-the-game-awards-461-workers-at-zenimax-online-studios-unionised">ZeniMax</a>. Given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">cuts and cancellations</a> the company have dished out since they absorbed ActiBlizz, it's not hard to see why folks are seeking these protections.</p>
<p>Solidarity to these freshly-unionised Blizzard workers.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/baby-steps-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps-review.1326301/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Nate probably needed a bit of a wake up call, a nudge or a hefty shove to get him out of his parentâs basement, out of his onesie and into some proper clothes, and out into the real world, but Baby Steps teleporting him out to a strange world without giving him shoes or any kind of survival gear is probably a bit much. Heck, he might actually be in need of physical therapy to relearn how to walk.</p>
<p><iframe title="Baby Steps is out now! Put one foot in front of the other  on PS5 and PC." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nu70MYCUtZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coming from the mind behind QWOP and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy â so, itâs Bennett Foddy in collaboration with Gabe Cuzzillo and Maxi Boch â you should know what to expect from Baby Steps. Itâs a game where the very act of walking is part of the challenge, and where failure will send you slipping and sliding back down like a cruel game of snakes and laddersâ¦ but without ladders.</p>


<p>Walking is pretty simple, though. Itâs not as utterly basic as in most games, and needing more actual thought than you put into your day-to-day life, but easy enough to figure out. Left trigger lifts your left foot, right trigger lifts your right, and pushing a direction on the analogue stick moves your weight and legs in that direction. Thatâs all that you need to clumsily stagger through the landscape before you.</p>
<p>You will repeatedly end up falling flat on your face in Baby Steps, whether taking too large a step and simply losing balance, catching a foot on an inconvenient tree root, or failing to find sufficient purchase on a steep, slick incline. Every pratfall sees Nateâs onesie become progressively dirtier with a dynamic soilage system that makes belly flopping into a stream or pool a nice way to clean off. It helps that âswimmingâ looks as utterly insane as you could imagine.</p>


<p>It didnât have to be this way. If only Nate had even a single non-awkward bone in his body and was able to accept the help of strangers. Thereâs something very relatable about that, of social anxiety making it difficult to interact with others. First thereâs the groundskeeper Jim, who offers to help Nate to get better equipped for his walk, and who then starts to lightly antagonise while still being about as helpful as possible. Then thereâs Mike the Hiker, who extols the virtues of having a map, of a grappling hook and more. Oh, and then thereâs the anthropomorphic donkeys who only ever have shirts and tops on. One for the jennies out there, but you can turn on a bit of censorship if donkey dicks is a bit much.</p>
<p>All of these thoroughly awkward interactions have an improvisational style to them, and thereâs an enjoyable amount of cringe, for those that like that kind of thing. Itâs very of the moment.</p>
<p>I admire the commitment to the bit â&nbsp;both in terms of the narrative style and the gameplay â and there is a satisfaction and enjoyment to be had in overcoming the obstacles and world put in your way, but after a while I just found Baby Steps becoming a massively unenjoyable chore.</p>
<p>Thereâs a whole world and map thatâs been created, filled with oddities and secrets to find, from watchtowers, to strange miniaturised buildings, fairgrounds that have sunk into the mud, but actually exploring it was the last thing I wanted to do after reaching the second campfire. Even the lure of hats was only enough to get me to go out of my way once, no least because fall off when you take too heavy a tumble, and then you obviously need to head back over and pick them up again.</p>

<p>A big part of my waning enthusiasm is down to never managing to truly adapt to the gameâs walking. Itâs insultingly easy to describe, and I can often get into the flow and rhythm of walking, but then I slip out of tempo, Nate falls flat on his face, and I spend the next five minutes repeatedly falling over until I have a hope of getting it back. Itâs even worse after tackling a section that needs precision, where I shift to much more manual inputs, whether hovering each foot over a thin plank before placing it â Nate surprisingly has exceptional balance â or shuffle stepping up a slippery incline. After doing that, Iâve got no hope of being able to walk regularly for a while.</p>
<p>And so I donât want to explore much, outside of getting a bit lost and failing to see the path ahead â though the section that leads you round in a circle for a few minutes did get a wry smile from me. When I did I found a place to grab a vase that some signs had claimed was stolen, only to smash it on rocks about 30 seconds later, or I tried to climb a swing up onto a tree and ended up plummeting into a pool that took me at least an hour to finally, painfully, drag my way back out of. Thankfully thereâs no fall damage.</p>

<p>Thereâs no undo, thereâs no reverting even back to the start of a chapter, thereâs nothing to do, but sigh despairingly and figure out the painstaking path back or new route you need to follow. In fairness, the world has been carefully constructed so that you generally shouldnât fall back too far if youâre following the main path, and that thereâs often another route through, back or around to follow.</p>
<p>I know thatâs meant to be part of the enjoyment here, that push and pull of failure and success. I see streamers basically zipping up and through the world with easy. What am I doing wrong or different? Are they playing with mouse and keyboard instead of controller? Am I the one thatâs out of touch?</p>
<p>Honestly, thatâs probably the best way to be able to enjoy this game, whether thatâs watching someone play it or sharing it with a friend by passing the pad back and forth.</p>

            <p>The future of GZDoom, the community-updated engine behind many thousands of brilliant Doom mods, is in doubt following a bust-up over the lead developer's use of generative AI to create code. The fracas has seen a number of GZDoom developers announce plans to splinter off and maintain their own engine, UZDoom.
</p><!--more-->
<p>New to GZDoom? It's a fork of Doom source port Zdoom, first released by Christoph Oelckers, aka Graf Zahl, back in 2005. A vast number of Doom modding projects make use of it, including such RPS headliners as literary horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/myhousewad-is-an-extraordinary-mod-thats-like-if-doom-was-a-horror-game">MyHouse.wad</a>, demon-petting add-on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-doom-mod-finally-lets-us-make-friends-with-the-cacodemons">Cacofrendo</a> (pictured), and unofficial Wolfenstein 3D sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blade-of-agony-doom-wolfenstein-mod">Blade Of Agony</a>.
</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/many-developers-leave-gzdoom-due-to-leader-conflicts-and-fork-it-into-uzdoom/">GamingOnLinux</a>, a moderator recently posted on Discord about strife between Oelckers and various members of the community. "Due to a conflict between GZDoom's lead developer/maintainer Graf Zahl, a lot of other developers decided to leave GZDoom and work on a new fork of the engine now known as UZDoom," they write. 
</p>
<p>The fracas appears to be only partly to do with Oelckers' usage of ChatGPT. Going by the chat on Discord and elsewhere, the backlash is fuelled by long-term misgivings about his bulldozing leadership style. Aside from replicating all of GZDoom's features, the Discord moderator post continues, the UZDoom rebels aim to offer "a more stable development structure with healthy collaboration and less power given to individual 'project leads'". 
</p><p>Further investigation takes us to this <a href="https://github.com/Zdoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2">Github page</a> for a GZDoom update that features some code by Oelckers, derived from ChatGPT. It has spawned a comments thread full of people arguing about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/oct/08/the-ai-valuation-bubble-is-now-getting-silly">the generative AI financial bubble</a> and the ethics and utility of coding with genAI. Oelckers has both defended his use of ChatGPT, arguing that a lot of programmers secretly deploy large language learning models for smaller tasks, and offhandedly invited the angry users to fork the engine and work on their own version.</p>
<p>The ire has spilled over into <a href="https://github.com/Zdoom/gzdoom/issues/3395">later Github bug reports</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/important_announcement_regarding_the_gzdoom/">this Reddit thread</a> summarising the situation, which includes further postage from pissed-off GZDoom devs. A few Doom modders have also been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/himynameischair.bsky.social/post/3m36lqd7kbc2s">airing their</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nashmuhandes.bsky.social/post/3m36nql4u3c2l">grievances</a> on Bluesky.</p>
<p>I can only scratch my head and look worried at a lot of this. I know eff-all about the twists and turns of GZDoom's long development - I am one of those drive-by Doomlites who downloads a cool wad every blue moon. Still, it all feels rather momentous, given the sheer number of projects that use the engine. More to follow, I'm sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Having the best meta guns will give you a huge advantage in Battlefield 6. At the very least, youâll be able to compete with everyone else who is also using the best guns. Weâve got top weapons you should be using in Battlefield 6, along with the ideal loadouts to go with them.</p>



<p>If youâre not keeping on top of the âmeta,â youâre going to fall behind. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> features a vast array of guns, but selecting the right one for each class is crucial. You might love the AK4D, for example, but itâs not as good as the most elite assault rifle in BF 6.</p>



<p>Weâve put together the best meta guns and loadouts for the top weapon in each Battlefield 6 class.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Starting off strong. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The assault rifle category isnât as strong as other classes in Battlefield 6. However, it looks like the <strong>M433 </strong>is the standard in the AR category and the bar that other assault rifles need to live up to.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Baker 3.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong>&nbsp;Double-Port Brake</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>A demon. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>M4A1 </strong>is currently the best Carbineâand potentially best weapon overallâin <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>. An assault rifle usually ends up being the most dominant gun in FPS games. For us, thereâs no question itâs the M4A1 Carbine that takes the crown instead. It fires well, hits hard, and this best loadout brings out its true potential.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Baker 3.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Standard Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 14.5â³ Carbine</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Itâs the MP5, always will be. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>PW5A3</strong>âAKA the MP5, letâs face itârules the roost where SMGs are concerned. Itâs consistently appeared throughout the course of FPS gaming history, and itâs here in Battlefield 6. It outclasses every other SMG up close, and itâs also quite handy at mid-range as well. If you need a gun that rapidly chews through bullets and tears through opponents in smaller maps, look no further than the PW5A3.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Iron Sights</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Compensated Brake</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 245MM Custom</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 40RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Donât sleep on this. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best <strong>DRS-IAR</strong> loadout is a strange one, as it doesnât even feel like an LMG in some ways. Our Magazine attachment gives it fewer bullets than our PW5A3 class, for example. But itâs still a powerful gun that can be just as powerful as an AR, and then some. If youâre looking for a different type of weapon, you should consider the DRS-IAR.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> CCO 2.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Double-Port Brake</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 20â³ SDM-R</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Alloy Vertical</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> Magwell Flare</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Boom. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you played the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, chances are you were blown away by it, by blown away, I mean blasted in the face repeatedly by the <strong>M87A1</strong> Shotgun. Its dominance and superiority have carried over into the full game, and thereâs no question that the M87A1 is the Shotgun to use. Itâs a one-shot weapon of mass destruction.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Iron Sights</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 20â³ Factory</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Adjustable Angled</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 7 Shell Tube</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> Flechette</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>King of Sniper Rifles. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 has a decent amount of medium-to-long-range maps. This allows Sniper Rifles to flourish, and if you fancy your chances as a precision marksman, you need the <strong>M2010 ESR</strong>. Itâs flexible as both a quick-firing quickscope rifle, or can dominate at a distance. Our M2010 ESR loadout is the one we feel gets the most out of the weapon, but donât be afraid to tinker with the slots here. You may want a suppressor, but we do not.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> SSDS 6.00X</li>



<li><strong>Optic Accessory:</strong> Anti-Glare Coating</li>



<li><strong>Left Accessory:</strong> Range Finder</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 26â³ Carbon</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 8RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> DLC Bolt</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> Match Grade</li>
</ul>



<p>Nowâs the time for you to get involved and share your thoughts. Let us know if any of these loadouts worked for you, what else youâd like to see, and you can also check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a> to start your own Battlefield 6 conversations and share your own loadouts!</p>

            <p>Sony has fired back against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> as part of a continuing lawsuit over its Horizon "knock-off" Light of Motiram, claiming the Chinese conglomerate's defence is "nonsense".</p>
<p>Last November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent revealed Light of Motiram</a>, which was immediately compared to Sony's Horizon games. As a result, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">PlayStation maker has sued Tencent</a> for allegedly ripping off its popular games; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-responds-to-sony-lawsuit-against-slavish-horizon-clone-stating-its-claims-of-originality-are-startling">Tencent then retaliated</a> by stating Sony's claims of originality were "startling".</p>
<p>Now Sony is fighting back. In a new court filing (thanks <a href="https://thegamepost.com/damage-sony-tencent-nonsense-protect-light-of-motiram-horizon-knock-off-lawsuit/">The Game Post</a>), Sony has accused Tencent of "playing a shell game" with its subsidiaries to shield itself from liability.</p>

<p>"Tencent remarkably contends SIE's claims are unripe because - despite having announced and continuously promoted its game for months - Tencent (purportedly) delayed Light of Motiramâs release until 2027 after SIE sued," Sony said in its complaint. "This is nonsense. The damage is done - and it continues."</p><p>"Although the public expressed confusion and outrage upon discovering Light of Motiram for the knock-off that it is, Tencent remained undeterred. Tencent continued promoting its infringing game over SIE's objection, and Tencent refused to accept any responsibility over its conduct."</p>
<p>Tencent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">quietly updated the Steam page for Light of Motiram</a>, removing a number of screenshots and a cover image of its Aloy-like protagonist. However, as Sony has claimed, "the damage is done".</p>
<p>In its defence, Tencent claimed Sony was attempting to sue the wrong company. Sony's lawsuit is against Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S., and Tencent Holdings, but Tencent itself said the game is being developed and published by Polaris Quest / Aurora Studios, a developer operating under Tencent Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd, and Proxima Beta PTE Ltd, a company in Singapore "doing business as '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent-games">Tencent Games</a>' and/or 'Level Infinite'".</p>
<p>"After SIE was forced to sue, Tencent attempted to avoid liability by playing a shell game with its brands and entities," Sony has now said. "Tencent tried to shield Defendants that it owns and/or controls from service of process and now seeks to escape jurisdiction over the parent entity, Tencent Holdings."</p><p>It continued: "Tencent Holdings describes its own business as having a Games division that 'own[s] Aurora Studios' - the Light of Motiram development studio. Tencent Holdings reports all of its revenue and debt from games on its annual report without attribution to any subsidiary. And it uses the name Tencent to advertise its games, like Light of Motiram - without distinguishing between subsidiaries."</p>
<p>Sony has also claimed reactions from the public and media highlight the resemblance between the games and will jeopardise the success of the Horizon series.</p>
<p>"Light of Motiram - a knock-off game so blatant that the public loudly decried the obvious and pervasive copying of Horizonâs protected elements -  jeopardises Horizon's continued success, including current expansion plans for the franchise," said Sony.</p>
<p>"The copying was so egregious that numerous journalists and Horizon fans called Light of Motiram 'a major Horizon rip off', 'an obvious knock off',â a 'copycat' with a main character that 'resembles Aloy to a tee', and 'extremely similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>'."</p>
<p>Sony has further claimed Horizon protagonist Aloy is a symbol of the brand, and that Tencent's "Aloy lookalike" is an "egregious" effort to trade off its character's "goodwill and reputation".</p>
<p>As a result, Sony has requested the court deny Tencent's motion to dismiss the lawsuit.</p>
