			<p>I am not a coder. In fact, I view the actual process of development and coding in much the same way as much of Hollywood with hackers being some kind of modern wizard with arcane knowledge. With that in mind, when I was offered the chance to play a game that puts you in the shoes of a hacker trying to access a sinister organisation’s network, my first worry was that I wouldn’t be able to understand what I was doing. The premise intrigued me enough that I gave it a try and I’m glad that I did, as s.p.l.i.t is up there with the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/26/threshold-review/">Threshold</a> in terms of short experimental horror games.</p>
<p><em><strong>Content Warning:</strong> s.p.l.i.t contains dark elements, with thematic and immersive references to self harm and suicide. I won’t discuss details in the review but these are central enough to warrant caution.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="'s.p.l.i.t' - Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKO3UzOTBsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The aesthetics of s.p.l.i.t are perfectly in keeping with the game. While most of the time you’ll be staring at a simulated interface, you can turn to look around your room when necessary. This will mostly be required to switch between your hacking interface and your messaging screen through which you’ll interact with two mysterious colleagues. All mechanics are carried out through the keyboard, which really nails the immersion. Messaging is performed through mashing the keys to simulate actual typing, but all of the hacking has to be done for ‘real’.</p>
<p>The backstory of s.p.l.i.t is deliberately incredibly vague. You and two accomplices are trying to hack into a system in what appears to be an authoritarian dystopia. You have access to an illegal field kit device that can be used to create an authorisation key but will only have a limited time to finish the job once you have access. This scenario, especially when combined with the sheer immersion of the interface, leads to some of the most harrowing and thrilling gameplay you’ll find in indie horror. The fact that this all revolves around using a DOS-like interface to find and access files and programs within the system makes this a game that you have to play to feel.</p>


<p>There are few guidelines in the game but the signposting is so expertly done that I never found myself lost even though I didn’t have any coding knowledge going in. As mentioned above, the main interface is much closer to a pre-Windows experience as you must navigate file structures, find information and use the hints from your colleagues to proceed. Each major breakthrough is marked by a save point and brings you closer to the game’s conclusion.</p>
<p>In terms of dark themes, s.p.l.i.t is not a game with light and shade. This is a grubby and lo-fi experience that never lets up either in intensity or mood. The constant feeling of threat and surveillance makes the hour or so it takes to play through feel like an ordeal in the best possible way and both of the alternative endings offer no real optimism but both feel entirely appropriate for the game’s themes and setting.</p>


<!-- CONTENT END 1 -->

	<div id="gp-summary">
		<p>Summary</p><p>
		s.p.l.i.t is a tough game to write about, as at heart it is just a simulation of a textual file interface wrapped up in a dark and oppressive environment, but it is also so much more than that. The perfect fusion of themes and mechanics makes for an experience that is almost suffocatingly immersive and the darker aspects (although absolutely not for everyone) elevate s.p.l.i.t to be one of the most harrowing games you’ll find. Aside from the essential content warning, I’d recommend going in as blind as possible and just playing out your The Matrix and Sneakers fantasies.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s patent infringement lawsuit in Japan against Pocketpair’s open-world survival game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> is ongoing. In the latest development, Nintendo has reworded one of the patents in the case, but what led up to this bizarre move?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld is an open-world survival game that skyrocketed in popularity upon its Steam and Xbox early access launch back on January 19, 2024. It sold 8 million copies in just six days and racked up over 25 million players in one month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game world is inhabited by creatures called Pals, which you can capture and use (read: exploit) to carry out various tasks. The visual appearance of the Pals and the method of capturing them by throwing a ball (Pal Sphere), quickly drew comparisons to Pokémon, with the game even getting nicknamed “Pokémon with guns” for its darker, black humor-infused take on the creature collecting genre. With Palworld’s meteoric rise in popularity, it wasn’t long before Nintendo rival Sony got together with Pocketpair to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>form Palworld Entertainment</u></a> in June 2024, a new business venture aimed at expanding the IP.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company showed signs of keeping an eye on Palworld (for example, this <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/335.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official statement</u></a> from The Pokémon Company back in January 2024). But it wasn’t until September 2024 that they <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>officially announced</u></a> they were filing a lawsuit in Japan against Pocketpair for infringement of patent rights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three patents</u></a> granted by the Japan Patent Office (JPO): two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that these changes by Pocketpair are not an admission of guilt. Rather, as Japanese patent attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/a9dd2fc3c0dc4e4d1282d012649b665462137560" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pointed out</u></a> on Yahoo Japan news last month, Pocketpair is following the standard three-pronged defense against patent lawsuits, which is to “deny infringement, argue that the patents are invalid, and avoid infringement through design changes.” He also noted that Nintendo does not have the upper hand, as there seems to be a fierce back-and-forth with Nintendo pushing for patent infringement and Pocketpair pushing for patent invalidity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-7528390/15/ja" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ride mechanic patent</u></a> (which got a sudden rewrite recently) covers a system for mounting and maneuvering pre-selected “boardable characters” (<em>tōjō kyarakuta</em>). Commenting on X, Japanese lawyer Ryo Arashida <a href="https://x.com/IP_Arashida/status/1920369811932262824" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pointed out</u></a> that it could be argued that the way Palworld’s Glider Pals worked prior to the May update infringed part of the patent’s specifications, namely those about the player grabbing onto and hanging from the boardable character, and their subsequent control of that movement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to the May Palworld update, you could use an actual Glider Pal to glide (by grabbing onto its feet). However, post-update, players have to use a piece of equipment — a Glider — to glide, rather than actually using the Pals themselves. Instead, Pals now act as passive buffs on your gliding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ironically, as Arashida <a href="https://x.com/IP_Arashida/status/1920412095805571096" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>noted</u></a>, Nintendo’s major argument to get the patent granted in the first place was that a “boardable character” was specifically a character and not a tool, like a parachute. “For this reason, claiming in the lawsuit that a ‘Glider’ (which is a tool) is a ‘boardable character’ would create a contradiction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This month, Nintendo reworded the ride-switching mechanic patent. Rewording a patent mid-case is legal as long as it doesn’t introduce any new concepts or technical matter. However, as pointed out by IP consultant Florian Mueller at <a href="https://gamesfray.com/nintendo-resorts-to-weird-patent-claims-as-its-litigation-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair-is-struggling/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesFray</u></a>, this only tends to happen if the litigant (in this case, Nintendo) feels the patent is “at a fairly high risk of being deemed invalid in its original form.” Nintendo’s rewriting of the patent makes it more verbose. Mueller focused on the addition of “even when” <em>(-attemo</em> in Japanese) to the wording, noting that “even” is rarely used in patents because it's “too emphatic and subjective.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it's not clear exactly what Nintendo’s motivations are behind this sudden rewording, it’s possible that it is using this as a last-ditch tactic to make it harder for the patent claim to be dismissed as invalid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case continues. Meanwhile, Pocketpair continues to update Palworld with new features, such as the recently released Terraria crossover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-story-of-the-last-of-us-part-i-and-ii-will-be-available-in-book-form-later-this-year.1253001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you cannot stand video games and TV shows and would like to know what all the fuss regarding The Last of Us is about, the entire story so far will be available in book form later this year. Of course, it's also a perfectly valid option for those who already know the story through different mediums and would like to read it from the perspective of script writers Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross (the latter worked just on Part II).</p>



<p>The hardcover is already available for pre-order <a href="https://amzn.to/46WmXgE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Amazon</a>. It is estimated to be released on December 16, and the price of $69.99 is currently discounted to $66.63 (5% off). Dark Horse Books publishes the book, which is 616 pages long.</p>



<p>Here's the product overview:</p>



<p><em>Join Joel and Ellie from the very beginning of their unforgettable journey. Relive every climactic moment from The Last of Us Part I, from the duo’s time with Tess in Boston, to Ellie’s joy while petting giraffes, to Joel’s heart-wrenching decision at the Fireflies’ hospital. And dive into The Last of Us Part II’s dual-perspective story, including Abby’s shocking introduction to the story, Ellie and Dina forging a bond together, an enthralling encounter with the Rat King, and the final showdown between Ellie and Abby.</em></p>



<p><em>This volume contains the script from both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II, as well as the DLC, Left Behind, so you can experience every bottle thrown, every bad pun of Ellie’s, and every heart-pounding encounter with the Infected in a totally new way. Much like Savage Starlight was to Ellie, The Last of Us: Part I and Part II Scripts is a must-have for any fan’s bookshelf (or survival kit).</em></p>



<p>The book also includes an art gallery featuring work by Naughty Dog principal character concept artist Hyoung Nam, a buckram-textured cover, and block printing along the pages' edges that evokes the iconic Cordyceps fungus of The Last of Us.</p>



<p>The story as-is can be considered complete. As we previously reported, creator Neil Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-iii-will-only-be-made-with-a-story-worthy-of-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> a third game would only be produced if Naughty Dog found a worthy story. Druckmann himself recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped back</a> from his additional role as co-showrunner of the HBO series, although HBO reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbo-not-concerned-neil-druckmann-departure-the-last-of-us-show-16-emmy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn't concerned</a> about his departure. Even so, the second season <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-sees-big-decline-over-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw a large decline </a>in viewership, and fans fear the third season will be even worse without the creator's handiwork.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumours about a Nintendo Direct</a> already doing the rounds online, veteran video game journalist Christopher Dring has now added to this buzz, claiming "Xbox is expected to announce more game ports" for other platforms, including the Switch 2, in the "coming weeks" (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/xbox-will-apparently-announce-more-ps5-and-switch-2-ports-in-the-coming-weeks">thanks, Pure Xbox</a>).</p>
<p>This would follow Activision's recent release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> on Nintendo's new hardware, with this publisher (also known for series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a>) now owned by Microsoft.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>While it's not known what exactly we might be seeing on the Switch 2 from Xbox, there's already been a lot of rumours about key series potentially being ported.</p>
<p>Additionally, Obsidian's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> team has recently responded to a question from <a href="https://youtu.be/o5tOD0sqfKM?t=1050">Gamertag Radio</a> about the game's sequel potentially getting a Switch 2 release at some point, and it sounds open to the idea of it – mentioning how it wants "as many people to be able to play" as possible (<a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/51091-obsidian-says-we-ll-see-what-happens-in-regards-to-grounded-2-on-switch-2">via GoNintendo</a>).</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Xbox has been releasing more of its IP on other platforms, with <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gears_of_war_reloaded">Gears of War: Reloaded</a></strong> coming to the PlayStation 5 next month.</p>

Super Heroes both Earth-born and cosmic must now join forces in a star-spanning adventure against the deadly Annihilation Wave. Brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos in classically inspired side-scrolling combat.</blockquote><blockquote>Choose and control your own team of two characters while tagging between them mid-fight with the innovative Cosmic Swap system, capitalizing on distinct superpowers and special attacks to create unique team-ups and dish out devastating damage. Unlock stellar powerups and rewards while experimenting with different duos and bash through a fantastic collection of locales and nemeses from the Marvel universe. Marvel Cosmic Invasion’s action includes a range of accessibility features, empowering the whole family to be Super Heroes (or villains), and supports four-player drop-in/drop-out local and online co-op with crossplay.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Joining the fight on Switch platforms later this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Marvel's been involved with some pretty exciting games in recent times, and hopefully, this trend continues with its upcoming arcade-style beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's launch on the Switch and Switch 2 later this year, Dotemu has today revealed another two playable characters joining the roster. This time we get a brief look at 'Beta Ray Bill' and 'Silver Surfer' who join the fight against the immortal super villain Annihilus.</p>
<p>Here's some PR about the latest character reveals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s hammer time for Annihilus’ forces when Beta Ray Bill smashes into action! With his devastating and mighty hammer known as Stormbreaker, the son of Korbin marshals his cyborg strength to squash any bug battalion standing in his way!</p>
<p>And he won’t be joining the fight alone – from the depths of the cosmos, the Silver Surfer soars into the battle! Imbued with the Power Cosmic, the Surfer can stun any adversary. Easily gliding in the skies or close to the ground, insectoid invaders can’t escape Galactus’ former herald!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silver Surfer and Beta Ray Bill will join a cast made up of various other characters like Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Venom and She-Hulk, as they brawl their way through the streets of Marvel's New York, all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone.</p>

<figure><a title="WWE 2K25" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03dfc2db8ed2c/wwe-2k25.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> has finally landed on the Switch 2 this week, and while the experience was expected to match other versions of the game, it seems this isn't <em>entirely</em> the case.</p>
<p>Although community creations are available in the Switch 2 release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-lacks-image-uploading-on-switch-2-and-fans-arent-happy">as highlighted by IGN</a>, this version "lacks image uploading" and it appears to have caught some wrestling enthusiasts by surprise.</p>
<p>The official game FAQ actually goes into a bit more detail about these restrictions, noting how Switch 2 players won't be able to upload or view custom images from "other platforms". The <a href="https://support.wwe2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/42408597808019-WWE-2K-Image-Uploader-Tool">same page on the game website</a> also includes the following notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 players will not see Image Uploader based Community Creations from any platform or be able to upload their own"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see below, fans and content creators within this space have shared their frustrations online – with some already speculating <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1m6lovh/no_community_creations_in_nintendo_switch_2/">about the reasons behind this decision</a>.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/51086-wwe-2k25-on-switch-2-blocks-access-to-user-created-content">GoNintendo</a> have also labelled this a "major disappointment" and have reached out to multiple parties to "try and get an answer".</p>

<p>Apart from this, early impressions suggest <a href="https://x.com/SMetaldave64/status/1948093777320546314">the Switch 2 version of WWE 2K25 is a respectable port</a>. We'll be delivering our Nintendo Life review soon, and if we hear any significant developments tied to this story, we'll let you know.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Recently Canceled a Star Wars Outlaws Sequel – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-sequel-recently-canceled-rumor-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-recently-canceled-a-star-wars-outlaws-sequel-%E2%80%93-rumor.1252920/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This month, just days prior to the time of this writing, Ubisoft chief executive officer Yves Guillemot blamed<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/"> Star Wars Outlaws missing its sales targets on the Star Wars IP itself</a>, saying that the Star Wars brand was "<em>in choppy waters</em>" at the time of Outlaws' launch. Now, a rumor has surfaced that Ubisoft has quietly canceled a Star Wars Outlaws sequel. </p>



<p>The rumor comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bFaIYn9H3g&amp;t=2800s">Tom Henderson and Insider-Gaming</a>, who said on the website's podcast that Ubisoft "<em>recently canceled Star Wars Outlaws 2</em>," adding that it was still in its early stages and that it "<em>hadn't entered [full] production</em>," and that it was "<em>very, very, early</em>." Mike Straw, senior editor at the site, joked that we were "<em>probably seven years away</em>" from seeing it.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Is EA's Last Chance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bFaIYn9H3g?start=2800&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Henderson has <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">previously correctly reported</a> internal information about Ubisoft, but this claim remains a rumor for now. It's also arguably not the most wild speculation. You could say that Outlaws was the biggest miss for Ubisoft in 2024, a year rife with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/09/skull-and-bones-looks-like-its-doing-worse-than-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">big misses</a> for the company. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">struggled to move units out of the gate</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/">underwent significant changes from its original launch version</a> months after release due to a heavy wave of negative player feedback. The game's director even acknowledged <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-director-admits-review-score-disappointment/">disappointment with the response from critics</a>.</p>



<p>Its poor launch sales were also used as an excuse to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows out of 2024 and to its eventual March 2025 launch date. You could make the case that Ubisoft has had anything but negative things to say about Outlaws since it launched. It's not the craziest idea that leadership ultimately decided not to go down the road of a sequel, even if they were exploring what one would look like.</p>

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h45Sr1kafGU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>resulting video</u></a> is quite funny, showing the new Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) family as they fumble through a few matches as their in-game counterparts.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Meet the family! ✨Marvel Studios The Fantastic Four: First Steps cast's genuine reactions as they try out Marvel Rivals! 😄 <a href="https://t.co/sq8lwMh7pp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/sq8lwMh7pp</a></p>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1948513591134679137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's goofy and occasionally hard to watch as Pascal flails his stretchy arms at enemies, but the highlight is no doubt the Fantastic Four cast’s reaction to Invisible Woman’s infamous Marvel Rivals Malice skin. Fans of the game had already taken the time to see everything the shockingly revealing outfit had to offer when it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvel-rivals/Season_1_Battle_Pass_and_New_Skins#Malice_Invisible_Woman_Skin">its debut with Season 1</a> in January. On the eve of the new Fantastic Four movie’s premiere, though, the cast is only just seeing it for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby is the first to joke about the skin: “Thank you. This is my favorite bit of her as well,” she says of the video game version of her Fantastic Four character. “This is my favorite bit. Guys, watch out, like I said, for the sequel. You better watch it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fantastic Four: First Steps, of course, has yet to receive the green light for a proper MCU sequel, though we do know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-pedro-pascals-reed-richards-lead-the-avengers-the-fantastic-four-first-steps-director-clarifies-previous-comments-insists-its-for-the-russo-brothers-to-reveal"><u>at least some of its major characters</u></a> will make an appearance in the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday. Invisible Woman’s evil black-and-red Malice skin probably won’t make it into the MCU, but the slack-jawed Pascal still shared some of his thoughts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Here we go,” Pascal said. “Costume designer, take notes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Loserfruit’s video also includes the Fantastic Four cast’s reaction to other Marvel Rivals cosmetics, including Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman’s The Life Fantastic wedding skins. Of course, it’s how all four actors reacted to the Malice skin that has started to achieve viral status.

                <p>Epic Games apparently <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1948486101020143845" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removed passive XP gains</a> from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s main Battle Royale and Zero Build modes on Thursday afternoon, in the midst of its Summer Road Trip event that will award a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-the-free-chevrolet-corvette-in-fortnite-and-rocket-league/1100-6533356/" data-ref-id="1100-6533356">free Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 car</a> body for gaining XP to complete a series of daily quests. Playing Battle Royale had awarded 550 XP per minute, or a little less than half a level per hour, just for existing in the game mode--but that's no longer the case.</p><p>While this certainly is a bit of a nerf, it's actually not typical for Battle Royale and Zero Build to give passive XP. In fact, passive XP was only just added to those modes at the beginning of the current season--before then, we lived without it. The change had made leveling the battle pass this season meaningfully faster.</p><p>Assuming the change will stick for a while, there are two fairly obvious potential reasons for the change. The Summer Road Trip event is one of them, since its quests simply require gaining XP to complete. You only need to gain eight total levels across these quests, so the lack of passive XP in BR probably won't slow anyone down very much. Another possibility is that we're approaching the end of Chapter 6 Season 4, and this change will make it a little tougher for folks who are just now getting started on the battle pass to catch up before the season ends on August 7.</p><p>When Chapter 6 Season 3 ends on August 7, it'll also mark the end of the current seasons of Fortnite OG and Lego Fortnite. In other words, it'll be a pretty eventful season launch. In fact, there's even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ogs-rocket-live-event-is-just-days-away/1100-6533279/" data-ref-id="1100-6533279">an end-of-season event</a> ahead. </p>

These include over 20 payment options, a full-featured mobile app, built-in marketing tools, and more robust pledge management. Indiegogo will also adopt Gamefound's flat 5% fee structure, putting more money in creators' pockets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s time for crowdfunding to be a forward-facing industry again,” said Julie dePontbriand, CEO of Indiegogo in the official release. “Gamefound’s technology is unrivaled, and we’re thrilled to bring it to Indiegogo’s diverse community. Together, we’re making crowdfunding more innovative, creator-friendly, and exciting than ever before.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two sites will continue operating independently for now, with Gamefound remaining focused on tabletop games and Indiegogo continuing to promote tech, film, and other creative projects.

                <p>It seems horror fans are destined to mourn the loss of Kojima's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hills/" data-ref-id="5000-306236">Silent Hills</a> project until the end of time--but that doesn't mean there aren't games out there picking up the torch left behind by its playable teaser, aptly named P.T. Indeed, developer Broken Bird Games has absorbed some of Kojima's vision to craft the eerie mind-bender <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/luto/" data-ref-id="5000-526997">Luto</a>. In this atmospheric horror title, you'll spend your time as a character stuck in a loop within their home, trying desperately to figure out, well, <em>why</em>.</p><p>If you're interested in checking out this chilling mystery but want to know what kind of time investment you're in for before you do, we'll fill you in on how long it takes to beat Luto and how many chapters stand between you and the finale.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mBgdXyIGsQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1mBgdXyIGsQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>How long does it take to beat Luto?</h2><p>How long it takes you to finish Luto will depend largely on your puzzle-solving abilities and how well you pay attention to your surroundings. Even with its occasionally obtuse puzzles, Luto is still a relatively brief horror experience that is focused on giving you a meaningful dose of the creeps without wearing its gimmicks too thin. With this in mind, you can expect it to take between <strong>3-5 hours to finish the campaign</strong>. Of course, if you're using a guide to assist with puzzles in Luto, you can almost certainly wrap things up even quicker. </p><h2>Luto chapter list</h2><p>Glancing at the chapter list for Luto may be confusing, with its repeated chapters and strange jumps. But it all makes sense within the bizarre, looping narrative structure of the game, which unravels to great effect as you move deeper and deeper into its twisted tale. While we don't want to ruin anything here about the way the narrative plays out in Luto, you can get a basic idea of what type of experience you're getting yourself into by surveying the chapter list below.</p><ul><li>Chapter 1 - It's Happening Again</li><li>Chapter 2 - Beyond the Noise</li><li>Chapter 3 - One More Time</li><li>Chapter 1 - It's Happening Again </li><li>Chapter 4 - Thanks for Pushing Me</li><li>Chapter 5 - Playing with the Truth</li><li>Chapter 22 - A Mouth Full of Sand Can't Scream</li><li>Chapter 3 - One More Time </li></ul><p>Luto is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

Today, during Robert Kirkman's panel at San Diego Comic-Con, the Invincible creator announced another new fighter for the game, and this one is a little more beastly.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle Beast--the fearsome warrior who travels the Invincible universe looking for a fighter to give him a glorious death--is the latest entrant into the Invincible Vs roster. The reveal trailer for the giant showed off some of his smashing moveset--including one attack where he smashed his club into Bulletproof so hard, it knocked off his head and limbs.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Invincible VS - Battle Beast Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Battle Beast becomes the sixth confirmed fighter for Invincible Vs., joining the previously mentioned Invincible, Atom Eve, Bulletproof, and Rex Splode, as well as the Viltrumite Thula. Two other Viltrumites, Lucen and Omni-Man, did feature in the game's initial reveal trailer in June, but neither have been officially confirmed as playable characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible Vs. was announced during the Xbox Showcase in early June, with Skybound also announcing the creation of its development studio Quarter Up. Quarter Up is made up of industry veterans from Activision, Riot Games, Xbox, and more, and it was founded by Mike Willette, who previously worked on the Killer Instinct 2013 reboot for Xbox--as a developer and as the voice of the announcer.</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible VS is set to launch in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

The official synopsis is as follows:</p><p>“A young Earthbender discovers she’s the new Avatar after Korra – but in this dangerous era, that title marks her as humanity’s destroyer, not its savior. Hunted by both human and spirit enemies, she and her long-lost twin must uncover their mysterious origins and save the Seven Havens before civilization’s last strongholds collapse.”</p><p>The image shown at Comic Con has the new Avatar front and center, alongside a feline companion and another character named Jae, who is described as Pavi’s mentor.</p><figure id="" data-id="d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-recommend-id="image://d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="3441" data-height="1933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pavi, Jae, and a feline companion look over a desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pavi, Jae, and a feline companion look over a desert." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nickelodeon</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-recommend-id="image://d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="3441" data-height="1933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pavi, Jae, and a feline companion look over a desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Seven Havens</em> will premiere in 2027 on Nickelodeon and span 26 episodes across two seasons.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo-greatly-expanding-tabletop-crowdfunding-platform</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamefound has acquired the crowdfunding platform, Indiegogo. This is a major change for Indiegogo, which was one of the earliest pioneers of crowdfunding platforms. This acquisition will lead to new features and improvements, as well as new conveniences for users.</p>

<h2>The Gamefound Indiegogo Acquisition</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/blog/post/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Gamefound discussed the changes that would be coming to both platforms as a result of the acquisition. First, much like Roll20 and Demiplane's acquisition, you will be able to log in to Gamefound using either your Indiegogo or Gamefound credentials. In addition, Indiegogo will be adopting Gamefound's business terms and policies, which are generally friendlier to the end user.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamefound-indiegogo-campaign-metrics.jpg?itok=SgV_nrJJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamefound-indiegogo-campaign-metrics.jpg?itok=nxWZIjNB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The latter is especially impressive since Gamefound provides plenty of methods and options for users to launch and support different tabletop projects. Campaigns include both pre-launch and late pledges. The platform provides integrated tax tools, providing more transparent prices for various regional taxes and national tariffs. Lastly, users have access to stretch pay and direct currency exchange.</p>

<p>“It’s time for crowdfunding to be a forward-facing industry again,” said Julie dePontbriand, CEO of Indiegogo. “Gamefound’s technology is unrivaled, and we’re thrilled to bring it to Indiegogo’s diverse community. Together, we’re making crowdfunding more innovative, creator-friendly, and exciting than ever before.”</p>

<p>These changes aside, not much will change for either platform. Gamefound is still dedicated to providing a platform for tabletop crowdfunding projects. It has been their mission statement since it was founded in 2016, and that is still their focus. Their track record speaks for itself with successes like board game adaptations of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cyberpunk-2077-board-game-campaign-raises-over-1-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/blasphemous-board-game-brings-penitence-to-gamefound" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blasphemous</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hearts-of-iron-board-game-reaches-gamefound-success-in-13-minutes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Hearts of Iron</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for Indiegogo, it will continue as a platform for various tech and arts projects. Projects as diverse as Steam Deck competitors or board game projects like the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-announces-street-masters-champion-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Street Masters</em></a> board game. The difference now is that the platform's userbase of about 38 million will be enjoying some quality-of-life improvements.</p>

VShojo CEO Justin “Gunrun” Ignacio <a href="https://x.com/VShojo/status/1948442574722924778">made the announcement today on X, writing</a>, “I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us to this point.”</p><p>Earlier this week, VShojo came under fire as Ironmouse, the agency’s top-performing VTuber, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712627/ironmouse-leaves-vshojo-vtuber-twitch-youtube">announced she was leaving the company</a> over a missing $500,000 charity donation and her own unpaid funds. Her departure triggered a mass exodus of VShojo talent, with 12 of the company’s 13 creators officially announcing their own split from the company and some also claiming unpaid wages as their reason. Ignacio’s announcement alluded to VShojo’s financial difficulties.</p><p>“We raised around $11 million to pursue a bold, talent-first approach in VTubing,” the statement reads. “However, despite all our efforts, the business failed to generate the revenue we needed to sustain that model, and eventually, we ran out of money.”</p><p>Ignacio also admitted that the funds raised by Ironmouse and intended for the Immune Deficiency Foundation had been spent by the company: “Additionally I acknowledge that some of the money spent by the company was raised in connection with talent activity which I later learned was intended for a charitable initiative.” Ignacio went on to write that he was confident that he’d be able to raise enough money to cover those costs. “We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts.”</p><p>Here’s the statement in full.</p><div><blockquote><p>VShojo has failed, and I’ve mismanaged the company into the situation you’re all witnessing.</p><p>So today I am sharing the difficult news that VShojo is shutting down, and I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us to this point.</p><p>I’ve been doing everything I can to fundraise and right the ship these past few months, but despite my efforts, we are in a worse position, and those I care about are now paying the price.</p><p>Over the past few years, we raised around $11 million to pursue a bold, talent-first approach in VTubing, prioritizing creators and community over short-term profits, to achieve long-term sustainability. Our funding went directly to our creators through generous splits, debut investments, infrastructure, concerts, events, and staffing, all designed to support them. We also wanted talent to own their IP, which we knew was a unique creator-first approach for an agency. However, despite all our efforts, the business failed to generate the revenue we needed to sustain that model, and eventually, we ran out of money.</p><p>Additionally, I acknowledge that some of the money spent by the company was raised in connection with talent activity, which I later learned was intended for a charitable initiative. At the time, we were working hard to raise additional investment capital to cover our costs, and I firmly believed, based on the information available to us, that we would be able to do so and cover all expenses. We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts. I made the decision to pursue funding, and I own its consequences.</p><p>I am deeply sorry to all the talents, staff, friends, and community members who believed in our brand. You did not deserve this.</p></blockquote></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/713343/vshojo-shutting-down-ironmouse-missing-charity-donations]]></content:encoded>
