            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/castle-crashers-dev-behemoth-new-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Castle Crashers&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alien Hominid&nbsp;</em>developer The Behemoth has announced its next project, and it's an arcade throwback title with a very familiar name.</p>

<p>"Game 6", as The Behemoth refers to it, will also be called&nbsp;<em>Behemoth</em>, and it'll launch on PC via Steam on October 31st. It'll enjoy some stiff competition, with the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>also set to launch on that date</a>.</p>

<p>The Steam page for&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>describes the game as an "arcade extravaganza" in which you play as a chicken gathering up baby chicks and collecting candy corn as you soar through the skies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-behemoth-arcade-throwback-behemoth-gameplay.jpg?itok=UcrkFUQO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-behemoth-arcade-throwback-behemoth-gameplay.jpg?itok=BsjFKs1S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Behemoth's new game&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>looks characteristically weird.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay footage released by The Behemoth today makes&nbsp;its latest game<em>&nbsp;</em>look a little like&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>, although mercifully, it appears not to be embracing the kind of live-service nonsense the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flappy-bird-returning-this-year">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>reboot</a> is going for.</p>

<p>Candy corn you collect over the course of your time with&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>will allow you to unlock cosmetics "like chicken colors, beaks, wattles, and feet", and you'll also be able to compete in daily leaderboards to see if you can beat the rest of the world at&nbsp;<em>Behemoth</em>.</p>

<p>The game is aiming for a pretty low price point, too; it'll only cost you $3.99, which puts it on the same level as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>&nbsp;(although it's unlikely we'll be seeing any<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-castlevania-crossover-dlc"><em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover DLC</a>&nbsp;for this one anytime soon).</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Behemoth</em>, which also shows off the kind of chaotic gameplay you can expect from the game, right here.</p>




<p><em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>will be The Behemoth's sixth major project. The studio's first effort was the Flash game&nbsp;<em>Alien Hominid</em>, which was followed up by side-scrolling beat-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Castle Crashers&nbsp;</em>in 2008.</p>

<p>After that, the California-based studio released wacky platformer&nbsp;<em>Battleblock Theater&nbsp;</em>in 2013 and strategy RPG&nbsp;<em>Pit People&nbsp;</em>in 2018, followed by a reimagined version of debut title <em>Alien Hominid&nbsp;</em>last year.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>when it launches <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3027260/BEHEMOTH/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on PC via Steam</a> on October 31st. Stay tuned for more on all other things The Behemoth-related.</p>

            <p>Rock Paper Shotgun has a fuzzy conception of "news", in that we regard the "new" element of news as sorely overrated, more of a guideline than an obligation. The trick to selling this mindset gracefully is to overclock your obnoxious narcissism until it levels up into stylish solipsism. "It's news to me," I sternly insist, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-lethal-company-developers-next-game-is-an-open-world-where-you-cant-see">announcing a game</a> you might pedantically observe was actually announced in 2019. "I can obtain no reliable empirical evidence that this existed prior to my noticing it," I declare, writing about my discovery that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> requires a permanent internet connection, even when you're playing the campaign.</p>
<p>The hair-splitters amongst you might object that this has been known since June this year, but that's no problem, because I have no reliable empirical evidence that you exist either. The only sources I'm prepared to trust are certain people on Reddit, who have also just learned about the always-online requirement after experiencing disconnects in single player, and are getting violently pissed off.</p>
<p>The implications of Call Of Duty single player going always-online are as you'd expect. Firstly, there's the risk of being  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1gblua0/due_to_call_of_duty_black_ops_6s_always_online/">booted out of your campaign playthrough</a> if you experience a disconnection, and secondly, the story mode will only be playable while Activision keeps the servers online. I'm not expecting them to pull support anytime soon - this is Call Of Duty, the annual shootman extravaganza which new owner Microsoft is prepared to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">sacrifice hundreds of developer livelihoods for</a>, though not their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-ceos-pay-rises-63-to-73m-despite-devastating-year-for-layoffs">CEO's annual compensation</a>. Still, there will come a point when they wind down the servers, and we can only hope they've added an offline mode by then.</p>
<p>While digital rights management could be a factor, Black Ops 6 seems to require an internet connection because it makes heavy use of texture-streaming, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-are-finally-cutting-down-call-of-dutys-horrendous-install-sizes-for-black-ops-6s-release">a bid to cut down install sizes</a>. As remembered by <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/infuriating-black-ops-6-campaign-crashes-caused-by-awful-online-only-requirements/">Videogamer</a>, the ability to stream textures to your hard drive was added in November 2020, following the release of Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. It was optional then. It's mandatory now, though there's a "Minimal" option for people with less bandwidth.</p><p>Our Black Ops 6 review is in progress. I've just obtained a code, and might give the campaign a try myself over the weekend. I'll let you know how the always-online stuff pans out, either in a Maw post or in a separate article. It'll still be news by then, for all of reality is but the fleeting reflection of my mind's eye. If you're more interested in the multiplayer, Jeremy has conjured up some guides for the best <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-loadouts">Black Ops 6 loadouts</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">best Black Ops 6 guns</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</h5><p><span>October 31st</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Grasshopper Manufacture</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>The story of Shadows of the Damned's development is an interesting one. The second-ever collaboration between <a href="https://wccftech.com/suda51-and-shinji-mikami-interview-discussing-shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-killer-7-sequel-and-more/">Goichi "Suda51" Suda</a>, creator of the No More Heroes series, and Shinji Mikami, the man behind Resident Evil, Dino Crisis, and many other successful CAPCOM games, the game was originally conceptualized to be a survival horror game called Kurayami very different from the wacky, edgy, over-the-top third-person shooter that eventually released in 2013. Despite Suda51 not being too pleased by the many changes made to his original concept, Shadows of the Damned turned out to be an extremely fun game with some standout features, such as the story and characters, the dark humor, and the relentless pacing that makes the entire experience feel like a true rollercoaster from beginning to end. The soundtrack by Silent Hill series composer Akira Yamaoka was the cherry on top of an extremely tasty cake.</p>
<p>After being stuck in PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hell and being unplayable on more modern gaming hardware, the cult classic by Grasshopper Manufacture has been given a second chance with Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered, a remaster that leaves the original experience almost untouched while slightly updating visuals and adding a small selection of additional content.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241016134149_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If we were to just evaluate the remastering job, there's no doubt that Grasshopper Manufacture and Engine Software really did the bare minimum. On PC, and presumably PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, the visuals now render at 4K resolution, but most of the assets don't seem to have been updated in any way, resulting in uneven visual quality. And that's it, basically. The PC port supports rebindable mouse and keyboard controls, which work great for a third-person shooter in the vein of Shadows of the Damned, but that is the only setting that can be changed in this version of the game, as there are no graphics options whatsoever. It's not even possible to change resolution: the game just runs in fullscreen mode using the monitor's resolution. While this could be fine, given the type of game and how undemanding it is, it's really difficult to accept a PC port with no options to tweak whatsoever in 2024. At the very least, the remaster is priced reasonably at $24,99 and, ultimately, does what it set out to do: give players the chance to experience the madness Suda51 and Mikami created over ten years ago on modern gaming hardware.</p>
<p>Even though Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered leaves a lot to be desired as a remaster, it is still a worthwhile release as the game is still as fun as it was in 2013. Controlling demon hunter Garcia Hotspur, players travel to the Underworld to save his girlfriend Paula from the Lord of Demons, Fleming, who wants to get back at the demon hunter by repeatedly killing the woman in the most gruesome of fashions. Aiding the foul-mouthed demon hunter is the equally foul-mouthed demon Johnson, who can transform into a bike, a torch, and multiple weapons with some ludicrous names, such as Hot Boner, and even more ludicrous capabilities, such as using demon teeth as ammo. With the demon acting as a guide, Garcia makes his way to Fleming's Castle of Hassle, fighting hordes of demons, opening up doors using the weirdest of keys, including the strawberries that demons love so much, and learning how unhinged the Underworld and its denizens truly are.</p>
<p>From this quick overview, it should be clear how the Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered characters and setting are standouts in the experience. While Garcia's journey is relatively straightforward, the eight or so hours required to complete the game are quite memorable thanks to its dark humor and the banter between Garcia and Johnson, which is so entertaining that by itself, it could be worth the price of admission alone. In many ways, the Shadows of the Damned experience is reminiscent of Madworld from PlatinumGames, where straightforward gameplay was elevated by irreverent humor and wacky setting. Outstanding performances from Steve Blum as Garcia and Greg Ellis as Johnson further enhance the experience, delivering all the game’s hilarious dialogue and stories with convincing charm.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241018134823_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the story and characters have aged extremely well, also considering how we don't see this type of humor too often nowadays, the gameplay hasn't aged as well, although it is still quite fun. Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered hasn't touched the original mechanics and features in any way, so the game still plays like a straightforward, high-speed third-person shooter sharing some remote similarities with Resident Evil 4, mostly due to Mikami-san's involvement. The game, however, couldn't be any different from the glorious entry in the CAPCOM series in regards to the complexity of the level design. In Shadows of the Damned, the locations aren't particularly big or articulate, and the vast majority of puzzles players find are closed doors that require some of the aforementioned keys to open, which are often obtained by exploring the immediate vicinities of the closed doors or by killing demons. The entire experience is undoubtedly built around combat, and it is geared toward moving players from one intense combat encounter to the next, which could be disappointing for those looking for a more involving experience, but it's this no-nonsense, breakneck pace that makes Shadows of the Damned the engaging game it still is in 2024.</p>
<p>The quality of the combat mechanics and the scenarios created around them also help quite a lot. The basics are incredibly simple. Garcia's arsenal includes three long-range weapons - a handgun, a shotgun, and a sub-machine gun - a torch that can be used as a short-range weapon, and a Light Shot, which is used to dispel barriers made of darkness, stun enemies temporarily, light up certain locations and more. Stunned enemies can also be killed with a gloriously gory special attack that is extremely effective, sometimes maybe a little too much. Outside of upgrades to weapons, which unlock new combat options, Garcia's moveset doesn't change during the course of the game, but the combat scenarios and the enemies do, and quite a bit.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241016134345_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the beginning of the journey, for example, the player is told that staying in the darkness is extremely bad and that Garcia can only resist inside for a set amount of time before his health starts dropping. However, as the adventure proceeds, darkness becomes an invaluable ally to the demon hunter, as standing in it will allow him to shoot switches to unlock doors, uncover weak points of specific demons, and even take down some of them without having to get into an intense fight. The way the game twists its simple mechanics to provide variety is remarkable, and very few games managed to achieve this so competently. With the addition of some simple mini-games, genre-bending sequences like the classic sidescrolling shoot'em up sequences in Chapter 4, and some amazing boss battles, with the exception of a couple of endgame fights, the experience never gets stale for its entire duration. The lack of any side venture or collectibles, ultimately, damages the experience's replay value a bit, but also makes it so that it can keep this engaging pace without faltering. Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered adds a much-requested New Game Plus mode, which is a great way to experience Garcia's journey again without having to worry about upgrades. A couple of new costumes round up the additions included in the remaster, which are not game-changing in any capacity but are still nice to have.</p>
<p>As a remaster, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is not in any way close to the best remasters released in recent years, featuring a middling visual upgrade and an extremely limited amount of new content. As a way to give Suda51 and Mikami's collaboration a second chance, however, it definitely delivers. Over a decade after its release, the Shadows of the Damned experience continues to be one of a kind and one that's worth experiencing for all fans of the two legendary Japanese developers.</p>

<p>As a remaster, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered leaves something to be desired, offering minimal visual improvements, no graphics options on PC, and no gameplay enhancements. However, it's still a worthwhile purchase for fans of Suda51, Shinji Mikami, and third-person shooters., as the quality of the original experience still shines through, with its relentless pace, engaging story, memorable characters, and a dark humor that's hard to find in games today. Garcia Hotspur's war against Fleming to save Paula remains just as captivating now as it was in 2013.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-update-crossovers-cyberpunk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie poker roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has received a brand new update, and it's bringing crossover card skins based on popular franchises like&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, and more.</p>

<p>This update constitutes the second part of the "Friends of Jimbo" event, which was first revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap">August's Nintendo Direct presentation</a>&nbsp;and which has already seen the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Witcher</em>,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>joining&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>(with the latter even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro">returning the favor recently</a>).</p>

<p>The latest Friends of Jimbo update brings four new franchises into the&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>fold:&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>,&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, each of which gets a number of cards based on "fan-favorite characters".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/balatro-update-crossover-cards-stardew-valley.jpg?itok=49QhJLB8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/balatro-update-crossover-cards-stardew-valley.jpg?itok=LrJL_O6B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has some new crossover cards for you to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>Just like the first Friends of Jimbo update, this&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>crossover content is entirely free, and it's up for grabs across all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is currently available as well, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-mobile-release-date">mobile devices</a>.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that this isn't the big&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>update that developer LocalThunk <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon">promised back in August</a>. That one is set to bring "new ideas and strategies" to&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, and it's set to launch sometime next year.</p>

<p>If you've somehow managed to avoid the&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>hype, it's a poker-based roguelike created by Canadian developer LocalThunk, and it's based around creating big combos and game-breaking strategies to reach higher and higher score multipliers.</p>

<p>While the game is based on poker, it's more about creating synergy across the cards in your deck so that you can keep meeting a series of rising point antes over the course of a run.</p>




<p>Shortly after being released,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million">crossed 500,000 sales</a>, hitting the million mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million">within a month of its initial launch</a>. At last count, the game had reached two million sales, and that number is only likely to increase as time goes on.</p>

<p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/balatro/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/balatro/9PK087LNGJC5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/balatro-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-model-l-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best Model L attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Merlin Mini</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-comms-weapons-attachments-intel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6 Model L</a> excels in medium-ranged engagements, with a slow fire rate that’s easy to control and consistent damage. The iron sights aren’t the best, so the <strong>Merlin Mini </strong>is a nice choice for Optic. Then, to keep you off the enemy’s radar, the <strong>Suppressor</strong> Muzzle is a vital option. </p>



<p>Boosting the damage range and bullet velocity is the <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong>, making the weapon even more effective at range. Then, the <strong>Extended Mag I</strong> gives you more than enough bullets in a mag to finish off multiple enemies. Lastly, the <strong>Commando Grip</strong> improves handling with a decrease in aim down sight and sprint-to-fire speeds.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-model-l">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for Model L</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Flak Jacket</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Frag Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>Perks are a vital aspect of any loadout in BO6, and so we’ve chosen <strong>Assassin</strong>, <strong>Double Time</strong>, and <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> to get the Enforcer Combat Speciality. Then, <strong>Perk Greed</strong> allows you to select another Perk, and I find <strong>Flak Jacket </strong>to be a huge lifesaver, especially when enemies are lobbing grenades at the objective.</p>



<p>As for Equipment, <strong>Frag Grenades</strong> are a classic tool for catching enemies in enclosed spaces, while the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> keeps you topped up with health. Finally, we’ve gone with the <strong>Trophy System</strong> to support the team in capturing objectives.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-model-l">Best Secondary for Model L</h2>



<p>The best Secondary weapon for the Model L is the <strong>Grekhova</strong>, a fully automatic pistol that can support your battles in close-range situations. As the Model L is a long-range AR, this Secondary keeps you covered in those close-combat situations where you need something that has a faster fire rate and more mobility.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-model-l-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock Model L in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You will unlock the Model L in Black Ops 6 by reaching Level 40. This will take some time, but by playing objective-based modes and gaining as much XP as possible, you should get there in a relatively fast fashion.</p>



<p>Check out our guide on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to rank up fast</a> if you’re eager for tips on unlocking the gun quickly.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-model-l-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the Model L any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The Model L is great on medium and large-sized maps, but it isn’t he best at close ranges due to its slow fire rate. So, with that said, it’s an excellent AR but you’ll need to play to its strengths to get the most out of it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">When Season 14 arrives in December for Overwatch 2, Blizzard will bring back 6v6 matches with two different tests. The original game featured those team sizes, but the sequel controversially replaced that setup with 5v5 competitions.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller detailed the upcoming 6v6 experiments on <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's website</a>. The first test should land during the first week of Season 14 (currently scheduled to launch December 10) and will incorporate team compositions of "at least 1 of each role, and no more than 3." Then, in the middle of Season 14, Overwatch 2 will try out "the classic 2-2-2 composition" with a few changes.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="821744087" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

different ways that we might implement a change without running into the same problems we had previously." There seems to be a lot up for consideration for Overwatch 2 in regard to 6v6. For instance, Keller stated that previously he couldn't foresee 5v5 and 6v6 both working together in the sequel. But now, he's open to the idea.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-6v6-sort-of/1100-6525278/" data-ref-id="1100-6525278">Bringing back 6v6 for Overwatch 2</a> was initially broached in July.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dayz">DayZ</a> may have just turned a decade old, but it's seemingly more popular than ever, setting a new highest daily active user count of over 500,000 players.</p>
<p>DayZ's second expansion, Frostline, has tempted - and tempted back - hundreds of thousands of players, with 501,222 logging on on 20th October: 235,618 on Steam, 113,897 on PlayStation, and 152,037 on Xbox.</p>

<p>That's not all, either; the second expansion has also set a new concurrent record on Steam, clocking up a new record of 78,937 simultaneous players. At the same time, 33,000 users were on PlayStation, and 36,000 on Xbox.</p>
<p>DayZ Frostline sees you "brave the elements and embrace the chilling new challenges", bringing a new "depth of survival gameplay as the bitter cold sweeps across the land". Either alone or with a team, you can expect "countless opportunities for thrilling encounters and unexpected alliances".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-space-age-dlc-sales-400k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>has reached a pretty impressive sales milestone despite being on release for less than a week, developer Wube Software has revealed.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-434" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Friday Facts</a>&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>blog post, Wube says that&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>sales have passed the 400,000 mark. Earlier this week,&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>enjoyed its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-player-count-space-age-20-update">highest ever concurrent player count</a>&nbsp;thanks to the launch of said DLC, as well as the base game's 2.0 update.</p>

<p>By way of one "last little surprise" for&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>, Wube also announced a new feature called the Galaxy of Fame. Essentially, when you finish&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>'s campaign, you'll be able to upload a snapshot of your game, which will then add your game's info and stats to a collective gallery.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/factorio-space-age-dlc-sales-galaxy-of-fame.jpg?itok=i9XKn2Cu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/factorio-space-age-dlc-sales-galaxy-of-fame.jpg?itok=M6KBCYkA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Galaxy of Fame allows&nbsp;<em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>players to immortalize their achievements.</figcaption></figure><p>While you're looking at the Galaxy of Fame, you can browse other player' factories and get a glimpse into their inner workings. Wube says it isn't banning "saves that use cheats/commands/editor" yet, although more "filtering options" will soon be added.</p>

<p>The studio also provides an update on&nbsp;<em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>and the 2.0 update for Nintendo Switch. Sadly, if you were hoping for the DLC to hit Nintendo's console, there's some bad news: the Switch isn't getting&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>.</p>

<p>Wube says that there's "simply not enough RAM" in the Switch to fit&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>'s new factories, nor is there enough CPU to run the DLC at 60fps thanks to the expanded systems. New sprites also won't fit in the Switch's VRAM, apparently.</p>

<p>However, the 2.0 update will be making its way to the Switch. Wube says it should arrive in "1-2 months", although the studio is reluctant to commit to a release date "since the release process on consoles takes a long time".</p>




<p><em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/645390/Factorio_Space_Age/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and the base game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also available on Steam</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/factorio-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

If you look at titles such as <em>Resident Evil 4</em> and <em>Resident Evil 2</em>, they clearly know how to modernize famous franchises for today’s audiences, while remaining mainly faithful to the source material.

Most point toward the quality-of-life features like the ability to skip time between cases, and the overall polish of the remaster. It’s a stable, smooth game that’s downright fun to play.</p><p>However, even the most user-friendly gaming experience will attract negative reviews. <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em> isn’t perfect, and the bad reviews point out its flaws in spades.

<p>Those looking to for a reason as to why Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown sold below expectations thus leading to a sequel being rejected need to look to the top of Ubisoft. </p>



<p>That’s what Michael Douse, the director of publishing at Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios, had to say about the situation. </p>



<p>In a social media post (h/t <a href="https://80.lv/articles/baldur-s-gate-3-publishing-director-blames-ubisoft-for-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-s-poor-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80 Level</a>), Douse pointed the fingers at Ubisoft management, saying that the decision to not release the game on Steam day one hurt any chance of the game’s success.</p>



<p>“The last notable game on their platform was arguably Far Cry 6 in 2021,” <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1849147473354211400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Douse said</a>. “The Crew, Mirage and Avatar came in 2023 and didn’t perform, so you can assume subscriptions were at a lull when PoP released by 2024. Which means people wouldn’t be launching their store all too much.</p>



<p>“If it had released on Steam not only would it have been a market success, but there would likely be a sequel because the team are so strong.”</p>



<p>He then went on to call out the game’s critical success across the board.</p>



<p>“It’s such a broken strategy,” he said. “The hardest thing is to make a 85+ game — it is much, much easier to release one. It just shouldn’t be done as it was.</p>

<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown has sold around one million copies since its launch, far below what the internal expectations were for the game. Insider Gaming learned that Ubisoft was was expecting the game to sell on par, or better, than some of biggest Metroidvania’s in the market. When that didn’t happen right away, a decision was made to move on from the project.</p>



<p>Now, the team that developed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is no more after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft disbanded them to move on</a> to different games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-finally-fixes-blu-scouts-pants-17-years-after-team-fortress-2-came-out<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve has finally fixed a problem with Team Fortress 2 that’s been in the game since it launched 17 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since the influential hero shooter came out on October 10, 2007, the Scout’s pants on the blue side were the wrong color. Now, among <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/231496" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a> for a recently released Team Fortress 2 update, Valve buried the big news: Scout’s pants are now fixed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the rather innocuous line from the patch notes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed BLU Scout using the incorrect team color pants</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">In typical Valve fashion, it made the change without explanation or fanfare. No explanation for why it’s taken 17 years to change the color of Scout’s pants, and no reason for why it’s done so only now. Ever mysterious, Valve is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say the reaction from the Team Fortress 2 community has been a mix of shock and excitement. “They changed a character design 17 years later! What!” X/Twitter user @heavyfortres asked.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— heavy team fortres 2 (@heavyfortres) <a href="https://twitter.com/heavyfortres/status/1849564536795242979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Honestly I can't believe they did it,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1gbcl0t/comment/ltl0s4x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor KyleTheWalrus added</a>. “BLU Scout had gray pants and blue belt loops for 17 years, and he has several cosmetics that require the gray pants color to work correctly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If they fixed anything, I was sure they would just make the belt loops gray because it's easier. But those crazy bastards took the hard route.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now we wait another 17 years for the rest of Scout's pants cosmetics to become the correct shade of blue. Hooray!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve’s relationship with the Team Fortress 2 community has certainly had its ups and downs over the years. The game’s had an awful bot problem for some time, and exacerbated players often call for Valve to do more to clamp down. They’ve also asked for more support and content for Team Fortress 2 from Valve, which, some say, is more focused on its other, more popular games. Team Fortress 2 remains incredibly popular, though, and is among one of Steam’s most played games ahead of the likes of Warframe, Overwatch 2, and Destiny 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-fortress-2-players-make-an-actual-book-out-of-340000-anti-bot-petition-signatures-and-deliver-it-to-valve-hq">Team Fortress 2 players got creative in the fight against the shooter's rampant bot problem</a> by turning a 340,000 signature strong petition into an actual book and delivering it to Valve headquarters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>A new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-25/" data-ref-id="5000-618409">EA Sports College Football 25</a> is here, and a whole lot more college athletes are being added to the game--718 of them, to be precise. The update also contains upgrades to player abilities, rating adjustments, Team Builder, and generative AI features. Here's everything that's new, as well as the full patch notes.</p><p>The update is adding 718 new NIL players, and also new to the game is Nissan Stadium, which will be the default stadium for PlayStation tournaments. The latest update also includes a number of ratings updates for players, as well as an update to overall team rankings. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-uniforms-in-ea-sports-college-football-25/2900-5621/" data-ref-id="2900-5621">Uniform</a> pieces have also been updated or newly added for almost 50 teams in the game.</p><p>The new update also adds Play A Friend mode to College Ultimate Team for the first time, and increased the AP limit to 12 for Season 3.</p><p>Also new in the update is an upgrade for Team Builder that adds Adobe Express integration, providing generative AI tools to create designs, which could prove to be controversial for some players. The tools can be accessed from the logos page, where you'll now see a "Create with Adobe Express" link. You'll need to create or log into an existing Adobe account to use Express, which will provide 25 credits. These can be spent to generate new logos, or you can use to Express create something from scratch.</p><p>While these are the main new additions in the patch, it also contains a whole lot of bug fixes, covering common bugs across regular gameplay, Dynasty, Ultimate Team, and more.</p><p>For everything that's new in the latest update, check out the full patch notes below:</p><h2>Title Update Notes</h2><h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><h4>General</h4><ul><li>Refreshed the Ability Loadouts of players in Front End Rosters.  <ul><li>DEV NOTE: <i>These ability changes are based on current player performance this season and changes to their ratings.

                <p>Blizzard is releasing a highly sought-after mount for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s 20th anniversary, but it's turned out to be the game's most expensive mount yet. The Trader's Gilded Brutosaur is just the second Brutosaur mount Blizzard has released, and it costs an eye-watering $90.</p><p>The Gilded Brutosaur's kit isn't just pretty, as it also comes with built-in functionality, allowing you to check your mail or auctions on the go. The golden harness set is themed after WoW's 20th anniversary, set with gems that represent each of the MMORPG's expansions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4390282-wow_traders_brutosaurmount_bnetshop_featureimage-specials_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390282" data-ratio="0.56283422459893" data-width="1496" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4390282-wow_traders_brutosaurmount_bnetshop_featureimage-specials_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390282"></a><figcaption>The Gilded Brutosaur mount</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4390282-wow_traders_brutosaurmount_bnetshop_featureimage-specials_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>The new mount is just the second time WoW has offered a Brutosaur mount, after the Mighty Caravan Brutosaur added with Battle for Azeroth--which also became infamous for its high price.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/25/towers-of-aghasba-preview-explore-survive-and-rebuild-in-a-withered-ecosystem/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Towers of Aghasba is a fascinating melting pot of ideas, both novel and new, and borrowed from other games, movies and anime. It’s one of those games that feels almost impossibly ambitious, Dreamlit inc. crafting a truly gorgeous game world that you’ll shape as you fill it with life.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towers of Aghasba: Early Access Gameplay Showcase + Release Date Announcement!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Cm-02rxXdY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game will take you to the desolate landscapes of Aghasba, a region that was once home to huge amounts of vibrant life, both in nature and with the Shimu people settled there. That civilisation and the balance of ecosystems was torn apart by the Withered, forcing the Shimu to flee. Now you, as a junior architect for your people, are returning to restore Aghasba to something of its former glory.</p>


<p>Dreamlit inc. CEO and game director Khang Lee is refreshingly open about how he came to the core concept of Towers of Aghasba, and how it’s morphed over time. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/30/shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-review/">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, and the films <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(film)">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(1986_film)">Labyrinth</a> were all amongst the early inspirations for this game – essentially, looking to harness the creativity of Minecraft within a much prettier art style and world – and Towers of Aghasba actually started out as a 2D side scrolling game. But then came <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> to push the studio’s ambitions further – you can see it in the free climbing and glider – and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-cross-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> to refocus the game in a different direction. What was a survival game in 2019 has had some of the edges of that genre sanded back to morph into more of a building and exploration game.</p>


<p>You’ll naturally need to start off small as you plant your first Colossal Tree – it starts off relatively small, but will grow to live up to its name over time – a life-giving tree that will instantly spread grasses and other plant life in the immediate surrounding area. It will define the biome of the region, bring creatures back to the area and create a little pocket of vibrant life for you to live in. There’s some really fantastical creature designs here, that blend the familiar with utterly alien.</p>
<p>It will also provide the foundation for a lot of the general activities you’ll be doing, giving you the opportunities to hunt, to fish, to feed the animals and more. One point of emphasis here compared to other survival and builder games is that you will likely want to try and be sustainable in how you do this, ensuring the the ecosystem can continue to thrive alongside your actions.</p>

<p>In parallel to the local ecology, you’ll also look to rebuild villages for the Shimu. You’ll come across the ruins from before the Withered forced your people away, and have to rebuild structure-by-structure. You’ll need to find and harvest the minerals to build the structures, and then use them to foster things like farming, production and more.</p>
<p>Helping to guide you is the world’s lore and a menagerie of characters and ancient gods that you’ll meet along the way. They’ll explore some of the backstory of the world, helping you figure out what happened to the island, giving you quests and missions to follow along the way. It’s really more about onboarding you and nudging you along the way to restore the island in your own way.</p>

<p>And that will mean fighting to push back the Withered and unlock new areas that you can restore. Still filled with a poisonous atmosphere and more horrific creatures, you’ll have to battle against towering monsters to loosen the Withered’s grip on the region.</p>
<p>Your time within the Withered will be limited, every second that you spend within these dark places seeing an inky black miasma bubbling around you, slowly poisoning you over time. The survival aspects of Towers of Aghasba won’t extend to needing food to satiate your hunger –&nbsp;it’s more casual in that regard –&nbsp;but as you step into the Withered, you’ll need to have crafted potions to help build a resistance to the atmosphere, armour to defend against the monsters and soldiers you face, and weapons to help you fight back.</p>
<p>Thankfully you won’t have to go alone. You can play in groups of up to four, inviting friends to your personal island, trading with them, and heading in to fight back the Withered together.</p>

<p>Towers of Aghasba is a fascinating endeavour that looks to strike an intriguing balance and blend between its various inspirations. It’s a lovely looking game, with an impressive scale and ambition to let you shape it as you please.</p>
<p>Thankfully it won’t be too long before we can try it for ourselves. Towers of Aghasba will launch into Early Access on PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> on 19th November, a little less than a month from now.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-13-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-3-set-to-launch-next-month.1019295/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-13-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.3, and it'll bring two new S-level characters to add to your team, plus new areas to explore and more.</p>

<p>Version 1.3 arrives on November 6th, and just like in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-12-release-date">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>updates, you can look forward to an expansion of the game's main story. This time around, you'll be working alongside the Hollow Investigative Association to respond to a new threat.</p>

<p>Two major S-level characters will be added to the game in this update as well. The first, Yanagi, is an Electric-Anomaly fighter who can boost Disorder damage for the team and "rapidly deal massive amounts of damage to enemies" with her Ex Special Attack.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.3-lighter.jpg?itok=_HtZT77y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.3-lighter.jpg?itok=HiD-Oqne 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lighter is one of two fighters being added to&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>in Version 1.3.</figcaption></figure><p>Your other fighter this update is Lighter, a Fire-Stun agent who can buff himself by building up his Morale as well as lowering enemies' resistances to the Ice and Fire elements. Two new A-level Bangboos, Baddieboo and Knightboo, are also coming in Version 1.3.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to two brand new gameplay modes. The first, The Mystery of Arpeggio Fault, is a roguelike mode that offers the chance to battle through "random environments with random Resonia and resources".</p>

<p>The Simulated Battle Trial, meanwhile, is pretty much what you think it is based on the name; it lets you practise your combat skills as you hack through increasingly tough enemies, and you can earn Polychromes and Badges by reaching certain levels in said trial.</p>




<p>In case you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is, it's the latest action RPG from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>studio HoYoverse. Unlike those games,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>takes place in an urban fantasy world that's not a million miles away from the likes of&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, however,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>takes its cues from games like&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>; it revolves around dealing quick damage, dodging enemy attacks, and racking up combos, although it does still feature HoYoverse's signature gacha mechanics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278893/amazon-like-a-dragon-yakuza-prime-tv<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>It was late when I watched the first episode of Amazon Prime Video’s <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em>. I bargained with myself to watch one episode before sleep; three episodes later, I finally went to bed. Let’s get this out of the way: if you’re looking for <em>Like a Dragon </em>to be a faithful representation of the<em> Yakuza </em>video game series, you’re going to be disappointed. But that’s what makes it worth watching. <em>Like a Dragon</em>’s unique approach to storytelling blends two different timelines together, making for a show that works on its own merit, without needing all the trappings of a<em> Yakuza </em>video<em> </em>game.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Like a Dragon</em> is Amazon’s second bite at the video game adaptation apple after the surprising success of its <em>Fallout</em> show. It stars Ryoma Takeuchi as Kazuma Kiryu, an orphaned youth who joins the Tojo yakuza clan with dreams of earning the title of Dragon of Dojima.</p><p><em>Like a Dragon</em>’s story is loosely based on the events of the first two <em>Yakuza</em> games and is told across two concurrently running timelines in 1995 and 2005. Each of the series’ six episodes jumps between the two time periods, chronicling Kiryu’s rise and fall as a yakuza member, the shattering of his chosen family, and how those pieces are violently smashed back together 10 years later.</p><div><figcaption><em>Kiryu (far left) and the members of his chosen family.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Amazon MGM Studios</cite></p></div><p>What initially shocked me most about <em>Like a Dragon</em> and what most cleanly separates it from its source material is all the violence. I’m aware of the irony: this is a mob show; people tend to get hurt in those. But the <em>Yakuza </em>series has always been deliberate in how it depicts violence. Guns are rare and murder is rarer, but <em>Like a Dragon</em> has both in abundance. The games also depict their fair share of blood, but those are typically in street brawls fought with fists and the occasional traffic cone. There was one murder in the show, of a civilian no less, so shocking in its casual execution that it actually made me queasy.</p><div><p>Like a Dragon probably won’t do for Yakuza what Fallout did for… well, Fallout</p></div><p>All the time skipping is the most interesting element of the show and the reason I don’t mind that it bears little resemblance to the games. In 1995, Kiryu was surrounded by the love of his chosen family and the respect of his yakuza brothers. By 2005, all of that had rotted away into distant animosity, and it was fun watching how the show reconciled it all. Rather than simply tell the story chronologically, <em>Like a Dragon</em> intentionally created gaps in understanding with one timeline and then filled them in with the other. In 1995, Kiryu has two father figures: the ex-yakuza who raised him in an orphanage and his clan leader. In 2005, both men are absent, and Kiryu has since been branded as an oyagoroshi — or “father killer.” The back and forth created a thrilling tension, compelling me to work alongside the show to piece the plot together like it was a mystery in addition to its basic gangster plot of revenge and betrayal. And I was pleasantly surprised by the resolution.</p><p>Since <em>Like a Dragon</em>’s violence feels antithetical to the spirit of the source material, I’m glad that the show didn’t also try to incorporate the series’ wackier elements. <em>Yakuza</em> is a video game and is therefore not subject to the mundanities of realism. Kiryu fighting grown men in diapers — a regular occurrence in the games — works because you, the player, are in on the joke and are participating in its telling.</p><div><figcaption><em>The show’s set and styling are the most like the </em>Yakuza<em> games rather than the story itself.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Amazon MGM Studio</cite></p></div><p>But while <em>Yakuza</em>’s heartfelt story of redemption and its aesthetics as a Japanese gangster thriller translated well to TV, its over-the-top goofiness doesn’t. The story can’t bear that level of irreverence because there’s no player driving the action. Cutting from a moment of extreme violence to Kiryu at the Kamurocho batting cages, while a totally authentic representation of the games, would have created a tonal whiplash that would have taken even the most diehard <em>Yakuza</em> fan out of the show.&nbsp;</p><p>But dispensing with comedy in exchange for drama does mean the show gets a bit tedious in its later episodes. Paramount’s <em>Halo</em> series also bears no resemblance to its source material, but it was interesting as hell (and canceled far too soon) because it was willing to use familiar characters in totally new narratives. <em>Like a Dragon</em> adds some new characters and remixes familiar story elements, but it’s basically the same story I’ve experienced before in the games.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Kiryu fighting grown men in diapers — a regular occurrence in the games — works because you, the player, are in on the joke</p></div><p>A lot of video game adaptations fail because they seem to operate from the premise that being just like the game is entertainment enough. The story gets twisted to fit all the little details that’ll make a fan sit up and say, “I get that reference,” leading to a boring, annoying mess, like when <em>Doom</em> shoehorned in that nausea-inducing first-person sequence. But <em>Like a Dragon</em> works precisely because it didn’t go for being a straight-up recreation of the games. It probably won’t do for<em> Yakuza</em> what <em>Fallout</em> did for… well, <em>Fallout</em>. But <em>Like a Dragon</em> is made better because it puts being good TV first over being a faithful adaptation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rebecca Jones (RPS in peace) really liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/10-dead-doves">10 Dead Doves</a> when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/13-great-steam-next-fest-demos-to-get-you-started-this-october">she wrote about it</a> back in 2022, saying it reminded her of why she “loves weird low-budget spooks so much”. Discovering such an interesting project speaks to curiosity and taste on her part, but me? I am simply a pun enjoying buffon who got an email promising that “Dovecraftian horrors await”. The thrust of said electronic mail was that the game now has a release date of this December, but it looked neat, so I doved right in. I coo-dn’t resist. I too love weird low-budget <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>. I have been pigeonholed.</p>

<p>Distinct from the implied narrative conceit mainly revolving around poisoned chips, 10 Dead Doves opens with Marcus - “the Most Pathetic Man on Earth” - going backpacking on the Appalachian Trail with his buddy Sean, searching for an urban-legendary place called “The Ant Farm”. Presentation is all medium poly papercraft and fixed angles, tank controls and all. It’s very odd and very fun. You can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1564540/10_Dead_Doves/">demo here</a>, by the way.</p>
<p>This is likely part cop-out and part time constraints, but I feel the highest praise I can give what I’ve played of 10 Dead Doves is that I don’t feel I could adequately do it word-justice in anything less than a much longer article. I will say this: while I do not feel it’s attempting to be the indie game equivalent of an A24 film in any way, I do <em>feel</em> that my fellow A24 wankers will likely appreciate it. I’d compare it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indika">Indika</a>, almost, in the way it uses the sort of camera techniques, spatial tricks and disorientating artistry that feel like they’re film specific, but are actually implemented in ways only a game could pull off.</p><p>If this sounds overly worthy or highfalutin, I should say that it’s also just very funny. Nothing sums up the scrappy avant-garde approach better than the devs singing the game title acapella over the splash screen. Some of the language used in the more eldritch sections is winkingly baroque, and the way the character’s faces dart jarringly between distinct expressions is brilliant. I actually didn’t finish the entire demo since I plan to grab this on release, but it’s shot right up for me as a must-play for the year. It’s a Columbidae-te, then. One for the massive cross section of ornithology enthusiasts and indie horror fans, that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
