Others, however, believe the bottom left 'finger' is simply flesh falling off the little finger above it, although there are irregularities with the present boxes and ribbons in the bottom right, too. Generative AI often struggles with hands, adding extra fingers where they shouldn't be.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/share-20241206-1244480-1-1733745842140.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Black Ops 6's 'Necroclaus' loading screen. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another image of a gloved hand was used to show off a new Zombies community event. It contains what looks like six fingers with no thumb on-screen, suggesting up to seven digits on this hand.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/share-20241206-1244200-1-1733745876407.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The central image includes a gloved hand with some odd things going on. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Activision for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of the Zombie Santa image sparked a closer look at other images in Black Ops 6, which some in the Call of Duty community have now called into question. Redditor Shaun_LaDee highlighted three images included in paid bundles that have irregularities that could suggest the use of generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now calling on Activision to disclose the use of generative AI for art that is included in bundles that are sold. And as others have pointed out, Steam operator Valve now has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI disclosure rules</a> that call on publishers and developers to describe how they use AI in the development and execution of their games. As part of this, Valve has told developers it will include their disclosures on the Steam store page of their game, “so customers can also understand how the game uses AI.” Currently, Call of Duty’s Steam page has no such disclosure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wired</a> reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic">Activision sold an “AI-generated cosmetic” for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 last year</a>. The cosmetic in question was not named, but was linked to the Yokai’s Wrath bundle released in December 2023. The store did not disclose any use of generative AI for this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle cost 1,500 COD Points, the premium virtual currency sold for real-world money that generates hundreds of millions of dollars for Activision each year. 1,500 COD Points is approximately valued at $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wired pointed out that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard after its $69 billion acquisition of the company last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>cut 1,900 staff from its gaming business</u></a> just months after Activision sold this skin. The report alleged that 2D artists’ jobs were being replaced by AI at the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of 2D artists were laid off,” one anonymous Activision artist told the site. “Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.” Activision employees were allegedly “made” to sign up for AI training, with its use promoted throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>It's once again that special time of year when we give you a chance to do well by doing good. That's right—it's time for the 2024 edition of our annual Charity Drive!</p>
<p>Every year <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/11/the-opposable-thumbs-childs-play-giveaway-you-donate-we-give-you-stuff/">since 2007</a>, we've encouraged readers to give to <a href="https://childsplaycharity.org/">Penny Arcade's Child's Play charity</a>, which provides toys and games to kids being treated in hospitals around the world. In recent years, we've added&nbsp;the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> to our charity push, aiding in their efforts to defend Internet freedom. This year, as always, we're providing some extra incentive for those donations by offering donors a chance to win pieces of our big pile of vendor-provided swag. We can't keep it, and we don't want it clogging up our offices, so it's now yours to win.</p>
<p>This year's swag pile is full of high-value geek goodies. <strong>We have dozens of prizes valued at over $4,000 total</strong>, including gaming hardware and collectibles, computer accessories, apparel, and more. In 2023, Ars readers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/ars-readers-gave-nearly-40000-in-our-2023-charity-drive/">raised nearly $40,000 for charity</a>, contributing to a total haul of <strong>more than $506,000 since 2007.</strong> We want to raise even more this year, and we can do it if readers dig deep.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Donating is easy. Simply <a href="https://childsplay.salsalabs.org/Donate/index.html">donate to Child's Play</a> using a credit card or PayPal or <a href="http://eff.org/AT2014">donate to the EFF</a> using PayPal, credit card, or cryptocurrency. You can also support Child's Play directly by using <a href="https://my.onecause.com/fundraiser/organizations/8534d777-53ce-4d94-a537-c8e0cbb7acb0/fundraisers/fundraiser:ae0c129c-94ac-4e63-a265-20b71ac4bd03">this Ars Technica campaign page</a> or picking an item from the Amazon wish list of a specific hospital on <a href="https://childsplaycharity.org/get-involved#hospital-map">its donation page</a>. Donate as much or as little as you feel comfortable with—every little bit helps.</p>

            <p>Bandai Namco's shuttered MMORPG Blue Protocol project has been extended a new lifeline courtesy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-funded developer Bokura.</p>
<p>At the end of August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-and-amazon-games-published-mmorpg-blue-protocol-has-worldwide-release-cancelled">Bandai Namco announced plans to shut down the servers of its anime MMORPG Blue Protocol</a> in Japan and cancelled its release in the West altogether, saying "it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you".</p>

<p>Now, however, Blue Protocol has been reincarnated as Star Resonance, with some of its original development team joining the new one at Bokura. Although set in the same world as Blue Protocol, Regnas, the team said Star Resonance players can expect a reworked gameplay and storyline.</p>
<p>And it seems Bokura has hit the ground running, too. A <a href="https://bpm.bkrgame.com/web202412/news-detail.html?newsid=18543902">closed beta test</a> is already planned for players on Android devices and PC, although sadly, that's only open to Chinese players for now.</p>
<p>As yet, there's no firm release date either in China, Japan, or beyond. Blue Protocol's servers are due to go dark on 18th January 2025 (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namcos-unsuccessful-mmorpg-blue-protocol-to-be-reincarnated-as-star-resonance-by-chinese-studio/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Ed went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-protocol-is-amazons-next-punt-on-east-meets-west">hands-on with Blue Protocol last year</a>, which was set to follow the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a> and New World as Amazon Games' next big MMO. However, he had concerns of whether the game could differentiate itself from its key competitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle looks stunning with <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/">path tracing</a>, but even the most powerful GPUs currently on the market cannot run the game at native 4K resolution and max setting at anything above 30 FPS.</p>
<p>Making some compromises in terms of settings and resolution, however, definitely looks worth it, as path tracing makes the game developed by MachineGames outright stunning, as highlighted in a comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TyrianYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyrian</a> on YouTube. The video also clearly shows how an RTX 4080 has trouble hitting 60 FPS during the introduction sequence at 4K resolution and with NVIDIA DLSS at the Balanced setting.</p>

<p>Much like the other games supporting path tracing like Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle makes it pretty clear that it will be some time until it will be possible to run games with full path tracing at high native resolutions, as even an RTX 4090 cannot push past the 30 FPS mark at native 4K resolution and max settings, as shown in the test shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Mostly_Positive_Reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mostly Positive Reviews</a>. The most powerful GPU on the market struggles at native 1440p resolution as well, barely hitting the 50 FPS range in the most demanding of the two testing scenarios.</p>

<p>Leaks about upcoming playable Marvel Rivals characters have surfaced online, revealing new details about Ultron and The Thing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-the-thing-leak">Marvel Rivals The Thing Leak</h2>



<p>The Thing is set to be <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1865513703044485624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another Tank</a> for Marvel Rivals. The character’s passive ability is Solid as a Rock, which makes him immune to enemy knockback and displacement effects. The character’s primary attack is Combination Punch, which releases quick and continuous punches. Their secondary attack is Thunderbolt Punch, which releases a devastating blow at the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Thing’s E ability in Marvel Rivals is Battlefield Support, which will make him jump towards teammates and reduce damage for allies and himself. His L Shift move is Furious Charge, which triggers a Continuous Forward charge that pummels enemies in your way and leaves a seismic zone behind you. Lastly, The Thing’s ultimate is called Slam Moment, and it knocks all enemies in front of you in the air.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-ultron-leak-nbsp">Marvel Rivals Ultron Leak&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As per <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1864338925164093603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RivalLeaks</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Ultron will be a supporting character in Marvel Rivals. His primary attack will be the Encephalo-Ray, an energy beam, and his secondary move is Dynamic Flight, which allows him to quickly fly in the direction of movement and then enter a free-flight mode. Ultron’s E ability is Imperative: Firewall, which provides health to allies within range with the help of drones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultron’s L Shift ability in Marvel Rivals is Imperative: Patch, which releases a giant drone that follows an ally, healing them and others within range. Ultron’s passive ability, called Algorithm Correction, allows him to jump and fall slowly. His ultimate is Rage of Ultron, which releases Ultron Drones that Encephalo-Rays at enemies or heal allies. RivalLeaks added in another post that Ultron might be released <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1865940057988935760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sooner than we think</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
A year has now passed since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-the-things-we-noticed-in-the-gta-6-trailer-you-may-have-missed">Rockstar's record-breaking first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer</a> landed, and there's been no real news on the game since.
</p>
<p>
While some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-fans-think-rockstars-hidden-yet-another-clue-in-the-moon">fans look to GTA 6's moon for word on when we'll hear more</a>, others are taking matters into their own hands - by going back to last December's trailer and using it to build bits of the game for themselves. 
</p>
<p>
There are several shots in the video below by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FyfT3zs3mQ">Dark Space</a> that, at a glance, could be mistaken for the real thing. The video shows a street from Vice Beach and some of the  downtown Stockyard area recreated using custom assets and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> engine.

Later, Dark Space mocks up a rumoured cutscene, where players will apparently hook a chain to a safe to rip it out of a pawn shop using a truck. As they say, it'll be interesting to see how close to the final game all of this looks - whenever the time comes.
</p><p>
There's also a section where we see the estimated size of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s map from above, as a plane flies over both it and the GTA 5 map at the same speed. The inferrance here is that GTA 6's map will be bigger than its predecessor's - though this was to be expected, and exact measurements are likely best saved for the final game.

Rockstar publisher Take-Two has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">GTA 6 set to launch in late 2025</a>. Next year is a big one for the company, with Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country both also set to arrive between April 2025 and the end of March 2026.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-reveal-trailer-brilliantly-recreated-in-real-life">GTA 6 reveal trailer has been recreated</a>. Earlier this year, fans remade the video using real-life footage and actors.

<p>Speaking of actors, our Christian Donlan recently took a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-hamlet-is-a-luminous-documentary-about-staging-shakespeare-inside-gta-online-that-brings-fresh-nuance-to-the-game-and-bard-alike">Grand Theft Hamlet, a luminous documentary about staging Shakespeare inside GTA Online</a> that brings fresh nuance to the game and bard alike.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has released a new job trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Mobile, showing its touchscreen battles for the first time.</p>
<p>The UI for Final Fantasy 14 - as with many MMORPGs - is particularly complex, with each job (or class) having multiple abilities mapped out on a player's hotbar. With the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-officially-revealed">announcement of Final Fantasy 14 Mobile</a>, many players wondered how this would transition to a mobile touchscreen.</p>
<p>Well now we know. The trailer - <a href="https://weibo.com/tv/show/1034:5108677439324201">shared on Chinese social media site Weibo</a> - includes battle animations for all of the nine starting jobs, with their various job actions located in the bottom right of the screen around a large central primary attack used for continuous combos.</p>

<p>Players can then cycle through abilities, with cooldowns clearly displayed, while health and MP are located at the bottom of the screen as always.</p>
<p>It's tidy but, personally, looks far too small. When some jobs have up to 11 abilities to choose from, those ability icons look impossible to accurately select, while the fonts are tiny.</p>
<p>The trailer also does not include any character movement during battle, perhaps suggesting a simplified battle system without positionals (attacks where position around an enemy is vital for dealing damage). This also means there's no dodging of AoE attacks in this trailer, though perhaps that's indicative of a lazy player relying too much on their healer (we all know this from bitter experience).</p><p>Speaking of healing, the Scholar and White Mage jobs are the only characters in the trailer to switch targets (all others face a single enemy). It's still unclear how switching between friend and foe will work, though appears to be a quick direct tap of the screen - something else that could get fiddly in the heat of battle.</p>
<p>Still, it's impressive to see running and appears faithful to the original experience. Fans appear particularly impressed by the Monk and Summoner animations.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 14 Mobile will be free-to-play without gacha, and will follow the base game A Realm Reborn.</p> <div>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>'s fourth season starts tomorrow, marking the beginning of the end for Rocksteady's current roadmap.</p>
<p>From 10th December, players will be met with DC supervillain Deathstroke. The developer shared news of his debut with an image on social media platform X, although further details on the upcoming season for now remain pretty thin for now.</p>
<p>Rocksteady has thus far only committed to four seasons of content for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. It shared its <a href="https://x.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1749494429768146999/photo/1">2024 roadmap back in January</a>, promising new weapons, environments, gear and more. Things kicked off with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-first-post-launch-season-includes-playable-elseworlds-joker">arrival of The Joker in March</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-second-season-adds-frozone-esque-mrs-freeze">Mrs. Freeze joined in the summer</a>.</p>

<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-season-three-debuts-to-less-than-300-steam-players">Zoe Lawton joined for Kill the Justice League's third season</a>. However, her debut didn't particularly spark much enthusiasm among players. Perhaps Deathstroke will have better luck.</p>
<p>Then, after season four comes to an end, who knows what is going to happen with Suicide Sqaud: Kill the Justice League. It is fair to say the game failed to take off the way Rocksteady and publisher Warner Bros. had hoped.</p>

<p>Back in February of this year, Warner Bros.

Warner Bros. went on to attribute a $200m revenue loss to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>A report then followed in July, which stated a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">key reasons for the live-service game's failure</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sega has announced a sequel to its official Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba game, based on the popular manga and anime series.</p>
<p>Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2 will arrive next year across PC via Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and the "Nintendo Switch family of systems".</p>
<p>Like the first game, this will be an arena fighter with a story mode continuing where the original left off. It follows teenage protagonist Tanjiro Kamado and promises fans will be able to "relive many of the exciting moments from 'Entertainment District Arc', 'Swordsmith Village Arc', and 'Hashira Training Arc'".</p>

<p>Over in VS mode, the game will have a huge roster of 40 characters, including a return of all characters in the original game, its free post-launch updates, and paid DLC.</p>
<p>The nine Hashira (the highest rank of the Demon Slayer Corps) will also join in the sequel, including Muichiro Tokito and Mitsuri Kanroji.</p>
<p>Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles has sold over 4m units worldwide following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-demon-slayer-game-heads-west-in-october">release in 2021</a>, so there's certainly an appetite for this sequel.</p>
<p>The games are developed by CyberConnect2, the Japanese studio known for other anime and manga adaptations like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-ball-z-kakarot">Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/naruto-ultimate-ninja">Naruto: Ultimate Ninja</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It's been another weekend of records on Valve's Steam. Yesterday at 14:00 UTC, Steam itself broke a new concurrency record of 39.2 million users, over 12 million of whom were playing a game.&nbsp; Valve's platform continues to grow at an astonishing rate. In January, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-new-top-concurrent-player-number-record-nearing-34-million-connected-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> 33.6 million users; the 34 million threshold was <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-new-record-with-over-34-million-concurrent-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken</a> in early March and quickly surpassed by two new records (35 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-another-record-with-36-million-concurrent-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36 million</a>). The 37 million milestone was <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-37-2-million-concurrent-players-breaking-all-previous-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> in August, while the following Steam <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-hits-all-time-record-38-3-million-pc-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 38 million concurrent online users. Of course, these new peaks usually happen whenever big games are released, driving users to engage with the platform. That was the case this past weekend with Grinding Gear's Path of Exile 2 and NetEase's Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>The action RPG sequel launched into early access this past Friday and it's doing amazing numbers for a premium game (this early access phase is paid, while the full launch will be free to play) with a Steam player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2694490/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> at 578K around fourteen hours ago. So far, user reviews are also quite positive (82%), aligning with <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-hands-on-the-arpg-that-could-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Francesco De Meo's early access preview on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em> The Early Access version made it clear how Grinding Gear Games has a very strong idea of how to evolve the formula of its predecessor to deliver an experience that is, undoubtedly, very fun at all skill levels. Considering how the game manages to be both extremely welcoming and extremely deep at the same time, I have no doubt that Path of Exile 2 will only get better from here on out, having the potential to become one of the best action role-playing games ever released.</em></p>
<p>The game is performing well on all platforms,&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-redemptions-top-1-million-queues-over-the-weekend-are-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassing</a></span>&nbsp;a million users in total. In fact, the developers were forced to enable temporary server queues.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals also had a strong launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registering</a> a peak of 444K concurrent users on Steam during the week and then <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breaking</a> it with 480K users fourteen hours ago. However, the game has even more success on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X - <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to NetEase</a>, the team-based PvP superhero shooter has registered over 10 million players in the first three days. Of course, it has the advantage of being already free-to-play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-development-issues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a rare interview, Michel Ancel said that problems between management caused Beyond Good and Evil 2’s development issues.</p>



<p>The new interview came from French outlet <a href="https://www.superpouvoir.com/entretien-avec-michel-ancel-le-createur-de-rayman-et-beyond-good-evil-se-confie-sur-sa-nouvelle-vie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Superpouvoir</a>, where Ancel answered elaberated on the development issues of Beyond Good and Evil 2 and where he believes some of the accusations of toxic management, of which he denies, originates.</p>



<p>“On&nbsp;BGE2, for example, there were too many problems between managers. The artistic director wanted to redo everything constantly, <span>and the&nbsp;game director&nbsp;wanted to make a game of generated dungeo</span>ns. I dreamed of a space adventure. We could not agree and the&nbsp;game director&nbsp;took the project in other directions,” he said. </p>



<p>Ancel continued, “In this type of situation, teams find themselves tossed around and don’t even know who’s in charge and making decisions. The producer is supposed to sort things out, but that didn’t happen.&nbsp;Yves Guillemot&nbsp;even had to go down to Montpellier to get things back on track, but that wasn’t enough and the&nbsp;<em>game director</em>&nbsp;continued in his stubbornness. When I read in Libé that I was the one directing the game and asking for changes, I thought I was going to choke.&nbsp;<em>BGE2</em>&nbsp;is the game on which I don’t think I’ve ever questioned a decision.”</p>



<p>Michal Ancel left Ubisoft in 2020 to spend time in a wildlife sanctuary following burnout while working on games. One week later, though, accusations of toxic leadership by Ancel began to circulate, which Ancel firmly denied and continues to do so.</p>



<p>As of the time of writing, Ubisoft’s Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development. After nearly two years of development, it finally found its footing in early 2017. Speaking with sources, the game is still a couple of years out, though. We’ll share some exclusive details on the game later this week.</p>



<p>What do you think of the issues surrounding Beyond Good and Evil 2? Do you think it will ever be released? &nbsp;Let us know how it’s going on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Per a recent report, Apple and Sony are collaborating to bring third-party controller support for the Vision Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-08/apple-sony-talk-playstation-vr-ps-vr2-hand-controller-support-for-vision-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Apple approached Sony at the beginning of 2024 to bring support for PlayStation VR 2 controllers for the Vision Pro. Moreover, Apple has also had conversations with other third-party developers about featuring third-party controller support for their games on the VR platform. The controllers will not only be a valuable addition for gaming on the Vision Pro but also provide more control over the entire operating system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report adds that Apple and Sony had planned to announce PlayStation VR 2 controller support for the Vision Pro “weeks ago”; however, the announcement was postponed due to an undisclosed reason. Also, Sony has another hurdle to cross: selling their VR controllers as standalone accessories, as right now, they can only be acquired by purchasing the PlayStation VR 2 console. When the announcement does come, players will seemingly be able to grab the PS VR 2 controllers from Apple’s retail and online stores.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2's troubled development was due to "passionate managers" not getting along, the series' creator Michel Ancel has said.</p>
<p>The sequel to the cult classic adventure has been in development for almost 20 years (the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-overtakes-guinness-record-holder-duke-nukem-forever-as-game-longest-in-development">longest in history</a>), and has continued despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-quits-video-games-industry-to-work-on-wildlife-sanctuary">Ancel leaving Ubisoft back in 2020 due to retirement</a>. His departure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-says-michel-ancel-left-ubisoft-amid-investigation-into-his-toxic-behaviour">followed an investigation into allegations of toxic leadership</a> by French newspaper Libération.</p>
<p>Ancel has not spoken publicly about the game's development since, but in a new interview with French outlet <a href="https://www.superpouvoir.com/entretien-avec-michel-ancel-le-createur-de-rayman-et-beyond-good-evil-se-confie-sur-sa-nouvelle-vie/">SuperPouvoir</a> he has now discussed some of the tensions and accusations made against him.</p>

<p>Passion is a "fabulous energy", said Ancel, but can also lead to clashes. For BG&amp;E2, he stated how the game's art director had wanted to redo everything over and over, that the game's director had wanted a game of generated dungeons, while he "dreamed of a space adventure".</p><p>The trio were unable to agree on a direction, with the development team left not knowing who was ultimately in charge. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot even visited the Montpellier studio, Ancel said, but it wasn't enough and "the game director continued in his stubbornness", said Ancel.</p>
<p>"When I read in Libé that I was the one who was directing the game and asking for changes, I thought I was choking," Ancel said. "BG&amp;E2 is the game on which I think I have never questioned a decision.</p>
<p>"In the end, it is all a matter of passionate managers who have not gotten along. I believe that for some time now, these people have been let go and the project has found a certain balance with new leaders."</p>
<p>Ancel added there's a "huge difference" between developing BG&amp;E2 with new technology, and a project with established technology. This complexity "exceeded many people at Ubisoft".</p>
<p>He surmised there was no "single big villain" but multiple concerns left unresolved with managers. "I have my share of responsibility and I should have defended the project better, been more present and more conciliatory with the employees," he concluded.</p>
<p>According to the Libération report into Ancel's toxic leadership, his management of the project resulted in constant changes and fluctuations in scope, leading to "an unusual amount of [staff] exhaustion, depression, and burnout".</p>
<p>Ancel also discussed the end of WiLD, the project from his Wild Sheep studio originally announced in 2014 that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-prehistoric-open-world-adventure-wild-has-reportedly-been-cancelled">reported as having been cancelled in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Though a playable version had been established in 2018, Ancel said the studio chose to upgrade the game from PS4 to PS5. However, despite Sony offering double Ubisoft's budgets to take on the game as publisher, it was turned down and remained with Ubisoft.</p><p>This was during Ancel's burnout and subsequent departure from the industry. Without him there to defend the game, he said, it was "crushed" by Ubisoft due to changes made "without really playing the game", which Ancel described as "a real scandal". The game was later abandoned in 2020 due to no longer matching the original vision.</p>
<p>He added the "editorial department was in full explosion" at this time due to Ubisoft's internal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-exec-tommy-francois-leaves-company">investigation into former editorial vice president Tommy François</a> who had overseen development of WiLD, who was reportedly then fired.</p>
<p>Ancel joked 2018 was therefore "the beginning of the end" for both WiLD and BG&amp;E2, in his eyes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains in development</a>, it was confirmed again in October this year, with a new creative director once again at the helm.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In their latest update, Palworld developers have changed the behaviour of Pal Spheres while battling Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pal Spheres work like Pokeballs and capture and summon Pals in Palworld. However, after <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4477236636060484669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">version v0.3.11 </a>(spotted by <a href="https://nichegamer.com/palworld-removes-pal-sphere-summons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NicheGamer</a>), the Pal Spheres will have a different activation. Now, whenever a player uses a Pal Sphere, their Pal will be summoned near the player without them needing to throw the sphere. Also, the new update will display a reticle while aiming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest developments</a> on Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld, the former has alleged that the latter has infringed three different patents and is seeking damages of 10 million Yen (approximately USD 66,000). Pocket Pair replied, stating they “will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings” in the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Palxworld is getting its biggest island yet in December, which is about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-december-dlc-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six times bigger than Sakurajima</a>. Also, Palworld has finally launched for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-finally-launches-for-ps5-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 consoles in Japan</a>. What are your thoughts on Palworld changing how Pal Spheres work in the game?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> just hit an impressive milestone: 10 million players in three days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase’s free-to-play superhero team-based PvP shooter launched on December 6 across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. While Sony and Microsoft do not make PlayStation or Xbox player numbers public, Steam makes Valve stats available, and it’s there that Marvel Rivals is enjoying a particularly massive launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in Steam’s top five most-played games. It’s the 20th highest concurrent player number ever seen on Steam, ahead of the likes of Helldivers 2, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Destiny 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Marvel Rivals has a ‘mostly positive’ user review rating, with 76% of the 35,000 reviews tagged as positive. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review"><u>Marvel Rivals Review in Progress</u></a> to find out what we think.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel Rivals - Character Skins Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For NetEase, it will be hoping not only to keep Marvel Rivals’ player count as high as possible for as long as possible (something that’s proved particularly tricky for live service games of late), but to make enough money from players to meet the company’s internal revenue projections. To that end, Marvel Rivals sells a battle pass and premium skins, but are they convincing players to open their wallets? Early signs suggest they are — Marvel Rivals is the second top-selling game on Steam by revenue, behind only Grinding Gear Games’ action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals launched alongside Season 0, dubbed Dooms’ Rise. This month-long kick-off season starts with a total of 33 heroes, all available to play for free, eight maps for Quick Match and Competitive modes, a Conquest map, and a Practice Range. Dooms' Rise serves as the opening chapter “for the chaos caused by each of Doctor Dooms’ time experiments colliding and unleashing the Timestream Entanglement,” NetEase said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a Twitch Drops event for Season 0, as you’d expect from a live service game of this type, an 'Entangled Moments' seasonal event to unlock spray rewards, gallery card rewards, and stories for completing tasks, and a global launch gift: a special code for a free Iron Man costume.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>The first update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is here, available across PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>Along with a variety of fixes, this update has notably added full ray tracing (with path tracing) for Nvidia GPUs on PC. The Indy team said you will need to have a minimum of 12GB VRAM to get the most out of this feature, however.</p>

<p>Other PC-specific fixes include improved performance on larger game levels for those players using an 8GB VRAM video-card, and a fix for torch or lighter flames flickering when playing the game at a high refresh rate.</p>
<p>More generally, across platforms, photos that Indy takes when out and about should now appear more quickly when inspecting them from the journal. On the UI side of things, the Adventure Book list will now get updated immediately after unlocking a new book.</p><p>There are also a fair smattering of mission fixes, however I won't go into specifics here to avoid spoilers.

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is available now for PC and Xbox. It will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">coming to PlayStation 5 in the spring of next year</a>.</p>
<p>We awarded Indiana Jones and the Great Circle five stars on its release. "Indiana Jones really feels like he comes full circle (sorry) in this latest adventure. At long last, there's an Indy game that nails both the puzzles and the kind of action we know so well from the films, and it does so with wit, charm and a real eye for spectacle," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/darktide-on-ps5-%E2%80%93-another-standout-warhammer-40k-shooter.1055514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/darktide-ps5-review-warhammer-40k/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The wait for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> on PS5 was made a little more bearable for 40K fans earlier this year with the release of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>. Saber Interactive’s surprise sequel to the 2011 hack n’ slash/shooter hybrid has achieved phenomenal success, and is certainly a tough act to follow.</p>
<p>However, Darktide is a markedly different kind of game, hailing from the same school of shooter as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> and indeed developer Fatshark’s flagship title, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-end-times-vermintide">Warhammer: Vermintide</a>. No doubt seeing how popular their co-op action series has grown, the Swedish studio applied a similar template to Game Workshop’s gritty sci-fi universe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - PlayStation &amp; Grim Protocols Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MqQH6IJgpSA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For the most part, it’s a great fit. Darktide delves deep into the dark underbelly of 40K, far away from the warring Space Marines and their xenos rivals, instead focusing on the spreading corruption of Chaos within the Hive City of Tertium. Here, hiding within a labyrinth of habitat zones, factories, and pleasure districts, sedition manifests in the form of mutant cults who have turned their backs on the Emperor, seeking salvation instead from dark and ancient deities.</p>
<p>One major difference between Darktide and Vermintide is the shift away from named playable heroes. Instead, you create your own avatar, choosing from one of four classes that each have their own distinct weapon loadouts and abilities though all are equally capable in combat. As you’d expect, the hulking Ogryn is a bullet sponge who excels in taunting foes and pulling aggro away from squishier squadmates such as the magic-wielding Psykers. Although Darktide gives you the tools to customise your own grimdark misfit, this isn’t to say they’re devoid of any character. In fact, there’s plenty to be gleaned about the 40K universe from the banter, barbs, and exchanges between heroes as they go about their Chaos-thumping crusade.</p>


<p>We won’t do a complete retread of our original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/19/warhammer-40000-darktide-review/">Darktide review</a>, though what we praised about the game at launch still rings true. There’s an immense amount of joy to be had shooting and pummelling huge waves of enemies as you steadily push along each gauntlet-like stage, completing objectives. On the lowest rung of the difficulty ladder it can be presented as mindless fun though there’s plenty of challenge to be had, pressing even the most coordinated of strike teams to work together.</p>
<p>One common critique of Darktide is also still true. Repetition is pretty much baked into the core experience, encouraging players to rerun stages over and over, gradually dialling up the difficulty while earning experience points, as well as new weapons and abilities. This is a game about perfecting your ideal loadout rather than seeing a concise narrative unfold from beginning to end. Thanks to various updates and major content drops – including the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/02/cry-havoc-let-loose-the-grim-protocols-of-warhammer-40000-darktide/">Grim Protocols</a> – Darktide gives players much more to see and do while expanding the previously limited character progression system.</p>

<p>Through two years of toil and improvements, PlayStation fans get to experience Warhammer 40,000: Darktide at its very best complete with system-specific features such as DualSense haptics and a PS5 Pro performance boost. Online crossplay is another big boon, allowing you to matchmake with Xbox and PC players (something that was disappointingly absent from Vermintide 2). Speaking of which, Fatshark’s Skaven-stomping sequel is now long in the tooth and tail yet remains an ongoing success story within the blighted realm of live service video games – one that Darktide is looking to emulate.</p>
<p>Die hard fans have already managed to wring plenty of value from the game so far and there’s plenty of room to expand, though we doubt Fatshark will want to fragment its matchmaking pool by introducing premium maps. Having launched on all platforms, we’re eager to see what’s next as we go into 2025 and beyond, whether it’s new playable classes, enemies, and endgame modes.</p>

		<p><strong>Update 11AM 09/12</strong> – It looks like itch.io is back online, hopefully for good.</p>
<p><em>The original story follows.</em></p>


<hr>
<p>Popular indie game marketplace itch.io has been taken offline, the company blaming “bogus phishing reports” submitted AI brand protection used by Funko. Yeah. The plastic toys company…</p>
<p>Taking to <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866017758040993829">social media</a>, the company explains:</p>
<p>I kid you not, itch.io has been taken down by [Funko] because they use some trash “AI Powered” Brand Protection Software called [BrandShield] that created some bogus Phishing report to our registrar, iwantmyname, who ignored our response and just disabled the domain. […]
</p><p>Also, for transparency, we *did* take the disputed page down as soon as we got the notice because it’s not worth fighting stuff like that. Regardless, our registrar’s automated system likely kicked to disable the domain since no one read our confirmation of removal.</p>

<p>This is potentially a major headache for all the developers who rely on the platform. While itch.io is often a compliment to hosting and selling games on Steam in particular, it also has other opportunities that Steam doesn’t necessarily accommodate – it can host game jams, it’s great for prototyping and it’s DRM free.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is able to be resolved quickly, though itch.io say they will try to get a new domain if downtime lasts longer than 8 hours.</p>
<p>We’re probably going to wait this one out. We considered putting up a new domain but there are implications with third party services that make it not a trivial swap. In the meantime, if you know how to tweak your hosts file use: 45.33.107.166</p>
<p>It’s a situation that highlights the flaws of both “AI powered” automation and online copyright claims, which can often be used indiscriminately or extra-judiciously by large companies to take down things they don’t like, whether they have an actual case or not. Adding AI to the mix without human hands as a check and balance doesn’t exactly help the situation…</p>

            <p>
Well shatter my Infinity Stones. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-hero-shooter-marvel-rivals-off-to-heroic-start-on-steam">Marvel Rivals' supercharged start</a> has now seen an astonishing 10 million players assemble over the game's opening weekend. 
</p>
<p>
A free-to-play six-on-six team shooter from Chinese giant NetEase, Marvel Rivals launched last Friday for PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, on PlayStation 5 and on Xbox Series X/S. 
</p>
<p>
As of midnight last night, NetEase <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851">announced</a> that 10 million players had joined in across the game's various platforms. Excelsior!

Marvel Rivals' roster of current and upcoming characters includes Marvel Cinematic Universe stalwarts such as Iron Man, Hulk, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Wolverine and Groot, along with other fan favourites such as Iron Fist, Cloak and Dagger and, of course, Squirrel Girl. (Seriously, when is she getting her MCU debut?)

<p>
As for how it plays, well, Marvel Rivals has been compared to Blizzard's hero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Indeed, over the weekend, Blizzard's former boss - the ever-chatty Mike Ybarra - suggested Marvel Rivals was as much of an Overwatch copycat as the widely-discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-also-coming-to-ps5-of-all-platforms">Horizon Zero Dawn clone Light of Motiram</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-blizzard-boss-blasts-marvel-rivals-similarity-to-overwatch">Ybarra also seemed to suggest Marvel Rivals had copied Overwatch's character of Widowmaker</a> for Black Widow. The character - played by Scarlett Johansson in the MCU - was created by Marvel legend Stan Lee in 1964.
