            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon and KT Racing have announced the&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown&nbsp;</em>release date, which means the years of delays might finally be coming to an end.</p>

<p>According to a brand new trailer released earlier today,&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on September 12th.</p>

<p>Said trailer also includes some pretty tantalizing footage showing some of the cars and tracks you'll be able to experience when the game does finally arrive, and if you're a racing aficionado, it looks like you won't want to miss this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-release-date-car-parked.jpg?itok=KALMBWQN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-release-date-car-parked.jpg?itok=UdF6L9Xs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date.</figcaption></figure><p>We first got wind of&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kt-racing-announces-test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">all the way back in July 2020</a>, when it was announced during a Nacon Connect presentation by developer KT Racing.</p>

<p>The game was originally slated for a 2022 release, but was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/3192501139825395531" rel="noopener" target="_blank">delayed to 2023</a>. It was also set to launch on PS4 and Xbox One, but those versions were canceled to allow Nacon and KT Racing to "maximiz[e] the overall quality of the game".</p>

<p>Following that delay&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-delayed-to-2024-first-gameplay-revealed">once again pushed back</a>&nbsp;to an unspecified date in early 2024, although it seems that this release window proved somewhat too ambitious for Nacon and KT Racing as well.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this latest <i>Solar Crown&nbsp;</i>release date won't be moving again. You can check out the release date trailer for the game right here.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar,&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown&nbsp;</em>is an open-world racing game (or "lifestyle and social experience", to use Nacon's wording) set on a 1:1 scale recreation of Hong Kong.</p>

<p>You'll drive a range of licensed cars from manufacturers like Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Dodge as you compete in the titular Solar Crown, a competition created by Hong Kong's mysterious "Radiant" organization.</p>

<p><em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1249970/Test_Drive_Unlimited_Solar_Crown/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003910" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on September 12th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Dataminers have found new details about Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>
<p>As shown in the posts below, the next Call of Duty game will reportedly release on both previous and current generation consoles. This ties in with reports earlier in the month, when <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1794089299589132780">images</a> of a GameStop pre-order screen for the game started making the rounds online.</p>

<p>Additionally, those interested will seemingly be able to pick up a 'Vault' edition of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, as well as the 'Standard' edition.</p>
<p>According to the leaked images, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Vault edition will include Gobble Gum, a selection of weapon skins, bonus operators and more. You can check out some of the keyart below.</p> <div>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-cod-2024-is-named-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">officially named just last week</a>, after newspaper advertising spotted by fans pointed to its title. Further details remain slim for now, although previous reports suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-a-black-ops-title-set-in-the-gulf-war-new-report-claims">Black Ops 6 will feature the Gulf War</a>. We can expect to find out more at a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-with-mystery-game-direct">dedicated hour-long showcase</a> next month, when the Call of Duty team will give us an "in-depth" look at gameplay.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Microsoft confirmed to Eurogamer that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-be-locked-behind-a-new-xbox-game-pass-tier">Black Ops 6 will be available across  Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass for Console members</a> on its release.</p>

  <p id="EvVJYA">One of the best parts of our jobs at Polygon is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play">recommending awesome new games to play</a>. Whether it’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24151036/best-indie-games-2024">indie games</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24151983/best-cozy-games-play-nintendo-switch-steam-playstation-xbox-pc">cozy games</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24144632/best-board-games-2024-new">board games</a>, or just the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24078256/best-video-games-2024">best of the year</a>, we’re always trying to introduce readers to new and exciting picks. Lists are a great way to share a variety of great <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games">tabletop games</a> in a short amount of time. But sometimes it’s fun to do something more personally curated.</p>
<p id="YXwJDF">That’s why we have this regular open thread dedicated to helping you, our dear readers, find the perfect <a href="https://www.polygon.com/board-games">board game</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-magic-the-gathering">card game</a>, or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons">tabletop role-playing game</a> to play right now. Want to start a month-long campaign with a close-knit group of friends? We have options, to be sure. Hoping for something short and sweet to kick off a longer night of gaming? We’ve got something that meets that need as well.</p>
<p id="DQEOOH">From 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. EDT, I will be in the comments section down below answering your questions and fielding requests for what you should play. We previously programmed this as a weekly <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2024/5/2/24146259/best-movies-watch-tonight-best-recommendations-streaming">movie column</a> but will be moving that version to a monthly schedule with more non-movie recommendation threads coming your way week over week, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2024/5/16/24156963/best-game-play-tonight-recommendations-pc">video games</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2024/5/23/24162735/best-comics-read-now-recommendations">comics</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2024/5/9/24150607/best-tv-watch-tonight-recommendations-streaming">TV</a>, and now tabletop games as well.</p>
<p id="bPgMdP">I should add that this is also a great place to share what <em>you’ve been playing</em>, if you want to talk about that with your fellow Polygon readers! Participation is very welcome, even without questions.</p>
<p id="7Nj4Qf">A little bit about me, your curator for this go ’round: I’m Charlie Hall, Polygon senior editor and the first and only tabletop editor at a major media publication here in the United States. I’ve been writing about board games, TCGs, and TTRPGs since before I even worked here — more than 12 years at this point. I haven’t played everything, to be sure, but I have my head on a swivel for the newest and the best in just about every category — from solid roll-and-writes to dark and stormy solo journaling games.</p>
<p id="nxxvwd">What am I playing right now? Well, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156680/dnd-dunegons-dragons-alt-art-phb-reveal-release-date-price">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> night is Tuesday here for my group in Northern Illinois, and we’ve been playing together every week for close to a decade at this point. But that’s not all! I just kicked off a campaign of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23124230/arcs-collapse-and-conflict-in-the-void-cole-wehrle-leder-games-kickstarter-release-date-price"><em>Arcs: Collapse and Conflict in the Void</em></a>, the latest from Leder Games due out later this year. I’ve also been doing lots of reps of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24158546/life-in-reterra-board-game-review"><em>Life in Reterra</em></a>, the latest from Diana Jones Award-winning designer <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/10/12416080/gencon-diana-jones-trophy-burned-book-eric-lang">Eric M. Lang</a>. In between painting up more of my beloved <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23643118/how-to-paint-miniatures">Dark Angels Space Marines</a> after work, I’ve even managed to get in a few rounds of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158275/disney-lorcanas-ursulas-return-starter-deck-upgrades"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>’s newest set of cards with the kids.</p>
<p id="9V82EL">Now it’s time to turn it around to you. What kind of tabletop game would you like to play this weekend? Maybe you know what you’re playing and want to share how much fun that game is! Are you painting anything that you want to show off? Leave a comment or a request below and I’ll get to it soon as I can. Details help, of course. Let me know a little bit about the other players at the table and what they might be into, the last few games y’all have enjoyed playing together or apart, and any other relevant info you feel like sharing.</p>
<p id="fAsFjv">Here are two examples of good queries from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2024/5/23/24162735/best-comics-read-now-recommendations">last week’s comics edition</a>:</p>

The series follow a best-of-seven format, the winners of each going on to face each other in the Stanley Cup Final.</p><p>And though the Penguins didn’t even qualify for the playoffs this year, Rust told Ninja that he’s confident his team would have beaten <em>my</em> New York Rangers in the first round—even though we swept the Washington Capitols in that round. </p><p>“Little hockey talk, dude, that’s what I’m talking about, baby,” Ninja says as Rust joins the stream, before quickly giving him a “what’s up brother,” an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article287347040.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article287347040.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ode to viral TikToker and streamer Sketch</a></span>.</p><p> “Off-season, you missed the playoffs by like, a game—sorry to rip the Band-Aid there,” Ninja’s brother, Jonathan “Bearded Blevins” Blevins says. “First question for me, would you at least have won one game against the Rangers, unlike the Capitols?”</p><p>“I think we would’ve beat the Rangers,” Rust says confidently, as the Blevins brothers react with shock and awe. </p><p>“Full serious, we’re not just gassing our own team up, right?” Ninja asks. </p><p>“I think we would have beat them,” Rust repeats, before explaining that it was a “match-up thing.” “There’s teams you just do well against,” he said.</p><p> Interestingly enough, the Penguins and the Rangers played three times this season, and the Rangers won two of those games: one in a 7-4 shellacking, and the other in a shutout. Does that seem like the Penguins “do well against” the Rangers? Hmm...</p><p>Naturally, hockey fans are flocking to social media to react to Rust’s statement, mocking him for what is essentially the, “If my grandmother had wheels she’d be a bike,” excuse. I for one believe he’s emanating the most aggressive “1v1 me” energy humanly possible. </p><p>Anyway, let’s go Rangers. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 22:single/related:1af5d41baabbe51d4a6a617fc07de53b --><!-- empty -->
<p>If you're still getting use out of your aging PS4 after nearly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">four full years of PS5 availability</a>, new data from Sony shows you are far from alone. The Japanese electronics giant says that both the PS4 and PS5 currently have about 49 million monthly active users, suggesting a significant number of PlayStation players have yet to spend $400 or more to upgrade to the newer console.
</p><p>The new data comes from <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf">an extensive Game &amp; Network Services report</a> presented as part of Sony's most recent <a href="https://www.sony.com/ja/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/">Business Segment Meeting</a>. Those numbers suggest that about 42 percent of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/wkw0ei/the_final_total_consoles_sold_for_the_ps4_is_1172/">117 million PS4 units ever sold</a> are still in active use, compared to 86 percent of the 56 million PS5 units sold thus far.</p>
<p>Despite the parity in active consoles, Sony also points out that the PS5 is responsible for significantly more gameplay hours than the PS4:&nbsp;2.4 billion for the new system compared to 1.4 billion for its predecessor (it's unclear what time period this comparison covers). Sony's monthly user numbers also include any console "used to play games or [access] services on the PlayStation Network," so an old PS4 that serves as a convenient Netflix box in the spare bedroom would still inflate the older system's numbers here.</p>
<p>Still, it's pretty impressive that nearly 50 million people are still regularly using a console first launched in 2013 (even considering <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/playstation-4-ps4-pro-review-4k/">2016's Pro upgrade</a>). That could be in part because the PS4 is still seeing plenty of software support well after the PS5's release; Sony's PSN Store listings currently include <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/024029c7-f61b-4bef-a4d7-06270ed12b56/1?last_thirty_days=productReleaseDate&amp;PS4=targetPlatforms">189 "just released" PS4-compatible games</a>, including <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/024029c7-f61b-4bef-a4d7-06270ed12b56/1">many "best-selling" titles</a> that don't require a PS5 at all. The fact that those PS4-compatible titles <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/sony-confirms-playstation-5s-ps4-back-compat-details-hints-at-game-boost/">are also playable directly on the PS5</a> has probably helped convince some publishers to target the older console for their less graphics-intensive games.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-30-at-10.24.08%E2%80%AFAM.png" data-height="1442" data-width="2598" alt="PS5 owners are spending less money on full games and a lot more money on &quot;add-on content.&quot;"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-30-at-10.24.08%E2%80%AFAM.png" data-height="1442" data-width="2598">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> PS5 owners are spending less money on full games and a lot more money on "add-on content."</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The PS4's longevity doesn't seem to have had a significant negative impact on the PS5's bottom line, either. Sony's gaming division has already earned $10 billion in profit off of $106 billion in sales across the nearly four years of the PS5 generation, compared to $9 billion in profit off $107 billion in sales across seven years of the PS4.</p>
<p>PS5 owners have spent an average of $731 each across games, services, peripherals, and add-on content. That's up significantly from $580 in nominal spending from the average PS4 owner at the same point in that console's life cycle, though what sounds like a big increase is actually pretty flat <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/the-return-of-the-70-video-game-has-been-a-long-time-coming/">when you take inflation into account</a>.</p>
<p>That per-console gaming spending is now concentrated less on "full game" purchases—which are down 12 percent between the PS4 to PS5 generation—and much more on so-called add-on content—which is up 176 percent between generations. We're guessing that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/uk-report-recommends-regulating-all-loot-boxes-as-gambling/">big-spending, loot-box-chasing "whales"</a> have something to do with that increase.

                <p>Hogwarts Legacy is getting its first major update in a while this summer, and it includes a number of features that players have been asking for. The free update arrives June 6, and it includes a photo mode, a new Onyx Hippogriff mount, Harry Potter's glasses, and other additions.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't have the full details on this update yet, but we do have an idea of the highlights thanks to an image that publishing label Portkey Games <a href="https://x.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/1796164665917186386/photo/1" rel="nofollow ">posted to social media</a>. It includes a screencap of the photo mode in action, with typical options like tilt, depth of field, and different character poses. It also notes a new quest, titled the Haunted Hogsmeade Shop, which will bring some fresh adventure to the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The update will add the ability to reset your character's talent points, which is always a welcome option in any game with a talent tree. The post also lists a few other minor additions that are coming with the patch, including the aforementioned Hippogriff mount and Harry Potter's glasses (titled The Glasses That Lived), an Azkaban Prisoner outfit, a Lavender Borealis broom, and the Felix Felicis Potion recipe.</p><p dir="ltr">The first major game in the Harry Potter universe in years, Hogwarts Legacy has enjoyed strong sales since its release. For example, it recently ranked as the 20th <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-most-downloaded-ps5-games-of-april-2024/2900-5402/#1">most downloaded PS5 game</a> for the month of April, more than a year after it first came out.</p><p dir="ltr">Hogwarts Legacy is developed by Avalanche Software, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game has been embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she is not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-very-beginner%E2%80%99s-guide-to-vampire-survivors.884973/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/a-very-beginners-guide-to-vampire-survivors/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-very-beginners-guide-to-vampire-survivors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="428" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The premise of <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is pretty simple: what if <em>you</em> were the bullet hell? Given gaming’s propensity for fulfilling a player fantasy in terms of might, ability, heroism, fame/infamy, and feeling rested after a good sleep, it’s little wonder that Poncle’s roguelike release – which spins the bullet hell genre on its head – has been receiving significant praise on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> since it came out in 2022.</p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">But for those who haven’t played the game – or are new to it – its blend of retro-style visuals and the opportunity to “mow down thousands of night creatures” is offset by the sheer chaos and perhaps surprising difficulty, despite the aforementioned power fantasy needs that are met.</p> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">So in this very beginner’s guide to <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, I thought I’d give a few pointers so that you, too, can experience the pixelated dopamine surge that is this game.</p>
 <h2 id="h-you-ll-die-a-lot-early-on-and-that-s-okay" data-injectable="false">You’ll die a lot early on – and that’s okay</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="690" data-injectable="true">Get used to seeing that screen above. If you’ve ever played any kind of rogue-ish, run-based game before, you know dying a lot is par for the course. Even though <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is about being this unstoppable slayer with a wealth of projectiles and power-ups spewing out of you like a fire hose through a colander, there’s quite an uphill battle when you first start playing.</p>
 <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">But that’s fine. The game doesn’t hand you everything on a plate as soon as you install it. There’s some work that needs to be done. You’ll find yourself being easily swamped by hordes of enemies and once you die, you start the level from scratch.</p> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">But like any game of this sort, it’s about learning what works. Use these first few runs to become acquainted with how it all functions. What kind of enemies are you likely to encounter, which ones are the toughest, what does each weapon and power-up actually do. Dying isn’t the end; it’s just another chance for you to get back into the ring – as it were – and try again.</p>
 <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="188" data-injectable="false"><em>NOTE: Levels go on for a maximum of 30 minutes, at which point The Reaper will spawn to finish you off. Although this results in a Game Over screen, it is classified as completing the map.</em></p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Build up your gold</h2> <figure data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="235" data-injectable="false">If you want to give yourself a bigger advantage against the throng of baddies coming at you like a SNES-era flash mob, you’re going to need some firepower and additional perks. That’s where the in-game shop comes into play.</p> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">As time marches on during a round, you not only level up your weapons and defense items, you also get the chance to earn gold. This could be by smashing certain objects on the map (such as light sources), opening a treasure chest that will also contain an upgraded power-up, or through Gold Fever, which allows you to collect coins from enemies you kill within a certain time limit.</p>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Once you amass enough, you can begin building up your deck with better armor, increasing your speed, having an extra projectile from the start, becoming stronger, increasing the area of attack for your weapons, and more. You can also give yourself a revival so you come back to life at least once when you die, as well as spawning “defanged” enemies, which don’t deal damage.</p> <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">There’s also a cursed power-up, which makes the game tougher by increasing enemy speed and health. At this stage, best to avoid this one like some sort of cliché saying.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Level 2 is actually more newbie-friendly than level 1</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Poncle/Steam.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true"><em>Vampire Survivors</em> has a lot of stages to tackle. Obviously, the game will want you to get to know the basics first, so will start you off on level 1: Mad Forest. This is an open space containing a lot of greenery. You can move about the place, seemingly forever, while fighting off groups of creatures. Here, you’ll acquaint yourself with the fundamentals.</p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">However, there’s an argument to be had that level 2 – Inlaid Library – is actually a better stage for new players. Perhaps the main reason for this is it’s a long stretch from left to right, rather than incorporating all four directions. This means you have a tighter space to fight in, but still enough room to maneuver. There are still some snags, such as bookcases, tables, and alcoves you can get stuck in, but it’s an easy level to navigate.</p>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">It’s also not much harder than Mad Forest. All stages begin in a more calm fashion, throwing in a few low-tier enemies so you can concentrate on becoming powerful and strong (like ox). They progressively get harder as time marches on, but Inlaid Library doesn’t have much of a difficulty spike when compared to the first level.</p> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="591" data-injectable="true">However, you do need to unlock it before you can play it. Fortunately, all this means is getting to level 20 on the first stage. You don’t have to reach the end of the 30 minutes. Just get those levels up nice and quick and stage 2 will be yours.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Stick to more open areas</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">I mentioned above how there are obstacles on each stage that you can get stuck on. Well, this doesn’t affect your adversaries. I neglected to say that enemies come at you from all angles, regardless of the level’s layout and geometry. This means they come through the literal scenery in order to get to you.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">Given this, you’ll want to make sure you’ve got as much room around you as you can. Creatures will advance regardless, but what you don’t want is for a 360-degree circle of pixelated hostiles encroaching on you while you’re bumping your head against a tree or a wall you weren’t expecting to come across because it blends in perfectly with the texture of the floor.</p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true">You could say that sticking to areas that are open is generally good advice for a lot of action-based games. However, in the midst of a battle in which you can become swamped by tough hombres, it’s easy to panic and find yourself backed into a space, which just creates more problems for you.</p>
 <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">You’ll first notice this in the Mad Forest, with its liberal placement of conifers, which has prompted my girlfriend and I to simply refer to them – at all times – as “Tree Bastards.” We’re in our 40s.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Defense is just as important as offense</h2> <figure data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">One of the game’s biggest appeals is getting to become the bullet hell you always imagined you’d be. Choosing projectiles and explosives that have become so powerful, the screen is nothing more than a headache-inducing visual noise of cascading missiles and magic (<em>Vampire Survivors</em> does come with a sensitivity warning) is pretty much the end goal.</p> <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">However, you’re not exactly invincible. In fact, when first starting out, you’re actually pretty easy to kill, so you’re going to have to balance powerful weaponry with life-affirming safety. This means choosing defensive items as well as offensive ones.</p>
 <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">Everything from extra health, regeneration, shields, armor, and even power-ups that encircle you as they do damage to creatures will go a long way to protecting you from harm.</p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">One that many would recommend – and I would agree with them – is the Garlic item. This gives you a (presumably smelly) ring of defensiveness around you, which deals damage to enemies. If you get this early on, you can watch those low-level enemies just fizzle away as you walk through them.</p>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="false">The best character to choose for this is Poe Ratcho. He’s slow and a bit weaker, but he starts off with the Garlic, which is invaluable – even when you’re not new to the game – at the start of each map. Unfortunately, you do need to unlock him, which involves advancing the Garlic to level 7 during a round and forking over 500 gold. After that, he will be a formidable addition to your roster.</p>

<p data-characters="340" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>&nbsp;expansion launching on June 4, Bungie has been hard at work detailing what players can expect when they load into the next chapter of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>. After showcasing some of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-showcases-dread-forces-ahead-of-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Dread enemies</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-adds-a-golden-gun-sniper-and-other-new-exotic-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exotic weapons</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-shows-off-destiny-2-the-final-shape-exotic-class-armor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exotic armor</a>, the studio has switched gears, laying out changes for existing weapons and abilities. </p> <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false">In the Dev Insights post for Subclass tuning, Bungie tackled some expected issues. But the studio also had a few surprises up its sleeve for a Subclass most players have written off.</p> <h2 id="h-stasis-revamp" data-injectable="false">Stasis revamp</h2> <figure data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">The big news is a new Subclass keyword called Frost Armor. Frost Armor provides 4.5% damage resistance per stack against PvE foes and 2% per stack in PvP. The buff lasts nine seconds and can be stacked up to five times, leading to a whopping 22.5% damage resistance when fully stacked in PvE. If players loop in the updated Whisper of Rime Fragment, that duration bumps up to 13 seconds, and Frost Armor can be stacked up to eight times, pushing Guardians up to a 36% resistance buff in PvE and 16% in PvP.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">Players can gain a stack of Frost Armor and a heal whenever collecting a Stasis Shard, but it doesn’t stop there. To support Frost Armor and give Stasis players a few extra toys to play with, Bungie has reworked several Fragments and introduced a couple of newcomers.</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Whisper of Rime</strong>&nbsp;– Reworked to increase Frost Armor buff length and maximum stack total.</li> <li><strong>Whisper of Chill</strong>&nbsp;– A new Fragment that allows a chance to create a Stasis Shard when defeating foes with a Stasis weapon.</li> <li><strong>Whisper of Chains</strong>&nbsp;– This Fragment was rebuilt to allow for the creation of Stasis Shards when defeating enemies while Frost Armor is active.</li> <li><strong>Whisper of Fractures</strong>&nbsp;– Reworked to provide a stack of Frost Armor when players Shatter a frozen target with melee.</li> <li><strong>Whisper of Torment</strong>&nbsp;– The Fragment was altered, now providing a fixed 7% grenade energy when players take damage from enemies, bumping up to 12% when Frost Armor is active.</li> <li><strong>Whisper of Reversal</strong>&nbsp;– A new Fragment that slows melee attackers or those subject to a melee when players have Frost Armor active.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">Bungie also noted how Shatter would change in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>&nbsp;to round out general stasis changes. Shatter damage will double from 200 to 400, but the studio has simultaneously fixed a bug where boss enemies were prone to having the Shatter effect hit twice.</p> <figure data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">General Arc changes</h2> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Spark of Beacons&nbsp;</strong>– This Fragment now has an additional way to activate, defeating enemies with heavy Arc weapons while Amplified.</li> <li><strong>Spark of Frequency&nbsp;</strong>– The ability regen bonus will remain active until players’ shields are fully recharged.</li> <li><strong>Spark of Recharge</strong>&nbsp;– Added a weapon stability buff after a powered melee hit.</li> </ul> <h2 data-injectable="false">General Strand changes</h2> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Thread of Warding</strong>&nbsp;– Orbs of Power now provides Woven Mail for 5 seconds instead of 10.</li> <li><strong>Strand Tangles and Grapple&nbsp;</strong>– Grapple is no longer refreshed when grappling a Tangle. Tangle durations will be increased by 5 seconds per Grapple but reduced to 1-second increases after 5 Grapples.</li> </ul> <h2 data-injectable="false">Warlock Subclass changes</h2> <figure data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Solar</h3> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">Solar Warlocks only have one change to address, and it’s a big one: the Well of Radiance Super. Bungie has long believed the Super was overused across&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, often allowing players to ignore mechanics with the neigh invincibility it provided. In that spirit, the studio has some changes coming to Well, making it less of a set-and-forget Super.</p> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="768" data-injectable="true">For the good, Well of Radiance will now provide 8 seconds of the Radiant buff to players who’ve entered the Super, even after they’ve left its AOE. In addition, Well now has some powerful utility as an instant group heal ability, with its instant heal on cast jumping from 40 to 300 HP. Finally, Bungie has made it possible to generate more Orbs of Power from the Super, going from 4 maximum to 5.</p>
 <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">On the other hand, Well of Radiance’s ability to essentially withstand enemy damage will be all but eliminated. Healing per second is dropping to 50 HP from 100 and damage resistance is going down across the board, from 40% in all situations to 10% damage resistance against bosses and 20% against everything else.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Arc</h3> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true">Similar to Hunter, there aren’t many changes for Arc Warlocks inbound. The most notable are updates to the Lightning Surge Aspect that provides some damage resistance and some fiddling with Ball Lightning to make it more reliable. Chain Lightning also got some love, increasing damage from 27 to 54.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">Void</h3> <p data-characters="566" data-current-count="866" data-injectable="true">Void Warlocks are getting a couple of targeted fixes to help improve the Subclass’ abilities for Prismatic. The Chaos Accellerant variant of Charged Magnetic grenade will see a 20% damage increase and a cooldown decrease of 20%. It will also knock enemies back by an additional 10%. Pocket Singularity will see some gains, too, with a 50% increase in detonation damage in PvE. The Nova Bomb Supers are also getting a little love, with Cataclysm earning two additional seeker projectiles (going to 6) and Vortex’s duration increasing to 10 seconds from 7.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Stasis</h3> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false">Aside from the updates that revolve around Frost Armor and Shatter, there isn’t much changing for Stasis Warlocks. The only point Bungie noted was that Iceflare Bolts would spawn 7 homing Bolts, up from the previous 5.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Strand</h3> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">For Strand Warlocks, there’s only one change incoming, and it’s to the Weavers Call Aspect. The Aspect now offers a chance to generate a perched Threadling by eliminating foes with Strand damage.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Hunter Subclass changes</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">Solar</h3> <p data-characters="596" data-current-count="896" data-injectable="true">Solar Hunters are getting a few changes to the tools in their kit, starting with the underutilized Lightweight Knife melee ability. The ability will come with two charges by default, making throwing the blades rapidly easier. To support the changes to Lightweight Knife, Bungie changed how Knock ‘Em Down works, reducing the cooldown of the melee regenerating effect from 1 second to 0.2 seconds. Finally, Swarm Grenade is getting a few buffs to ready it for Prismatic builds. It will see a 20% damage buff, can linger for up to 11 seconds (up from 8), and has improved projectile tracking.</p>
 <p data-characters="602" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">The other significant change Solar Hunters will see is to their Golden Gun Super. Specifically, Bungie called out Golden Gun, Marksman’s ability to recharge and power up a group of Hunters, all using the Super and the Star-Eater Scales Exotic. Thankfully, Bungie isn’t touching the power of the Super ability at its base, but it is tuning how effective created Orbs of Power are. Against a boss, created Orbs of Power have a 0.4 multiplier rather than a 0.75 multiplier. This effect is 0.5 for non-boss enemies. When Star-Eater Scales is thrown into the mix, that multiplier drops to 0.35.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Arc</h3> <p data-characters="551" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">There weren’t too many Arc changes for Hunters, with Bungie noting that it would watch how the Subclass performs after&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>&nbsp;releases. Of note, heavy attacks will now Blind enemies when using Arc Staff. Otherwise, the only other changes are that Disorienting Blow has a reduced cooldown, from 100 seconds to 90 seconds, and Tempest Strike now provides some damage resistance in PvE. In addition to these goodies, Skip grenades and Arcbolt grenades get a 15% damage buff against PvE enemies, and Storm grenades get a 20% buff.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">Void</h3> <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="753" data-injectable="true">Bungie commented that Void Hunters didn’t need many changes, but it still had a few updates in store. Starting with Snare Bomb, the ability will let its smoke linger for 5 seconds, up from 3. The smoke will also hurt enemies, dealing more damage the longer they’re in the effect. Trapper’s Ambush will similarly increase its smoke duration from 4.5 seconds to 6. Finally, Stylish Executioner will apply to Glaive melee attacks as well.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Stasis</h3> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">On top of the more general Stasis updates, Hunters are having a few of their abilities targeted for a buff or overhaul. Bungie started with the Winter’s Shroud Aspect, adding some new functionalities. The Aspect now offers a damage reduction when used in PvE, and using the Aspect to slow enemies increases Class ability regeneration rates.</p> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="789" data-injectable="true">Next up was the Touch of Winter Aspect, focusing on the Glacier and Coldsnap Grenades. When using the Aspect, Glacier Grenade will now create one additional Stasis Crystal, but it’ll come at the cost of a slower deployment. Coldsnap Grenades buffed by the Aspect have been reworked to double seekers after freezing an enemy. They will also create a medium Stasis Crystal after chain-freezing a second enemy and a large one after a third.</p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">Finally, Silence &amp; Squall got a bit of an update, making it more reliable. The Super will move faster by 10% in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, and it’ll slow itself when surrounding an enemy, hopefully eliminating a chance of overshooting foes. The speed at which it damages and applies Slow was also raised by 40% in PvE.</p> <figure data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Strand</h3> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">Bungie thinks Strand Hunters have a couple of abilities that are a bit too strong in their current form. To bring things more in line with the studio’s vision, Ensnaring Slam’s radius has decreased from 8 meters to 6.5 and changed in shape from a sphere to a cylinder. Threaded Spike also got a bit of a nerf, decreasing damage against players to 70 from 79.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Titan Subclass changes</h2> <figure data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Solar</h3> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Solar Titans are getting two focused tweaks ahead of&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>. First, the powerful Consecration powered melee ability is getting even stronger. Consecration will see a 20% damage buff to Ignitions created by the ability and will be able to destroy any Stasis Crystals it hits. The ability will also more easily target foes in the air and apply damage resistance to the user.</p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">The next set of tweaks is around Hammer of Sol, and interestingly, only when the Sol Invictus Aspect isn’t equipped. Shrapnel counts have increased by 1 regardless of distance traveled before detonation, either creating 4 or 6. Additionally, Shrapnel will deal more damage when Sol Invictus isn’t equipped, ramping up after 0.7 seconds.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Arc</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">Arc Titans are getting a bit of focus, with several changes coming to the Subclass. First, Thunderclap will increase its damage and provide some resistance. The Knockout Aspect is getting reworked, providing some instant healing after a melee kill and increasing powered melee attack damage by 50%, up from 25%. The healing provided by Knockout is 30 HP for a player, 50 HP for a minor enemy, 75 HP for Majors, and 100 HP for Champions or stronger.</p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">Storm grenade is getting a couple of buffs, with increased tracking provided by the Touch of Thunder Aspect. Damage has risen by 20% for Storm grenades not utilizing Touch of Thunder. Lightning grenade will also get some added utility from Touch of Thunder, adding Jolt after the first instance of damage.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Void</h3> <p data-characters="684" data-current-count="989" data-injectable="true">While Void Titans have several changes coming their way, one of the biggest has to be Ward of Dawn. Alongside Well of Radiance, Bungie looked at Ward of Dawn, bringing it into line with other Super options. The Void-based dome shield no longer provides an overshield via Armor of Light, instead providing a Void overshield. The Void shield will recharge players close enough to the Ward, and Armor of Light has been reworked to provide 60% resistance while inside the dome in PvE and 30% resistance against players in PvP. Accompanying these changes is the retirement of Weapons of Light through the Super alone, but Titans can generate Orbs of Power with melee kills inside the Ward.</p>
 <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">Outside of Ward of Dawn, Void Titans can expect changes to the Shield Throw melee ability. It will be able to bounce up to 5 times, increased from 4, and has a longer lifetime, going up to 4 seconds from 3. Bungie also made the ability to track enemies more easily and included a solid 20% damage buff against PvE foes. Offensive Bulwark is also getting a minor update, restoring Void overshield after melee kills and fixing a timer and buff duration issue.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Stasis</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true">Alongside the general updates, Stasis Titans are finally getting some love. For the Stasis Titan melee, Shiver Strike will bolster a 10% damage boost in PvE and become easier to land hits. Bungie also noted that Glacial Quake would automatically propel Titans into a sprint after activation, and Cryoclasm has had its sprint requirement removed in favor of a 4-second cooldown between elongated slides.</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">Diamond Lance will see a suite of updates to make it a more competitive choice. The radius of the Lance’s detonation is increasing from 3.5 meters to 5 meters, and its slam radius is rising from 6.75 meters to 8 meters in PvE. The icy weapons will also be easier to grab amid combat, taking a note from Strand Tangles.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Strand</h3> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true">Bungie noted that, over time, Banner of War has proven a bit too strong. Bungie tuned down some abilities connected to Banner of War Titans to make the build feel less obligatory. The Into the Fray Aspect’s melee energy regen scaling was reduced from a 4X multiplier to 3X. Additionally, Banner of War saw a series of changes, including a time reduction to Banner of War, dropping from 30 seconds to 24.</p>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">Bungie also took a swing at the Synthoceps Exotic, decreasing bonus damage across the board. The same also happened with the Wormgod Caress Exotic. Finally, Frenzied Blade got a minor tweak, making it more reliable when close to enemies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tiny-glade-is-a-lovely-stress-free-builder<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several of us at Aftermath are fans of building games that <a href="https://aftermath.site/summerhouse-steam-game-architecture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just let you build</a>, without all the rules and fail states of other city-builders. (Though we <a href="https://aftermath.site/against-the-storm-is-a-really-good-city-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/manor-lords-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">those</a> too, or at least when they <a href="https://aftermath.site/paradox-publishing-interactive-pc-steam-cities-skylines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work</a>.) Upcoming indie game <em>Tiny Glade</em> is the latest in the “just make a cool house” genre. It has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2198150/Tiny_Glade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> out later today on Steam, and it’s lovely.</p><p>In <em>Tiny Glade</em>, by developer Pounce Light, you build little medieval towns atop grassy landscapes, dragging to add houses, towers, and walls. That’s the whole deal! The demo only features one contained area to build, and while I felt a bit stifled by the limited space at first, there’s so much you can do in a small area. If you drag a building horizontally or vertically, it will get taller, longer, shorter, or skinnier; as it does so, it transforms itself, sprouting arches and other decorative touches. You can combine buildings to make entire complicated castles, and you can add windows and doors, change the shape of roofs or the color of bricks, and add some pathways and–my personal favorite–clusters of wildflowers.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tiny Glade - Gameplay Trailer | Wholesome Snack: The Game Awards Edition" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E0pNz9H6aRo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While there aren’t a lot of variation options in the demo’s menu, you can create so many different things just by clicking and dragging around. Building games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2533960/SUMMERHOUSE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Summerhouse</em></a> are fun in part because they let you make exactly what you want, but I really enjoyed going with the flow in <em>Tiny Glade</em>, discovering what the game would give me as I dragged my mouse or tweaked the landscape up and down. A tower going from a pointed roof to a flat turret inspired me to create a fortress; a couple skinny buildings clumping together transformed my town into a grand estate.</p><p>My favorite part of the demo is the sound: the rumbling bricks of walls unfurling, the rattle of windows going in, the rustle of a flowerbed expanding. Sound designer Martin Kvale worked on similar chill builder <em>Townscaper</em>, among <a href="https://www.martinkvale.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other games</a> (and, full disclosure, also once showed me around Oslo when I visited Norway on a birthday trip in 2019). The attention to detail, both in the sound and the visuals, make <em>Tiny Glade</em> feel lively and robust; it might not be complex, but it feels <em>full</em>, from changing times of day to wandering sheep that react if you click on them or build where they’re standing.&nbsp;</p><p>The <em>Tiny Glade </em>demo will be available for a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2198150/view/4207001628979187283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">few weeks</a>, and will overlap with an incoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Next Fest</a> that’s sure to overwhelm me with even <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/steam-next-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more demos</a> to play. The full game is due to release some time this year.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-private-division-end-partnership</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloober-team-and-take-twos-private-division-end-partnership-for-new-ip.884943/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-private-division-end-partnership<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team has revealed that its partnership with Take-Two's Private Division label for an upcoming new horror IP has ended.</p>

<p>That's according to <a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/espi/pl/reports/view/2,561716#pvy7zfso61" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a notice</a> filed with Polish press agency PAP Biznes (for which we're using machine translation), wherein Bloober Team says Take-Two terminated its agreement with Bloober Team over the currently-codenamed <em>Project C</em>. No reason was given in the notice.</p>

<p>Bloober Team says it is continuing work on&nbsp;<em>Project C&nbsp;</em>with a view to self-publishing the game, but that the studio isn't ruling out the possibility of working with a new publisher for the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloober-team-private-division-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=V4hDActq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloober-team-private-division-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=KSWTmsDm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bloober Team is currently working on the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake (which isn't&nbsp;<em>Project C</em>, so don't worry).</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, Bloober says it believes the termination of its agreement with Private Division could provide a "significant opportunity" to increase revenue from&nbsp;<em>Project C</em>.</p>

<p>The partnership between Bloober Team and Private Division was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-teams-up-with-private-division-for-new-horror-game">announced back in December 2022</a>, but was actually put into effect in September 2021.</p>

<p>No details have been released about&nbsp;<em>Project C&nbsp;</em>yet, so we're not sure exactly how much involvement Private Division actually had in its creation, nor do we know how much of a setback this might prove for Bloober Team.</p>

<p>This isn't the only project in the works at Bloober right now, though. The studio is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-developer-asks-fans-to-be-patient-as-production-is-going-smoothly">currently working on the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake</a> for Konami, and with a&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUWjJ1zOxwo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">presentation due later today</a>, we may well learn more about that project in a few hours' time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloober-team-private-division-the-medium.jpg?itok=Z-vRCPJa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloober-team-private-division-the-medium.jpg?itok=rMbKJ7AD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also know Bloober Team's name from&nbsp;<em>The Medium</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Bloober Team's history with horror also extends to 2021's&nbsp;<em>The Medium</em>, a survival horror-come-narrative adventure game with more than a shade of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>about it.</p>

<p>You might also recognize the studio's name from the <i>Layers of Fear&nbsp;</i>series, which takes a much more straightforward "walking simulator"-style approach to horror than&nbsp;<em>The Medium&nbsp;</em>(and, hopefully,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>as well).</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what comes of Bloober Team and Private Division's partnership dissolving. Stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p>A listing for Resident Evil 9 appeared today on online retailer Play Asia's website, revealing the game's supposed subtitle.</p>
<p>The listing, which can be found<a href="https://www.play-asia.com/resident-evil-9/13/70hafz"> here</a>, reveals that the ninth entry in the series, subtitled Remnant Shadows, will continue the series' chilling legacy with a fresh story, new characters, and the return of familiar faces, blending intense action intricate puzzles and the atmospheric dream fans have come to love over the years.</p>
<p>Alongside the Resident Evil 9 listing, listings for<a href="https://www.play-asia.com/biohazard-code-veronica-x/13/70haan"> Resident Evil Code Veronica</a>, <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/biohazard-zero-hd-remaster/13/70haa7">Zero</a>, and <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/resident-evil-5/13/70hadf">5</a> on PlayStation 5 appeared today on Play Asia. The listing for the fifth entry in the series is particularly interesting, as it states that it features "new technology developed specifically for the game, as well as incredible changes to both the gameplay and world of Resident Evi," suggesting this will be a full remake, and not a remaster. The Code Veronica listing, sadly, doesn't provide any new information, while the Zero listing seems to suggest it will be an HD remaster and not a remake.</p>
<p>Following the release of the Resident Evil 4 remake, CAPCOM has been pretty silent regarding the series, although it has been known for a while that a new numbered entry in the series has been in the works for a good while. <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-zero-code-veronica-remakes/">A few days ago</a>, reliable insider Dusk Golem confirmed that remakes of Code Veronica and Zero are indeed in the works, so the future is definitely looking great for the popular survival horror series, although it is not yet clear exactly when we will get the first glimpse at any of the games in development.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Baldur's Gate 4 Isn't Next For Larian; Something Bigger Is Coming</p>
      </div>
<p>"If anybody from Larian at this point tells you this is what the game is going to be, they're lying. They don't know because we're trying a whole bunch of things," he added. "We have ideas, but we're an iterative company. So we iterate. We're trying things. We're experimenting."</p><p>What we do know is that Larian is not going to make Baldur's Gate 4, though Vincke did confirm that Larian started working on Baldur's Gate 4 (and DLC for Baldur's Gate 3) before shifting gears.</p><p>Vincke wanted to make something new in part because Baldur's Gate is owned by Hasbro, and he wanted Larian to branch off on its own.</p><p>"It literally wasn't for us anymore. I think one of the problems is--it's not our IP. It's not ours. Obviously, all that success attracts a lot of attention. But it was always important for us to be able to do our own thing, to maintain the Larian's independence. And with BG3, the miracle was that we were left alone so we could do our own thing," he said.</p><p>Beyond Larian's next game, Vincke is thinking even further out and has grand plans to create a "very big RPG" that will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-is-working-toward-an-rpg-that-dwarfs-it/1100-6522051/" data-ref-id="1100-6522051">"dwarf"</a> any of Larian's previous releases. "It's an inspirational goal. That's it. I cannot say more, because it needs to stay in that dream-reality," he said.</p><p>While Larian will not make Baldur's Gate 4, Hasbro has said it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">keen to expand the Baldur's Gate series with other teams. </a> "We're going to take our time and find the right partner, the right approach, and the right product," Hasbro previously said about the future of Baldur's Gate.</p>

<p data-characters="253" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It might seem odd in a racing game, but making sure your camera settings are perfect can actually cut tenths off your lap times. If you’re not sure how to tweak them, I’ve put together this guide with all the <em>F1 24</em> camera settings you need. </p> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">You might be wondering why camera settings are important, but the reason is that if your camera is in the wrong position, you may find it difficult to spot the apex of a corner and end up costing yourself lap time.

<p data-characters="265" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While the specifics of the issue are still unclear, it seems a very significant chunk of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-launch-trailer-has-me-asking-a-lot-of-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a></em> has leaked ahead of its June 4 release date. The leak is rapidly spreading all over the internet, so I advise caution if you’re spoiler-averse.</p> <p data-characters="628" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">Notably, it appears that a strange issue with Sony’s PlayStation 5 streaming services allowed some users to access a pre-release build of <em>The Final Shape</em>. It doesn’t seem that there have been any major story leaks, which is good news, but <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-new-exotic-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the gear has been all but entirely leaked</a> due to all the new stuff popping up via the Collections interface. This means that if you’d like to enjoy the process of discovery at your own pace on June 4, you’re going to want to avoid most of the usual online <em>Destiny</em> discussion hotspots, as screenshots and videos are being posted virtually all over the place already.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-avoid-the-usual-destiny-2-discussion-boards-to-steer-clear-of-the-final-shape-leaks" data-injectable="false">Avoid the usual Destiny 2 discussion boards to steer clear of The Final Shape leaks</h2> <p data-characters="466" data-current-count="766" data-injectable="true">The particularly alarming bit, in my book, is that Raid loot seems to have leaked alongside all the usual stuff (i.e. regular DLC loot, seasonal gear, etc.), and the featured descriptions <em>can</em> help deduce what some of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-the-pale-heart-location-leans-into-strangeness-and-wouldnt-look-out-of-place-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Final Shape</em>‘s hotly anticipated narrative beats</a> might be. Further, Raid mods, too, seem to have been spotted, and particularly well-informed and clever players could use these during the Raid Race to figure out the event’s mechanics.</p>
 <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">This could be catastrophic for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-raid-release-date-and-exact-release-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Final Shape</em>‘s Raid</a> scene. Historically, <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s Raid Race events have always been the highlights of their respective content releases, as they invigorate the community and bring everyone together to figure out what’s what and how the new endgame content functions in practice. Having what is practically a leaked cheat sheet around is a huge issue, especially considering just <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how important <em>The Final Shape</em> is for <em>Destiny</em> at large</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="527" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true">It doesn’t <em>seem</em> that any of the actual lore and cutscenes have leaked out, thankfully. Those players who managed to accidentally access the testing server had to create an all-new character, which meant they couldn’t immediately start progressing through <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s story. Still, I recommend extreme caution if you don’t want spoilers for <em>The Final Shape</em>, and the upcoming seasonal release, Echo. It’s just better to stay on the safe side of things when it comes to such situations, really.</p>
 <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="247" data-injectable="false">Whatever the case may be, Bungie may decide to chime in on the situation as part of today’s TWID blog post. With <em>The Final Shape</em> coming out next Tuesday, this leak is bound to be a hot topic for the next couple of days, so stay on your toes.</p>

			<p>It’s hard work being a young Diokek warrior. One moment you are minding your own business, exploring some ancient ruins, and the next you’re discovering a legendary sword and are tasked with saving the entire world from sinister forces! Turns out you’re a long-prophesied heroic saviour. Typical.</p>
<p><iframe title="Astor: Blade of the Monolith -  Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhs--UE8cGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And so begins Astor: Blade of the Monolith, a fast-paced Zelda-like action RPG. And fast-paced the game certainly is! There is no mucking about with long introductions and tedious tutorials here; Astor has their sword and starts their quest within a few minutes of the game booting up. This efficient and effective storytelling is a breath of fresh air. Throughout the quest, the game keeps never-ending text boxes and long-winded waffle to a minimum; Astor’s fellow Diokek’s clearly know this hero has got a lot of saving the world to do, so they keep their exposition welcomingly concise. As such, Astor: Blade of Monolith has a pleasing arcade quality that suffuses its otherwise standard action RPG experience.</p>



<p>Visually, Astor: Blade of the Monolith is rather lovely too. Sure, the environments themselves are standard video game fare – dark caves, forests, deserts, you get the idea – but they are pleasingly designed with a chunky cartoon aesthetic that sets the game apart from its many contemporaries. Seeing the wind rustle through the red leaves, shrubs, and long grass of the forest world, even teasing Astor’s cloak playfully, was an unexpected visual treat for what is a budget-priced game. It’s a shame that the environments are so empty. Wandering back and forth across a desert, you’ll encounter handfuls of enemies but there is little of interest to lure you from the path to your next dungeon.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the dungeons themselves are much more interesting to explore. Though gameplay-wise the experience is akin to a My First Zelda, there is still fun to be had. After all, all the elements you would expect are present. There are weapons and tools to gather, puzzles to progress through, foes to best, and big bosses to battle. Nothing to blow you away perhaps, but there is a certain satisfaction to be had from a decent adventure that’s reliably delivered with classic mechanics.</p>

<p>Combat, again, is reasonable but lacking in heft. Astor can swipe and slash their sword like the best of them, but it never feels like a foe is being hit. Indeed, were it not for diminishing health bars, it would be hard to tell if Astor’s intricate combos were having any impact whatsoever. Everything feels a little flat. Even when Astor juggles opponents with an air combo, rarely do you feel like there is any contact or connection. The same goes for incoming enemy attacks, their lack of visual commitment makes them difficult to read. Successful dodging and parrying then, is far more down to luck than skill.</p>
<p>Mind you, with a gentle difficulty curve and minimal hassle, even with the lacklustre combat, Astor: Blade of the Monolith proves an enjoyable means to while away a few hours.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Astor: Blade of the Monolith offers an enjoyable action RPG experience with charming visuals and character design. However, with weak combat and a lack of things to see and do in the overworld, it’s an experience that will soon be forgotten.	</p></div>

            <p>A retail listing for Resident Evil 9 has popped up on Play Asia, along with PS5 versions of Code Veronica, Resident Evil 0, and Resident Evil 5.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-currently-in-development-leak-claims">Whilst the remakes have long been rumoured to be in development</a>, the former includes a hitherto unknown subtitle, "Revenant Shadows", "preliminary" cover art, and a description of the game.</p>

<p>"Resident Evil 9: Revenant Shadows is the latest instalment in the iconic survival horror series by Capcom," the store description <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/resident-evil-9/13/70hafz">says</a>, without actually telling us anything meaningful about the game, suggesting it's just placeholder text.</p>
<p>"This game continues the chilling legacy with a fresh story, new characters, and the return of familiar faces. Set in an expansive, terrifying world filled with new threats and mysteries, Revenant Shadows blends intense action, intricate puzzles, and the atmospheric dread that fans have come to love."</p>
<p>There are also listings for Resident Evil 5 on <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/resident-evil-5/13/70hadf">PS5</a> – the description says there's been "new technology developed specifically for the game, as well as incredible changes to both the gameplay and world of Resident Evil", suggesting it's not a mere remaster – and <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/biohazard-code-veronica-x/13/70haan">Code Veronica</a>, although it's unclear at this stage if that's a port or a remaster.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>A PS5 version of <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/biohazard-zero-hd-remaster/13/70haa7">Resident Evil Zero</a> is also listed, although that is clearly marked as an "HD remaster."</p> <div>

<p>Capcom has yet to comment on the listings, and no release dates are given for any of these presently unannounced games. At the time of writing, only PS5 versions of the horror games are available.</p>
<p>The listings add credence to the rumours from earlier in the week that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-currently-in-development-leak-claims">intimated Capcom had remakes of both Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil: Code Veronica in development</a>.</p>
<p>In a long thread of posts on social media platform X, Dusk Golem attempted to clarify what has been a confusing time for claims about the future of the Resident Evil series, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-is-doing-incredibly-well">huge success of the recent Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>.</p>
<p>Capcom's main team behind RE4 Remake is now worked on Code Veronica, Dusk Golem stated, while its secondary studio that worked on RE4 Remake's Separate Ways DLC is handling work on Zero.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kill-knight">KILL KNIGHT</a>, the silly-named twin stick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> you may have caught at similarly silly-named event <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-triple-i-initiative">The Triple-I Initiative</a> in April, is joining this year's Steam next fest with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694420/KILL_KNIGHT/">a demo</a> ahead of its expected release date later this year. I’ve played it, and I feel must apologise, Mr. Knight. I still think it's a silly name, but with frantic flowing action this immediately gratifying, you can call yourself whatever your killy little heart so desires. For this knight is not like other knights: this is a knight who kills. Wait, they all do that? Oh. Well, this one has four guns. Suck it, literally every other knight.</p>

<p>Imagine I’ve got a whiteboard pointer, because I’d first like to highlight Kill Knight’s spread of individual tutorials, each adding another trick to your arsenal. You start with the basics - twin automatic pistols with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war">Gears Of War</a>-style active reload that makes them deadlier, and a highly reactive dodge with i-frames for phasing through projectiles. You’ve also got a screen-clearing shotgun, great for much-needed crowd control, since Kill Knight overwhelms you with foes from second one. The shotgun has limited ammunition, but you’ll gain more by slaying foes with your sword. Oh, right. Yeah. You’ve got a sword!</p>

<p>You’ve also got a fourth gun (Four guns <em>and</em> a sword!) but this one is special. Kills made with this gun are the only way to spawn health orbs, and you can only fill up its shoot-o-meter by absorbing the red orbs that fallen foes drop. But! These orbs are also how you power up your character, increasing your speed, damage, and possibly some other bits. It’s a lot to balance! Also you can parry. Also the parrying slows down time. I tell thee what, this knight has truly put a lot of thought into the myriad ways in which kills may be achieved.</p>
<p>It all comes together to blend the twitchy with the cerebral, the pressure of making smart calls to safeguard the next ten seconds while murder-dodging your way through the current ten seconds. I’ve not quite mastered the balance myself, but it’s already got its hooks in me to the point where I’d be well up for getting even mildly proficient at it. I’m writing this in the past, but I assume there'll be some sort of tag where you can keep up with all our picks from this year’s Steam Next Fest. That’s my promise to you as a Word Writer.</p>
<p>Steam Next Fest 2024 doesn't kick off properly until the 10th of June, but we've already got some lovely demos trickling in. You can keep up with all our coverage<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/steam-next-fest-2024"> here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166316/keanu-reeves-china-mieville-book-of-elsewhere-brzrkr<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="XMYN2U">Who or what can’t <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23640292/best-keanu-reeves-movies-john-wick">Keanu Reeves</a> beat in a fight? The titan of action cinema, who has also recently expanded his enthusiasm and prowess <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/cyberpunk-2077/7564">to video games</a>, has been taking on a new foe of late: literature. What started as a wildly successful venture into comic books with the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2021/3/4/22313805/keanu-reeves-brzrkr-comic-boom-studios-review">Kickstarter-funded series <em>BRZRKR</em></a>, co-created by Matt Kindt and Ron Garney, has now expanded into Reeves’ first co-written novel, <em>The Book of Elsewhere</em>. </p>
<p id="TMCThj">Don’t worry if you’re not familiar — <em>The Book of Elsewhere </em>is not solely for fans of <em>BRZRKR</em>, but it’s a good fit for fans of Keanu Reeves. A philosophical, violent thriller about an immortal soldier pondering the nature of his existence, <em>The Book of Elsewhere</em> has an elegance that might surprise you for a pulp thriller, thanks to Reeves’ chosen collaborator: weird-fiction legend China Miéville. </p>
<p id="W7tdFZ">Miéville is a prolific and wide-ranging writer known as one of the preeminent voices in the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_weird">new weird</a>” canon of the ’90s and ’00s, with novels like <em>Perdido Street Station</em>, <em>Embassytown</em>, and <em>The City &amp; the City</em> that, generally speaking, applied the cosmic horror sensibilities of H.P. Lovecraft and Robert W. Chambers to other genres — most often urban fantasy, in Miéville’s case. His presence as Reeves’ narrative collaborator on <em>The Book of Elsewhere</em> immediately makes it more interesting, even for those who aren’t already fans of the comic. </p>
<p id="SvMdsf">Because while <em>BRZRKR</em> is a hell of a thrill ride, it takes some doing to expand into a worthwhile novelistic experience. The story of an immortal warrior named Unute, or “B,” <em>BRZRKR</em>’s 12-issue narrative is an ultra-violent fable about a warrior-poet of sorts, an 80,000-year-old man with the might of a demigod in search of an end to his immortal condition. He doesn’t want to die, he repeatedly says; he just wants to be able to. To this end, Unute has struck a devil’s bargain with the United States government: He does dangerous black ops work for the military, and in exchange they get to study him to see if anything about his superhuman strength is replicable, as long as they also try and find a way to cure him. </p>

<p id="mBypAJ">It’s a very comic book-y story, depicted with unsparing brutality under Garney’s pen, but the three men who made it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/22717755/keanu-reeves-interview-brzrkr-comic">do the work to ensure it is also a thoughtful comic book-y story</a>. <em>The Book of Elsewhere</em> doesn’t just transpose <em>BRZRKR</em> into a new medium, though. It’s more an entirely different take on the same basic premise, like seeing two stylistically different filmmakers adapt the same story. </p>
<p id="Ok8p4e">Under Miéville, the stranger aspects of Reeves’ unkillable warrior take center stage. While its violent, in-medias-res opening may make the reader feel like they missed something, Miéville introduces Unute/B and his world as if <em>BRZRKR </em>didn’t exist. Different aspects of the story find new emphasis, and its plot centers on a strange new dilemma: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babirusa">babirusa</a>, or deer-pig, that is also immortal, just like Unute, and has followed him throughout his life. </p>
<p id="GfRtLS">It’s a thoughtful twist that allows Miéville to bring an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/21/17036936/annihilation-movie-review-2018-natalie-portman-alex-garland"><em>Annihilation</em>-esque</a> flair to the world of <em>BRZRKR</em>, turning Unute’s immortality into something more like an eco-horror mystery, with a conspiracy thriller on the side. Chapters alternate between the main narrative and vignettes from throughout history, recounting people or places that Unute or the babirusa encountered, ruminating more deeply on the philosophical ideas of cyclical violence gestured at in the comic. And it’s worth repeating: I read <em>The Book of Elsewhere</em> before <em>BRZRKR</em>, and it stood alone just fine. In fact, being a fan of one of Reeves’ two takes on Unute’s story does not necessarily mean you will enjoy the other. This is a good thing, as both are distinct works reflective of the creators working with the raw material Reeves gives them. </p>
<p id="7OhZWB">In this, <em>BRZRKR</em> and <em>The Book of Elsewhere</em> mirror the actor’s career in cinema: Whether it’s in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22847211/the-matrix-resurrections-review"><em>The Matrix</em></a><em> </em>or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23653939/john-wick-chapter-4-eat-the-rich"><em>John Wick</em></a>, Reeves excels in enabling fellow artists to bring their A game. </p>
<p id="ige7MO"><em>The Book of Elsewhere</em> will be available July 23. </p>

<p>According to a variety of leaks from <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter/X user @AusilMV</a>, MultiVersus plans to add multiple fan favorite characters, stages, and more.</p>



<p>The following contains potential spoilers for MultiVersus. In fact, user @AusilMV warned readers that their account has multiple strikes and may be taken down soon. But many fans have already had a good look at the following spoilers.</p>



<p>After apparent datamining, @AusilMV claims that some of the upcoming characters include Daffy Duck, Samurai Jack, and Aquaman, among others. The latter two do line up with easter eggs in the latest trailer. Some fans spotted a trident and a katana around the WB tower in the teaser.</p>



<p>@AusilMV also claims that some major stages are coming to the game, such as a Cat Concerto stage and Candy Kingdom. The Cat Concerto would be a reference to one of the most beloved Tom &amp; Jerry episodes of all time. </p>



<p>Again, the most recent trailer hinted at stages like the Teen Titans tower, which @AusilMV also seemed to find. They also mentioned a Water Tower and a Mousewheel.</p>



<p>At this time, the dev team did not officially confirm any of these characters and other leaks are actually coming to MultiVersus.</p>



<p>MultiVersus only <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-release-date-announced-for-may-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just launched again</a> on May 28 after a long hiatus, introducing new content and features. Notably, the devs confirmed that both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-trailer-teases-jason-voorhees-agent-smith-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Voorhees and Agent Smith</a>, from Friday the 13th and The Matrix, joined the roster.</p>

<p>Bloober Team is looking for a new publisher for its new unannounced survival horror game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bloober-team-working-with-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known as Project C</a>, after Take-Two Interactive’s Private Division has reportedly canceled its publishing deal with the studio.</p>



<p>As first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1796102364463501426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MauroNL on Twitter</a>, the terms of the termination are being negotiated. Bloober Team is also looking for another publisher for the game, which is expected to be a brand new IP from the Polish studio.</p>



<p>The deal between Bloober Team and Private Division was signed back in September 2021. That deal included an option for Private Division to cancel without reason, according to MauroNL.</p>



<p>The cancellation comes amid Take-Two Interactive’s announced plans to cancel multiple games. </p>



<p>As of publishing, neither Take-Two Interactive or Bloober Team have commented on the termination. Insider Gaming has reached out to both parties for comment. Should a response be received, it’ll be added to this story. </p>



<p>Currently, Bloober Team is still working on the Silent Hill 2 remake that is expected to be sometime in 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/30/playstation-says-live-service-games-will-launch-day-and-date-on-pc-but-single<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>PlayStation has reiterated its approach to releasing its games on PC, stating live-service games will launch day-and-date on PC. However, its tentpole single player games will not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This comes from <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/14/hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino-named-dual-playstation-ceos-following-jim-ryans">one of PlayStation's dual CEOs, Hermen Hulst</a>, during a public business <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf">presentation</a> held earlier this morning. During it, Hulst explained the strategy for releasing PlayStation's single-player games on PC at a later date, rather than day-and-date, citing it's part of a strategy to bring more people into the PlayStation platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GF8M0YoySoc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"Indeed, we are bringing our titles to the PC platform, and we have a dual approach here," Hulst said. "On the live service side, we are releasing our titles simultaneously, so day and date on PlayStation 5 and PC. But with our tentpole titles, our single player narrative-driven titles that [are] the backbone of what PlayStation studios has delivered in recent years and in our history, we take a more strategic approach and we introduce our great franchises to new audiences, and we're finding new audiences that are potentially going to be very interested in playing, for example, sequels, on the PlayStation platform.</p>

<p>"We have high hopes that we are actually able to bring new players into PlayStation at large, but into PlayStation platforms specifically. Actually, the same goes for the work that we do with extending our great properties onto other media, such as television series and film, for example, as you have seen with <em>The Last of Us</em> on HBO or <em>Gran Turismo</em> on film, that brings new players into our franchises as well."</p>

<p>While this doesn't come as a surprise – we saw the live-service multiplayer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven">Helldivers 2</a> launch earlier this year simultaneously on PS5 and PC while <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/06/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-rides-to-pc-in-may">Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut</a> only just hit PC this month, years after its PS5 release – it's nice to officially hear PlayStation's approach moving forward.</p>

<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Natsume continues to diligently plow the fields of <em>Harvest Moon</em>, and its latest crack at the farming sim series takes it to mobile. The developer and publisher <a href="https://www.natsume.com/news/news_pdffiles/pid_351_HMHSH_Title%20AnnouncementF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> <em>Harvest Moon: Home Sweet Home </em>as a mobile game that’s eyeing an August 2024 launch on iOS and Android.</p> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">Details are light at the moment, but <em>Home Sweet Home </em>has players moving back to their hometown at the behest of their childhood friend. It turns out the town of Alba is in rough shape now, and it’s up to you to revitalize it. In the process, you’ll need to team up with friends while convincing the more doubtful townsfolk that someone from the city has what it takes to bring their town back to life.&nbsp;</p>

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiK4CpQg1aw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stream</a> is set to kick off today, on May 30, at 3 p.m. Pacific Time, and it sure would be a coincidence if one of their announcements had to do with the <em>Story of Seasons </em>series. As you may know, the original, long-running <em>Harvest Moon </em>series continues under the <em>Story of Seasons </em>title in the west due to rights issues.</p>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">We’ll see what comes of the Marvelous stream soon while we wait for more information from Natsume on the next <em>Harvest Moon </em>entry. Prior to this, the most recent game was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/new-harvest-moon-screens-winds-of-anthos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Harvest Moon: The Winds of Anthos</em></a>, which hit consoles and PCs around the world in September 2023.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-animated-series-coming-to-netflix.884844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix and Microsoft have announced a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>animated series as part of the hugely popular sandbox game's 15-year anniversary celebrations.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/netflix-series" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>website, the series will tell "an original story with new characters" and will "reflect the world of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>in a new light".</p>

<p>It's being worked on by WildBrain, the company responsible for shows like&nbsp;<em>Sonic Prime</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Ninjago: Dragons Rising</em>, so if you've seen either of those shows then you'll know roughly what to expect from&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-animated-series-telltale-story-mode.jpg?itok=BFY_ZHAv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-animated-series-telltale-story-mode.jpg?itok=bSgIF9yE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming Netflix&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>animated series won't be the franchise's first foray into narrative media.</figcaption></figure><p>Details about the series are pretty thin on the ground right now; we know that&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>will be exclusive to Netflix, but we don't know what its story will be, who it will star, or even what its name is.</p>

<p>The teaser trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>animated series is light on info, too; it features a single Creeper shuffling its way across the screen, followed by a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-style Netflix logo surrounded by lava and a promise that the series is "coming soon".</p>

<p>You can check the teaser out below, but be aware that it's very much a teaser, so there probably isn't much information to mine (oho!) from it.</p>




<p>Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>animated series won't be the franchise's first flirtation with narrative media, and it also won't be the first time&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>has appeared on Netflix, either.</p>

<p>Telltale's&nbsp;<em>Minecraft: Story Mode</em>, which was originally released episodically between 2015 and 2017, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-story-mode-comes-to-netflix-november-7">made its way to Netflix in 2018</a>&nbsp;as well, although it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/download-minecraft-story-mode-before-its-gone-for-good-later-in-june-2019">subsequently delisted in 2019</a>.</p>

<p>There's also a live-action&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>movie in the works, and it's set to star Jack Black as main character Steve, apparently alongside stars like Jason Momoa, Jennifer Coolidge, and Kate McKinnon.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether the movie will launch before Netflix's animated series does. Stay tuned for more info on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>.</p>

Full screenshots of new loot, raid exotics, and even partial cutscenes are popping up across various YouTube channels, Discord servers and subreddits.</p><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

There is speculation that Sony may have mistakenly pushed out the new build for Bungie’s game onto the PlayStation Network early, though there hasn’t yet been any confirmation of how players were able to access the content.
