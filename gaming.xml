			<p>The humble scrolling beat ‘em up has been experiencing something of a golden age in recent years, with the indie-scene enjoying a resurgence in the old-school coin-fed darling. We’ve seen modern reimagining’s of arcade classics, beat ‘em ups with roguelite elements, and even attack inputs controlled with a thumb-stick. Now, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ra-ra-boom">Ra Ra BOOM</a>, we’re witnessing a scrolling beat ‘em up combined with a scrolling shoot ‘em up. Oh, and it includes space cheer leaders.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ra Ra BOOM Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wKowKZpM2Ow?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A rogue AI has taken over the world. We’re not told why, but maybe it got fed up with answering inane questions about Roman sanitary systems, or perhaps that’s just me? Either way, humanity has fled to a space colony to survive, but doesn’t give up hopes of fighting back. No, we’ve actually been preparing for counter AI’s aggression by… training up a group of cheerleading heroes – Saida, Aris, Vee, and Ren – to take the fight back Earth and free the world from its oppressive digital overlord.</p>


<p>What follows is a bold, bright, Saturday-morning cartoon inspired adventure in which you and up to three friends get to beat seven shades of oil out of hordes of despotic, yet oddly charming, robots. Visually Ra Ra Boom stands out with it over-the-top characters designs and a punchy colour palette. Animation is slick and smooth, our heroes cartwheeling, sliding, and double jumping around the environment with stylish abandon. Combat is strong too, made up of accessible combos and easy to implement dodges. Chargeable special attacks are suitably bombastic, laying waste to swarms of foes in blooming patters of blue fire.</p>


<p>Entire sections of the game transform into something akin to a scrolling shoot ‘em up, in which the speed of the player characters’ increase, enemies spawn in greater numbers, and you are encouraged to squeeze the trigger to unleash a delicious spray of machine gun fire, cavalcade of rockets, or a smattering of ninja throwing stars. Thanks to clear horizontal pathways mowed into the ground like the level is a fancy lawn, it’s easy to tell if you are on the same attack plane as your enemy, removing the common frustration of not being able to hit your foe as you are slightly in the wrong position.</p>
<p>It’s all eminently enjoyable silly stuff, particularly in local co-op. The problem comes with how slight the game is, perhaps even being unfinished. For example, early on in the game you’re encouraged to choose between two paths, with the tutorial informing you that this will be a regular occurrence. However, no further path choosing occurs – it’s like the devs ran out of time to actually include the feature. There are also lengthy expanses of level where nothing much happens, you just walk from left to right; no dialogue, no enemies, no nothing. The final two levels also feel rather cheap, one seeing you fight evil versions of yourselves again and again, the other featuring a supremely underwhelming final boss that is an unexpected doddle to defeat.</p>

<p>Upon completion, there’s little reason to return. Sure, you can play through each level to tick off certain challenges, but these activities are exactly the same on each stage. After being forced to shoot every enemy rather than engage in close combat five times in a row, things get pretty boring. In short, there’s a distinct vibe of this not being fully fleshed out.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The debut release from Gylee Games has a lot going for it; a charming cartoony aesthetic and reliably punchy fisticuffs being at the forefront of that particular list. Yet, it also feels too light on content, suggesting we might have to wait for a sequel before Ra Ra Boom’s true potential is realised.	</p></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-should-you-bring-the-bolt-cutter-with-you/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-%E2%80%93-should-you-bring-the-bolt-cutter-with-you.1288494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In true survival-horror fashion, Cronos: The New Dawn features a few items that The Travel has to acquire to complete the mission. These items like keys and keycards, are discarded automatically once they no longer useful. There's only one exception to this rule: the Bolt Cutter.</p>



<p>Much like the keys above, the <strong>Bolt Cutter</strong> is an item that is required to proceed toward one of the early game's main objectives, but once it is used to open a door locked with a chain, it isn't discarded like every other progression-related item. As inventory space in Cronos: The New Dawn is limited, bringing an item that may not look particularly useful during the moment-to-moment gameplay doesn't sound like a great idea, so <strong>is there any reason why you should bring it with you?</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>There are plenty of good reasons to bring the Bolt Cutter with you in Cronos: The New Dawn</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though some may prefer to carry more useful items as they make their way through New Dawn, <strong>bringing the Bolt Cutter with you may still be a good idea</strong>. Even though there aren't a lot of doors that require the item to open, there's at least one of them in all of the game's main locations, and inside these doors, you will find <strong>a ton of useful resources</strong> that can really make a difference in an experience where resources like ammo and crafting materials are scarce. As such, consider <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-upgrades-to-get/">expanding your Shell's inventory slots</a></strong> as much as possible in the early game, not only to always have the Bolt Cutter with you, but also to be able to carry all the items you can find inside the rooms you can access with it.</p>



<p>However, if a bit of backtracking doesn't scare you, you always have the option to leave the Bolt Cutter inside your storage crate and backtrack to retrieve it whenever you find a locked door. Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't make stage navigation too simple without a map, but after spending a few minutes inside any of the game's main locations, you should have decent knowledge of their layouts, making backtracking a little easier.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/pragmata-isnt-secret-mega-man-game-says-capcom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pragmata-isn%E2%80%99t-a-secret-mega-man-game-says-capcom-killing-fans%E2%80%99-dreams.1288491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PRAGMATA was among the most interesting titles shown at Gamescom 2025, as evidenced by Francesco De Meo's preview published earlier today:</p>



<p><em>Before Hugh can damage any enemy using any weapon, Dana will first have to hack them to lower their defenses. Hacking is done via some puzzle grids that are generally easy to complete, but that can be a challenge to clear with the attention divided between the minigame and avoiding damage. Once the puzzle has been completed, the enemy will be left defenseless for a short while, allowing Hugh to dispose of it. The hacking minigames promise to become more complex as Hugh discovers new abilities, as it is possible to apply debuffs via some slightly more complex puzzle grids. At the beginning of the demo, handling the two core elements of the combat system felt a little forced, but before long, I was hacking and taking down enemies with ease, all the while having extreme fun.</em></p>



<p>I also played a bit of the Gamescom 2025 demo and came away equally impressed and looking forward to the release next year. However, just in case you're among the die-hard Mega Man fans who have been speculating that PRAGMATA could somehow be connected to CAPCOM's Mega Man franchise, game producer Naoto Oyama has officially killed your dreams in a statement <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-settles-it-no-pragmata-isnt-a-secret-mega-man-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to VideoGamesChronicle</a>:</p>



<p><em>Pragmata is not a Mega Man game. It is a completely new game from Capcom. I was actually one of the producers on the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection as well, so I’m happy to see that people who love Mega Man are passionate about Pragmata too. From my standpoint, it’s nice to see people are being so positive about it.</em></p>



<p>It always seemed a bit of a stretch to me, but as Oyama said, ultimately it doesn't matter much as long as Mega Man fans can enjoy it all the same. The single player action/adventure game will be released at some point next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X after several delays (PRAGMATA was originally slated for 2022, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-teaser-art-delay-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023</a>, and then again indefinitely until the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 window</a>).</p>

            <p>Mewgenics finally has a release date! The endless cat breeding RPG from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a>'s Edmund McMillen will be released on 10th February, 2026 on PC. That's over 13 years since its original announcement!</p>
<p>Alongside this announcement, McMillen (one half of the Mewgenics team) released a gameplay reveal on his personal YouTube account. It's a whopping 50-minutes long, and showcases how the much-anticipated indie will actually play. You can check it out yourself down below.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Mewgenics has been on a bizarre development journey. First revealed in 2012 after the smash hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-meat-boy">Super Meat Boy</a>, the game was described as the "strangest project" McMillen had ever worked on. However, this version of Mewgenics was shelved and ultimately cancelled, with McMillen focusing on The Legend of Bumbo until 2018 when he acquired the rights for Mewgenics from Team Meat and began development on the game alongside Tyler Glaiel.</p>

<figure><a title="007 / Hitman" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/68598632611c7/007-hitman.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Judging from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/007-first-light-is-more-that-just-spies-and-style-launches-march-2026-on-switch-2">recent gameplay reveal</a>, IO Interactive's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> is looking pretty marvellous, and it's heading to the Switch 2 on <strong>27th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, in speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-dev-io-interactive-put-daniel-craigs-head-on-agent-47-when-pitching-for-james-bond-game-007-first-light">IGN</a>, game director Hakan Abrak has revealed that IO managed to secure the video game rights to James Bond in a rather amusing (albeit not entirely surprising) way. Essentially, the studio took the (digital) head of Daniel Craig, the most recent actor to portray Bond, and stuck it on Agent 47's body from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3lwyvup&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The team then demonstrated how a Bond game would work by exploring the Sapienza level from 2016's Hitman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We actually did put Daniel Craig in there. We just modeled his head and put it in instead of Agent 47, just for demo purposes, giving an impression of what these living, breathing spaces mean in an IO game. And if you are acquainted with the franchise, there is a level called Sapienza with the virus in the caves underneath the compound. So we showed some things off there and, yeah, it was well received.</p>
<p>"I think what they saw in us and what we are also conveying is our angle would be to try to deliver a 360 experience where it's not necessarily about only shooting and cut scenes — there's certainly that in our game as well — but it's also being able to explore the part of the Bond fantasy where he is in social spaces where he is using not only his fisticuffs, but also his charms and bluff and figuring out different ways in those social spaces to overcome the obstacles or get what he wants. How would a charming Bond fare in a situation like this where he doesn't have to necessarily resort to violence?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, we reckon it's safe to say that folks weren't exactly shocked to discover that IO, who really did tremendous work on the Hitman series, would be the ones to bring James Bond back into the world of video games. Hitman is basically Bond, but... maybe a bit more violent. Just a bit.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's a fun little story about how that project came to be, and we can't wait to check out the full game next year. 007 First Light will be available via a standard edition priced at <strong>$69.99 / €69.99 / £59.99</strong> along with a deluxe edition priced at <strong>$79.99 / €79.99 / £69.99</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CAPCOM's sci-fi game PRAGMATA has been a mystery for a good while. In the months following its announcement in <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-sci-fi-game-pragmata/">2020</a> and its eventual delay from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-teaser-art-delay-2023/">2022 release window</a>, very little was said about the game, making players feel it would follow in the footsteps of the ill-fated <a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-down-hasnt-been-completely-given-up-on-by-capcom-says-ono/">Deep Down</a>, an action role-playing game by the Japanese publisher that never saw the light of day. Thankfully, that was not to be the case, as a trailer shared in 2023 confirmed it was a real game with some rather unique gameplay mechanics, which were further defined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/">subsequent showings</a>. While opinion is divided between action game fans regarding the game's unique combination of action and puzzle game elements, I feel that once PRAGMATA is in their hands sometime next year, the general consensus will be generally positive, expecially if the game's quality will be on the same level as that of the Gamescom 2025 demo.</p>



<p>The PRAGMATA Gamescom demo takes place aboard a deserted lunar research facility deep in space, where protagonist Hugh and the android Dana work together to uncover what happened to it and eventually return to Earth safely. On the surface, the game doesn't feel much different from a lot of other third-person action-adventure games, as Hugh has to navigate an intricate enough facility and complete a few simple puzzles, mostly of the navigational kind, while fighting enemies here and there. To be fair, everything feels pleasing enough to play, but the game definitely wouldn't have been very remarkable without its unique combat system combining action and puzzle game elements, which is sure to become the defining highlight of the entire experience.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>PRAGMATA's hacking mechanics add a new dimension to traditional third-person action combat that makes the game extremely fun to play.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Before Hugh can damage any enemy using any weapon, Dana will first have to hack them to lower their defenses. Hacking is done via some puzzle grids that are generally easy to complete, but that can be a challenge to clear with the attention divided between the minigame and avoiding damage. Once the puzzle has been completed, the enemy will be left defenseless for a short while, allowing Hugh to dispose of it. The hacking minigames promise to become more complex as Hugh discovers new abilities, as it is possible to apply debuffs via some slightly more complex puzzle grids. At the beginning of the demo, handling the two core elements of the combat system felt a little forced, but before long, I was hacking and taking down enemies with ease, all the while having extreme fun. The boss fight possibly even did a better job showcasing just how nicely this gameplay setup works, making for an intense battle that felt extremely dynamic with the constant switching between hacking and action gameplay, and properly taking advantage of the enemy's vulnerable state to maximize damage.</p>



<p>Having had so much fun with the demo, my time with PRAGMATA flew by way too quickly, leaving me hungering for more. With hints of things to come already noticeable from the demo, I really cannot wait to see how creative the development team got with an experience that is set to be among the most fun in action-adventure games in years. Sadly, we still don't know when we will be able to embark on this journey together with Hugh and Dana, as PRAGMATA is slated for a generic 2026 release window on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Thanks to a combination of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-might-be-moving-closer-to-a-steam-controller-2-and-new-vr-controllers-rumours-say">datamining</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-latest-patent-filing-is-for-a-new-vr-headset">public paperwork</a>, we know that Valve are working on, have recently been working on, or are vaguely interested in working on a thick catalogue of different PC hardware. Besides a long-rumoured Steam Machine successor, we’ve also seen evidence of an all-in-one VR headset – codenamed Deckard – and a new take on the Steam Controller, while preliminary tinkerings with a Steam Deck 2 are likely underway even with Valve’s warnings that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-community-continues-to-blow-our-minds-valve-talk-the-steam-deck-one-year-on">it’s a few years off</a>. Now, it looks like one of these has a name: the Steam Frame.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The moniker appears in, once again, <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/99370857">a Valve filing</a> with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/99370861">Two</a>, in fact: one to trademark the Steam Frame as computer hardware and another to cover it under game consoles and peripherals. As well as "Cutlery, Machinery, Tools and Parts Thereof" and "Musical Instruments and Supplies," apparently. Trademark law is weird.</p>
<p>I’m going to ignore my legendarily poor record of predication-making on this website and take a punt on the Steam Frame most probably being Deckard, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-index-review">Valve Index</a> replacement that can supposedly run games off itself instead of needing to be hooked up to a separate PC. I’m guessing that the included controllers would require that second trademark application to cover it under peripherals specifically, and although that could also mean the filings are pointing to the new Steam Controller (or maybe even the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>)... I dunno, "Frame" just sounds like a more fitting name for a VR kit, mainly because all the straps and clips involved can make it feel like you’re wearing scaffolding. Doubt it’s going to be a knife and fork set, anyway.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Then again, maybe it’s all just a spot of arse-covering in case Valve simply like the name and want to dibs it for something later. Trademark and patent documents are, infamously, a source of fanciful bullshit (<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sony-patent-mcdonalds/">MCDONALD'S!</a>) as often as they are for genuine glimpses of future tech. Then again, it wouldn’t be the first time that Valve’s regulatory dealings hinted at real, almost retail-ready products: the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> was indirectly revealed by US and South Korean authorities certifying its upgraded Wi-Fi card.</p>
<p>We’ll see, either way. Also, just to avoid this article ending on an exceptionally nerdy note about Wi-Fi, did you know the USPTO is currently trying to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/02/u-s-appeals-court-uspto-must-reconsider-if-fucks-are-for-everyone/">decide if someone can trademark the word 'Fuck'?</a></p>

<p>Season 4 of Marvel Rivals is rapidly approaching, bringing major changes and additions to the game, and we’ve got all the early details for the patch notes.</p>



<p>As is customary with a new season in Marvel Rivals, a new playable character, new maps, and new Team-Ups are being added, while there was also the big announcement that the game will finally be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-trailer-confirms-ps4-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on PlayStation 4</a>.</p>



<p>For a full overview of what’s being added in Marvel Rivals Season 4, including a look at the buffs and nerfs, take a look at our early patch notes.</p>

<p><strong>The full patch notes for Marvel Rivals Season 4 have not been shared yet. However, we do have an overview of some of the major additions and changes.</strong></p>



<p>In the latest <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1963300965437538535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dev Vision video</a>, general details were provided of the new additions to the character roster, maps, and game modes. This was then followed by details of the buffs and nerfs for Season 4.</p>



<p>We’ve split the early patch notes for Marvel Rivals Season 4 into specific sections below to make it easier to navigate.</p>



<h3 id="h-angela-new-playable-character">Angela – New Playable Character</h3>



<p>Angela, Asgard’s Assassin and sister of Thor, is arriving at the start of Season 4 as the latest playable character, filling the Vanguard role.</p>



<p>Equipped with Ichors, a type of living fluid that can be used to create various weapons. A razor-sharp spear is used to dive on enemies, while a shield is used to block incoming damage. Finally, the Ichors can be transformed into dual axes to dish out significant damage.</p>



<h3 id="h-team-up-adjustments">Team Up Adjustments</h3>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 4 adds a new Team-Up, removes another, and adjusts the members of two others. We’ve detailed them below.</p>



<ul>

<p>Arcade Mode in Marvel Rivals is getting a significant update in Season 4, with the Clone Rumble and Giant-Size Brain Blast returning permanently.</p>



<p>A new mode, Free Fight, allows players to play with no restrictions on duplicate heroes, so you can unleash an entire six-man team of Jeff the Land Shark, if you want. Conquest (Annihilation) is another new mode, where points are secured through KOs.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kidas-ceo-says-roblox-age-verification-measures-are-easily-bypased-and-are-not-the-full-answer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kidas-ceo-says-roblox-age-verification-measures-are-%E2%80%9Ceasily-bypassed%E2%80%9D-and-are-%E2%80%9Cnot-the-full-answer%E2%80%9D.1288464/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite The Roblox Corporation’s best intentions to protect children with new age verification tools, Kidas CEO Ron Kerbs believes it’s not enough, and has told Insider Gaming that Roblox needs to incorporate “Real-time behavioral monitoring.”</p>



<p>A new wave of age verification has emerged in the last 12 months, with businesses worldwide beginning to clamp down on who can access specific content. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-play-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online</a> is reportedly getting age verification, for example, and Roblox has added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-adding-video-selfie-security-measures-to-protect-teenagers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">security measures to protect teenagers</a> in 2025.</p>



<p>There have been concerns that while this is a good start, a lot more needs to be done.</p>



<h2 id="h-roblox-requires-real-time-behavioral-monitoring-says-kidas-ceo">Roblox Requires Real-Time Behavioral Monitoring, Says Kidas CEO</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No Roblox game or community is truly safe! Image credit: Roblox Corporation</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ron Kerbs is the CEO of <a href="https://getkidas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kidas</a>: A “Cybersecurity company committed to enhancing the safety of young gamers in the digital realm. Employing advanced AI technology, ProtectMe monitors and mitigates cyberbullying, online predators, and other digital threats in real time.</p>



<p>The company’s goal is simple: Protect kids and young gamers from online predators and harassment so they can enjoy video games with safety and peace of mind.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has obtained an exclusive quote from Ron discussing Roblox’s recent age verification measures:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Roblox’s new age verification effort is a step in the right direction—but it’s not the full answer. While technology like facial analysis and ID scans can help restrict access to mature content, these tools are still easily bypassed and don’t address the most pressing safety issues kids face online every day.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kidas has seen evidence of how predators operate and take advantage of younger children, and is doing all it can to increase security measures:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that no verification method—AI or otherwise—can guarantee that the person behind a screen is who they claim to be. We’ve seen kids be groomed and scammed by individuals who pass verification checks but still engage in harmful behavior. What’s needed isn’t just more gates, but better guardrails. Roblox and platforms like it must invest in real-time behavioral monitoring, not just one-time identity checks. Protecting kids isn’t about proving you’re over 13—it’s about detecting when a conversation is going dangerously off track and stepping in fast. We applaud the intention. Now let’s raise the standard for execution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We definitely need to see more action like this and companies paying greater attention to child safety. Kidas says it’s protected over 400,000 gamers and counting and issues an alarming statistic on its home page: “3&nbsp;out of&nbsp;5 U.S. kids who play online games will be scammed or harassed before age 18.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming wants to know what <em>you </em>think. Is enough being done to protect young gamers who just want to experience the joys and thrills we all had growing up playing games without the fear of strangers and predators on the internet? Please let us know.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-how-to-defeat-armored-tier-3-orphans/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-%E2%80%93-how-to-defeat-armored-tier-3-orphans.1288458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn features a lot of powerful Orphan enemies to defeat, but for the vast majority of them, accurate headshots with any weapon are more than enough to take them down with relative ease. This is not the case for the most powerful Orphans and those who manage to consume multiple bodies, which are easily recognizable by a peculiar trait: <strong>most of their body is covered in tentacles</strong>, making them look as if they are wearing a suit of armor. Besides making them look markedly different from any other Orphan, <strong>this sort of armor made of tentacles makes them more difficult to take down</strong>. If you try shooting at any part covered in tentacles, you will notice that your shots will <strong>bounce off.</strong> As such, you will have either have to <strong>deal with the tentacle armor first, or completely change your combat approach.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Shooting canisters to set enemies on fire and weaken them is one of the core gameplay mechanics in Cronos: The New Dawn.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lowering the extreme defenses these Cronos: The New Dawn enemies have is not too difficult, if you have the right resources or if you are in the right place, as <strong>setting them on fire will leave them defenseless for a short while</strong>. To do so, you will either have to use the flamethrower, a Pyre bomb, or shoot canisters and the like if any are nearby. If you are in a bind, this is also the easiest way to deal with these armored enemies, as you won't need to do any accurate shooting to damage them once you set them on fire.</p>



<p>If you have no means to set these armored Orphans on fire, you can still take them down with a bit of effort. Although the tentacle armor seems impenetrable,<strong> it always leaves some parts of their bodies exposed</strong>, usually one of their arms, so if you focus your shots on these parts, you can take them down without setting them on fire. As these enemies have a lot of health, you'd better use a weapon with high firepower like any shotgun, otherwise you risk prolonging the fight too much and wasting precious ammo for the handgun, which you should save for weaker enemies.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-price-rewards/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-dust-devils-premium-warbond%E2%80%94price-rewards-is-it-worth-it.1288455/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2 shows no signs of slowing down, with releases coming thick and fast, with the new Dust Devils Premium Warbond now available—but is it worth it?</p>



<p>After the long-awaited Xbox launch last week, which coincided with the release of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a>, a fresh update has brought a wealth of new challenges. Whether you’re taking down the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-hive-lord-hp-best-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hive Lord</a>, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-destroy-spore-lung/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destroying Spore Lungs</a>, new gear will not go amiss.</p>



<p>We’ve got all the details on the Dust Devils Premium Warbond here, including a breakdown of what’s included and whether it’s worth spending your hard-earned Super Credits on.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-dust-devils-premium-warbond">How Much is The Dust Devils Premium Warbond?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of gear. Image via Arrowhead Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Premium Warbond in Helldivers 2 costs 1,000 Super Credits, the standard price of Warbonds in the game.</strong></p>



<p>This translates to $9.99 in real-world money, though you don’t need to spend at all, as Super Credits can be farmed in the game. You can also use a Warbond Token to unlock the full pass.</p>



<p>As usual with Warbonds in Helldivers 2, there is no limited-time period to make the purchase, and it will remain available permanently, so you can purchase it whenever you like.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-helldivers-2-dust-devils-premium-warbond">All Rewards in the Helldivers 2 Dust Devils Premium Warbond</h2>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Warbond in Helldivers 2 has a total of 22 rewards to claim, including two armor sets, three Stratagems, and a new assault rifle.</strong></p>



<p>Rewards in the Dust Devils Warbond are geared around the latest content drop, introducing Hive planets, providing effective firepower to take down the threats they pose, along with accompanying cosmetics.</p>



<p>We’ve got a full breakdown of every reward in the Dust Devils Warbond below, including the Medals required to unlock them.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Reward</th><th data-align="center">Type</th><th data-align="center">Medals Required</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Rightful Occupier</td><td data-align="center">Cape</td><td data-align="center">8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-42 Federation’s Blade</td><td data-align="center">Helmet</td><td data-align="center">30</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">100x Super Credits</td><td data-align="center">Bonus</td><td data-align="center">7</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Hellpod</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-42 Federation’s Blade</td><td data-align="center">Armor</td><td data-align="center">45</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rightful Occupier</td><td data-align="center">Player Card</td><td data-align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">AR-2 Coyote</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">35</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Speargun</td><td data-align="center">Stratagem</td><td data-align="center">85</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-191 Scorpion</td><td data-align="center">Helmet</td><td data-align="center">45</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-191 Scorpion</td><td data-align="center">Armor</td><td data-align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Windswept Wayfarer</td><td data-align="center">Player Card</td><td data-align="center">7</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Windswept Wayfarer</td><td data-align="center">Cape</td><td data-align="center">25</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Shuttle</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Expendable Napalm</td><td data-align="center">Stratagem</td><td data-align="center">85</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">100x Super Credits</td><td data-align="center">Bonus</td><td data-align="center">12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Solo Silo</td><td data-align="center">Stratagem</td><td data-align="center">110</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Raider’s Cheer</td><td data-align="center">Emoted</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Exosuit</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">100x Super Credits</td><td data-align="center">Bonus</td><td data-align="center">32</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Vehicle</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">G-7 Pineapple</td><td data-align="center">Throwable</td><td data-align="center">65</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Burier of Heads</td><td data-align="center">title</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-the-dust-devils-premium-warbond-worth-it">Is the Dust Devils Premium Warbond Worth it?</h2>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Premium Warbond in Helldivers 2 is definitely worth purchasing for additional firepower to take down the Hive Worlds introduced in the Into The Unjust update.</strong></p>



<p>With missions on the Hive planets taking you deep underground, where your Stratagems are ineffective unless you manage to find an opening in the tunnel system, the weapons included in the Dust Devils Warbond are the perfect tools for the job.</p>



<p>The AR-2 Coyote assault rifle is ideal for mowing through the Terminid hordes, with the incendiary ammunition packing a punch, and the G-7 Pineapple cluster frag grenade is similarly effective for taking out large groups of enemies.</p>



<p>Both pale in comparison with the EAT-700 Expendable Napalm, a single-use missile that contains napalm cluster bombs, and the MS-11 Solo Silo, which calls down a Hellpod-sized missile silo with a single, ultra-powerful missile and a handheld targeting remote—though the latter may require being outside of the cave system.</p>



<p>The Dust Devils Warbond is a worthwhile addition for any Helldiver, though it’s particularly useful for any new Xbox players who perhaps don’t have an arsenal as expansive as their PC and PlayStation counterparts just yet.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> CEO Hakan Abrak has commented on the disastrous launch of Build A Rocket Boy's action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> back in June, stating it wasn't what the company hoped for.
</p>
<p>
IOI provided assistance distributing the game through its IOI Partners publishing arm. Now, at a recent event for the company's forthcoming Bond game, Abrak spoke to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">IGN</a> about MindsEye's launch.
</p>
<p>
"The initial talks we had with those guys were to support them," said Abrak. "We thought they had some great ideas and a great world in the background that they were building, and hopefully they'll get the opportunity to show more of that in the future. And we just wanted to help them distribute the game."

<p>
"Well, that was definitely tough, right?," Abrak continued, speaking of the launch itself. "It was a tough reception. It wasn't what they hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners. They're working hard on turning that around to regain the trust of the gamers out there, and they have tons of potential and content they're working on. So hopefully they'll succeed with that in the future."
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the game's release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">co-CEO of Build A Rocket Boy suggested negative reaction to MindsEye had been paid for</a> in a "concerted effort" against the studio. At the time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise">Abrak stated</a>: "I don't believe that."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">Two studio execs departed the studio</a> just one week before it debuted and then, once released, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">clear MindsEye was full of technical issues</a>. The studio promised performance updates, but later a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseyes-hitman-crossover-mission-delayed-leaving-its-community-starving-for-content">Hitman crossover mission was delayed by IO Interactive</a>.
</p>
<p>
So, has the Hitman and Bond studio been too burned by its work with Build A Rocket Boy to continue with similar publishing work?
</p>
<p>
"So, IO Interactive will publish our own games internally," said Abrak. "IOI Partners? That remains to be seen."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">MindsEye received a one star review from Eurogamer</a>. "Although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat," it reads.

<p>Now, there's no eShop page currently live, nor are there any pre-order options for this one, so if you want to dive into the hotly anticipated sequel as early as you possibly can, you'll want to be there at drop time. Don't worry, we've got you covered.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Team Cherry revealed the release times in a handful of regions, but we thought it was only right to recap 'em all for you now, so you don't miss out on any valuable metroidvania minutes. You'll find the exact time Silksong launches in your region below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pzvstm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The game will set you back <strong>$19.99 / €19.99 / ¥2300</strong> (there's no GBP price info available at the time of writing, but we have to imagine it'll be £19.99 too), and there's even a free upgrade path to the Switch 2 version of the game if you decide to pick up the S1 edition today.</p>
<p>And we'll be diving right in with you. Team Cherry confirmed that it wouldn't be sending our pre-launch codes, so we'll be setting out on our underground adventure today and will endeavour to have our review with you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>While the trademark filing doesn't have enough information to confirm anything, the industry rumor mill suggests Valve is working on multiple hardware projects including a Steam console codenamed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-pointing-to-a-new-steam-console-from-valve/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fremont</a>, a new SteamVR headset codenamed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-stream-deckard-standalone-vr-headset-rumor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deckard</a>, and new Steam controllers. The Valve Fremont <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently appeared</a> in a listing on benchmarking platform Geekbench, further fueling speculation around the project.</p><p>While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machines-first-impressions-the-specs-prices-/1100-6425734/" data-ref-id="1100-6425734">Steam Machine</a>, Valve's first foray into compact gaming hardware running the Linux-based SteamOS, was a flop, the company has had better luck with recent releases including the popular handheld Steam Deck. Many have speculated that Valve would return to console-like hardware for SteamOS after the Steam Deck's success, and recent news is making a console announcement look more likely.</p><p>As for what exactly the Steam Frame will be, the multiple trademarks suggest the branding could be intended to cover multiple upcoming hardware devices, as well as their related peripherals.</p>

                <p>Prior to this year, the release date for the Nintendo Switch 2 console was the subject of numerous rumors and speculative reports. The wait for fans officially ended in early June, but a new report states that Nintendo pushed back the Switch 2 launch multiple times despite the frustration of third-party companies.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-nintendo-switch2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, the reason Nintendo didn't rush Switch 2 to the market is because its designers requested extended deadlines for the launch titles in order to "perfect" them. Nintendo prioritized that above all other concerns, including the third-party publishers and fans who clamored for the console for years.</p><p>Earlier this summer, a separate report noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-dev-kits-still-sound-somewhat-rare-even-2-months-after-launch-report/1100-6534247/" data-ref-id="1100-6534247">Switch 2 development kits are still rare among third-party</a> companies even months after launch. It's believed that issue may be the reason <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-switch-2-dev-kits-could-explain-limited-third-party-game-announcements-report/1100-6533186/" data-ref-id="1100-6533186">why some Switch 2 third-party titles have yet to be officially announced</a>. Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-developer-claims-that-sales-were-below-our-lowest-estimates/1100-6532572/" data-ref-id="1100-6532572">Switch 2 launch titles have also outsold the third-party games</a> for the console by a much higher ratio than expected.</p><p>Nintendo released a statement last month that said it regrets <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-regrets-the-inconvenience-of-switch-2-selling-out-all-the-time/1100-6533634/" data-ref-id="1100-6533634">the inconvenience caused by Switch 2's scarcity</a>. The company confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">Switch 2 sold over 6 million units</a> by the first week of August, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-massively-outpacing-switch-1-sales-so-far-in-the-us/1100-6534305/" data-ref-id="1100-6534305">has reportedly moved 2 million consoles</a> in North America alone.</p><p>For now, Switch 2 is the only major modern console that hasn't been hit by a price hike over tariffs. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-could-get-more-expensive-in-2026-analyst-predicts/1100-6534130/" data-ref-id="1100-6534130">that may change in 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo recently released an update for Switch Online, which among other little tweaks adds a nice, nostalgia infused Easter egg to the Game Boy Advance app.</p>
<p>This Easter egg can be found by twiddling with the analogue stick while booting up the Game Boy Advance app. If you do this, you will be met with the classic GBA bootup sequence.</p>
<p>You can see how the Easter egg looks via the video I took this morning.</p> <div>

<p>Marvel Rivals developers have confirmed plans to introduce Placement Matches to the ranked mode for new seasons, though there is no details on exactly when it will release.</p>



<p>Since its launch in December 2024, Marvel Rivals’ ranked set-up has attracted criticism from players, particularly at the start of new seasons when things reset, as higher-ranked players drop several tiers.</p>



<p>This has made the first few days of a new season in ranked incredibly unbalanced, a frustrating experience for players, but devs have been listening to feedback and announced plans to bring placement matches into the fray.</p>



<h2 id="h-placement-matches-coming-to-marvel-rivals">Placement Matches Coming to Marvel Rivals</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big change. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>Announced at the end of the latest <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1963300965437538535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dev Vision video</a> ahead of the drop of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 on September 12</a>, Marvel Rivals devs acknowledged the discussions in the community on the back of the recently released details explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how the matchmaking system works</a>.</p>



<p>It was confirmed that the team is “already working on implementing Placement Matches,” but, as it is a “complex feature with a lot of moving parts,” the team needs “more time for development and thorough testing.”</p>



<p>While Placement Matches won’t be ready for the drop of Season 4, the team is “pushing forward as quickly as we can.”</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether Placement Matches will be a major feature that drops as part of Season 5, which is expected to launch in early November. Exact details of the Season 5 launch are not known, though the start date should be revealed by the Season 4 Battle Pass.</p>

            <p>Amazon has cast Sophie Turner as Lara Croft in its upcoming live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>Turner, known to many as Game of Thrones' Sansa Stark, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-thrones-sophie-turner-reportedly-in-talks-to-play-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-tv-series">rumoured to be in talks to play Lara Croft in November last year</a>. She will follow in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander, who both previously portrayed the globetrotting archeologist in live-action Tomb Raider adaptations. </p>

<p>As previously reported, Fleabag's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">Phoebe Waller-Bridge will serve as the Tomb Raider series' creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner.</p>
<p>"I'm so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team," Waller-Bridge said. "It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out... Croft is coming..."</p><p>Turner added she was "thrilled beyond measure" to be playing Lara Croft. "She's such an iconic character, who means so much to so many - and I am giving everything I've got," the actor said. "They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking."</p>
<p>Amazon has confirmed production on the series will officially begin next year, on 19th January. Joining Waller-Bridge and Turner on the series are Jonathan Van Tulleken as director and executive producer, as well as Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p>
<p>The Tomb Raider TV series - which Amazon has previously referred to as "epic" - doesn't have a release date yet, but will air on Prime Video when it eventually shows up.</p>

<p>Along with the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">Amazon is also working with Crystal Dynamics on the next Tomb Raider game</a>. Details have remained fairly sparse for the upcoming Tomb Raider since it was announced. In fact, all we really know right now is that it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-announces-next-tomb-raider-game-made-in-unreal-engine-5">being made in Unreal Engine 5</a> and will have "mind-bending puzzles to solve" and a "wide variety of enemies to face and overcome".</p>
<p>In August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well"</a>, but did not elaborate much further than that.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-xbox-sells-more-gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-on-xbox-sells-a-lot-more-than-gears-of-war-reloaded-on-playstation.1288389/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft and Sony performed a rather unusual (especially on Sony's side) shooter game exclusive exchange on August 26, when Helldivers 2 launched on Xbox Series S and X and Gears of War Reloaded brought the series to PlayStation 5 for the first time. Whereas the latter game is certainly not the only Xbox title available on Sony's console following the policy switch to full-on multiplatform, Helldivers 2 is a unicum that is unlikely to be repeated any time soon. There was a lot of demand for it, though, what with the Xbox crowd always having been shooter-friendly, and the fact that a live service always benefits from being on as many platforms as possible.</p>



<p>Now that it's been a little over a week since these launches, game analyst (and Wccftech friend) Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics has <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> an overview of how each release has performed so far. Unsurprisingly, Helldivers 2 turned out to be a lot more popular on Xbox than Gears of War Reloaded on PlayStation 5. According to the data gathered by the analytics firm, the remaster of the first title in the Gears of War series only sold around 259K units on PS5, whereas Arrowhead's hectic sci-fi cooperative game about squashing alien bugs is already nearing the million with 926K units. Helldivers 2 even outsold itself on PlayStation 5: back when it launched on Sony's console, the game sold around 633K units in the first six days. </p>



<p>As for Gears of War Reloaded, we know the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-surpasses-1-million-players-three-days-after-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has surpassed one million players</a>. Alinea Analytics says it has reached 1.3 million at this point, but a million of those were from Xbox, despite those users knowing the game all too well. Most of those players likely accessed it from Game Pass, too. The PC userbase is really minuscule: around 41K players, per this data.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gears of War Reloaded also performed poorly compared to Forza Horizon 5, which sold nearly six times as many copies on PS5 in the same timeframe. Granted, perhaps it is not entirely fair to compare a remaster of a 19-year-old game to two much more recent games that are still among the hottest titles of the respective genres. </p>



<p>Alinea Analytics also shared more highlights from August 2025's hottest games. Peak remained the most downloaded with 4 million downloads, but Delta Force was close behind it with 3.7 million downloads, owing to the recent console launch and a resurgence on Steam as well. Grounded 2 secured the third place with 2.2 million downloads. </p>



<p>When it comes to premium games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> has sold over 1.2 million units at this point, half of which on PlayStation 5. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is at 500K units, though it's still early days given that it debuted exactly a week ago.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-fallout-dlcs-ranked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-best-fallout-dlcs-ranked%E2%80%94which-fallout-expansion-is-the-best.1288362/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If there’s one thing Bethesda Game Studios does well, it’s the creation of a top-notch expansion. For the Fallout franchise, some sizeable expansions have dropped over the years that have left players impressed and hungry for more. </p>



<p>From Fallout 3 to New Vegas and from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76, Bethesda Game Studios has delivered some great additional content. In this list, we’re taking a look at the 10 best Fallout DLCs and ranking them.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-best-fallout-dlc-ever">What’s The Best Fallout DLC Ever?</h2>



<p>Everyone has their idea of the perfect expansion. It’s a mostly subjective argument, but there are some universal truths. If you disagree with this list of the best Fallout DLCs ranked, then be sure to leave a comment and set us straight!</p>



<h3 id="h-best-nuka-world-fallout-4">Best: Nuka-World (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuka-World was a fantastic adventure from start to finish, taking players to a wide, open theme park that could be made operational. It was the perfect endgame DLC to an already impressive base game, and it served as a sublime send-off to the best-selling core Fallout game ever released. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-point-lookout-fallout-3">2. Point Lookout (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Point Lookout was a creepy, backwoods expansion that forced players to contend with some of Fallout 3’s eeriest enemies. It was a darker, more foreboding expansion that took players out of the base game’s map and put them in the heart of a swamp bursting at the seams with danger.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout/">10 Most Iconic Brands From Fallout</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-3-far-harbor-fallout-4">3. Far Harbor (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Behind Nuka-World, Far Harbor was a fantastic expansion for Fallout 4, and in many ways, it was similar to Point Lookout from Fallout 3. It introduced players to a brilliant map that was a wonder to explore, and the only thing holding this particular Fallout DLC back from the top spot is the series of annoying puzzles that must be solved as part of the expansion. </p>



<h3 id="h-4-the-pitt-fallout-3">4. The Pitt (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Pitt was so good that Bethesda Game Studios decided to revisit it in Fallout 76 more than a decade later. It was one of the grittier Fallout expansions, landing players in the heart of Pittsburgh to go toe-to-toe against savage, mutated creatures that were once slaves, twisted up by their masters and the environment around them.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-lonesome-road-fallout-new-vegas">5. Lonesome Road (Fallout New Vegas)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fallout: New Vegas had some fantastic expansions, but few are as memorable as Lonesome Road. It’s one of the best Fallout DLCs because of the writing behind it and the characters it introduces – namely, Ulysses. It expands beautifully on the protagonist’s backstory and gives players a great location to explore,but  it’s just a little light on content.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-broken-steel-fallout-3">6. Broken Steel (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Broken Steel was one of the best Fallout DLCs that was released to appease fans who wanted more of the base game. It boosted the game’s level cap, added a stack of new content, and introduced an extra act that saw players fight the Enclave directly alongside the Brotherhood of Steel – Liberty Prime included. It was a bit of an afterthought that Bethesda created to ‘give players a little more’, but it was solid.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-automatron-fallout-4">7. Automatron (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Automatron was a short but sweet Fallout DLC that saw players pick up the ability to solve a mechanical mystery and create a robot companion that could be anything they so desired. It was the first outing for the expansion concept in Fallout 4, and while it didn’t add too much, it was entertaining enough for a couple of hours’ worth of content.</p>



<h3>8. Vault-Tec Workshop (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In Vault-Tec Workshop, players get access to their own customisable Vault. It’s a massive, underground cavern with untold potential to craft something truly unique, but that’s about all it is – a building expansion. There are a few experiments to carry out, in true Vault-Tec style, but ultimately, it’s an expansion that allows you to build a Vault, which is about it.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-honest-hearts-fallout-3">9. Honest Hearts (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Honest Hearts has been the subject of many memes over the years, most notably because of the character that’s introduced in it – The Burned Man, Joshua Graham. It’s a great narrative, but the expanded area that’s opened up for exploration isn’t all that memorable, and aside from the core story, there isn’t much to unravel.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-steel-reign-fallout-76">10. Steel Reign (Fallout 76)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Steel Reign was one of the more sizeable Fallout 76 expansions – more commonly known as ‘updates’ – that brought the Brotherhood of Steel back into play. It was a follow-on from Steel Dawn, which was released around a year prior, and it added plenty of story content for the player to enjoy – but since it dropped in 2021, Bethesda Game Studios hasn’t been back to revisit the Brotherhood storyline. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-like-hitman/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-007-first-light-like-hitman-io-interactive-development-explained.1288353/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Is 007 First Light like Hitman from a gameplay standpoint? That’s a common question from anyone who hears IO Interactive is making the jump to James Bond.</p>



<p>Millions of people fell in love with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-75-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hitman: World of Assassination trilogy</a> over the last decade. During that time, Agent 47 had an established formula that was consistently refined with interesting maps and engaging challenges.</p>



<p>James Bond has quite an interesting history when it comes to video games, but what can you expect in the newest game? Is 007 First Light like Hitman?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-007-first-light-gameplay-similar-to-hitman">Is 007 First Light Gameplay Similar to Hitman?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>He may be another spy, but James Bond is not Agent 47. Image via IO Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>007 First Light can be compared to Hitman and shares some of its mechanics and stylings, but it’s not an exact copy and is its own game.</strong></p>



<p>A lot of the things that connect Hitman and First Light are the exploration aspects of the game. When things are calm, James Bond will survey his environment and look for ways to sneak around and enter restricted areas by causing distractions or using gadgets to disorient enemies. That is very similar to how Agent 47 operates in Hitman, so the blueprints align there, though we haven’t seen James try to steal someone’s outfit like 47 often does.</p>



<p>We would say where the two differ the most is in the combat. In Hitman, the focus was very much on remaining stealthy as long as possible. Agent 47 can fight his way out of a tricky situation, but those moments are rather limiting. Shooting in the Hitman games is rather stiff, and his melee is basic at best.</p>



<p><a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">007 First Light</a> seems to have gotten a big facelift when it comes to combat. Bond can do more with the environment around him when fighting, like grab an enemy and throw them in a direction, or fight to take a weapon away from someone. We’ve also seen Bond control an airplane and make it rock sideways while in combat, so there could be bigger ways to give enemies a harder time taking you out.</p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-has-more-to-it-than-stealth-and-combat">007 First Light Has More to It Than Stealth and Combat</h2>



<p>For the Hitman games, stealth and combat are essentially the main things you have to look forward to. There is a story there, but to be honest, it’s nothing that special or interesting.</p>



<p>IO Interactive is putting in the work to make 007 First Light a more cinematic experience than Hitman. Consider the car driving sections that never appeared in Hitman, or just how much more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-james-bond-voice-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Bond is willing to talk</a> to get his way. We love Agent 47, but the point of his character is to be silent and stoic.</p>



<p>From the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early look we’ve had at the game</a>, 007 First Light definitely appears to have some of the Hitman DNA in it, but we would say it’s been built on top of not necessarily making something completely new, but augmenting what came before so that James Bond can stand apart from Agent 47.</p>



<hr>



<p>Did you love the Hitman World of Assassination trilogy? How are you feeling now that IO Interactive is focused on James Bond instead of Agent 47?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Both the Switch 2 and Switch versions will be available physically. The Switch 2 version will ship on a game-key card.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>This is an escape <a title="Genres > Action [3,007 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> that follows the rules of the popular Fuji TV show <em>Run for Money</em>, in which players become Runners and win prize money based on the time spent escaping the Hunters let loose in an enclosed area.</p><p>This game is the first in the series to include a “Hunter Mode” in which the player can aim to become the greatest Hunter. It also supports online play, so players can play against users across the country and compete in the online leaderboards.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Realistic Escape Action Just Like the TV Show</strong></p><p>The game flow is as follows: Runners get a head start to escape, and Hunters are released 30 seconds later. Runners accumulate prize money based on the amount of time they spend escaping, and can of course surrender at any point to keep the prize money accumulated thus far. If the Runners can avoid being captured by a Hunter within the 15-minute time limit, they have successfully escaped. But if a Runner is captured by a Hunter, it is “Game Over!” Can you escape the Hunters until the very end?</p><p><strong>A Series First: Become the Hunter in Hunter Mode</strong></p><p>“Hunter Mode,” which puts players in control of a Hunter, is included for the first time in the series. Players have always dreamed of becoming a Hunter and chasing down and capturing Runners, and now it is finally possible. Become a Hunter, capture Runners, and aim to be the greatest Hunter. Updated Hunters will also appear.</p><p><strong>A Series First: Hunters vs. Runners Mode</strong></p><p>“Hunters vs. Runners Mode,” in which players can choose to play as either a Hunter or Runner, is included for the first time in the series. In order to stop the rampaging Hunters, who have lost control of their power, the Runners must launch a counterattack against the Hunters using weapons obtained in missions. In “Online VS,” up to 12 users can play together (four Hunters, eight Runners). Who will come out on top between the Hyper Hunters Army and the Runners?</p><p><strong>A Series First: Online VS</strong></p><p>Includes an “Online VS” feature that allows up to 12 players to compete for the first time in the series. Users can compete online via quick and simple matchmaking, or play against friends. All five “Runners Mode” and “Hunters vs. Runners Mode” stages can be played online.</p><p><strong>Compete Against Players Across the Country in the Online Leaderboards</strong></p><p>In “Hunter Mode,” your ranking is determined by your score based on how fast you clear the stage. In “Hunters vs. Runners Mode,” your ranking is determined by the total prize money accumulated playing both offline and online.</p><p><strong>High-Variety Game-Original Stages</strong></p><p>The battle stages are all original! There are a total of five stages: “Wonderland,” “Diversity,” “Fantasy,” “The Airport,” and “The Pier.” The events that occur in each stage will trigger various missions, and by completing those missions, your escape may be made easier through things like the escape area expanding or obstructing the release of Hunters.</p><p><strong>Series Mainstays Return</strong></p><p>Popular elements from the series will of course return, including “GameShare” and “Local Communication Play” with up to four players, “Hard Mode” featuring “Hyper Hunters” with enhanced performance, and “Trophy” and “Hunter Figure” collecting.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/run-for-money-hunters-vs-runners-can-you-win-as-either-adds-switch-2-version-launches-december-4-in-japan]]></content:encoded>
