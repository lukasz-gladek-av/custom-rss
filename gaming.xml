Developer Riley Testut is heavily encouraging users to click that external link by tripling the price you’d otherwise pay to Apple for In-App Purchase versions of those same Patreon tiers.&nbsp;Testut calls it the “do not buy sale.”</p><p>The update both embraces and protests <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24040881/apple-outside-payments-app-store-policies-iphone-ipad">the External Purchase Link Entitlement</a> that Apple introduced in January, which allows developers to link to outside payment platforms in exchange for giving Apple a slightly reduced 27 percent cut of sales. The App Store policy change was made following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24039983/supreme-court-epic-apple-antitrust-case-rejected">rulings in the Epic vs Apple lawsuit</a> that found Apple had acted anticompetitively by preventing developers from telling users about payment methods that bypassed its own payment system.</p><div><figcaption><em>Clicking this link within the Delta app settings will take you to the Patreon page to sign up directly.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Delta</cite></p></div><p>Testut says Delta is likely the first app to use the entitlement. The $3, $5, and $10 monthly memberships on Patreon — which provide additional benefits like iPad and SEGA Genesis support, and private Discord access depending on the subscription tier — are listed in the iOS app at $10, $15, and $30, respectively.</p><p>“We <em>really</em> don’t want people to use in-app purchase,” Testut told <em>The Verge</em>. “We’ve been using Patreon for years, and it allows us to do things Apple’s IAP system can’t — such as issuing refunds and handling customer support — making it much more convenient for creators like us.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">"There's only so much I can do with hands."</p><p dir="ltr">Raccoon Logic creative director Alex Hutchinson attributes this quote to his animation director, Mike Menillo. It's a funny line, but it's also a short-and-sweet elevator pitch for one of the biggest changes for Revenge Of The Savage Planet, the follow-up to 2020's Journey To The Savage Planet.</p><p dir="ltr">Revenge is taking players out of the head of their characters and placing them over the characters' shoulders, as the first-person view gives way to a new third-person format. For players of the original game, this is a radical change, but for the team at Raccoon Logic, it was the perfect way to stretch their creative legs as they try to one-up the last journey.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot sat in on a hands-off demo during a recent online press event, and while the change in viewpoint is jarring, based on the team's reaction, it's a move that could pay off immensely when it's again time to travel to the stars.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417137-revenge-of-the-savage-planet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417137-revenge-of-the-savage-planet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417137"></a><figcaption>Is that a mushroom? Nope nope NOPE!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417137-revenge-of-the-savage-planet.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Shifting perspectives</h2><p dir="ltr">The change from a first- to third-person perspective is not indicative of either option's quality, according to the team; it's simply a matter of preference. "First-person feels more immersive, but third-person is more appealing to a mainstream audience," Hutchinson said. "It’s a balance. Neither is better or worse--just different."</p><p dir="ltr">From the jump, the switch to third-person felt, from a development standpoint, like a whole new world of opportunity was opening. Third-person allows the team to focus on things like physical comedy, status effects, and even emotion. The player-character shown in the demo walks, jumps, slides, and dodges around the world with personality, and in a way that only this viewpoint can show off.</p><p dir="ltr">"Third-person is really exciting because it gives us the opportunity to add a ton more character to the player's avatar," Hutchinson describes. "We can add personality to their walk and runs, and we can have them exude charm with every action." Platforming becomes easier too, as a player can actually see a platform as they jump on it--or, as Hutchinson described it, "you can see your feet!"</p><p dir="ltr">Player agency also gets a boost from the perspective change, as costumes will now be available for a little bit of intergalactic dress-up. These costumes may look familiar, but Hutchinson assures us that these costumes are "legally distinct," with "Temu Star Trek," "Temu Power Ranger," and "Temu Han Solo" among the terms used to describe them.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Two-player co-op and the "sweet spot"</h2><p dir="ltr">Revenge Of The Savage Planet will feature co-op, with two players being able to journey through the wild worlds together at a time. The team makes clear that this is not due to any technical limitations; the team is actively choosing to limit co-op to two people in one session.</p><p dir="ltr">Hutchinson says that, in his experience, co-op games with two players hit the "sweet spot." When only two players are paired up, they'll engage each other more through banter or light-hearted jokes. It's not just about the task at hand; duos tend to be more willing to explore, mess things up, and laugh about what's happening in real time. Any more than that, however, and those groups stick to talking about the objectives rather than allowing themselves to live in the moment, or what Hutchinson refers to as a "shared space."</p><p dir="ltr">"I’ve directed a bunch of two player co-op games, from Army of Two: the 40th Day, to Far Cry 4, to Savage Planet, and I love the idea of you and your best friend, or kid, or partner, versus the world," Hutchinson says. "I want people to have the experience I had growing up; on the couch with a pizza, sitting next to your best friend, sharing your day."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417135-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417135" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417135-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417135"></a><figcaption>Oh boy, here I go exploring again.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417135-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-2.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">"Poop jokes and corporate satire"</h2><p dir="ltr">One major returning element from Journey To The Savage Planet is its levity: The first game was inherently silly, with over-the-top fake advertisements playing on TVs and radios within the game world. Those are coming back along with some new ones to seek out, but the game also contains a more biting commentary on the state of the world, particularly in a corporate setting. This is, as Hutchinson calls it, "a game for all ages."</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the silliness does come through in our demo, as the hero can kick any enemy away with the push of a button, sending them flying into the air. At another point, they defeat a small enemy that leaves behind some red goo, which then sets a small woodland creature on fire on contact. We even get a brief glimpse of one of the aforementioned in-game ads, where Shama Lama's Ding Dong Academy is offering classes, but with a warning that "parkour and pottery may result in permanent injuries."</p><p dir="ltr">"I think with enough density, people skate over the bits that they don’t find funny, and dwell on the bits they do," Hutchinson says. "We try to keep the game moving fast, we don’t belabor a joke, and we let people cause their own chaos for what we like to think of as 'interactive slapstick.' But jokes are always poking a bit and taking a risk; we hope we find an audience who appreciates it!"</p><h2 dir="ltr">A new journey</h2><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Revenge Of The Savage Planet is a bigger version of its predecessor, and the team at Raccoon Logic hopes those who enjoyed it the first time will continue to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">"You liked co-op?" Hutchinson asks. "Now you can play split-screen on your couch or cross-play with your weird friend from Sweden."</p><p dir="ltr">"You like jokes?" We have more systemic chaos that will let you slip on green goo then set yourself on fire while trying to battle an alien crab with human eyes."</p><p dir="ltr">"You liked one alien planet? Now we have four!"</p><p dir="ltr">Along with those changes, though, comes a bold new perspective thanks to the third-person view. By cranking up the first game's best bits, and throwing in the extra character elements and customization that third-person allows, Revenge Of The Savage Planet is shaping up to be a bigger and better journey--poop jokes and corporate satire included.</p><p dir="ltr">Revenge Of The Savage Planet is scheduled to launch in May 2025 on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-netflix</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/squid-game-unleashed-like-other-squid-game-spinoffs-misses-the-point.1063791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-netflix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix’s mobile game <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> came out today, a week ahead of the disturbing show’s second season, and a few days before the premiere of <em>Beast Games</em>, Mr. Beast’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/mrbeast-beast-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embattled</a> take on the show with Amazon. All of these things are distinctly not <em>Squid Game</em>, which is what makes them so very <em>Squid Game</em>.</p><p>First things first: <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> is fine, and I enjoyed playing it this morning. It’s a lot like <em>Fall Guys</em> without the physics (game director Bill Jackson told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/495597/squid-game-unleashed-free-to-play-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon</a>, “We didn’t want the characters to feel unreal and have their physics feel unreal”). Characters start in the iconic green jumpsuit, though their outfits can be customized with currency you earn by playing. Some, like Kang Sae-byeok, are characters from the show, while others have been invented for <em>Unleashed</em>. Each character has a dossier in their info screen that tells a backstory about why they joined the game.</p><p>The levels themselves are takes on the show’s challenges; without the psychological aspect that made the show so compelling, they’re largely races to a finish line. There’s Red Light, Green Light, which came back in a later round in one of my games with the addition of buzzsaws. The dalgona challenge, where characters had to carve a shape from a candy, here is a race along the outline of shapes to fall to the ground and make it to a finish line, a compelling combination of teamwork and competition. The marbles episode appears to be recast as a race to a school, with busses, electrified water, and fire to avoid. The challenge where characters inch across a glass floor stays pretty straightforward and works well as a game level. A final round I spectated, a take on the hand-to-hand combat that ended the show’s first season, features players knocking each other out of a slippery squid-shaped arena, grabbing weapons and shields from floating present boxes that are definitely an aesthetic contrast to the actual moment in the show.&nbsp;</p><p>The brutality of the show is present in moments where you’re eliminated, either ragdolling to a bloody death or being sharply felled by a sniper. Developer Boss Fight has done a good job keeping the contrast between the show’s bright, cute spaces and the violence behind them without tipping too far in either direction. As Jackson told Polygon, “You don’t want to create a world where players don’t want to be;” I’m sure it was an immense game design challenge to try to make a game players would want to play and have fun with from a narrative about characters’ life experiences forcing them into an unthinkably terrible situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Atop all this is all the stuff of any mobile game: leveling up through play, earning different kinds of currency that can be spent on outfits or giving your character new abilities surrounding in-game items like bats and dodgeballs. While it makes sense from a gameplay perspective to earn currency while you play and not just when you win, the whole idea of this runs against the core concept of the show. Money was such a hard, ever-present feature in <em>Squid Game</em>, from characters’ motivations to the pig full of cash dangling above their heads. Here, as in many mobile games, money feels cheap and abundant, which sands off much of its meaning. If you, like me, aren’t the kind of player who’s motivated by cosmetics, it basically doesn’t matter at all.</p><p>Here’s where <em>Unleashed </em>and <em>Beast Games</em> and Netflix’s reality competition <em>Squid Game: The Challenge</em> all miss the point. <em>Squid Games</em>’ games got their meaning from the story behind them, both the show’s written narrative and the deeper issues it pointed to. It cast a spotlight on money and power and class divides and the fundamental unfairness of society, all of which resonated with viewers because we’re so <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/23/opinions/squid-game-netflix-why-americans-are-obsessed-lowe/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aware of these issues</a> but can feel like we have few outlets for challenging or changing them. It would be fun to, say, climb on a <em>Ninja Warrior</em> course because the course is the topic of that show; in <em>Squid Game</em>, the <em>fun </em>is just a set dressing that highlights how unfun and unfair it is to try to survive in actual society. If you strip all that away to just the mechanics, all you’re left with is uncomfortable reality shows and a perfectly fine mobile game dressed in <em>Squid Game</em>’s aesthetics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are individuals at the top of Amazon and Netflix and the Mr. Beast empire who are less bloodthirsty corollaries to <em>Squid Game</em>’s rich antagonists, who see art and people as nothing more than dollar signs (Remember when Netflix exec Bela Bajaria, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/16/how-much-more-netflix-can-the-world-absorb-bela-bajaria" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a> about her favorite shows, replied with “I’m a fan of TV” before having strong opinions about the wine on a private jet?). I don’t want to presume these people are ignorant of the conflict they’ve wandered into, or get all holier-than-thou about what Netflix can do with its properties or what <em>Squid Game</em> creator Hwang Dong-hyuk should do with his show. I’m sure everyone involved is hyper-aware of how <em>weird</em> the extended <em>Squid Game</em> universe is, even as they milk it for every drop of cash and viewer engagement it’s worth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a different world, maybe <em>Squid Game</em> could have stayed what it was without getting little bits nibbled off to feed the <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IP machine</a>. But the world we live in is the one where the people who make money are going to make money, and the rest of us are going to find resonance in <em>Squid Game</em>’s message while still thinking “it would be fun to play a version of this without killing someone or getting shot in the head,” and where Boss Fight has made a totally OK, even enjoyable mobile game to satisfy both those parties. <em>Squid Game</em> the show highlighted the conflicting choices people make in our current system; in that way, maybe all these spinoffs fit right in. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/day-of-the-jackal-river-udc-redmayne"><h3>The Day of the Jackal Is So Good Except This One Part That Makes Absolutely No Sense</h3></a><p>The only real problem with the show is the Jackal’s target: a tech entrepreneur with a killer app that does… something.</p></div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2024-future-class-game-changer-geoff-keighley"><h3>With The Future Class On Hold, The Game Awards’ Attempts At Doing Good Produce Mixed Results</h3></a><p>Geoff Keighley wants to be perceived as an agent of change for the better, but he's propped up by the status quo</p></div></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/killzone-might-be-coming-back-but-in-helldivers-2.1063752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/killzone-helldivers-warbond-leak/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been claimed by dataminers that a Killzone collaboration is en route to Helldivers 2. If these reports are accurate, it’ll be the first time we’ve seen something Killzone-related surface in a game (outside of Astrobot) in more than a decade.</p>



<p>The last Killzone game surfaced in 2014, and it was a short-lived thing on the PlayStation 4 that died a death, before the developer, Guerrilla, moved off to focus on Horizon. Now, dataminers have uncovered images showing a new Warbond in Helldivers 2 that will award players with Helghast outfits.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-just-want-it-back">I Just Want It Back</h2>



<p>I’m a huge Killzone fan and would do anything for a revitalisation of the franchise, but that’s not going to happen. </p>



<p>Instead, I might need to rely on the new datamined Warbond – ‘Righteous Revenants’ – that’s reportedly coming to Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://x.com/Iron_S1ghts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Iron_S1ghts</a> published images of the ‘leaked’ Warbond, and in no time at all, it had been pulled down by Sony in a copyright strike. That’s typically all you need to believe that something is <strong>real</strong>. The images have since been shared by other fans across social media.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Helldivers 2 dataminers are giving me hope. This is the first new Killzone content in 11 years.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Per the leaks, two new armour sets could be set to surface in Helldivers 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>AC-1 Dutiful</li>



<li>AC-2 Obedient</li>
</ul>



<p>They’re both ‘Acclimated’, providing 50% resistance to elemental forms of damage. The core difference between them is that AC-1, which is based on the typical Helghast foot soldier, has a higher armour rating, while the AC-2, based on a Helghast sniper, has less armour but is faster and has better stamina regen.</p>



<p>It’s a sight better than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ellie-tlou-ii-remastered-skins-sad-killzone/">the Killzone t-shirt</a> that was added to The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>

<p>Team Heretics’ VALORANT superstar Benjamin “Benjyfishy” Fish has been issued a warning by Riot Games for violating the gambling section of the Global Code of Conduct. The former Fortnite pro placed, and won, a bet made during the League of Legends World Championship final between T1 and Bilibili Gaming.</p>



<p>The ruling by Riot was officially made just a couple weeks before the doors were opened to betting sponsorships.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-win-some-you-lose-some">You win some, you lose some</h2>



<p>According to an <a href="https://competitiveops.riotgames.com/en-US/rulings/benjy-benjyfishy-fish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official ruling</a> on Riot’s Competitive Ops website, Team Heretics informed Riot in early November that benjyfishy placed and won a wager on the Worlds final. The ruling, made on November 28, states that benjyfishy won €100 from his wager.</p>



<p>Placing said wager violates section 3.15 of the Global Code of Conduct. That section states that “Esports Professionals” may not engage in legal or illegal gambling activities involving any title owned by Riot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their ruling, Riot noted several factors that contributed to a reduced punishment. Benjyfishy self-reported the incident after realizing what they had done and fully cooperated with the investigation. The ruling also notes that he volunteered “to donate a sum to charity.” Additionally, because benjyfishy placed a wager on a game and in a region they don’t compete in, there was little “risk of direct harm to the competitive integrity of VALORANT.”</p>



<p>Benjyfishy was issued a warning, and a fine of an undisclosed amount was imposed on Team Heretics. Coincidentally, Riot confirmed to Insider Gaming earlier this week that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-policy-change-betting-sponsorships/">partnered VALORANT and League teams will be allowed to explore partnerships</a> with betting companies. An official Riot statement notes that the Riot broadcast and team jerseys will remain free of gambling branding. All potential betting partners will also be vetted by Riot before getting approval.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you think the allowing of betting sponsors could result in a rule change that lets players place wagers? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-partners-leak-next-gen-rtx-50-series-gpus-including-a-32gb-5090.1063746/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/nvidia-partners-leak-next-gen-rtx-50-series-gpus-including-a-32gb-5090/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Rumors have suggested that Nvidia will be taking the wraps off of some next-generation RTX 50-series graphics cards at CES in January. And as we get closer to that date, Nvidia's partners and some of the PC makers have begun to inadvertently leak details of the cards.</p>
<p>According to recent leaks from both Zotac and Acer, it looks like Nvidia is planning to announce four new GPUs next month, all at the high end of its lineup: The RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070 were all briefly listed on Zotac's website, <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/zotac-confirms-geforce-rtx-5090-with-32gb-gddr7-memory-5080-and-5070-series-listed-as-well">as spotted by VideoCardz</a>. There's also an RTX 5090D variant for the Chinese market, which will presumably have its specs tweaked to conform with current US export restrictions on high-performance GPUs.</p>
<p>Though the website leak didn't confirm many specs, it did list the RTX 5090 as including 32GB of GDDR7, an upgrade from the 4090's 24GB of GDDR6X. An Acer spec sheet for new Predator Orion desktops also lists 32GB of GDDR7 for the 4090, as well as 16GB of GDDR7 for the RTX 5080. This is the same amount of RAM included with the RTX 4080 and 4080 Super.</p>
<p>The 5090 will be a big deal when it launches because no graphics card released <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/rtx-4090-review-nvidias-biggest-gpu-is-easily-its-best/">since October 2022</a> has come close to beating the 4090’s performance. Nvidia’s early 2024 Super refresh for some 40-series cards didn’t include a 4090 Super, and AMD’s flagship RX 7900 XTX card is more comfortable competing with the likes of the 4080 and 4080 Super. The 5090 isn't a card that most people are going to buy, but for the performance-obsessed, it's the first high-end performance upgrade the GPU market has seen in more than two years.</p>

                <p>After debuting on PlayStation 5 earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> is heading to PC in early 2025. Rebirth game director Naoki Hamaguchi is well aware that the title's PC debut will almost certainly be accompanied by weird mods, just as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-intermission-review-half-measure/1900-6417689/" data-ref-id="1900-6417689">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> was when it hit PC in 2021. Regardless, Hamaguchi issued a plea to players to avoid any offensive Rebirth mods.</p><p>"While the team has no plans for official in-game mod support, we respect the creativity of the modding community and welcome their creations," Hamaguchi told <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/ja/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-is-officially-coming-to-pc-and-the-epic-games-store" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games</a>. "Though we ask modders not to create or install anything offensive or inappropriate."</p><p>Unfortunately for Hamaguchi, that may be like asking the ocean not to wash up on the shore. Final Fantasy 7 Remake was almost immediately modded with skimpy outfits for Tifa, Aerith, and other characters. Rebirth seems likely to meet the same fate. However, the modding community has also created mods that are transformative, and arguably works of art unto themselves. It will be interesting to see what mods arise from Rebirth.</p><p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">GameSpot's best PlayStation 5 games of 2024</a>, and it will arrive on PC on January 23, 2025. Square Enix has previously stated that Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-says-final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-didnt-meet-sales-expectations/1100-6526552/" data-ref-id="1100-6526552">didn't meet the company's sales expectations</a>. Bringing Rebirth to PC may help its numbers, but Square Enix has yet to release the sales figures for that title. In November, Rebirth's predecessor received a visual encyclopedia, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-Ultimania/dp/1646091760?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Material Ultimania Plus</a>. The book features commentary, art, maps, and insights for the game.</p>

			<p>Archetype Entertainment has finally shared the first gameplay trailer for its debut title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-is-an-epic-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-features-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EXODUS</a>, and it's fair to say it's very reminiscent of Mass Effect. Not that we were expecting anything much different from a studio founded by key BioWare veterans like Creative Director James Ohlen and Lead Writer Drew Karpyshyn.</p>
<p>In the trailer, we saw several brief dialogues between protagonist Juno and some of their companions, not to mention shooting, a grappling hook used in a fight with an armored bear, and even stealth (which was largely absent from Mass Effect). The trailer debuted on a stream hosted by CohhCarnage, where Ohlen and Archetype General Manager Chad Robertson answered several questions about the game.</p>
<p>EXODUS won't be an open world game, focusing on curated missions like in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic or Mass Effect instead. That said, there'll be room for exploration and optional content.</p>
<p>Described as an action roleplaying game, it will feature a lot of choices for players, the main twist being that they will get to see them impact their own homeworld over the decades and even centuries. The central theme of the game is that Travelers like Juno embark on perilous journeys to distant planets in a desperate effort to recover long-lost technology that could help humanity fight off the Celestials.</p>
<p>In that regard, Ohlen described Juno (who can be a male or female depending on the player's preference) as a blend of Indiana Jones and Dune's Paul Atreides. On one hand, they are explorers who venture into forgotten crypts and lost worlds to uncover precious artifacts; on the other hand, they are also leaders of their civilization, making pivotal choices for the development of humankind.</p>
<p>The aforementioned journeys are conducted at near-lightspeed. As a result, while the trips may take days or weeks for Juno and their team (by the way, they can only take two with them at a time, like in Mass Effect), years or even decades may have passed for those back on the home planet, which should result in some interesting plot progression.</p>
<p><iframe title="EXODUS Gameplay Trailer: 'The Traveler's Creed'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmJxSKn47EE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As you would expect in a game made by BioWare vets, EXODUS will feature deep relationships with the player character's companions, some of which will be romanceable. There may well be infighting between them, too, and it will be up to Juno to deal with the potential fallout.</p>
<p>We also got some info on the so-called lifestone, a blend of mineral and live vegetation that Juno can take advantage of while in combat and in exploration. It certainly sounds like this game's version of magic-like powers.</p>
<p>EXODUS is being <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-sci-fi-aaa-rpg-will-be-co-developed-by-certain-affinity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-developed</a> with the help of Certain Affinity and will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. No date was provided, but the developers teased that it won't be long before we get to see more gameplay. Meanwhile, you can either read the novel <a href="https://amzn.to/4gixKn9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> earlier this year or watch the dedicated 15-minute episode of Blur Studio's Secret Level that just became available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sell-17-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is projected to sell between 15 and 17 million units next year and more than 80 million units by 2028, solidifying its position as the console market leader, while Sony and Microsoft will struggle to gain significant market share with their next-generation systems.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DFC Intelligence</a>, the longest-standing research and advisory firm focused exclusively on the video game industry, published its 20245 market report and forecast, projecting major revenue growth for the video game industry for the second half of the decade. Following two years of revenue drop, the market will grow from this year's US$72 billion to US$83 billion in 2028, reaching nearly a third of a trillion dollars by then factoring in PC and console hardware and mobile game revenues. The video game audience is also expected to grow considerably, and nearly half the world is expected to be playing video games by 2027.</p>

<p>In the midst of this projected growth, Nintendo is expected to emerge as the absolute winner of the next console generation with the Nintendo Switch 2 in terms of hardware sales. According to DFC Intelligence, the system will be the most popular next-generation console, thanks to a combination of earlier availability and limited competition. As such, Nintendo's next system is expected to sell between 15 and 17 million units next year and over 80 million units by 2028. The PlayStation 6 and Xbox Next, on the other hand, are expected to fail to significantly increase Sony and Microsoft's market share, and one of the two companies will struggle in a distant third place, depending on which of the two can gain early momentum.</p>

<p>Given how much the Nintendo Switch 2 is being talked about despite the system still having to be officially revealed, these sales projections should surprise no one. The excitement surrounding the system could reach new heights as the new year begins, as Nintendo is reportedly planning not to wait <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/">much longer</a> to finally provide the first proper look at its next-generation system.</p>

<p>Shift Up has revealed an upcoming holiday update for Stellar Blade, the electrifying action title released by the South Korean studio in April this year. The title competed for trophies in a couple of categories at The Game Awards, and it has been turning heads since it launched on account of the game’s protagonist, Eve.</p>



<p>As you could expect, Eve is the central focus of the holiday update, with Shift Up adding a stack of accessories, a new hairstyle, and a fresh outfit for Eve to equip.</p>



<p>Read on to check out what’s coming in the Stellar Blade holiday update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-goes-seasonal">Stellar Blade Goes Seasonal</h2>



<p>In the latest update for Stellar Blade, a slew of holiday-themed assets have been added.</p>



<p>Players can unlock the ‘Santa Dress’, an exclusive outfit for Adam, and other new accessories, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Santa Girl hairstyle</li>



<li>Snow Crystal glasses</li>



<li>Wreath Earrings</li>



<li>Sleigh Earcuff</li>



<li>Rudolf Drone Skin</li>
</ul>



<p>Shift Up has added new BGM to celebrate the Christmas period, and they’ll be playable both in the camp and in certain areas around Zion – in the small plaza and The Last Gulp. Players can also marvel at the seasonal decorations spread around Zion, adding a touch of festivity to the post-apocalyptic slasher.</p>



<p>If you look hard enough in Zion, you’ll find that the target shooting minigame has been adorned with a festive theme, but that’s the most interactive element of this update if I’m being honest.</p>



<p>In addition, the team has made various bug fixes as part of the update – but we don’t care about that, we just want the holiday-themed content.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to unlocking the holiday content in Stellar Blade? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Since 2017, new Chapter releases (ESO's versions of expansions) have come yearly, including this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-gold-road-revealed-will-introduce-a-brand-new-daedric-prince-in-june/1100-6520388/" data-ref-id="1100-6520388">Gold Road chapter</a>. That annual model has been "incredibly successful," according to Firor. The massive updates introduced new zones, quests, dungeons, followers, and more. They normally released in June, and much of ESO's schedule was planned around these major content releases, but because of the strict release schedule, didn't allow the team much time for experimentation.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="597752841" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

months. Seasonal updates will include new story content, dungeons, and events. Next year will be a "transition year" for the team, Firor said, and some of the larger updates the team has been working on will still be released alongside the game's new seasonal updates.</p><p dir="ltr">"Freeing up the dev team from needing to adhere to a strict annual cycle means we will be able to have teams launch content when it is ready throughout the year and not work to a date in June--this will let us focus on a greater variety of content spread over the year," Firor said.</p><p dir="ltr">Firor stressed that while the team is moving away from Chapters and its focus will no longer be largely on adding giant new zones, there will still be new story content and, occasionally, new zones. Larger zones will be split across multiple content updates, Firor said, and stories from previous zones will be continued. There will also be new stories focusing on Elder Scrolls factions like the Dark Brotherhood, Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, and Thieves Guild. For those looking forward to a new ESO zone, it sounds like there will still be one coming next year, but Firor said players will have to wait until April to learn more details on how it will work differently from previous zone additions.</p><p dir="ltr">A desire for ZeniMax Online to experiment on new and different types of content is something it's heard from the game's community, Firor said, and 2025 will see some of those experiments come to fruition. They include revamping the Cyrodiil PvP experience to have higher concurrent players by giving classes PvP-specific skills that perform better in the massive-PvP setting, increasing the standard difficulty of combat while out in the open world, more experimental zones, better guild tools, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Firor additionally said ZeniMax Online will be putting a focus on the game's new and returning player experience moving forward, with visual updates to the game's starting zones, UI improvements, and changes to make it easier for returning players to jump back into the game more quickly.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-developers-have-unionized/1100-6528457/" data-ref-id="1100-6528457">ZeniMax Online recently unionized</a>, which parent company Microsoft has voluntarily recognized.

One of them, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/bimfli-and-his-time-travels-japan-switch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/bimfli-and-his-time-travels-japan-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bimfli &amp; His Time Travels: Japan</em></a></span>, features screenshots that seem to all be made using AI-generated imagery of children. The game was developed by Aldora Games, a studio that has released nearly <em>80</em> games since February 2023. And almost all of them are storybook games that use AI-generated art or reuse assets. </p><p>As we get closer to Christmas, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/search/#q=christmas&amp;p=1&amp;cat=gme&amp;sort=rd&amp;f=corePlatforms%2Cavailability&amp;corePlatforms=Nintendo+Switch&amp;availability=Available+now%2CNew+releases&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/search/#q=christmas&amp;p=1&amp;cat=gme&amp;sort=rd&amp;f=corePlatforms%2Cavailability&amp;corePlatforms=Nintendo+Switch&amp;availability=Available+now%2CNew+releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can also find a lot of holiday-themed slop</a></span>, often priced low and relying on AI art to hopefully entice a parent or kid to spend a few bucks on some entertainment. Except you won’t get much holly jolly enjoyment out of most of these “games,” as they are just barely interactive storybooks with AI-generated text or public domain stories included. The ones that aren’t just boring storybooks appear to be bland-looking mobile game ports or hastily developed asset flips. </p><p>And what makes me sad is that as I  dug through all the slop and scams, I saw real games made by small teams trying to break through all the garbage.

<p>Lords of the Fallen 2 is already being eagerly awaited by the community. Today (17), new information about the sequel was revealed by Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, the game’s publisher.</p>



<p>According to Marek, the game has already entered the full production phase with more than 200 developers working on it. </p>



<div><article><p><span>The next game under </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LordsoftheFallen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#LordsoftheFallen</a><span> has been already under full production for a good part of this year. As of now we have over 200 people full time working on that, both internal team and codev partners.</span></p></article></div>



<p>According to the CEO, the internal forecast is for the game to be released sometime in 2026. The marketing campaign will begin sometime next year. </p>



<p>Hexworks has delivered a very competent Souls-like game that has revitalized the franchise. Surprisingly, as well as making a new game, the studio still manages to find time to support the first game by releasing patches frequently. </p>



<p>The reboot was praised for its unusual realm-crossing mechanics that impacted exploration and direct campaign progression.</p>

<p>Exodus, a new AAA sci-fi RPG from Archetype Entertainment, has been given an electrifying gameplay trailer.</p>



<p>Called “The Traveler’s Creed”, the material shows story scenes, some of the locations we’ll be visiting, breathtaking scenery and, of course, lots of explosions. The game’s budget seems to be quite generous, after all, even a trailer featuring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exodus-starring-matthew-mcconaughey-gets-new-cinematic-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew McConaughey</a> has been released.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EXODUS Gameplay Trailer: 'The Traveler's Creed'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmJxSKn47EE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In one part of the trailer, we can see a gigantic bear wearing space armor. Crazy, right? The protagonist will also be able to use a grappling hook to move around the environment faster.</p>



<p>Comparisons with Mass Effect are and will be inevitable, after all, part of the Exodus team are veterans who worked on the BioWare franchise. And, well, judging by this initial trailer, fans of Shepard are going to be very happy with Exodus.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, no release date has been announced. The synopsis reads as follows:</p>



<p>“<em>Join the Travelers, as they sacrifice their lives to travel through the Centauri Universe on a dangerous mission to save an isolated Awakened civilization from enslavement by Celestials. Our service – our sacrifice – discovers worlds, seeds hope, breaks empires</em>.”</p>

Earlier this year, Ziff Davis, <em>IGN</em>’s parent company, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161718/ign-gamer-network-acquisition">acquired a handful of media sites</a> including <em>Eurogamer;</em> <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun;</em> and <em>VG247</em>. In the time since, there have been staff departures and layoffs <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamesindusty-biz-ign-and-humble-losing-talent-due-to-soft-layoffs">including buyouts offered to employees earlier this month</a>. According to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts">a report in <em>Aftermath</em></a>, this latest round of buyouts has apparently left <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, a site that’s been around for over 20 years, with only one full-time employee.</p><p><em>Restart</em>’s business model isn’t wholly unique. Before it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24212016/game-informer-shutting-down-layoffs-gamestop">unceremoniously shut down earlier this year</a>, <em>Game Informer</em> magazine was owned and operated by GameStop, and for decades <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/24/3800928/nintendo-powers-final-cover">Nintendo ran its own magazine</a>. Other websites like <em>IGN</em>, <em>Polygon</em>, and <em>The Verge</em> also run sponsored content and include affiliate links in articles. To survive in the current digital media landscape, the support of deep-pocketed individuals or corporations is all but required. In this regard, <em>Restart</em> is just like any other publication.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.restart.run/editorial-mission">its editorial mission</a>, “<em>Restart</em> is sponsored by Walmart, but we operate as an independent site.” The mission statement explains that while its articles will feature affiliate links to Walmart products, the site itself will receive no portion of the sale. “We hope you can see this gives us zero incentive to provide biased review scores or other information about a game.”</p><div><p><em>“Restart</em> is sponsored by Walmart, but we operate as an independent site.”</p></div><p>But <em>Restart</em> is also entering a media landscape where the wall between corporate interests and editorial independence has become perilously thin, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23949269/aftermath-video-games-kotaku-defector">with a few rare exceptions</a>, games media has slowly shifted away from providing readers thoughtful discussion and critique to providing a product that can be monetized to hell and back.  That driving ethos is clearly outlined <a href="https://moonrockbiz.substack.com/p/november-2024-exciting-partnerships">in a post by Moonrock on its Substack</a>. “Restart.run serves as a dynamic hub where gaming content meets retail opportunities, allowing gamers to transition effortlessly from discovering new games to purchasing them on Walmart’s platform.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the most <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-is-the-obnoxious-game-we-needed-it-to-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">random yet enjoyable games</a> to release in 2024 has a new update. Developer Dee Dee Creations has released a new update for Squirrel With A Gun.</p>



<p>The new Ratatoskr Update sees a new boss, a new platforming level dubbed the “Super Platforming Challenge”, and new styles to find. </p>



<p>“A new rival has arrived and joins forces with Mother &amp; Father to destroy the neighborhood,” the update description reads. “The fight against Ratatoskr is quite unlike the vehicle-based bosses you’ve faced before. The mythical squirrel moves fast, has a variety of ranged and melee attacks, and is a considerably smaller target! Fortunately, you will be granted a special SMG with a magazine of infinite bullets for the occasion.”</p>



<p>The Ratatoskr Update is just the second — the first added Photo Mode to the game — of at least six planned free updates for the game. The next update is an outfit variety pack in February followed by a new Gravity Gun in March. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-post-launch-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rest of the updates</a> are scheduled to come by August 2025.</p>

<p>In our review of the game, we called Squirrel With A Gun “the exact type of obnoxious game it needed to be” with its mix of platforming, puzzles, and fun cutscenes. The game is available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
