			<p>You can tell that a medium has reached some form of maturity once things start getting meta and titles appear that draw attention to the process of being constructed and the dilemmas that are faced by their creators. Countless great modern novels and films that are as lauded as Citizen Kane are clear examples of this and, whilst not in the same league as these, The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest is of a similar vein. You play as a burned out developer who undergoes hypnotism in a therapy session only to find himself trapped inside his own creation, a search adventure game with procedurally generated layouts.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Prisoning: Fletcher's Quest | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXqAy_wgqlw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The pixel-art aesthetic in Fletcher’s Quest is really nicely done and the various areas of the game look distinct whilst enemies and characters are well designed. Bosses are particularly memorable and everything benefits from a bright and colourful approach. Music is solid enough with a few standout tracks, again often in boss fights.</p>


<p>The game’s narrative is clearly nonsense and is all presented in a suitably tongue-in-cheek fashion. This is perhaps most obviously seen by the fact that the early rooms of the game have to be traversed not just devoid of weapons or skills but also of clothing. The pixel graphics mean that you are saved the detail of such nudity, whether you’d like it or not, but characters do comment on it. Your first mission, therefore, is to find clothes and a means of defending yourself.</p>


<p>While billed as a Metroidvania (I prefer ‘search adventure’ myself) the game actually reminded me more of classic home computer titles such as Jet Set Willy and Manic Miner. The flip-screen traversal and assortment of ludicrous enemy types brought me right back to my earliest days of gaming in the mid to late-1980s, but without the extreme frustration that accompanied those often nigh-on-impossible games. The main difference, however, is actually an unintended consequence of the choice to use procedural generation – rooms and areas are relatively forgettable, lacking the intricate design that the genre really requires to succeed.</p>
<p>The generated layout is completely functional with areas blocked until you beat bosses and unlock new skills, but many rooms feel interchangeable and the extreme frequency of save and travel points mean that backtracking is rarely required. Indeed, on the default difficulty it was generally quicker to collect items and then die to return to the last save point. As collection progress is maintained, the game seems to actively encourage you to avoid playing it. If I’m being generous this might be a deliberate move in keeping with the meta view of the genre, but I think it’s just another result of the use of procedural generation.</p>
<p>In terms of skills, you play through the whole game with just a pistol, and one that initially is a real pea-shooter. You can fire one bullet at a time and if you miss then you have to wait until the bullet disappears from view before you can fire another. This adds a level of strategy and reward for accuracy that does help to keep things interesting. As you defeat each boss you’ll be granted an additional bullet (a fact that I forgot, which made the second main boss unnecessarily difficult) as well as a traversal skill like double-jump and butt bounce.</p>

<p>As well as standard single screen platforming challenges, The Prisoning occasionally breaks things up with horizontal shooter sections and the final boss is an auto-runner minigame that treads a fine line between challenging and downright annoying. That said, given my first playthrough was under three hours, the variety is restricted by the short length of the game. This, again, helps to make the game feel like a lost retro title.</p>
<p>The four boss fights are the most memorable part of the game, not coincidentally because they are clearly the most hand-crafted moments. You’ll find yourself up against a giant robot, a skateboarding shark and more, with all offering distinct challenges and necessitating different approaches. The one that stood out for me was the shark, both because of the uniqueness of the antagonist, but also the slippery slope of forced humour it introduced.</p>

<p>The whole game has a lot of lol random’ humour that is very hit or miss. The nudity is the most obvious example but the shark boss features a lot of dialogue about how badly it is designed and frustratingly difficult it is. This kind of meta-joke is so often undermined by the content being as annoying as the joke pokes fun at. Admittedly this boss was rendered more challenging by my forgetfulness, but the battle goes on for a long time with you only having two hits before death.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest isn’t a bad game, and the handful of hours you’ll spend with it will certainly pass the time with a decent level of enjoyment, but there isn’t really anything particularly memorable here. The procedural generation means that subsequent playthroughs will feature slightly different layouts, though this undercuts the intricate level design that good search adventure games need. Coupled with the sometimes questionable humour and you have a title that can offer a passing distraction but won’t stay with you.	</p></div>

<p>Of course, TPC isn't celebrating any old birthday this year. 2026 marks the series' 30th anniversary, so we're cautiously optimistic that there might be a surprise or two in store for us during the show (alongside all of the usual app updates, of course). Gen 10 feels like a no-brainer, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">FireRed and LeafGreen</a> are already confirmed, but could there be <em>more</em>? Don't worry, we've got the clown makeup on standby.</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced that Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green will be released for the Nintendo Switch next week. </p>

<p>Coming next week</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has seemingly revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> for the Switch earlier than planned, as a whole bunch of eShop listings are now <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/english-pokemon-firered-version-switch/">live on the eShop</a>. <em>[Update: the reveal has now been made official.]</em></p>
<p>Priced at <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> each with a launch date of <strong>27th February</strong> (Pokémon Day, of course), the release has bypassed Nintendo Switch Online entirely, meaning you can own the games digitally à la carte. At the time of writing, there's no confirmation that a physical release is also in the works, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, releasing FireRed and LeafGreen is a pretty big move to acknowledge Pokémon's 30th anniversary, much like the launch of classic titles on the 3DS almost 10 years ago for the 20th celebrations.</p>

<p>The titles will be available shortly after a Pokémon Presents showcase on the 27th, so we'll be sure to keep an eye out for any further anniversary announcements from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company.</p>

		<p>Having suddenly appeared on the Nintendo eShop, Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green are coming to the Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> next week on 27th February – that’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon">Pokémon Day</a>, which will have a traditional stream with new announcements, for which this was no doubt meant to be a surprise.</p>
<p>The games are priced pretty highly, set at £16.99 / $19.99, but also have the quirk of having distinct versions released for every language that they were shipped in.</p>



<p>The reason for this, per the eShop store page, is that “Because this version replicates the way the game was originally released, each language version is separate and there are no in-game options to change the language.” That’s an unnecessary complication for modern gamers, and honestly doesn’t make too much sense, but it hopefully won’t catch too many people out.</p>


<p>These Game Boy Advance remakes of the original game are rare enough to be prized possessions amongst game collectors, if you can find an original cartridge – it will be a great way to mark the Pokémon franchise’s 30th anniversary, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>The remakes updated the originals with the graphics of the GBA era – also making it so that Green was the pairing to Red, instead of Blue as it had been for the original western release – and added the Sevii Islands to visit, while bringing some other improvements like a contextual tutorial, save game recaps, and ties to the other Game Boy Advance and GameCube Pokémon games. Fire Red and Leaf Green also came with a special wireless adapter for local link play, and since wireless is now built into everything you own, this will also be supported on Switch.</p>
<p>Most importantly for the here and now, these games will have support for Pokémon Home added to them, so Pokémon caught in this game can be brought through to the newer titles.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/incursion-red-river-update-story-arc/</link>
            <guid>1441387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Incursion Red River is fast becoming a must-have extraction shooter. We’ve been talking about Incursion since it shone at Steam Next Fest in February 2024, and later that year, a massive update hit the game in development, blowing it wide open.</p>



<p>Now, the team at Games of Tomorrow has unveiled the incoming 1.3 update, which features a massive story segment bolstered by voice acting provided by none other than the BAFTA-award-winning Jane Perry. It’s coming globally on February 25th, and if you’re at all interested in this game, you’ll want to see what it includes.</p>







<h2 id="h-incursion-red-river-continues-to-grow">Incursion Red River Continues to Grow</h2>



<p>In 2023, Incursion Red River was known as PROJECT QUARANTINE, but a major rebrand overhauled the game’s identity and pushed it into the realms that we know now. In April 2024, the game launched in early access, and it has been under ongoing development ever since.</p>



<p>This new update, 1.3, is perhaps the most ambitious the team at Games of Tomorrow has produced thus far.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Games of Tomorrow revealed the 1.3 update has pushed them ‘to the absolute limit’, allowing them to ‘go beyond the boundaries originally set for the project.’</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’ve pushed ourselves to the absolute limit with this one…</p><p>With Update 1.3, we tried to go beyond the boundaries we originally set for the project and deliver something truly substantial.</p><p>With a full story chapter featuring 23 missions, voice by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheJanePerry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheJanePerry</a>, and… <a href="https://t.co/36tLqEJMfY">pic.twitter.com/36tLqEJMfY</a></p></div>— Incursion Red River (@IncursionRR) <a href="https://twitter.com/IncursionRR/status/2024140999560147145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The 1.3 update includes a full story segment comprised of 23 missions, with voice work from Jane Perry, a legendary actor. It also introduces Solarint to the universe, hired as an AI programmer after his success on SP-Tarkov’s SAIN AI mod. The team wrote in a recent blog post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>AI behavior has been completely rebuilt. It will feel fundamentally different to the enemies you will encounter in 1.2.</p>



<p>We are aiming for grounded and realistic behavior. Bots won’t be doing jumpshots or anything that a person in their situation wouldn’t plausibly do.</p>



<p>This first version is designed to be a solid framework to build off in future updates. That means it is not feature complete and some behavior is placeholder until the systems can be made to support it as intended. Even so, we think it will be a very compelling upgrade compared to 1.2.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that AI enemies have had their pathing, movement, tactical positioning, difficulty, and focus upgraded.</p>



<p>Incursion Red River is one of those extraction shooters that deserves way more attention than it gets. All-time, it peaked at 2,478 concurrent users on Steam, which isn’t at all indicative of the game’s quality. When we played the game during pre-release in 2024, we were pleasantly surprised at how well it handled.</p>



<p>It’s worthstressing that it’s a PvE shooter with cooperative elements, which isn’t typical for the extraction genre, and that’s perhaps why it hasn’t hit lofty heights <strong>yet</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[FURIA Has Stripped Entire Rainbow Six Siege Roster (Except for HerdsZ)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/furia-rainbow-six-roster-dropped/</link>
            <guid>1441384</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FURIA has unveiled a major restructuring effort that has resulted in the removal of <strong>almost </strong>the entire Rainbow Six Siege roster. The only player to survive the culling is Gustavo ‘Herdz’ Herdina, the sole member to retain his spot with the organization.</p>



<p>The roster that was just dismissed was the former w7m team that claimed the top spot at the Six Invitational 2024, securing a $1 million prize after having dominated at the BLAST Atlanta Major and BLAST Copenhagen Major the year before.</p>







<h2 id="h-furia-s-rainbow-six-presence-drops">FURIA’s Rainbow Six Presence Drops</h2>



<p>FURIA is now sitting without a roster after falling out of this year’s Six Invitational in sixth place. The organization made it into the playoffs in Paris, but back-to-back losses against Team Falcons and Fluxo W7M were enough to eliminate the Brazilian roster from the running.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was FaZe Clan, a <strong>different </strong>Brazilian unit, that went on to win the Six Invitational. It was a historic victory, as it cemented FaZe Clan as the first back-to-back Six Invitational winner <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>All eyes are now on the team that will be built around HerdsZ, the last player left on FURIA after the cleanout. That’s not all, though, as fans of Rainbow Six esports will be eager to see if the dismissed roster remains a squad and moves on to a new home together, just as they did from w7m into FURIA.</p>



<p>There’s now something of an off-season before the big events start popping up again. Our next BLAST R6 Major will land in May in Salt Lake City, which gives teams plenty of time to get their ducks in a row.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ve got any idea what will happen next with FURIA.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Congratulations, you’ve made it to the end of another tough week. Your reward for making it this far is another string of NYT Connections hints and answers. It’s not much, but it’s all I have! If you scroll down, you’ll get the NYT Connections solutions you need to solve today’s puzzle as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Enjoy your weekend! But don’t forget to stop back tomorrow for another guide!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-20">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 20)</h2>



<p>Here are the words from today’s NYT Connections puzzle:</p>



<ul>
<li>MAGIC WAND</li>



<li>ECLIPSE</li>



<li>TOP HAT</li>



<li>DONKEY</li>



<li>TIDE</li>



<li>PLAYING CARD</li>



<li>WEREWOLF</li>



<li>BOOT</li>



<li>SILVER BULLET</li>



<li>IRON</li>



<li>CHEESE</li>



<li>GREEN CHEESE</li>



<li>SOCKET</li>



<li>PANACEA</li>



<li>THIMBLE</li>



<li>EASY ANSWER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Words you might link to a quick, simple fix</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Words you might link to the moon in some way</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Words that you’d associate with a game of Monopoly</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Words that pair nicely with the concept of ‘Jack’</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 20:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-20-985">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 20 (#985)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– EASY ANSWER, MAGIC WAND, PANACEA, SILVER BULLET</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – ECLIPSE, GREEN CHEESE, TIDE, WEREWOLF</li>

<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CHEESE, DONKEY, PLAYING CARD, SOCKET</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Each character in this free "<strong>Bimmy &amp; Friends DLC</strong>" brings a new face, new personality, and a new fighting style to the city - allowing players to experiment with "powerful tag-team" combos. Here's the rundown about and you can see each fighter in action in the trailer above.</p>

<p><strong>Armored Okada</strong></p>
<p>Despite being the Oyabun of the Okada Clan, Lady Okada faces constant discrimination from the elders. When a powerful threat emerged, the elders presented her with the sacred clan armor - a challenge disguised as support. If she triumphs, she earns their respect. If she fails, she proves them right.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p><strong>Bimmy Lee</strong></p>
<p>Legends speak of a secret within the Sōsetsuken - a form that can only be mastered by two. The tale has been passed down for so long that few believe it, dismissing it as myth or joke. But could this be the proof…?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-league-of-legends-tcg-riftbound-has-posted-explosive-early-growth-since-launch-with-searches-surging-over-300">League of Legends trading card game</a> Riftbound's second set, titled Spiritforged, was released in the US on February 13. The newest expansion has been out in China for a couple of months now, and in the west for just over a week, sowe've seen a general picture of how the new cards are impacting the metagame thanks to two recent Regional Qualifiers in Fuzhou and Chengdu. With that being said, these are some of the best Spiritforged cards I think you should look into picking up now that the set is finally available.</p><p id="blood-money"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Blood Money">10. Blood Money</h2></p><div id="234747"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234747" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blood Money</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At uncommon, this card is relatively easy to pick up at an affordable price as a single. This is a super cheap and efficient early removal spell to help you stay on tempo, and you'd be hard pressed to see Yellow decks like Viktor, Herald of the Arcane not running three copies. </p></div><p id="card-sharp"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Card Sharp">9. Card Sharp</h2></p><div id="234748"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234748" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Card Sharp</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Card Sharp is pretty versatile. There are a few Power hungry decks with Spiritforged, so being able to offset some of that cost with the Gold generated from Card Sharp and pressure with a 3 MIght body is worth considering. </p></div><p id="not-so-fast"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Not So Fast">8. Not So Fast</h2></p><div id="234749"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234749" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Not So Fast</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to the <a href="https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/rules-and-releases/riftbound-spiritforged-faq/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent errata to refexive triggers</a>, nerfing cards like <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/653046/riftbound-league-of-legends-trading-card-game-origins-icathian-rain" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Icathian Rain</a>, Not So Fast got significantly better. Before, you'd only be able to counter just one instance of damage, but now you can just counter the entire spell with Not So Fast. Definitely keep this card on your radar if you like Green decks. </p></div><p id="bellows-breath"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bellows Breath">7. Bellows Breath</h2></p><div id="234750"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234750" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bellows Breath</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Repeat mechanic offers a more dynamic way to interact with opponents. Bellows Breath is one of these, being able to clear a Battlefield of smaller units in the early game. </p></div><p id="trinity-force"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Trinity Force">6. Trinity Force</h2></p><div id="234751"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234751" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Trinity Force</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorite new equipments from the set, Trinity Force is one of the few cards that allow you to store extra points. I can see this making waves in Master Yi, Wuju Bladesman, as his Legend ability buffs defending units. In the Origins meta, the deck was great at holding to score points, and looks to be the same situation with Spiritforged. </p></div><p id="piercing-light"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Piercing Light">5. Piercing Light</h2></p><div id="234752"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234752" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Piercing Light</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Bellows Breath, this can be an early game removal spell for tempo, or an easy two-for-one later on. Kai'Sa, Daughter of the Void typically ran two to three copies of <a href="https://zdcs.link/z64yqj?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Falling Star</a>, so I can see this finding a home in that deck too. </p></div><p id="ferrous-forerunner"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Ferrous Forerunner">4. Ferrous Forerunner</h2></p><div id="234753"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234753" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ferrous Forerunner</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ferrous Forerunner is a big body that continues to pressure your opponent even after it dies. Doing its best <a href="https://zdcs.link/aA85lL?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wurmcoil Engine</a> impression, this guy will spit out two 3 Might Mech tokens upon death, allowing you to maintain your board presence. </p></div><p id="called-shot"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Called Shot">3. Called Shot</h2></p><div id="234754"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234754" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Called Shot</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if Called Shot had 1 Energy cost, I would consider extremely powerful. At 0 Energy <em>and </em>sporting the Repeat mechanic has convinced me it's the best draw and filter spell in the game. With a ton of ways to generate Gold tokens to help pay Power costs, this card is positioned to be seen in every Purple deck. </p></div><p id="guardian-angel"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Guardian Angel">2. Guardian Angel</h2></p><div id="234755"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234755" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Guardian Angel</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Guardian Angel is essentially copies four through 6 of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLpyVX?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zhonya's Hourlgass</a>, which has the same effect. This, however, is an equipment, so it comes with a +1 Might buff and costs a Power to equip to a unit. Master Yi,  Wuju Bladesman is still poised to be a contender with Spiritforged, and this card is one reason for that. </p></div><p id="ezrea-prodigy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Ezrea, Prodigy">1. Ezreal, Prodigy</h2></p><div id="234756"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234756" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ezreal, Prodigy</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While Draven, Glorious Executioner is easily the strongest deck in the Spiritforged meta, many lists are playing Ezreal, Prodigy, which is the best card in the set for my money. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purple is undoubtedly very strong, and Ezreal's effect allows you to filter through your deck and a lot cards early, and fits into a few other archetypes nicely. </p></div><p id="where-to-buy-spiritforged"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to Buy Spiritforged">Where to Buy Riftbound: Spiritforged</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you prefer the rush of cracking packs hoping to pull your favorite chase cards, below are the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/league-of-legends-riftbound-tcg-spiritforged-where-to-buy-2026">Spiritforged sealed products available for purchase</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Origins before it, the second set is already sold out on Riot's online storefront, but you can order through TCGplayer at pretty high markups if you're desperate to secure the goods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.

<p>Nintendo has this week surprised <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade</a> fans with a Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>. There is also a paid upgrade for existing owners.</p>
<p>To celebrate the Switch 2 version, Nintendo has also revived the game's themed icons for Switch Online members. Yes, in case you missed it, there are four waves over four weeks, and the first wave is now officially live. As usual, they'll cost <strong>10 Platinum Points</strong> each, and background and borders are priced at <strong>5 Platinum Points</strong> each.</p><div><figure data-videoid="h10LJgMQyAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yth10LJgMQyAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed562d82pyvswk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>If you haven't already pulled the trigger on the Switch 2 upgrade for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, it will cost you <strong>£4.19 / $4.99</strong>. Or you can get the Switch 2 Edition for <strong><em>£</em>54.99 / $64.99</strong>. A physical release has also been confirmed and is arriving in April. Whatever you choose, expect 4K and up to 60fps in docked, and 1080p and up to 60fps in handheld.</p>
<p>Here's what we had to say about the Switch 2 Edition of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition in our hands on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is the smallest paid Switch 2 Edition yet from Nintendo, providing <em>only</em> a resolution bump (1080p handheld, 4K docked) and performance boost (a steady 60fps both handheld and docked). But it's hard not to be impressed when you see Monolith Soft's vision be fully realised on-screen. It's amazing we've never had a <strong>Xenoblade</strong> game at 60fps before this, and it's a real showcase of just how much more beautiful and smooth these worlds can look."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Here’s Why Some People Think The Viral AI Fight Between Tom Cruise And Brad Pitt Was Kind Of A Scam]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/tom-cruise-brad-pitt-ai-fight-scene-video-debunked-2000671486</link>
            <guid>1441297</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On February 10, filmmaker Ruairí Robinson made a <a href="https://x.com/RuairiRobinson/status/2021394940757209134">bold claim on X</a>. “This was a 2 line prompt in seedance 2. If the hollywood is cooked guys are right maybe the hollywood is cooked guys are cooked too idk,” he wrote. The post was accompanied by a video of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt performing a fight scene together. The clip gained attention for its apparent sophistication; it appeared well-choreographed, competently shot, and appropriately lit, which are all elements that other AI video tools have struggled to convincingly replicate. If Robinson’s claim was true, this was a significant leap forward in AI video technology. The kind of thing AI hype-men have been shilling for years and which has—until, if Robinson is to be believed, right now—turned out to be nothing more than <a href="https://www.shokunin.studio/blog/2024/2/15/openai-releases-text-to-video-tool-sora-and-instantly-generates-a-wave-of-social-media-spam">snake oil</a>. There’s just one problem: It’s probably still snake oil.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This was a 2 line prompt in seedance 2. If the hollywood is cooked guys are right maybe the hollywood is cooked guys are cooked too idk. <a href="https://t.co/dNTyLUIwAV">pic.twitter.com/dNTyLUIwAV</a></p> <p>— Ruairi Robinson (@RuairiRobinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/RuairiRobinson/status/2021394940757209134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Aron Peterson, a writer and software developer who has also worked in film production, post-production, and visual effects, posted a blog on his website, <a href="https://www.shokunin.studio/blog/2026/2/18/is-it-all-over-for-filmmakers">Shokunin Studio</a>, questioning Robinson’s story. “The claims being made immediately rubbed me up the wrong way,” Peterson wrote. “Other demos of the Seedance model had the usual errors we have come to expect from AI video generators [but this one didn’t].” In particular, Peterson explained, “AI video generators are really bad at simulating realistic camera moves, especially handheld shaky cam,” but in the Cruise/Pitt video, “we can see the camera movement.”</p>

 <p>So Peterson started researching <a href="https://kotaku.com/arcane-league-of-legends-ai-trailer-vi-jinx-ekko-warwick-2000666921">Seedance 2.0</a>, the new AI tool from TikTok developer ByteDance that’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1dl410q9o">already doing large-scale copyright infringement</a>, which Robinson used to create the video. Peterson “hopped over to Seedance’s website and it only took 10 seconds to find green screen footage of two stuntmen performing the same fight choreography we see in the Cruise vs Pitt scene,” he said. He also posted a comparison of the two videos on YouTube.</p>   <p>“Was the input really just a 2 line prompt or was it actually 2 lines, green screen video footage, and face references too?” Peterson asked. “The evidence appears to show that stuntmen were filmed from several angles, that a clip had to be generated for every angle, and then finally all clips were stitched together for marketing.” Peterson’s evidence implies that the Cruise/Pitt fight scene wasn’t entirely AI generated; instead, it was probably just face replacement and background creation laid on top of footage that already existed. As TV writer David Slack put it on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/slack2thefuture.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, “In other words, like most AI hype — it was a con.”</p>

In the shadows, Takechiyo’s younger brother, Tokugawa Kunimatsu, is consumed by jealousy towards his sibling. Empowered by a sinister force, he plots to overthrow Takechiyo and leads a horde of yokai, abruptly ending the era of peace and plunging Japan into hell. Guided by the mysterious power of their Guardian Spirit Kusanagi, Takechiyo transcends time to rescue a land in dire straits and become shogun.</p><p>The story of <em>Nioh 3</em> unfolds on a larger scale than ever before in series history. Covering various eras and regions, including Edo Castle, the Totomi region during the Warring States period, the Heian period’s capital city of Kyoto, and, for the first time in the franchise’s history, the Bakumatsu period. Players will be able to freely explore each era as a vast open field featuring beautiful and distinct environments.</p><p><em>Nioh 3</em> introduces two distinct combat styles, Samurai and Ninja, that players can freely switch between during the heat of battle. The Samurai Style captures <em>Nioh</em>‘s foundational, grounded combat experience, while introducing the new Arts Proficiency system to enhance Martial Arts abilities. In addition, the new Deflect mechanic allows players to block enemy attacks at the last moment to turn the tide of battle against deadly adversaries.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In contrast to Samurai Style, Ninja Style excels in agility, enabling players to swiftly dodge and perform aerial attacks while employing various Ninjutsu techniques to attack outside of enemy range. Ninja Style also features the Mist technique, which leaves an afterimage following an attack to momentarily distract enemies, as well as the Evade technique to narrowly avoid enemy strikes. Both techniques will help players outmaneuver foes while delivering devastating swift attacks from behind.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Accolades Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Nioh 3 - Accolades Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xr6MIWX29jA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『仁王３』アコレードトレーラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HrdLtgaQnA4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/nioh-3-sales-top-one-million]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/skate-4-grom-paywall-location-new-map-island-2000671466</link>
            <guid>1441249</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Next month, season three goes live in EA’s free-to-play reboot of <em>Skate</em>. The big new addition in the upcoming season is Grom, an island that players can visit and skate around on. However, the island, which is a slightly updated version of the tutorial island, is essentially locked behind a paywall, which goes against a promise EA made before launch.</p> <p>On February 19, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/dev-update-s3-skatepass-grom-and-the-future">EA and Full Circle posted a blog</a> talking about some of the changes coming in <em>Skate’s</em> third season, which goes live on March 10. In the post, EA revealed that a new island will be available to skaters in the next season. But accessing this island won’t be as simple or free as fast traveling to it once the update is live.</p>

 <p>During the first month of season three, skate.Pass Premium holders will be able to visit Grom as much as they want, whenever they want. For those who haven’t paid for <em>Skate’s</em> battle pass, they’ll be locked out until April. That’s when a “very special multi-week event” will happen, and all players will be invited to Grom’s “grand opening.” After that wraps up, free access to Grom will be restricted once more to Premium pass owners. Non-paying players will be able to spend 500 rip chips, an in-game currency you earn by playing, to buy a day pass to the island.</p> <figure><figcaption>An overhead comparison of Grom during the game’s tutorial and Grom during the event provided by EA.&nbsp; (EA/Kotaku)</figcaption></figure> <p>Did you get all that? A bit confusing, but somewhat understandable for a free-to-play game. However, there’s a problem. Before the launch of <em>Skate</em> in September last year, EA made some promises about the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/FAMgtFyrQLk?t=453">In a video posted in July 2022</a>, the devs said that when they started exploring the free-to-play model, they had to set some “hard ground rules to follow.” One of those rules included “No map areas locked behind paywalls.” Whoops! It also doesn’t help that the new island is just a slightly expanded version of the game’s tutorial island, something that is very clear to see in EA’s own comparison image in the blog.</p>

 <h2>The backlash to <em>Skate</em> paywalling an island</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r9a7oh/so_devs/">As you might expect</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r98r3g/ea_did_it_again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><em>Skate</em> players weren’t happy</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r98r3g/ea_did_it_again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">about all of this</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r9akiw/what_is_this_full_circle/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">and started flooding social media</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r997il/isle_of_grom/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">and Reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r98un6/huh_whats_that/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">with posts</a> <a href="https://x.com/nkocharm/status/2024534025692430345">pointing out the promise EA had broken</a>. This eventually led to the official <em>Skate</em> account on <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/2024539083259654345">X posting a statement about Grom</a>.</p>

 <p>“We launched <em>Skate</em> in Early Access so we could build it with players, not behind closed doors,” EA wrote. “Since September, we’ve been updating the world, tweaking characters, and adding features our players have been asking for, and there is lots more coming. Yes, sometimes plans have to change. That’s part of the deal when you’re building in public. We’re here, we’re listening, and we’re going to keep shaping <em>Skate</em> together.”</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to EA for more information.</p> <p>While it is true that game development is messy, going back on this promise has opened up a can of worms. EA also promised that <em>Skate</em> would not contain paid loot boxes or pay-to-win elements. Why should players trust EA to stick to those promises if it is willing to deviate on this issue and toss an island behind a paywall, even one that can be avoided by grinding for currency?</p>

 <p>Regardless, I’m not shocked EA has decided to renege. The company is likely under pressure to make more money across all of its games after announcing its upcoming deal to sell itself to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">Saudi Arabia and private equity goons for $55 billion</a>.</p>

            <guid>1441246</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE has filed three new video game trademarks.</p>



<p>On February 18, WWE filed to trademark the terms “WWE Domination,” “WWE Generations,” and “WWE Eras Collide.” All three trademarks have the same description, noting that they’re used for video games.</p>



<p>“Trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of video and computer game software; video games software for use with wireless devices; downloadable video games software for use via a global computer network and wireless devices; interactive video game programs and computer game cartridges; interactive multimedia computer games on all platforms comprised of computer hardware and computer game software; electronic games software that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device,” the official trademark description reads.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-games-in-the-past-have-focused-on-the-clash-of-eras">WWE Games in the Past Have Focused on the Clash of Eras</h2>



<p>In 2011, WWE released WWE All Stars. Published by THQ, the game focused on pairing the stars of yesteryear against the then-modern stars of WWE. The game was an arcade-style break from the usual simulation releases the sports entertainment juggernaut puts out annually.</p>



<p>No game has since been directly focused on the collision of different eras in WWE history. However, every year, several generations are represented in the WWE 2K video game series. </p>







<p>It is not certain whether these trademarks will lead to a new video game release, and if that game will be released on mobile or console devices. Still, it’s been several years since WWE has tried something new in the gaming realm, and any sign of a fresh idea could be fun for that fan base.</p>

It comes with a sneak peek at how hurricanes will tear through maps like Spaceport, promising what already looks like the most dangerous weather the southern Italy-set video game has faced yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Powerful Electromagnetic Storms and wintery Cold Snap conditions have had players seeking shelter before, but Embark says Arc Raiders hasn’t seen anything quite like this. Starting with the launch of Shrouded Sky February 24, Raiders may be subjected to strong winds that will have them rethinking how they approach PvP and PvE.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Searching for topside resources and blueprints during a hurricane will have players fighting both with and against the wind. Running with the storm could provide a small speed boost, for example, but running against it will result in slowed movement and drained stamina. Raiders can also expect everything from gas grenades to trailblazers and other throwables to behave differently when winds pick up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One look at the trailer makes it clear visibility will be low during a hurricane, but Embark says Arc Raiders players will want to be wary of debris, too. However, like with most other map conditions, the increased threat level means more opportunities to find better loot, with today’s post teasing Raider Caches and relics of the First Wave for those who brave the storm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shrouded Sky is Embark’s major update for February and follows the January <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-big-arc-raiders-update-of-2026-adds-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-bird-city-and-more-tomorrow"><u>Headwinds update</u></a>. While that relatively small content drop added a solo vs. squads queue option and the Bird City map condition, Shrouded Sky is said to come packed with a Raider Deck and map update, as well as a new Arc threat, which we may have gotten a small glimpse of toward the end of today's trailer. Players can also expect to reset their ranks once again with the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-outlines-expedition-changes-after-players-criticized-steep-reward-requirements"><u>the next Expedition</u></a> the following day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026"><u>Arc Raiders roadmap</u></a> also promised the Flashpoint update for March and Riven Tides for April.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/how-a-rabid-xcom-fan-became-the-designer-of-enemy-unkno-5890749">Jake Solomon</a>, who previously served as creative director on <a href="https://kotaku.com/xcom-2-the-kotaku-review-1757343867"><em>XCOM 2</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-midnight-suns-impressions-xcom-firaxis-pc-rpg-1849793171"><em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em></a>, announced today that the studio he founded, Midsummer Studios, is closing down. Solomon created Midsummer Studios in 2024 with the goal of “reinvent[ing] the life sim genre,” according to a <a href="https://www.midsummerstudios.com/news/studio-announcement">press release</a> from the time. <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181">In a post on X</a> announcing the closure, Solomon wrote, “We built a studio, we made a game, and I’m really proud of both. Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I’d like to share a glimpse of <em>Burbank</em>, the game we poured our hearts into. It’s like “Life Sims + <em>The Truman Show</em>,” but it’s more than that. I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up. Burbank let’s you do that.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both.

In order to do that, <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024511003917009256">Solomon disclosed in a follow-up post</a>, “Our characters use AI for memory, reasoning and speech. That’s what let’s you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write. But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing *any* developers with AI.” Solomon did not provide a reason for the studio’s closure.</p>

 <p>Studio closures and layoffs are arguably the games industry’s biggest crisis right now. Earlier today, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">Sony announced it would close Bluepoint Games</a>, the studio behind the very well-received <em>Demon’s Souls</em> and <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> remakes.&nbsp;In a 2024 interview with <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/xcom-designer-jake-solomon-is-done-with-turn-based-strategy-and-is-now-making-a-life-sim-inspired-by-the-small-town-drama-of-gilmore-girls/">PC Gamer</a></em>, Solomon said that Midsummer Studios had 11 employees, with plans to add two more. At the time of the studio’s creation, those included co-founder and <a href="https://kotaku.com/civilization-beyond-earth-the-kotaku-review-1649058397"><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization: Beyond Earth</em></a> designer Will Miller, and Grant Rodiek, a longtime designer on the<em>&nbsp;Sims</em> franchise. It seems likely that, with Midsummer’s closure and <em>Burbank</em>‘s cancelation, all of those employees will be out of a job.</p> <p>Still, Solomon tried to end the announcement on a positive note. “We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we’ve never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that’s special. What you’re about to see is definitely pre-alpha. But this game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us,” he wrote.</p>

It will launch in 2026. <span id="more-1027364"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via ManaVoid Entertainment:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Billy is a little older now. And the world feels different.</p><p>In <em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears</em>, you step into a more introspective chapter of Billy’s journey, one shaped by adolescence, doubts, and the fears that quietly grow with us.</p><p>Rather than jumping and running through obstacles, Billy now observes, questions, and listens. The game unfolds as a narrative investigation, where understanding others and making sense of emotions takes precedence over <a title="Genres > Action [3,425 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As Billy explores the world, he encounters strange creatures known as Fearlings—manifestations of fears, anxieties, and unresolved feelings. These encounters are not about defeating enemies, but about understanding what troubles them, and, through them, understanding yourself.</p><p>Each situation invites you to investigate environments, gather clues, engage in dialogue, and piece together emotional puzzles. Choices matter, not because they lead to victory or failure, but because they shape Billy’s outlook on fear, empathy, and growth.</p><p><em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears</em> is a melancholic, thoughtful journey about growing up, learning to name your fears, and realizing that understanding them is often the bravest thing you can do.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1027370"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Themes</strong></p><ul><li>Growing up and emotional change.</li><li>Fear, anxiety, and self-discovery.</li><li>Empathy over confrontation.</li><li>Understanding others as a way to understand yourself.</li><li>Nostalgia for childhood / adolescence.</li></ul><p><strong>Gameplay Overview</strong></p><ul><li>Narrative-driven investigation gameplay.</li><li>Exploration and environmental observation.</li><li>Dialogue-based progression.</li><li>Emotional and symbolic confrontations with Fearlings.</li><li>A slower, reflective pace focused on mood and introspection.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Narrative Investigation</strong> – Explore environments, observe details, and piece together emotional clues to progress.</li><li><strong>Empathy-Based Encounters</strong> – Face Fearlings not as enemies, but as manifestations of inner struggles to be understood.</li><li><strong>Introspective Storytelling</strong> – A more mature and melancholic tone, reflecting adolescence and emotional growth.</li><li><strong>Same Universe, New <a title="Companies > Experience [215 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong> – Set in the Rainbow Billy world, but offering a fresh gameplay approach distinct from the first game.</li><li><strong>Stylized Art Direction</strong> – A colorful yet subdued visual style that mirrors the contrast between childhood wonder and growing emotional complexity.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

      <p>Bluepoint Games, an American studio specialising in remakes like the<em> God Of War Collection</em>, the <em>Ico &amp; Shadow Of The Colossus</em> bundle, <em>Uncharted Collection</em> and <em>Demon's Souls</em>,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>has been shut down by Sony after five years of ownership, during which time the company did not release a single remake</u></a>, with Bloomberg reporting that "roughly 70 employees will lose their jobs" as a result.</p><p>Having worked closely with PlayStation for over a <em>decade </em>(the <em>God of War Collection</em> was released in 2009), Sony decided to buy Bluepoint in 2021 and bring them in-house, after which they were promptly...set to work as a support studio on <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, before then being assigned a live-service <em>God of War</em> game, before <em>that </em>project was cancelled in January 2025.</p><figure></figure><p>And today they're done. The studio, first founded in 2006, will be shut down next month. In an internal email sent to PlayStation staff (shared on<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloomberg-playstation-is-shutting-down-bluepoint-games-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remakes.1440826/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>resetera</u></a>), Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst says:</p><blockquote>...we're operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.<p>To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We've taken a close look at our business to ensure we're delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March.</p><p>This decision was not made lightly. Bluepoint is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community. I want to thank everyone at Bluepoint for their creativity, craftsmanship, and commitment to quality. Where possible, we will work to find opportunities for some impacted employees within our global network of studios.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi/"><u>I have seen some gross acts of mismanagement in my time covering this industry</u></a>--it feels like the last three to four years have been nothing but--yet this one somehow feels like the worst. Bluepoint was a studio with a very clear speciality and a very successful track record: they took old PlayStation hits, gave them an update and sold them to new generations of fans.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi/"><div><p>Executives Should Be Facing The Music, Not Laying Off Workers - Aftermath</p><p>Bosses need to be held accountable for their failures</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>For PlayStation themselves to buy Bluepoint, not use them for the one thing they would have bought them for and now close them down is just the most colossal waste. It's industry vandalism, at scale. Former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who had live-service game brainworms (see below), deserves some of the scorn here, but the current regime--who have made the decision to close Bluepoint instead of finding something, <em>anything </em>from PlayStation's vast back catalogue for them to work on instead--are equally to blame.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:lb5dnroqbk4ikw4zmgdd77dd/app.bsky.feed.post/3mfaeubpavk2g" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihch3tsrer7mjtdjifeafldxutaiktgmffrnx5mee6h3vgjotb2am"><p lang="en">Not pulling this outta my ass either, here's something from Sony's 2022 investor/press thing, where they promised 12 Live Services by 2025. Aside from Helldivers, none of that is paying off, and that was under Jim Ryan who left before shit predictably hit the fan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan </em>was, I'd argue, one of those games with potential that fell a little flat, so the fact it's getting a followup in the form of <em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears </em>is an exciting prospect for me.</p><p>Developer Manavoid Entertainment announced the game today, describing it as a "new story-driven investigative adventure" that takes place in a "colorful summer camp where something feels...off".</p><p>It sounds as though Manavoid may have ditched <em>Rainbow Billy</em>'s shape-based combat system; in a press release, the developer says you'll "explore the camp, follow subtle clues, talk with campers, and slowly piece together what's happening", but there's no mention of any fisticuffs.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears </em>was an unexpected followup, but not an unwelcome one.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Manavoid, you can expect an investigative experience in which "clever puzzles" will "guide the story forward and reward curiosity", so hopefully, this won't be your typical "press A on the thing to win" adventure game.</p><p>The story revolves around the appearance of "curious creatures known as Fearlings" that were "never supposed to exist". They're a manifestation of the worries of the campers at an otherwise-cheerful summer camp, and it'll be your job to deal with them.</p><p>Manavoid says the Fearlings will be central to your journey, and that each "has a reason for being there", making learning the proper way to deal with them "essential" for achieving success in <em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears</em>.</p><p>Since Manavoid is still all about inclusivity and emotional intelligence, however, <em>The Book of Fears </em>will remain "warm and inviting" throughout its runtime from a tonal perspective, offering a "thoughtful and quietly meaningful experience".</p>
<p><em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears </em>is set to arrive on PC via Steam sometime this year.

              <p>In 2021, Facebook became Meta and the company claimed its <span data-start="12.945" data-end="13.235">focus</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="13.270" data-end="13.398">would</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="13.433" data-end="13.503">be</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="13.537" data-end="13.584">to</span> “<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/"><span data-start="13.653" data-end="13.874">bring</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="13.932" data-end="14.002">the</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="14.037" data-end="14.443">metaverse</span>&nbsp;<span data-start="14.478" data-end="14.547">to</span>&nbsp;</a><span data-start="14.629" data-end="15.012"><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">life.</a>” It launched <em>Horizon Worlds,</em> a VR metaverse that people could explore and create worlds in. It looked bad and wasn’t great, but it was supposedly the future. Five years later, Meta’s metaverse is ditching VR and spinning <em>Worlds</em> into a Roblox clone after burning <a href="https://medium.com/analysts-corner/the-100-billion-metaverse-hallucination-6f036155a869">$70+ billion</a> on virtual and augmented reality.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/2026-vr-state-of-the-union-horizon-mobile-focus/">On February 19</a>, in a blog post on Meta’s official website, the company announced its plans to split its VR and Reality Labs sector from <a href="https://kotaku.com/facebook-metaverse-horizon-worlds-vr-oculus-quest-2-cha-1848436740"><em>Horizon Worlds</em>, its free-to-play 3D metaverse</a> that supports user-created worlds and games. The company claims that doing this will “create more space for both products to grow.” The plan now is to fully pivot <em>Worlds</em> into a mobile, non-VR software experience that will resemble a Roblox clone more than the virtual metaverse depicted in <em>Ready Player One.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>“We started <em>Worlds</em> for VR with a small crew of dedicated creators who set out to build immersive experiences on their own,” said Meta. “Last year, we began to experiment with <em>Worlds</em> as a mobile platform, and we saw positive momentum. Now, to truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we’re going all-in on mobile.”</p>  <p>And when I say <em>Horizon Worlds</em> is becoming a Roblox clone, I mean that quite literally. In the blog post announcing this big shake-up, Meta name-drops three experiences that have landed on <em>Worlds</em> in recent months and become hugely popular:<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824"> Grow A Garden</a>, Steal A Brainrot, </em>and <em>Yeet Yourself</em>. (Though oddly, after posting the blog, Meta removed the last two games. Hmm.)</p>

 <p>These are popular Roblox experiences, and it makes it clear what Meta is really doing with this pivot. Not many people wanted to strap a VR headset to their face to play bad games. But plenty of folks, including kids, are far more likely to hop into <em>Horizon Worlds</em> if it’s just a phone game they can hop into on a device they already own. Early testing proved that. When you consider that <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-the-video-game-industry-is-dying-2000671338">Roblox is one of the few parts of the game industry that is growing rapidly</a> and making tons of money, it makes sense that Meta would decide to take its bad VR Roblox clone, rip out the VR part, and hope to find success as a slop generator for kids.</p>

 <p>As for what this means for the future of virtual reality at Meta, the company claims it isn’t going anywhere. It says it has more VR hardware in development and plans to invest more in third-party VR devs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-game-quest-vr-facebook-deadpool-sanzaru-twisted-pixel-layoffs-2000659376">But after the company sliced up its VR game studios last month</a>, well, it’s clear that if VR sticks around, it won’t be a main focus anymore at Meta. <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/meta/2025/meta-to-invest-600-billion-to-build-ai-data-centers-in-us/">Instead, the company is focused on AI. For now</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528">Slay the Spire 2</a> will feature co-op play for up to 4 players.</p>



<p>Slay the Spire 2, the follow-up to the game that built the modern roguelike deckbuilder genre, is slated to enter Early Access in March 2026 on Steam. The new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2868840/Slay_the_Spire_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game description</a> not only teases expanded lore and new characters but also confirms that the game will allow four players to play together with new multiplayer-specific cards, team synergies, and more.</p>



<p>“Brave the ascent on your own, or play with up to 4 players and face the Spire together in the all-new co-op mode. Discover multiplayer-specific cards, powerful team synergies, and carry your friends (or get carried) to victory!”</p>







<h2 id="h-slay-the-spire-2-was-prevously-delayed">Slay the Spire 2 Was Prevously Delayed</h2>



<p>Slay the Spire 2 was initially set to release in Early Access in late 2025. However, in September of last year, Mega Crit Studios announced they would delay the start of Early Access. The delay was attributed to adding more content and to the importance of emphasizing quality in development.</p>



<p>“Compared to Slay the Spire 1’s early access launch (and for that matter, its final 2.0 form), this new sequel has a lot more content that we can’t wait to share with you. In addition, we want to make sure we’re upholding the quality bar that both we and the gaming community have come to expect for Early Access titles,” the studio stated.</p>







<p>They also joked that the delay had nothing to do with the release of Hollow Knight: Silksong. While that may be true, the delayed release of Slay the Spire 2 caused brief concerns for the development team behind Omelet You Cook. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/omelet-you-cook-devs-fear-slay-the-spire-2-will-steal-spotlight/" id="172827">The team previously joked</a> that they were nervous about competing against the game that defined the genre, but that game currently has overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.</p>
