            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A <a href="https://kotaku.com/league-legends-riot-games-worlds-23-interview-1851071665"><em>League of Legends</em></a> player who claimed to have built a career around boosting accounts and selling them replied angrily on social media to a developer at Riot Games. He was worried about how he would make money now. The dev’s response was a link to McDonalds’ careers page.</p> <p>On August 11, <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-banning-bots-boosters-and-more-in-2025/?_gl=1*dgamq1*_gcl_au*MTU3NTAxOTczNy4xNzU0OTQ2Nzkw*_ga*MTM2MDIzODkzMS4xNzU0OTQ2Nzkw*_ga_FXBJE5DEDD*czE3NTQ5NDY3OTAkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTQ5NDY3OTEkajU5JGwwJGgw">Riot Games announced plans</a>&nbsp;to ramp up its efforts to fight back against smurf and alt account misuse in <em>League of Legends,</em> one of the biggest MOBAs on the planet. These new plans include banning and punishing people who grind on accounts owned by other players, boosting their rank in the process, and charging a fee for doing so. These services have <a href="https://insaneboost.gg/">become quite common online.</a> Even <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">Elon Musk admitted to using one such service</a> in <em>Path of Exile II.</em> But Riot is cracking down and banning accounts associated with the practice. These changes will begin in <em>LoL</em> update 25.18 and will likely lead to players being far more cautious about paying others to boost their rank in<em> League of Legends</em>. That will lead to fewer customers for those offering such “services,” and one of these people wasn’t happy about that news.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://x.com/cat1_alex/status/1954924168245358742?">Twitter user SLS replied to Riot’s Director of Product Drew Levin</a>, and explained that their “main income” comes primarily from boosting other players’ accounts in <em>League of Legends</em>. They also coach players in the free-to-play MOBA, but admitted that this only earned them about 15 percent of what they make boosting in a month. They wrapped up their comment with: “What I do after? [sic] Just chill at McDonald’s?” Levin reshared the post and included a link to McDonald’s careers page, seemingly joking that it was time for SLS to find a new job.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/Ku080U0fB4">https://t.co/Ku080U0fB4</a> <a href="https://t.co/7JgyjgOpJF">https://t.co/7JgyjgOpJF</a></p> <p>— Drew Levin (@drewlevin) <a href="https://twitter.com/drewlevin/status/1954931160469114915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Bro, you do understand that you have built a business off of ruining other people’s games, right?” <a href="https://x.com/drewlevin/status/1954926308049494207">replied Levin</a>. “[I] have no desire to preserve that at the expense of whatever lobbies you’re boosting accounts through.”</p> <p>When SLS replied to that message with a complaint that the boosting industry wasn’t hurting the game and that boosters take specific orders related to very high ranks, Levin replied again, this time pointing out how absurd it was that SLS was describing breaking how the game ranks players as an “industry.”</p> <p>“‘The industry?’ ‘Taking orders?’ Bro you are paid to trick our skill evaluation systems, and you are talking to the person leading the effort to improve their integrity,” <a href="https://x.com/drewlevin/status/1954930709510168878">said Levin on social media</a>.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Riot Games about the response.</p> <p>While some players who relied on boosting or liked smurfing–which is when a high-level player creates a new account to use their skills against low-level players–were upset about the changes, the vast majority of the replies to Levin were happy to hear Riot Games was taking alt account abuse seriously in 2025. Of course, it remains to be seen if Riot Games can actually weed out all the boosters and smurf accounts from <em>League of Legends</em> and how quickly people find ways around their new efforts.</p> <p>Also, it should be noted that working at McDonald’s, like any other fast food joint, is a very hard job that requires incredible amounts of patience and stamina. It would be nice if we could all stop acting like people who work at these places are lazy teens working a summer job for beer money or whatever. If that cultural shift were to happen, perhaps they’d have a better shot at getting paid more. And don’t you think the people making your food deserve more money? I do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh no, the latest World of Warcraft patch has us teaming up with an evil cosmic void being who has tried to kill us many times already and will <em>definitely</em> stab us in the back later...but we're all kind of okay with it? Partially because we have no choice but also because she's hot and sarcastic?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm talking about Xal'atath. You know, this lady. <strong>Heads up, I'm going to talk in this article about spoilers for World of Warcraft: The War Within leading up to the events in Patch 11.2, Ghosts of K'aresh that dropped last Tuesday.</strong> If you haven't started playing the patch yet and don't want to know what's happening, maybe don't keep reading.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/the-war-within-official-cinematic-shadows-beneath-world-of-warcraft-2-17-screenshot-1754926715062.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you're a lapsed World of Warcraft player, you might know this lady if you've dipped in as recently as World of Warcraft: Legion. Xal'atath first appeared in that expansion in the form of a dagger artifact weapon wielded by Shadow Priests, which would occasionally whisper creepy evil stuff to them about N'Zoth and the Old Gods and all that malarky. At the time, <em>some</em> folks grew rather fond of her unsettling whispers, even affectionately referring to her as "knaifu". The dagger, with the rest of the expansion's artifact weapons, was used to drain the corruption from the giant sword that Sargeras stuck in the planet at the end of the expansion. Normal stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we naively thought we wouldn't hear from Xal'atath ever again, what was once one weapon among a giant stack of them turned out to be hugely plot-relevant. Xal'atath was passed around from place to place in the interim expansions, finally regaining her power and emerging from the dagger in the form of a void-infused high elf, all the better to corrupt people with. She bopped around Azeroth for a while, manipulating the underground giant bug people and some dragons before she finally made herself known as something called the "Harbinger of Dimensius," basically a herald of a super powerful void lord bent on destroying reality. Again, normal stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the start of our current expansion, The War Within, Xal'atath appears to be the main villain. She opens the expansion by causing the destruction of Dalaran (again), and she's responsible for the events that lead us to fighting both the Nerubians and the goblin Gallywix. She's spent a lot of time popping up here and there and taunting our ally Alleria Windrunner, she nearly kills Khadgar, and she's obsessed with this void artifact she's been carrying around called the Dark Heart, which she keeps using to corrupt and empower and manipulate. All of this is to say, she seems pretty evil to me! She serves the void and is clearly very interested in destroying us, our buddies, and probably all of Azeroth! Nothing she has done so far seems good, at all!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>And yet.</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In patch 11.2, Xal'atath <em>joins us.</em> The short explanation is that she actually betrayed Dimensius in the past, but he's coming back, and he's probably pissed off at her. If he shows up, she's done for. Out of a sense of self-preservation, she's been trying to beef up the Dark Heart to <em>stop</em> his return rather than accelerate it, and was messing around with the Nerubians and the Goblins in an effort to get that done. But at the end of patch 11.1, she accidentally (and sort of stupidly) loses the Dark Heart, forcing her to team up with Alleria and the player as a back-up plan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this actually means, in practice, is that Xal'atath follows us around while questing and occasionally proposes we do things that sound horrible and dangerous, like turn ourselves into an energy being and fill someone with void energy so they can hear the planet sing to them (normal stuff!). But, you know, we can't stop Dimensius without her. She knows his weaknesses, and is pretty much the only path to getting close enough to him to do something about his encroachment. So the murdery knife-elf gets to come along.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/capture-1754938789710.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkdb1y/tone_matters_magni/">https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkdb1y/tone_matters_magni/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing is, Blizzard has done such a lovely job writing Xal'atath, and Claudia Christian does such a great job voicing her, that most players are...kind of enjoying her presence. The first few days of the new patch last week saw the community subreddit flooded with cheeky, obsessive posts about Xal'atath. Sure, she's evil, but apart from being gorgeous, she's also clever, funny, powerful, and dare I say, kind of sultry? Her banter with the player is almost flirtateous at times, referring to us again and again as "my champion", while simultaneously reminding us that she could snuff us out on a whim. She spends a <em>lot</em> of time needling Alleria Windrunner and, as the ever-wise Ve'nari puts it, "floating around and making sarcastic remarks." And irritatingly enough, she's also correct a lot of the time about the behaviors and motivations of the other people who claim to be Alleria's allies (looking at you, Locus-Walker) and the ways in which they aren't exactly behaving righteously, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Love for Xal'atath has reached such a point that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkv7jh/mommy_xalatath_addon/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">someone even made a mod (add-on) for World of Warcraft</a> that has Xal'atath whisper praise to the player every time they exit a combat scenario...though notably in these messages, Xal'atath refers to herself as "mommy". So download that at your own risk, I guess.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this lady is <em>definitely</em> going to turn on us. And while plenty of players are enjoying the twist of her temporary allegiance and the opportunity to get to know her a little better, others are (rightfully!) recognizing that Xal'atath is definitely a hot mess we're going to regret partying with sooner or later:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/capture-1754939255090.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj3014/the_story_so_far/">https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj3014/the_story_so_far/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an interesting move by Blizzard to build Xal'atath up for, technically, five expansions, introduce her as the <em>seemingly</em> big bad of this one, only to form an alliance of convenience in the final act of The War Within with the promise that she's definitely going to keep on being evil in future expansions. With Xal'atath's dark and void theming, it seems likely she might play a major role in the next expansion, Midnight, which will be fully revealed at Gamescom in just a few weeks. The long game Blizzard's playing here is especially potent given that some of its other storylines that similar took several expansions of setup did not go over so well, such as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23015539/world-of-warcraft-sylvanas-windrunner-story-explainer-battle-for-azeroth-shadowlands-novel/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whatever was going on with Sylvanas and the Jailer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, trust Knaifu at your own risk, and enjoy her while you can. Manaforge Omega, the new raid, opens tomorrow and will bring with it another chapter of The War Within's story as we inch closer to the Midnight reveal and what I can only assume is Xal'atath's inevitable re-betrayal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a> features dozens of different celebrations that your players can perform after making a big play on the field. From scoring a touchdown to recording an interception to just making a first down, you'll be able to celebrate quite often during a game. However, you first have to know what buttons to press to be able to celebrate and which celebrations you have access to, depending on what kind of play you made.</p><p>Below, we'll go over all of the available celebrations in Madden 26, how to perform them, and when you can perform each one.</p><h2>How to perform celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Before we get into each celebration offered in Madden 26, how do you perform one after you make a big play? Fortunately, it's fairly simple.</p><p>After you score a touchdown, intercept a pass, or make a first down, look at the bottom left corner of your screen. You'll see a "Celebrate" icon appear, and you can press a specific button combination after it appears to perform a celebration. You want to make sure you press the celebration buttons quickly, though, as the icon doesn't stay on the screen for too long.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548149" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548149"></a><figcaption>The Celebration icon appears in the bottom-left corner of the screen</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg"></figure><p>Once the icon disappears, your celebration window has passed, and you'll have to wait for the next big play to celebrate.</p><h2>All celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Now that you know what to look for before you celebrate, let's go over all of the celebrations and the buttons to press to perform each one.</p><p>As we mentioned before, you can celebrate after scoring a touchdown, intercepting a pass, or making a first down. There are specific celebrations you can perform after each of these big plays. This means you can only use certain celebrations after scoring a touchdown, and those celebrations aren't available after intercepting a pass or making a first down.</p><p>All three of the big play types in Madden 26 have their own celebrations with unique button combinations, so you have to remember which celebrations correlate with each play. You'll also have to remember the buttons to press to perform the celebration you want.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548150" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548150"></a><figcaption>Some of the TD celebrations in Madden 26</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg"></figure><p>Below, we've separated the different categories of celebrations and listed the button combinations for each one in Madden 26:</p><p><strong>All Touchdown celebrations </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Point to Fans</td><td>Right Stick (RS) Up</td></tr><tr><td>Step Back on Em</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Griddy</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Salute</td><td>RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Reach Low Flex</td><td>L2/LT + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Shake With It</td><td>L2/LT + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Wavy Walk</td><td>L2/LT + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>He's a Dawg</td><td><p>L2/LT + RS Left</p></td></tr><tr><td>Stand on Biz</td><td>L1/LB + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Afterburners</td><td>L1/LB + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Spike</td><td>L1/LB + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Two-Step Shuffle</td><td>L1/LB + RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Headstand</td><td>R2/RT + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Run Up Flex</td><td>R2/RT + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Fancy Flip</td><td><p>R2/RT + RS Down</p></td></tr><tr><td>All Together Now</td><td>R2/RT + RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Candy Karate</td><td>R1/RB + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Wait For It</td><td>R1/RB + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Shake Em Up</td><td>R1/RB + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>At the Y</td><td>R1/RB + RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>All Interception celebrations</strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wave Goodbye</td><td>RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Why You Throwing My Way</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Strapped</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Head Swag</td><td>RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>All First Down celebrations </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Signal It</td><td>RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Touch Em Up</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Jacked</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Shake It Off</td><td>RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can view all of these celebrations by pressing pause during the middle of a game or training session and selecting the "Celebrations" tab.</p><h2>How to perform Hot Spot Celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Finally, Madden 26 has also introduced Hot Spot Celebrations, which give you more freedom in how your player celebrates after a touchdown.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548151" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548151"></a><figcaption>Performing a touchdown celebration</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg"></figure><p>Hot Spot Celebrations work by giving you time to move your player after they've scored a touchdown. During this time, you can move your player to certain parts of the endzone to have them interact with specific elements of the field. There are a few different zones throughout the endzone, and moving to each zone will result in a new celebration.</p><p>For example, running to the field goal post will make your player interact with it, while running to one side of the endzone sees your player get the crowd involved. You only have a few seconds to move your player after they've scored a touchdown if you want to use a Hot Spot Celebration, so make your movements count.</p>

              <p>OpenAI launched its long-awaited <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/">AI update, GPT-5,</a> on August 7. It made lofty promises like “PhD‑level intelligence.” But within 24 hours, the tool’s most devoted users were cataloging its many bugs, errors, and shortcomings on Reddit. The ChatGPT fandom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkobei/openai_just_pulled_the_biggest_baitandswitch_in/">started melting down</a>. CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1953893841381273969">responded</a> by promising to let customers start using the older GPT models again. By August 11, Altman was in <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1954703747495649670">full screencap apology</a> mode trying to cauterize the flow of bad vibes.</p> <p>“If you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models,” he posted on X earlier today. “It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology (and so suddenly deprecating old models that users depended on in their workflows was a mistake).”</p> <p>The tenor of this self-inflicted debacle should be familiar to anyone who’s played <em>Destin</em>y, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, or dozens of other online multiplayer games. It’s the same mix of developer hubris, corporate profit motive, hyper fandom, and “<a href="https://x.com/dril/status/660644922744262656?lang=en">Sorry. Im sorry. Im trying to remove it</a>.” An upcoming expansion is sold with lofty promises. It arrives full of half-baked ideas and stealth nerfs. Players encounter a surprising number of bugs. Meanwhile the prices in the microtransaction shop are going up and the places where you can earn rewards for free are disappearing.</p>

 <p>“This guy communicates in a way that is indistinguishable from a community manager of a live service video game having a botched expansion release,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/catharsis23.bsky.social/post/3lw5jvotgfk2s">wrote</a> one Bluesky user in response. “Seems kind of humiliating.” Vocal AI critic Ed Zitron, who pegged GPT-5 as <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittification-of-generative-ai/">generative AI’s enshittification moment</a>, was more direct. “This is the ultimate folly of OpenAI: they engaged gamer-like hype, got gamer-like fandom, and now face the wrath of gamer-like hate,” he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edzitron.com/post/3lw5k3nkztc2r">wrote</a> today.</p> <p>The GTP-5 fiasco <a href="https://gizmodo.com/it-took-just-24-hours-of-complaints-for-openai-to-start-bringing-back-its-old-model-2000640912">revolved around a few main issues</a>. While it was promised as another big leap in the model’s capabilities, what really seemed to be going on was that it was just routing queries to lots of different models to save time and money. There was also a very limiting cap on the number of queries users outside of the most expensive plans could make each week. Finally, there was the disappearances of GPT-4o, one of OpenAI’s most popular models which also <a href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/">had a reputation for being</a> “sycophantic.”</p> <p>“ChatGPT psychosis” is one of the biggest concerns with the billion-dollar cash-burning enterprise right now. Chat bots can suck users into “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html">delusional spirals</a>” with them. People are reportedly being <a href="https://futurism.com/commitment-jail-chatgpt-psychosis">involuntarily committed or jailed</a> after becoming obsessed with their GPT interactions. One guy thought he had trained his AI to become self-aware and that <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/">it was talking to God for him</a>.</p>

 <p>Altman clearly thinks this aspect of ChatGPT can be harmful in the wrong hands. But many of the people currently paying for ChatGPT also clearly prefer it. And he’s spent so long packaging OpenAI’s platform-shift moonshot as a grand cosmic journey everyone’s on together that dialing down the snake oil is no longer an option. After years of hyping AGI (artificial general intelligence), Altman told Wall Street last week that it’s actually “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/sam-altman-says-agi-is-a-pointless-term-experts-agree.html?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=689a05a3778386000185beda&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky">not a super useful term</a>.”</p> <p>This is the part in the live-service hype cycle where studios usually go from talking about how their game is completely transformative and unlike anything else you’ve ever played before to offering very in-the-weeds explanations of why patch notes that are impossible for outsiders to parse will overhaul the game into the best version of the thing you already love. The players, who have invested not just their money and free time but also no small chunk of their identity in how your product makes them feel will now become like the dinosaurs at Jurassic Park. They are not trapped in your hyper-complex, infinitely monetizable skinner box. You are trapped in whatever they insist on perverting it into. Even if that’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/i-feel-like-im-going-crazy-chatgpt-fuels-delusional-spirals-ae5a51fc?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiqx4e9RsfPVEG8-vSVaF26bdgC8kiLYXSykv1hX5M3kzc2lNInkty8wQyYn5o%3D&amp;gaa_ts=689a6287&amp;gaa_sig=w891GxyjybddGBhS316rMpTsfH3domwnKveQDIM4DMGXW47JE1c4U4x30cETuWVawzdNGNzebYIZi-hOBA5Rcw%3D%3D">an expensive rabbit hole full of apocalyptic conspiracies</a>.</p>

                <p>From the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises to the 2K sports titles, Take-Two Interactive has some of the most-desirable games in the industry. However, the company has largely kept its marquee titles away from Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. Now, Take-Two President Karl Slatoff has explained why the company hasn't embraced lending more of its games to subscription services.</p><p>"We do put our titles occasionally into some of the subscription services," Slatoff said earlier this month during a Take-Two investor call (via <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/08/07/take-two-ttwo-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Motley Fool</a>). "They're great partners for us. And in many cases, they're great ... We wouldn't do it unless it was a good economic deal. The platforms wouldn't do it either. So we do take advantage of that, and it's been compelling much from an economic standpoint. As it relates to NBA, we have done it in the past. We don't really talk about whether we're gonna do anything in the future. But when you do put something into a channel like that, it generates obviously, engagement. It generates income for us. And it's something that we consider, and we do it if the time is right, if the math makes sense."</p><p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has previously weighed in on the subject by stating that it doesn't make sense <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-want-new-games-on-game-pass/1100-6494686/" data-ref-id="1100-6494686">to put any of the company's new titles on Game Pass or PS Plus</a>. He also said that high-profile day-one games like Call of Duty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">will only drive up Game Pass subscriptions for a short period of time</a>.</p><p>Raccoon Logic studio head Alex Hutchinson recently argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-who-launched-game-into-game-pass-warns-against-launching-games-into-game-pass/1100-6532306/" data-ref-id="1100-6532306">launching titles day one on Game Pass can devalue games</a> and hurt the industry. Hutchinson has first-hand experience with the subject: Raccoon Logic launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/revenge-of-the-savage-planet/" data-ref-id="5000-640444">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> as a day one title earlier this year, and the company didn't get the response it hoped for.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-anime-critics-at-ign-navigate-the-complex-score-obsessed-discourse.1267494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><figure><figcaption><span>IGN/David Production/Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure></p></div><div><p>Colloquially, an IGN review has become more than just a critique—it’s a meme, a lightning rod for online discourse, and a battleground. This is especially true in the anime space, where numerical scores are treated less as subjective assessments and more like declarations of war, with fandoms accusing them of rage engagement clicks.&nbsp;</p><p>For the critics who decide these scores, the backlash often spills into their mentions and DMs on social media platforms. In 2025, reviewing anime isn’t just about evaluating a show’s artistic merit; it’s about weighing whether a writer can survive the fallout of a fandom’s fury should a show’s premiere and season finale not vibe with them. I spoke with stalwart IGN freelance reviewers <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/rgmotamayor/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rafael Motamayor</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/SiddhantAdlakha/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siddhant Adlakha</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/kircarey/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirsten Carey</a> to debunk misconceptions about reviews of popular anime and animated works for one of gaming’s biggest publications.&nbsp;</p><h2>What makes a 10/10 anime?</h2><p>IGN is quite transparent about the criteria that determine its numerical scores. The site has <a href="https://corp.ign.com/review-practices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">examples of its review scale</a> and what qualifies a video game, TV show, or movie as unbearable, painful, awful, bad, mediocre, okay, good, great, amazing, or a masterpiece. Since the scores range from one to 10, people online often compare them to school grades out of 100, where a seven—commonly joked about as a typical pub score—is seen as a C-grade, failing to realize it still indicates a good rating.&nbsp;</p><p>Other readers have taken it upon themselves to use the rubric to compare IGN’s scores to each other, aiming to determine whether one work is better than another. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/ddwqbj/ign_has_never_rated_a_mystery_dungeon_game_above/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most popular meme </a>involves people comparing new reviews to <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/most-hated-game-imagine-party-babyz-meme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN’s score for <em>Imagine Party Babyz</em></a>.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It’s also difficult to give something a 10 that isn’t over.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Contrary to the idea that IGN randomly selects writers to review superhero shows and anime, writers must pitch to IGN’s editor, explaining their expertise and familiarity with the medium or source material, to let editors know their critique comes from an informed place.</p><p>I asked Motamayor, Adlakha, and Carey what they look for in the rarely awarded masterpiece, or 10, IGN review score.&nbsp;</p><p>“Whether or not it accomplishes what the show is trying to do from the beginning,” Motamayor said. “Different shows are trying to do different things. Not every show is trying to be serious, dramatic, [or] epic. But whether or not the goal of the show is&nbsp; accomplished and whether or not it does something unique for the tone, genre, or the space in which the show occupies.”</p><p>“For me, it’s a combination of how ambitious something is versus how well it executes that ambition,” Adlakha said. “If a particular episode has a high bar for what it’s going for—whether it’s visually, emotionally, or thematically—and if it’s able to stir up emotions in a successful way using the tools of the medium, that for me makes it a successful episode.”</p><p>“A 10 out of 10 anime would be gorgeously animated, and this is my own bias, preferably 2D animation, and if it’s CG, <em>Spider-Verse</em> levels with immaculate artistic choices with a good story, characters,” Carey said. “No weird sexism or anti-LGBTQ stuff happening that makes little flags go up in my brain. The difference between a nine and a 10, for lack of a better word, is an X factor. When people look back on that review 10 years from now, if the internet is still around, that will age well.”</p><p>Save for the final season of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/attack-on-titan-series-finale-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Attack on Titan</em></a>, which Motamayor reviewed, contemporary anime has yet to get a masterpiece, or 10, rating.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s also difficult to give something a 10 that isn’t over,” Carey said. “Most anime coming out right now, you’re just reviewing the first couple of episodes. How can you give the beginning of something a 10 unless it's the most incredible opening to a thing you’ve ever seen? I guess I would give the first episode of <em>Attack on Titan</em> a 10 because that’s an iconic hook. But it’s tough to give the beginning of a thing, or an unfinished thing, a perfect score because we don’t know how it’s gonna end.”</p><p>IGN is often misperceived as a hegemonic entity when it comes to its numerical review scores, especially in the anime genre, rather than focusing on individual reviewers with varying tastes. While using a numerical score is, for better or worse, a convenient summary and a core part of <a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/ign-review-tees?srsltid=AfmBOooTf0jAEjS9bFZHJap628H--WUgDG5rLi8yNgfQMR1AhEO6K0XY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN’s identity</a> as a media outlet, reviewers are divided on their opinions of these scores and whether they capture or oversimplify the nuances of an anime.&nbsp;</p><p>“I start by figuring out the number, and then write the review in a way to justify it. That helps me structure things,” Carey said. “The way that I worry about it flattening is if the number review is gonna make it seem like I like [a show] less than I do. Even if something is a six, that’s still ‘Okay.’ I enjoy the structure of how the number comes at the end, so you’re working up to the reveal, even though I know a lot of people who just scroll down to see what the number is. I’ve done that on other people’s reviews.”</p><p>“I have mixed feelings on numerical scores because I think on one hand they can be a representative shorthand of what someone feels about something that can be a helpful guide,” Adlakha said. “But I think the way it’s interpreted a lot of the time—whether it’s a score out of 10 or five stars on a film-centric website, I think people see that as the end-all of criticism. [Readers will] look at what the score is and not even read what you’ve written and treat it as an attempt at objectivity, and then they tend to clash with you on that.”</p><p>“I do not like numerical scores at all,” Motamayor said. “It definitely boils [a review] down. It makes it a shortcut for people to just read a score and ignore everything else.”</p><p>Granted, IGN provides numerous ways for readers to access short versions of reviews, accompanied by verdicts and blurbs that characterize its numerical rating, but even still, Motamayor finds that people “just ignore that and go straight for the score.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Charlie Goes Into An IGN Anime Review Rabbit Hole | MoistCr1tikal" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dAGvgWGJuCY?start=434&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Adlakha pointed out that readers often blame a single reviewer as the scapegoat for poor reviews of shows whenever online discussions become heated. In their frustration, audiences frequently overlook that their “this you” quote retweets of recent IGN reviews come from completely different reviewers. Even when confronted with this, some audiences will counter, believing that IGN has a mandate from on high dictating reviews be contrarian.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I’ve received gore for not liking one episode of a show.</p></blockquote></figure><p>This misperception appears to stem from an idea about how YouTube works, where a positive or negative review depends on whether the creator's check clears, implying that it is akin to a paid advertisement. This assumption ignores the fact that review writers are paid a <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fixed rate</a> regardless of whether the review is positive or negative.&nbsp;</p><p>“The idea that there are [pay difference between a positive or negative review] is straight up conspiratorial, and it's such a prevalent thing when it comes to the mistrust of critics and journalism at large that I don't really know what to do about it,” Adlakha said. “Even addressing it seems to lead to even more pushback, but it's also one of many conspiratorial accusations.”</p><p>“People have told me ‘You're just trying to be contrarian,’ but usually when I review something, there is no overarching opinion for me to be contrarian towards. There is no public opinion. There's no critical opinion just yet because usually the stuff is reviewed in advance,” Adlakha continued. “Even if I have these amazing psychic powers to predict what the public opinion on something is going to be, being contrarian in that sense would just lead to me being harassed nonstop, which has happened many, many times over reviews. Being intentionally contrarian has no advantages for me, and I don't know what people think [negative reviews] do.”</p><figure><figcaption>Demon Slayer<span></span><span>ufotable</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Rocking the fandom boat</h2><p>Writing reviews for highly anticipated anime often sparks controversy when a critique doesn't portray a beloved source material’s adaptation positively for fans. This is especially true in shonen anime and superhero shows. IGN’s tendency to exclusively cover big-name anime in a given season—all typically shonen—also comes with more eyes on its anime coverage as well as more scrutiny from audience expectations of a writer reviewing one of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-harassment-comes-with-the-territory-of-translating-popular-manga-2000556430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anime’s most popular (and toxic) genres</a>. Although Adlakha reviews superhero and superhero animated shows, he encounters a similar phenomenon with backlash on his reviews for popular shows, similar to what Carey and Motamayor experience with their reviews of popular shonen anime.</p><p>“It’s fine to have an opinion that runs counter to what a critic is saying, but in the particular case of superhero stuff, especially superhero animated stuff, it’s people who will track you down on any and every possible social media—including LinkedIn—and will just send you the nastiest stuff unprompted,” Adlakha said. “I’ve received gore for not liking one episode of a show. It tends to get really uncomfortable.”&nbsp;</p><p>The writers I talked to have become public enemies in IGN readership circles for writing less favorable reviews, which consistently make them the main characters of anime Twitter discourse for several days after their reviews are published. Adlakha and Motamayor are more infamous within IGN’s pool of freelance critics whenever they appear on IGN’s masthead because of their past review scores for popular series like <em>Demon</em> <em>Slayer</em>, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>, and <em>Invincible</em>. For clarity, Motamayor rated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/demon-slayer-season-4-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Demon Slayer</em> Season 4</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jujutsu-kaisen-season-2-part-2-review-shibuya-incident-arc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> Shibuya Incident Arc</a> a four and a six, respectively. Meanwhile, Adlakha rated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-3-review-prime-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Invincible</em> Season 3</a> a seven.</p><p>“Specifically, when it comes to shonen anime, my reviews on<em> Demon Slayer</em>—and to be fair—you can <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/demon-slayer/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see my reviews going down with time</a> as, in my opinion, the show got progressively worse,” said Motamayor.</p><p>Just like how a series can fluctuate from season to season, the same can happen with its coverage—especially when different reviewers take the reins. That was the case with <em>Demon Slaye</em>r, which Carey initially reviewed at the beginning of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-to-the-hashira-training-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hashira Arc</a> before Motamayor stepped in.</p><p>“I disagree hard with the final review, which goes against anyone thinking that IGN reviewers are a monolith,” Carey said.</p><p>“There is a tendency, specifically with IGN, to generalize not only a reviewer's opinion based on a single review but the entire website and the entire staff as a singular mindset or opinion,” Motamayor said. “In my case, when things like my <em>Demon Slayer</em> review become a point of discourse among certain groups, then they start looking at my reviews to prove their point. Other than those specific cases, ideals seem to be generalizing IGN as a single entity.”</p><p>“It comes down to people seeing a score and then working backwards from there as to what your opinion might be or what your intentions might be without actually reading what you have to say. There’s not much I can do about that if someone’s unwilling to engage with what I’m saying in good faith,” Adlakha said.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Attack on Titan<span></span><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p>Adlakha compared the phenomenon to a kind of cult within the readership that would message him about qualifying a show with a seven or eight IGN score as a “meme score.”</p><p>“I’m not gonna unpack what that means,” Adlakha said. “You live in your own world where a number out of 10 tells you something more than just what someone’s opinion might be. I think it’s gone to this almost fringe point. I can’t even begin to reverse engineer what any of it might mean,” Adlakha said. “It’s like the GIF of Donald Glover in <em>Community </em>walking into that room that’s on fire. It feels like I’ve walked into something that there’s some kind of ongoing conversation within this in-group who, through confirmation bias, convinced themselves that reviews on IGN are specifically designed to piss them off. If they’ve collectively decided that nothing I say is going to penetrate that, then I don’t see a point in engaging with it.”</p><p>Much of the discourse backlash that comes Motamayor’s way comes from manga readers rather than anime watchers. “I don’t want to generalize all anime fans, but a lot of the louder commenters, specifically on IGN’s website and social media, very much focus on a show being good because of the source material,” Motamayor said. Although many commenters end up agreeing with what Motamayor might say in a review, especially on points he’s less enthusiastic about, like fights in <em>JJK</em> being too long and convoluted, they eventually return to the consensus that he’s wrong because the anime and manga are popular.</p><p>“A lot of the engagement seems to be based on reputation rather than the actual artistic value of a show or a movie,” Motamayor said. “Another big part of it is boiling down the show to the fight scenes. If a reviewer finds issues with things other than the fight scenes, it doesn’t matter because the fight scenes, in some anime fans’ opinions, are the only thing that matters.”</p><div><p>Because of this shonen rule of cool, Motamayor says some groups of viewers can excuse almost anything in a critique, but once the focus shifts to an anime’s action—and the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/netflix-animation-anime-interview-power-house-sam-deats-adam-deats-david-how-2000517324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difference between special effects compositing and animation</a>—readers tend to have issues with reviewers. That or they assume a reviewer doesn’t understand the subject because they didn’t read the source material—another odd sticking point for anime, which reviewers either avoid mentioning in their reviews (because they’re not reviewing the source material) or emphasize because they also read the manga and comics.</p><p>“Even if I have read it, I don’t normally mention the source material in my reviews unless it’s a big part of something specifically worth mentioning,” Motamayor said. “Otherwise, I’m not reviewing a manga [because] you’re watching a show.”</p></div><p>“For me, it helps because it’s about striking a balance in a review, looking at something as both an adaptation and as its own thing,” Adlakha said. “Of course, some people might be looking for complete fidelity to the story and the structure, but for me that’s not what adaptation is all about, especially in an animated medium where you can use things like movement, rhythm, and music to enhance or subvert things that were already done in the source material.”</p><p>When hate comments appear, reviewers say IGN mainly steps in if they’re extremely vitriolic by moderating the comments section on its website. Still, because reviews are blasted onto social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, it’s unfortunate but common for reviewers to go no-contact on social media or block people for uncharitable responses.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It’s the actual critique in the conversation that is far more important. </p></blockquote></figure><p>While neither of the three have considered walking away from anime review writing because of online discourse, they have weighed whether it is worth putting up with the backlash that spills outside of IGN’s moderation onto their personal social media.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have considered whether there is enough of an upside if the downside is being harassed for weeks and months on end across every single social media place that I am available online—email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, BlueSky, Threads, LinkedIn—all at once, sending not just insults but death threats,” Adlakha said. “I have to consider whether this is worth it from a mental health standpoint. I haven’t gone to the extent of walking away, but the thought has come up.”</p><p>“The zeroing in on IGN numerical scores comes from the effect that the internet is having on our brain, that we have shorter attention spans.

I feel it’s almost less of an issue with IGN and more of an issue with how social media is training us to think. I would love to write reviews where I don’t have to assign a thing and just talk about something, but increasingly few outlets are allowed to do that.”</p><figure><figcaption>Jujutsu Kaisen<span></span><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Hype-driven online culture be damned; traditional criticism is still essential&nbsp;</h2><p>In the New Yorker’s “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-lede/in-defense-of-the-traditional-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Defense of the Traditional Review</a>,” writer Richard Brody quoted Pauline Kael’s 1971 article<em> “</em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1971/01/23/notes-on-heart-and-mind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Notes on Heart and Mind</a>,” in which she writes that “Without a few independent critics, there’s nothing between the public and the advertisers.” Brody’s use of the quote highlighted his argument that traditional reviews serve as an essential buffer between audiences and commercial influence, preserving artistic integrity and encouraging informed engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of anime reviews, the buffer of traditional review writing is as crucial as in any other medium. In a media landscape increasingly molded by algorithmic promotion, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/new-media-circuit-hollywood-publicity.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influencer culture supplanting press interviews</a>, criticism that engages and challenges should be valued. This level of scrutiny can keep conversation alive and help a medium evolve. Review writing that risks discomfort for fandoms and creatives alike is far more valuable than one that reads like a press release angling for a back-of-the-box quote or an accolade trailer shout-out.</p><p>While the hate comments and baggage that come with being an IGN anime reviewer haven't deterred Motamayor, Carey, or Alaksha from continuing to work for the publication, that doesn’t mean IGN as an institution doesn’t have room to grow in legitimizing anime reviews within the mainstream. Motamayor suggested IGN and traditional media coverage as a whole should expand its anime coverage beyond shonen-centric content as a way to make reviews of action-oriented shows less of a polarizing echo chamber and to highlight shows that aren’t solely focused on power levels and aura farming.&nbsp;</p><p>“My dream world would be one where IGN is reviewing enough anime consistently, where the big show, and specifically the reviewer writing about the big show, is not seen as representative of their whole career or the entire website's reputation. As it is now, the fact that we are mostly just running about the big shows makes it so that the reviews can be boiled down to ‘what, do you not like shonen anime in general, because of one show you didn’t like?’ Or ‘I guess they like writing negative reviews for the engagement.’”</p><p>In addition to expanding what kind of anime the site covers, there’s also the question of review scores overshadowing the nuance of a critique.&nbsp;</p><p>“The prominence of scores, these numerical figures, tends to be very overemphasized because art is not something you can approach objectively. It’s not what criticism is about, “Adlakha said. “A score or a star rating can be a gateway to a deeper and more fulfilling criticism. But the intense focus on these things reduces what criticism is capable of and skews what the conversation around a piece of art even is in this very thumbs-up, thumbs-down sense. Art and our response to it is a little more complicated than just a yes or no, or a 7 or 8, because I don’t feel that strongly about the numbers themselves. It’s the actual critique in the conversation that is far more important. To only get messages and responses just about a number is like we’re having two completely different conversations.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions"><h3>Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop</h3></a><p>Forget The Lorax, kid; it's time for classic architecture</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-best-video-game-boats"><h3>Let’s Remember Some Good Video Game Boats</h3></a><p>"Assassin’s Creed is reinventing interest in sea shanties.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>For months now, rumors of a Lego <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars</em></a> Death Star set have been floating around Reddit, Instagram, and other places where Lego nerds (like myself) hang out. Now we finally have our first real look at the massive upcoming Lego set, and it seems to confirm the previous rumors, which also claimed the price for this 9,000+ piece set might be $1,000.</p> <p>I first heard about a massive <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867">Lego Death Star</a> set that could cost as much as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoStarWarsLeaks/comments/1lq9y5m/death_star/">$1,000 back in May</a>. At the time, the only supposed details that had leaked were its set number, piece count, October release date, and estimated price, as well as some tiny details on possible minifigs that would be included. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoStarWarsLeaks/comments/1kj36y8/my_speculation_and_analysis_on_the_1000_death/">There was also speculation</a> that it wouldn’t be a full orb, but instead a half-orb that would serve as more of a large diorama piece. Now some new leaked images seem to confirm many, but not all, of those previously rumored details.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1mm3ecd/75419_ucs_death_star_full_box_source/">On August&nbsp; 9, three photos</a> of what appears to be the (still officially unconfirmed) Lego Death Star set were shared on Reddit. The photos show the massive set’s equally massive box and confirm the previously leaked set number and piece count. Well, actually, the piece count of 9,023 is a few bricks more than what was leaked, but it’s close enough that I’m confident that the source of the details had advanced information.</p>

 <p>The new leak also confirms <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-season-2-review-discussion-so-good-1851777959"><em>Rogue One </em>and<em> Andor’s</em> Orson Krennic</a> is one of the many included minifigs. Others include Ben Kenobi, Luke Skywalker in his Stormtrooper disguise, R2-D2 and C-3PO, the Emperor, a bunch of Imperial higher-ups seen in <em>A New Hope</em>, and Darth Vader. Oh, and I think I spotted a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sim_Aloo">Sim Aloo</a> figure in the images included on the back of the box. (Though a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoStarWarsLeaks/comments/1m8ys0s/part_2_for_death_star_mini_figures/"><em>different</em> leak</a> simply refers to him as an “Imperial Dignitary.” Boo!)</p> <p>Of course, the big news from this leak is that if all these previously rumored and speculated details are accurate, then it’s very likely Lego is about to set <a href="https://www.brickeconomy.com/sets/top/most-expensive-lego-sets">a new record for the most expensive official Lego set ever.</a></p> <p>Currently, the highest retail price the toy company has ever placed on a single set is $850 for the very big Millennium Falcon. <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/millennium-falcon-75192">That 7,500+ piece set was released in 2017</a> and is still for sale as of August 2025. The rumored price point of $1,000 for the new <em>Star Wars</em> Death Star would shatter the old record. However, the new Death Star won’t break the biggest set record, which is held by the Eiffel Tower set released in 2022. It contains 10,001 pieces and costs $630.</p> <p>And if you’re curious, the old Death Star set released in 2016 cost $500. At the time that seemed like a lot, and it still is a lot of money in 2025 to most people. I can’t imagine how many people will be able to afford double that when the new set arrives in October, assuming the rumored price is accurate. <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">And as tariffs continue to be a growing problem</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">in the United States thanks to President Trump</a>, expect Lego sets and other toys to become more expensive, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Woochi the Wayfarer is a new single-player action-adventure game developed by LoreVault Studio, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-the-first-descendant-death-relives/">The First Descendent</a> developer, Nexon Games, signed on as its publisher. Similar to how <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> leaned on a famous Chinese story, Woochi the Wayfarer leans on a famous Korean story, as a press release reveals the game is a depiction of 'The Tale of Jeon Woochi,' a famous Korean novel.</p>



<p>Nexon Games and LoreVault Studio debuted a nearly two-and-a-half-minute cinematic trailer, which set up the grandeur that the Unreal Engine 5 game is certainly going for, but didn't provide any real insight into the gameplay or what the final product will look like when it arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future. A release date, or even a release window, was not provided.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Woochi the Wayfarer | Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHH6xQT2-dw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a press release, Nexon Games chief executive officer, Park Yong-hyun, said "<em>Woochi the Wayfarer will provide a fresh and unique play experience that is based on traditional Korean materials while also having an emotional resonance that anyone around the world can relate to. We plan to present a game that will appeal to gamers of all cultures, telling an amazing story that fully showcases Nexon Games' development capabilities and accumulated experience</em>."</p>



<p>The game's soundtrack is inspired by traditional Korean music and is being composed by Korean composer Jung Jae-il, whose work you might recognize from the film Parasite or the Netflix series, Squid Game.</p>



<p>Between the storytelling, the visuals, and the music, it'll be cool to see Korean culture on display in Woochi the Wayfarer. Hopefully, the game is able to stick the landing with its gameplay on top of what already seems to be a strong setting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A retail release of the Welcome to Night Vale RPG is on the way. After a successful <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-comes-to-backerkit-this-october" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Backerkit campaign</a>, Night Vale Presents and Renegade Game Studios will be bringing a box set of their licensed TTRPG to hobby shops this September.</p>

<h2>The <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> Retail Release Date</h2>

<p>In an official newsletter, Renegade Game Studios has confirmed that the <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> boxed set will be coming to retail stores on September 9. This is roughly one month after the game's Backerkit supporters have received their copies of the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-town-artwork.jpg?itok=1nxG-Dl- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-town-artwork.jpg?itok=vKUlZ-B- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the name implies, the RPG has players explore the titular desert town from the beloved podcast series. The podcast began in 2012 and has since become a multimedia property with vinyl records and book spin-offs. Given that its Backerkit campaign raised over half a million dollars, it is a series with a large, passionate fanbase.</p>

<p>The game contains the show's unique blend of surreal, absurd, and dark atmosphere alongside an expansive cast of characters. It uses a simplified version of Renegade's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/essence20-field-guide-to-action-adventure-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Essence20</a>&nbsp;RPG system, which has been used in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-beneath-helmet-review-herolife-balance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Power Rangers</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/transformers-enigma-of-combination-review-new-meaning-of-teamwork" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Transformers</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-review-changeling-mischief" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>My Little Pony</em></a> RPGs.</p>

<p>The <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> boxed set will contain the following:</p>

<ul><li>Complete rules for playing the game</li>
	<li>A Citizen's Guide for character creation, a Host's Guide to help you share strange tales in Night Vale, and a Visitor's Guide that helps flesh out the desert town</li>
	<li>The <em>Skeleton Gorge Incident</em>, a five-part mystery adventure that leads characters through different Night Vale locations including the Numbers Station and the Library</li>
	<li>Eight dice and a Welcome to Night Vale-themed Game Master Screen</li>
	<li>Eleven pregenerated character sheets to help bring new players to the game quickly</li>
	<li>Nine new Threats for the players to encounter in the town of Night Vale&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>The <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> box set will be sold at an MSRP of $65.</p>

<p>Today marks the anniversary of the N64 turn-based RPG, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/paper_mario">Paper Mario</a> — which is a pretty big deal, because that means the entire series is <em>also</em> celebrating its quarter-century anniversary. Feeling old yet?</p>
<p>Originally planned to be developed by Square — who previously teamed up with Nintendo to make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_rpg_legend_of_the_seven_stars">Super Mario RPG</a> on the SNES — Intelligent Systems took the helm for what became the first of many papercraft adventures for Mario. And for many, the original (or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Thousand-Year Door</a>) are the high watermark for the series.</p>
<p>Taking a leaf from Mario's previous RPG outing, Paper Mario uses similar reaction timing-based combat but, instead of a party of three, Mario only has one other companion join him both in battle and in the overworld.</p>

<p>Throughout the story, Mario has various different companions join his team, each with different skill sets. Each companion represents a different type of enemy within the Mario universe — fan favourite Lady Bow is a Boo, for example, while Sushie is a Cheep Cheep.</p>
<p>Those skills aren't exclusive to combat, as every character has an ability that Mario can use to explore. Goombario's skill is that he can tell you all about the location you're in. Parakarry, the Paratroopa, allows you to cross large gaps, and Sushie gives Mario the ability to swim.</p>
<p>The game also introduced Badges, equipable items that give Mario boosts, effects, and sometimes new moves.</p>
<p>Plus, don't forget that amazing magazine ad from before the game's release:</p>

<p>Much of Paper Mario's spirit and skills would carry on in The Thousand-Year Door, the GameCube sequel that got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">a remake on Switch in 2024</a>, but the series gradually moved away from traditional turn-based combat, experimenting with gameplay gimmicks beyond the standard RPG ones.</p>
<p>Still, the franchise wouldn't exist without the charming N64 original, which you can play on the N64 Nintendo Classics (formerly NSO) service if you have the Expansion Pack tier. The latest entry in the series is 2020's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_origami_king">The Origami King</a>, which is available on Switch - hopefully it'll get a Switch 2 upgrade at some point!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A small store in California was <a href="https://kotaku.com/card-shop-pokemon-robbed-100k-hammer-rare-cards-thief-1851786241">robbed earlier this month</a>, and the thieves focused primarily on taking thousands of dollars’ worth of Labubu dolls. The owner says this happened only two months after opening her shop.</p> <p><a href="https://abc7.com/post/thousands-dollars-worth-labubu-dolls-stolen-la-puente-resale-shop/17465366/">As reported by ABC7,</a> Joanna Avendano’s One Stop Sales, located in La Puente, California, was burglarized on August 6 at around 2:00 a.m. local time. The owner explained that she was hit with a “gut feeling” to check her phone and noticed there was motion and sound coming from the store’s surveillance camera. Nobody was supposed to be there at the time. It was clear at that point that the place was being robbed. Four masked suspects entered the store after smashing in a window and proceeded to grab over $30,000 worth of inventory.</p> <p>“There was a lot taken, maybe like around $30,000 or more of inventory,” Avendano told the outlet.”We worked so hard to get to this point, and for them to just come in and, like nothing, take it all away, it’s really bad.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Thieves ransack LA County resale shop for its Labubu dolls" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PUD3A0EDHo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>ABC7 reports that the suspects didn’t steal cash or high-end electronics in the store and instead focused on grabbing Labubu dolls and other collectible merchandise. Labubu dolls have become quite popular over the last year or so, thanks to TikTok and celebrities posting about the bizarre monster plushies with big eyes that come in various colors and designs.</p>

 <p>“I was watching everything, from when they got in, what they were taking,” said Avendano. “I was panicking because I was just…I couldn’t do anything.”</p> <p>Avendano told ABC7 that she believes the robbery was planned, explaining that a suspicious truck was parked near her store as she closed up before the robbery. She also thinks the thieves were watching the shop’s social media posts and were waiting for her to share news of a Labubu restock. The dolls are currently very hard to find as their popularity continues to grow, mostly pushed by the algorithm.</p> <p>In fact, it’s entirely possible you’ve never heard of these hard-to-find dolls, and if so, you aren’t alone. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-11/tiktok-trends-are-driving-random-consumer-spending-spikes">As reported by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, many younger people are posting on TikTok about how many odd trends have gone viral recently, including Labubu, and how confusing it’s all becoming. It almost feels like these trends aren’t coming about organically, but instead are a symptom of pop culture becoming dominated by dopamine hits and corporate-controlled algorithms. Monoculture is dead and its replacement sucks.</p> <p>On August 8, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNFH1hTOOKV/?hl=en">Avendano shared a post on Instagram</a> claiming that police had recovered some of her stolen goods, including some Labubu dolls. However, she and local law enforcement are still asking residents in the area to report anything they might know to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department City.</p> <p>——</p> <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department City of Industry substation is investigating the burglary.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/these-are-my-favorite-switch-2-accessories.1267383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a> can be enjoyed right out of the box, but it’s even better with the right accessories. Some of these add-ons are more crucial than others, especially if you’re deciding what to buy early on. For example, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Carrying-Nintendo-Odorless-Protective-Portable-Protection/dp/B0DT48LYLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">case</a> and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Auto-Alignment-Protector-Accessories-Installation-Anti-Scratch-Ultra-Clear/dp/B0DRCKDWD1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">screen protector</a> can keep your console safe from scuffs, scratches, and drops, so both are what I’d consider to be essential.</p><p>On the other hand, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DFQKQ9CB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">microSD Express card</a> lets you add even more digital games to your library, although the console’s somewhat generous 256GB of internal storage means you may not need one right away. Some others don’t add enough to the gaming experience to be worth it. Those Joy-Con 2 steering wheel accessories? You can pass on those.</p><p>The Switch 2 and its games are expensive enough, so we’ve assembled this guide with picks that are a great value. You don’t need to spend hundreds on accessories — many of us at <em>The Verge</em> certainly aren’t. No matter your budget, we’ve included numerous categories, beginning with a starter kit of recommendations we think everyone should consider.</p><div><p id="our-seven-must-have-switch-2-accessories"><h2>Our seven must-have Switch 2 accessories</h2></p></div><div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->9</span></p><div><p>This two-pack of glossy screen protectors is a great value.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->33</span></p><div><p>A slim, durable case that comes in multiple color schemes.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->89</span></p><div><p>The Switch 2 wireless controller with the most features, but it’s not cheap.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->19</span></p><div><p>Grab this to be able to use your Xbox or PS5 controller on your Switch 2.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->54</span></p><div><p>Once you’ve filled up the Switch 2’s built-in 256GB SSD, add some extra storage.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->13</span></p><div><p>Switch 2 Wi-Fi download speeds are painfully slow.

It’s similar in several ways to the excellent Pro controller that debuted alongside the Switch, especially in design, with its analog stick layout, and because it’s the most replete with features you won’t find on other Switch 2 gamepads.</p><p>Its motion control support isn’t a novel feature (many third-party controllers offer that), but its Amiibo NFC support is still something that almost no alternatives offer. Another feature that makes this one worth considering despite its high price is its 3.5mm headphone jack, in case you want to plug in a set of wired headphones for private listening. Additionally, it can wake the Switch 2 from standby via Bluetooth (only a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716763/gulikit-elves-2-controller-wake-switch-2">select few wireless models</a> possess this ability), so you don’t have to get off your couch to hit the console’s power button. Lastly, this model has two additional buttons that can be mapped to mimic almost any other button. (some cheaper alternatives, including the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 and Pro 3, feature four extra buttons).</p><p>The Switch 2 Pro is very comfortable, and it’s the controller that I always want to use when given the choice between the options below. But it’s not perfect. For one, it’s pricey at $89.99, and you’d think for that price Nintendo might have opted for drift-resistant sticks. Alas, you owe $5 to your buddy who bet that Nintendo would doggedly opt again for potentiometer sticks that are proven to tear down over time. Its sticks haven’t caused issues so far, but it’s possible that they might not fare as well — and as long — as models below that feature more durable Hall effect or TMR joysticks.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->89</span></p><div><p>The Switch 2 Pro Controller features new remappable “GL” and “GR” rear buttons, the “C” button to access in-game chat features, and a headphone jack.</p></div></div><div><p id="8bitdo-pro-3"><h3>8BitDo Pro 3</h3></p></div><p>8BitDo’s Pro 3 is a good alternative to the Switch 2 Pro controller: it’s slightly cheaper, yet better in some ways (and a bit worse in others) that might matter to you.</p><p>Starting with the good, the company upgraded its joysticks to the even more durable <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR</a> sensors. The two back paddles are carried over from the first iteration, though there’s a new pair of buttons (L4 and R4) near the triggers that can be customized. Also of note are new toggle switches around its backside (similar to what we saw on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">DualSense Edge</a>) that let you alter the travel distance of its two triggers. Toggling a switch makes the corresponding trigger feel more like a mouse click.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that this controller is significantly more customizable than the Switch 2 Pro, as well as most other controllers out there. Its face buttons are magnetically attached, and can be removed to let the Pro 3 flip between the Switch layout and the Xbox layout.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>While the Pro 3’s TMR sticks might make it last longer, there are some trade-offs compared to the pricier Nintendo alternative — none of which are deal-breakers if saving money is a top priority. For example, its attempts to replicate the subtle blips and buzzing of Nintendo’s impressive HD haptics in the Switch 2 Pro controller are just not good. Its attempts at replicating the smallest, nuanced vibrations of Donkey Kong walking in <em>Bananza</em> makes it go full boar. I’d sooner turn off the vibration entirely than deal with how jarringly intense it feels, and thankfully you can in the app.</p><p>Other downsides are more minor, but are still worth knowing about. It lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, and it doesn’t have the C button to launch GameChat. However, you can easily assign the feature to one of the Pro 3’s buttons via the Switch 2’s OS — but not to its additional buttons (the two R buttons near the triggers, and the two rear paddles). If you’d prefer to use the controller’s built-in button combo to reassign in-game commands to any of its buttons, that’s easy to do, per the instructions in its <a href="https://download.8bitdo.com/Manual/Controller/Pro3/8BItDo-Pro-3-Bluetooth-Gamepad-for-EN.pdf">PDF manual</a>.</p><div><p id="8bitdo-usb-adapter-2"><h2>8Bitdo USB Adapter 2</h2></p></div><p>It’s technically not a controller, but I’m a broken record when it comes to recommending 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2 for households already with more than one console. In the case that you have an Xbox or a PS5 and would rather not buy a bespoke Switch 2 controller, just buy this $20 adapter instead, and use it to connect a wireless controller you already own.</p><p>This adapter goes into the Switch 2’s dock (or directly into the console, if you have a <a href="http://amazon.com/UGREEN-Adapter-MacBook-Thunderbolt-Samsung/dp/B0DSK82JK8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">USB-A to C adapter</a>). Connecting your controller is as easy as putting it into pairing mode, then ensuring that the “Pro Controller Wired Communication” option is turned on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-gb%2FSupport%2FNintendo-Switch%2FHow-to-Enable-Disable-Pro-Controller-Wired-Communication-1516284.html%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooQDh9bo5-2gBbiTFt9tjp2FhOWMvMjDCetyx00DLITBir2u2Z4" rel="sponsored">within the console’s settings</a>. Click and hold the adapter’s coin-shaped button to initiate pairing, then you should be good to go. The DualSense’s rumble and motion controls work seamlessly, and you can remap buttons as you please within the console’s OS, just like you would an official Switch controller.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->19</span></p><div><p>The 8BitDo’s latest adapter resembles a flash drive, but once connected to your Switch’s dock, it allows you to wirelessly pair it with a variety of PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo controllers.</p></div></div><div><p id="best-switch-2-cases"><h2>Best Switch 2 cases</h2></p></div><div><p id="dbrand-killswitch"><h3>Dbrand Killswitch</h3></p></div><p>The Killswitch is a great Switch 2 companion, whether you’re someone who primarily uses the console in handheld mode or while it’s docked. It’s a case that wraps around the Switch 2’s back, with detachable components that snugly grip onto each Joy-Con 2, adding some extra bulk that makes them more comfortable to hold. Above all else, it’s a great way to protect your console from scratches and slightly more significant damage. What’s also great is that it doesn’t limit its flexibility as a hybrid console.</p><p>Each Killswitch ships with a USB-C dock adapter that is inserted into the Switch 2 dock. Since the case-equipped console can no longer fit in Nintendo’s dock, this adapter lets you connect it to your TV without taking off the case. It’s tougher to correctly align the Switch 2’s USB-C jack with this adapter than it is to put it in the dock, but it gets easier with practice.</p><div><p id="tomtoc-fancycase-slim-zip-up-case"><h3>Tomtoc FancyCase Slim zip-up case</h3></p></div><p>The best, slimmest zip-up case you should buy is made by Tomtoc. Compared to the Belkin hard zip-up case that I got my hands on before the Switch 2’s launch, the Tomtoc FancyCase slim case feels more durable; anecdotally, it holds up much better to being squeezed by hand. It even has more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2 sticks, so it’ll never press them in on accident. Like most zip-up cases, it features a screen cover that doubles as cartridge storage. This one can hold 12 cartridges.</p><p>I’m confident that it’ll absorb more potential damage over time than other cases I’ve tried. Plus, it just looks cooler, with low-profile designs for gamers who don’t want to draw attention to their console. That said, its “Froz Edition” has ice cream-inspired looks that are a lot more expressive.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->33</span></p><div><p>This hard case has a soft touch and a slim fit, and includes a flap that can hold up to 12 cartridges as it protects the console’s screen.</p></div></div><div><p id="belkin-fabric-zip-up-case"><h3>Belkin fabric zip-up case</h3></p></div><p>Belkin’s $29.99 zip-up case is another competent, good-looking option that’s slim and lightweight. It’s worth considering over the Tomtoc for one reason only: its built-in pocket, which is great if you need to stow a charging cable or any other small doo-dads. Not to mention, this pocket contains another pocket for an AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, so you can track this case’s location should you lose track of it.</p><p>Belkin makes a thicker, pricier version of this case that has a 20,000mAh 20W battery inside. It’s nearly identical until you open it. A cutout fits this (and only this) Belkin battery perfectly, and it lets you charge your Switch 2 at top speeds while it’s protected.</p><div><p id="best-switch-2-cameras"><h2>Best Switch 2 cameras</h2></p></div><p>The best webcam that you can get for your Switch 2 should be the cheapest one you can find that’s guaranteed to work with it. So far, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/694565/logitech-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">Logitech has confirmed</a> that almost all of its webcams support the Switch 2, and <a href="https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/25019224596877-Elgato-Facecam-MK-2-Firmware-Update#:~:text=As%20of%20July%2029%2C%202025%2C%20the%20firmware%20for%20the%20Facecam%20MK.2%20updated%20to%20version%202.00.%20This%20update%20can%20be%20used%20to%20make%20Facecam%20MK.2%20work%20with%20the%20Nintendo%20Switch%202.">Elgato has updated its Facecam MK.2</a> to support it, as well. Elgato’s model is pricier than we recommend most people spend, but it’s a solid option if you also have a PC to use it with. It’s worth knowing that the Switch 2 displays low-fidelity video feeds during gameplay, so unless you plan to use the webcam with your PC as well, it’s not worth spending a lot for a model that promises great video quality.</p><div><p id="best-switch-2-portable-batteries"><h2>Best Switch 2 portable batteries</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 is more powerful than the original Switch. However, it doesn’t require all that much more power to charge, even while you’re playing games. While new phones and tablets are breaking new ground with fast charging speeds, getting a power bank that can deliver at least 20W is totally sufficient to get the fastest-possible charging speeds with the Switch 2 in handheld mode.</p><p>By using a display-equipped USB-C cable with a wattage reading, I was able to see that the Switch 2 usually pulls a maximum of about 15-17W of power (sometimes less) from a USB-C battery during gameplay. When the system was asleep, the rate went down to between 8-13W, fluctuating at different points during the charging process. From a totally dead state, the console took almost 90 minutes to reach 69 percent with a 20W battery plugged into it. You’ll likely drain your USB-C battery more quickly if you’re playing as you charge.</p><p>Thankfully, your options for compatible batteries are plentiful. You’ll likely be paying for more power than you’ll need with the Switch 2, but more power (and especially more ports) are never a bad thing to have too much of.</p><div><p id="best-microsd-express-cards-for-switch-2"><h2>Best microSD Express cards for Switch 2</h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards of up to 2TB, even though models with that amount of storage aren’t yet available for purchase. Most brands make cards in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB configurations, and some offer 1TB cards as well. I’d suggest grabbing the cheapest microSD Express card you can find, as so far they all offer similarly fast read/write speeds.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/buying-guides/720160/best-switch-2-accessories]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> launched last October, and though it fared decently amongst fans, publisher <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx">EA said it missed sales expectations by 50%,</a> bringing in roughly 1.5 million players instead of the anticipated 3 million it had hoped. Those missed expectations have left fans wondering what the future of the series looks like while <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/08/new-mass-effect-5-trailer-teases-original-trilogy-andromeda-and-maybe-a-new">BioWare works on the next Mass Effect game</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back on the franchise, however, we've recently learned BioWare, at one point, softly pitched a trilogy remaster of the first three Dragon Age games, but it was turned down by EA. That's according to Mark Darrah, former Dragon Age series producer and BioWare executive, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0">a new interview with MrMattyPlays on YouTube</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-has-there-never-been-a-dragon-age-origins-remaster-bioware-exec-explains-past-plans-and-continued-difficulties"><em>IGN</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I honestly think they should do – I don't think they will, but they should do – a remaster of the first three [Dragon Age games]," Darrah, who left BioWare in 2020 but consulted on last year's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, said to MrMattyPlays. "One of the things we pitched at one point – pretty softly, so pitched is a massive overstatement – was to retroactively rebrand the first games as if they were a trilogy, call it the Champions Trilogy, so you have these larger-than-life heroes... maybe you do that as a first step."</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-MRprT3Fnk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-MRprT3Fnk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As for why this trilogy remaster, which would consist of Dragon Age: Origins (2009), Dragon Age II (2011), and Dragon Age: Inquisition (2014), never came to light, Darrah places the blame on EA.&nbsp;</p><p>"EA's historically been – and I don't know why, but they've even said this publicly – they're kind of against remasters," he told MrMattyPlays. "I don't really know why, and it's strange for a publicly traded company to seemingly be against free money, but they seem to be against it. So that's part of it."&nbsp;</p><p>Darrah later posits that a Dragon Age trilogy is a more challenging task than, say, a Mass Effect trilogy (which EA and BioWare did in the form of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mass-effect-legendary-edition/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review-a-great-way-to-honor">Mass Effect Legendary Edition</a> in 2021), because of the series' storied development history and the engines used to create the games.&nbsp;</p><p>For more, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard/sticking-the-landing"><em>Game Informer's </em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>, and then check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/DragonAgeTheVeilguard"><em>Game Informer's </em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story hub</a> for exclusive details and interviews about the game's development and more.&nbsp;</p><p><em>[<strong>Source</strong>: </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0"><em>MrMattyPlays</em></a><em> via </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-has-there-never-been-a-dragon-age-origins-remaster-bioware-exec-explains-past-plans-and-continued-difficulties"><em>IGN</em></a><em>]</em></p><hr><p><em>Do you want a Dragon Age trilogy remaster?

			<p>Horror comes in many different flavours, with Folk Horror being particularly popular in recent years. Defined by a connection with and threat from the land beneath our feet and the beliefs that surround our involvement with it, this form of horror can offer fascinating insights into different cultures. Such is the case with One-Eyed Likho, a dark first person adventure based on a Slavic fairy tale. According to the tale, Likho is the embodiment of misfortune, a one-eyed ogress who haunts the margins of nightmares. Unfortunately for you, the protagonist of the game, you must track her down and find a way to escape her baleful eye.</p>
<p><iframe title="One-Eyed Likho - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W6YvgF_oIug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Likho is a window into another time and another culture. The 19th century Russian setting is one that was unfamiliar to me but also one that fits the eerie monochrome aesthetic perfectly. The lack of colour throughout the game gives the whole atmosphere the feel of a classic film, a mood only furthered by the Russian dialog. This combination of visuals and narrative reminded me greatly of 2021’s Mundaun, another folk horror game with a unique European setting.</p>


<p>While the black and white visuals seem limiting at first, the skilful use of light and shade throughout the game make details really pop in a way that they wouldn’t in full colour. The mixture of religious iconography and horror staples such as caves and dungeons creates a constant feeling of claustrophobia and there are some terrifying chase sequences that make full use of this tone.</p>


<p>You play as a smith who foolishly agrees to leave the safety of society to search for his fortune in the Mysterious Forest. Accompanied by a tailor, you soon find yourself embroiled in a nightmarish world of darkness and madness. The tailor seemingly dies at Likho’s hands early on but manages to remain a conscious companion in a freakish new form, the details of which I won’t spoil here. The original tale of Likho revolves around a smith blinding the ogress in order to escape her and one of the most memorable aspects of the game is the way in which it highlights the uncanny repetition found throughout folk stories from different cultures.</p>
<p>Early on in the game you find a strange book that at first appears to be empty. Scattered throughout the various locations are puzzle boxes that hold extra pages for this book – pages that contain a range of stories from across the world that all seem to contain the same basic elements of Likho. The most famous of these is, of course, the tale of Odysseus and the Cyclops and those who are familiar with this version will find some clear overlaps with the events depicted in Likho.</p>

<p>While there is no combat in Likho, you are not completely helpless in your adventure. Equipped with a seemingly bottomless box of matches you’ll frequently find the need to burn dry grass, wooden effigies and other obstacles to progress. This mechanic is your primary way of interacting with the world, but it’s not always about destruction. Lighting your path is often essential with many pitch black areas whilst other times puzzles require you to use light to your advantage.</p>
<p>The puzzles in Likho are mostly environmentally based with statues needing to be moved, keys found, and riddles to be solved. Alongside the main narrative path, there are the aforementioned storybook pages to be found, as well as birch manuscripts that give deeper lore details into the world of the story, and collectable dolls to burn hidden around the various locations. Trying to collect all of these provides some replayability which is welcome as the main story only takes around 4 hours to complete.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		One-Eyed Likho belongs in that rare category of games that take such a dark narrative and setting and manage to infuse it all with a surrealism that often verges on the comic. Even the epic conclusion of the story raised a smile at its presentation and effect. While not a long game and one that follows a very linear path, there are more moments and images here that will stay in your memory than many far longer games can muster.	</p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[Tencent has been Caught Making Changes to the Steam page for Horizon Rip-Off Light of Motiram after Sony’s Lawsuit]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/tencent-changes-light-of-motiram-steam-page-sony-horizon-lawsuit/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-has-been-caught-making-changes-to-the-steam-page-for-horizon-rip-off-light-of-motiram-after-sony%E2%80%99s-lawsuit.1267350/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Tencent first announced Light of Motiram, everyone, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">Wccftech</a>, immediately saw it as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-shown-in-new-gameplay-trailer/">clone</a> or rip-off of Sony's Horizon series. Which is why no one was surprised when, at the end of last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/">a copyright lawsuit from Sony attacked Tencent</a> for Light of Motiram. The lawsuit cites the multiple headlines that drew the same connections we did, and goes as far to call Light of Motiram a "<em>slavish clone</em>" of Guerilla Games' series.</p>



<p>Now that Sony has pulled the lever on a lawsuit, Tencent has been caught making a few potentially legally-significant changes to Light of Motiram's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/">Steam page</a>. Spotted by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/">The Game Post</a>, the key art for Light of Motiram has been changed, the game's description has been rewritten, and multiple screenshots, including ones featuring Light of Motiram's own red-haired player character, have been removed.</p>



<p>The game's original description on Steam read as such: </p>



<p>"<em>In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses. Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy machination, survive with mechanimals</em>."</p>



<p>The new description for the game now reads: </p>



<p>"<em>Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land</em>."</p>



<p>A much more generic game description that doesn't reference the Mechanimals that look directly styled after the robotic dinosaurs featured in Horizon.</p>



<p>Will these changes and removals have any significant impact on the lawsuit? Who knows, it's too early to tell which way things will sway, no matter how obvious the case might seem on the outside. Especially when considering details that the lawsuit revealed, like how Tencent apparently went to Sony asking if the two companies could partner on making a Horizon game. Sony declined, according to the lawsuit, and Tencent followed up that encounter with Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>It might look open-and-shut, and like Tencent decided to copy as much as they could from Horizon in order to leverage the similarities to create a new hit title, but copyright suits are rarely open-and-shut, especially ones where two massive companies are going head-to-head. Whichever way it swings, we can be sure that it will set an interesting precedent for the future.</p>

However, now that we’re seeing a bit more of his lore ahead of his gameplay reveal in the game’s latest digital comic, it definitely feels like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-seven-havens-pavi-earthbender-image-sdcc-panel-1851786934"><i><span>Avatar’s</span></i></a><span> element-bending was an influence on the hero’s design and story.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Wuyang Story Time with Howard Wang | Overwatch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RY3sER2O0jM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>Wuyang is a student at Wuxing University, which has different schools dedicated to different elements. There are Fire, Water, Metal, Earth, and Wood colleges, and each has a specific area of focus, with Water students working in medical fields; thus, Wuyang is a support hero. His parents and sister, however, were accepted into Fire College, which specializes in martial arts, and he spent his time at the school trying to live up to his family’s prestige. Eventually, he managed to make his water-based abilities useful in combat and was able to save his fire-wielding sister in a battle against the invading synthetic omnics, earning him respect after feeling ashamed of breaking his family’s streak.</span></p> <p><span>Joshi Zhang, a Senior Narrative Designer at Blizzard, </span><a href="https://x.com/ZhangJoshi/status/1954937098349498776"><span>posted a message on social media</span></a><span> about how Wuyang was inspired by his personal experience living in his sister’s shadow growing up, and the pressures he felt living as a Chinese-Canadian.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Complex emotions arise when we wish to give back to those who raised us,” Zhang wrote. “These feelings will not be unfamiliar to many Chinese people—especially those who haven’t yet discovered their own strengths. To the Chinese community, and anyone who resonates with this struggle, I hope Wuyang’s story helps you accept your journey and your life as it unfolds. Meandering off the set path without knowing how to get where you want to go is just part of the process. Work hard, go with the flow, and have hope. Eventually, you will find your place as the hero of your own story, just as Wuyang did.”</span></p> <p><span>Wuyang is set to join </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s roster in season 18, which begins on August 26. However, fans will be able to play him for the first time this weekend during a limited-time trial. Blizzard is releasing the first in-game footage of the hero in action </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6ZEN5MVJaU"><span>on Wednesday at noon Eastern</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
