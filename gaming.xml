<p data-characters="362" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The final week of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s The Pantheon has arrived, featuring a whopping eight bosses and one mean Power disadvantage. Whether Guardians just want a clear for that sweet Emblem, or they’re pushing to hit a Platinum score on each encounter for the Godslayer Title, they’ll want to know what to expect from The Pantheon: Nezarec Sublime.</p> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">The Pantheon is a limited-time boss rush mode in&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, featuring encounters tuned to inch up the difficulty. Alongside encounter reworks, players also go against a Power disadvantage, starting at -5 in The Pantheon’s first bout and going up to -20 for Nezarec Sublime. While regular Raids can already be challenging, The Pantheon demands mastery, quick thinking, and coordination.</p> <h2 id="h-modifiers-matter" data-injectable="false">Modifiers matter</h2> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">For The Pantheon: Nezarec Sublime, players have a few helpful modifiers to regain control in the encounters. First up is the return of Shot Caller from The Pantheon: Oryx Exalted. This modifier offers increased Special and Heavy weapon damage on top of damage resistance. Players can trigger the modifier by landing three precision shots in rapid succession.</p> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true">Alongside Shot Caller are the Solar and Strand Surges. Each Surge empowers matching elemental weapons, meaning players will want an arsenal of Solar and Strand weapons for Nezarec Sublime. Of particular note, The Parasite, Whisper of the Worm, Apex Predator, Sleeper Stimulant, Sunshot, and Scatter Signal all work marvelously, depending on the specific encounter.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">The first six bosses</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">If players have been following along with The Pantheon each week, they already know what’s in store for most of the boss rush. Guardians will still have to carve their way through all of the bosses previously defeated in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-pantheon-atraks-sovereign-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pantheon: Atraks Sovereign</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-pantheon-oryx-exalted-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pantheon: Oryx Exalted</a>, and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-pantheon-rhulk-indomitable-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pantheon: Rhulk Indomitable</a>, only this time with a -20 Power disadvantage.</p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">Some of these encounters can feel very different with the Power disadvantage and different Surges active. If players are struggling to overcome a boss, just remember to play to the strengths of the Surges and Shot Caller and to equip relevant Resistance mods on armor.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Riven</h2> <figure data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Riven mechanics</h3> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">Most players are used to passing over Riven with a bit of cheese, but that’s not going to work anymore. Guardians will have to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-how-to-defeat-riven-legit/" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn how to defeat Riven legit</a>&nbsp;if they want a chance at toppling Nezarec. That said, once you know what to do, the fight is easier than it’s been made out to be.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Riven changes</h3> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">Of course, the most significant change is that you can’t cheese Riven anymore. This used to be done by having the whole Fireteam go into one room together and then use a glitch to respawn back at the start if Riven didn’t appear. For The Pantheon, that method is defunct, and Guardians must do all of the mechanics in the encounter.</p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">Outside of doing Riven as intended, there are more enemies, and naturally, at a -20 Power disadvantage, they can hit like a truck. Doing the encounter’s mechanics safely will be the real challenge, with the only other notable change being that Riven sports additional resistance on the lower floors.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Nezarec</h2> <figure data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Nezarec mechanics</h3> <p data-characters="562" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">Nezarec is the final boss in the Root of Nightmares Raid and the last encounter in The Pantheon. Like other encounters with several mechanics happening simultaneously, it’s easiest to approach the fight with pre-assigned roles and an understanding of how everything comes together. The Fireteam will want to assign two players as runners and another one or two for tanking/kiting. The remaining players will focus on clearing the arena of enemies. The arena itself is separated into three lanes, with platforms dotted around the left and right lanes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">At the edge of the left and right lanes closest to the Rally flag, players will notice a plate with either a Light or Dark node (Dark on the right, Light on the left). This is the starting point for each runner. The tank team/player should stay far back in the middle lane, by the rally flag, and the ad clear players are free to move about so long as they don’t put themselves in danger.</p> <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="859" data-injectable="true">To start the encounter, each runner can shoot their respective node to gain a buff, either Flux of Darkness or Flux of Light. The runners then want to look at the platforms closest to their plate and head to the one with a small black orb floating above it. Standing on the plate and damaging the orb transfers the buff, activating that platform. Players must activate all platforms on both sides to push into a damage phase. However, there are a couple of catches.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true">After runners expend their buff, they can return to the starting plate to get another. That said, the buff-giving plate will move after players have activated it a few times. This means runners must keep an eye out after activating a plate to ensure they’re running the right way toward a rebuff. The other consideration in this relay race is Nezarec himself.</p>
 <p data-characters="507" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true">Soon after starting the encounter (usually when runners are heading to their second plate), Nezarec will raise a hand in the air, which starts bouncing random players around. This will make it almost impossible for runners to do their job, so this is where the tank comes into play. Using a sniper, the tank must shoot the crit spot on both of the boss’ shoulders. This will elicit a flash of color (either white for Light or orange for Darkness), which should be communicated to the rest of the team.</p>
 <p data-characters="667" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true">Shortly after the flash of color, Nezarec’s chest will light up so the tank can take a precision shot. Popping his chest debuffs the tank with Nezarec’s Hatred, which makes the boss jump down and chase the player for as long as they have the debuff. This will buy the runners additional time to activate plates until Nezarec starts to glow. When this happens, the runner of the opposite color called out must reacquire their Flux buff and use it on an activated platform matching the color Nezarec flashed. For example, if Nezarec flashed white after popping his shoulders, the Darkness runner would rebuff and use the buff on an activated Light platform.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">If done correctly, the platform in question will provide any player that passes over it with a shield buff called Light or Darkness Refuge that prevents Nezarec’s wipe mechanic. It’s important to note that the shield doesn’t last very long, so players will want to ensure they rebuff if it expires before Nezarec erupts. With the wipe avoided, Nezarec will return to his balcony, and players can finish activating any lingering platforms.</p>
 <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">Once all platforms on the left and right are activated, they’ll emit a beam of light to signal the phase switch. The Fireteam should all gather at one predetermined platform and play it safe until a beam pierces through Nezarec. Once that happens, Guardians can unload everything they have on the boss. Nezarec won’t just sit there and take the damage, though. The boss will attack players from the ground and the air, sometimes even teleporting around.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">At the end of the damage phase, if Guardians don’t do enough to push the boss, Nezarec will teleport back up to the balcony, and the whole cycle will start again. If players can push the boss, he’ll enter a final stand where the team has one last chance to finish Nezarec off.&nbsp;</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Nezarec changes</h3> <figure data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Alongside the Power disadvantage, a few changes to Nezarec will make the fight more difficult. The most notable thing is that if players stand on a plate for too long, it explodes. This means that Guardians must be especially careful when trying to get their Refuge buff.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">It also makes it more challenging to plan a safe locale for damage. Fireteams can try avoiding stationary damage altogether and follow the boss with a couple Well of Radiance Supers and The Lament sword, or they can try to lure the boss towards the starting Darkness node before damage starts to make use of the safe root jutting out from the side of the arena.</p>
 <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="false">In addition to exploding plates, Tormentors and Cabal Colossus will be running rampant, but thankfully, their defeat is not required for groups to get a Platinum score. The Colossus, however, are shielded with Light or Darkness.&nbsp;The Fireteam can have an&nbsp;add clear&nbsp;player stand on the buff-giving plate with a runner so they get the buff&nbsp;as well and can then&nbsp;eliminate the Colossus, or players can stun or blind the foes.</p>

			<p>It's been just a day since the official launch of Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, and PC gamers can already improve their experience with the first few mods.</p>
<p>First, the Flat2VR community showed off a Virtual Reality mod for the single player cinematic game released by Ninja Theory. Thanks to Praydog's <a href="https://wccftech.com/uevr-public-beta-makes-dozens-of-thousands-of-unreal-engine-games-vr-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UEVR tool</a>, Hellblade II already works with full 6DOF VR and can be played in first-person or third-person view.</p>
<p>You will need to grab the profile from the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ZFSCSDe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flat2VR Discord</a> to get it properly set up. Also, make sure you're using a powerful PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hellblade 2 VR Mod Out Now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8YLX6B-9nRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is full of postprocessing effects like depth of field, motion blur, chromatic aberration, lens distortion, film grain, and forced letterboxing (black bars). While most of those are essential to the artistic vision devised by Ninja Theory, they may also be distasteful or even sickening (in the case of motion blur especially) to some gamers.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there's already an easy-to-use mod to remove them all available for download <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/senuassagahellblade2/mods/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nexus Mods</a>. These are the simple steps required for installation:</p>
<p><em><span>1. Download the zip file and extract it.<br>
2. Copy/cut the files to this location:<br>
</span></em></p>
<figure>
<blockquote><p><em>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Hellblade2\Saved\Config\Windows\</em></p></blockquote>
</figure>
<p><em><span>3. Replace the file.</span></em></p>
<p>However, for players interested in disabling only specific effects, here's how to do it manually. You will have to open the Engine.ini file located in the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Hellblade2\Saved\Config\Windows\ folder.</p>
<p>Then, add the following text at the bottom of the file, depending on which effects you want to disable.</p>
<pre>[SystemSettings]
r.FilmGrain=0
r.NT.Lens.Distortion.Intensity=0
r.NT.Lens.Distortion.Stretch=0
r.NT.Lens.ChromaticAberration.Intensity=0
r.NT.DOF.RotationalBokeh=0
r.NT.DOF.NTBokehTransform=0
r.MotionBlurQuality=0
r.NT.AllowAspectRatioHorizontalExtension=0
r.NT.EnableConstrainAspectRatio=0
r.AntiAliasingMethod=0
</pre>
<p>Do note that removing the forced letterboxing (the black bars) has two side effects. The first and most obvious one is a decrease in performance since those pixels will have to be rendered after the tweak. The second is a zoomed-in camera effect due to the lack of a proper field of view slider.</p>
<p>You can find my Senua's Saga: Hellblade II review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Earlier today, Ninja Theory <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-galaxy-ring-price-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent out a thank you message</a> to the community for the 'incredible response' to the game.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24162032/evil-does-not-exists-ending-explained-by-director-ryusuke-hamaguchi</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/evil-does-not-exist%E2%80%99s-director-unpacks-its-strange-controversial-ending.878697/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24162032/evil-does-not-exists-ending-explained-by-director-ryusuke-hamaguchi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="u8wN8S">You don’t even have to watch <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24153139/evil-does-not-exist-review-ryusuke-hamaguchi">Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em></a> to consider it a conversation-starter: The debate begins with that title, a bold, unlikely statement that may feel at odds with most experiences of the world. Watching the movie complicates that response even further, given some of the choices its characters make, and the harm they bring to others. And then there’s that abrupt, surprising ending, the kind that will leave viewers arguing over what they actually saw on screen almost as much as they’re arguing about what it means. </p>
<p id="yqpj2e">Hamaguchi is no stranger to elliptical, unpackable, or discussable endings: His Best Picture Oscar nominee <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22947711/drive-my-car-deserves-best-picture-oscar"><em>Drive My Car</em></a> wraps with a long sequence where the audience is just watching the protagonist perform onstage in a multilingual production of Anton Chekhov’s <em>Uncle Vanya</em>, followed by a wordless sequence of another character going about mundane tasks. There’s a great deal of meaning there, but it takes thought, time, and attention to the film’s 179-minute length to access. <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em> is shorter and tighter, but it still <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/05/evil-does-not-exist-ryusuke-hamaguchi-movie-drive-my-car.html">centers on a 20-minute scene</a> where residents of a small community politely raise objections about a planned luxury development in the area.</p>
<p id="vWEAOU">What is Hamaguchi getting at with <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em>? From its title to its mysterious opening tracking shot to that what’s-going-on-here? ending, Polygon had a lot of questions about the movie. Speaking through a translator, we sat down with Hamaguchi to unpack the film.  </p>
<p id="AXiwvH">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> End spoilers ahead for <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em>.]</p>
<h2 id="cqx7yV"><strong>First: on the ending Evil Does Not Exist</strong></h2>
<div id="HA3KxF"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVY4lWfrbME?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="A6aUWS"><em>Evil Does Not Exist</em> centers on a small rural village, Mizubiki, that’s about to be disrupted by developers building a site for luxury camping, or “glamping.” At a town-hall meeting, the locals object, and their thoughtful, thorough analysis of the project’s flaws impresses the presenters, Takahashi (Ryuji Kosaka) and Mayuzumi (Ayaka Shibutani). But when they share the objections with their boss, they learn he doesn’t actually care about making the project sustainable or even profitable. He just cares about the pandemic-era development grants he’ll earn if he gets the proposal in ahead of a deadline.</p>
<p id="F3VX5s">Takahashi and Mayuzumi connect with Takumi (Hitoshi Omika), a widower and odd-job man in Mizubiki, who’s raising a young daughter, Hana (Ryo Nishikawa), on his own. Takumi is a quiet man who’s closely connected with nature, and Takahashi envies him and wants to move out to Mizubiki and live in nature himself. But then Hana goes missing, and the town rallies to find her. Takahashi and Takumi are together when they find her lying in a field, where she’s been attacked by a wounded deer. Takumi suddenly turns on Takahashi and brutally strangles him, then grabs Hana’s body and runs. Takahashi gets up and stumbles across the field, then falls again and lies still.</p>
<p id="foTe67">Is Takahashi dead? Is Hana dead? Hamaguchi says he wants to leave those things up to interpretation, to invite people to discuss the ending and what it means. “In order to be able to make this happen, I think two things are necessary,” he told Polygon. “The first part is to end in this abrupt manner, almost leaving the audience behind. But that in itself, I don’t think is enough to create conversations and create different interpretations. It really relies on what the characters do up until that point.”</p>
<h2 id="tmC1ES"><strong>Why does Takumi attack Takahashi in Evil Does Not Exist?</strong></h2>

</p>
<p id="40Y8OT">To some degree, the end of the film is foreshadowed in something Takumi tells his city visitors during the film: Deer aren’t ordinarily dangerous to humans, but a gutshot deer will lash out violently, particularly to protect its young. This is what happened to Hana: In what appears to be either a flashback or Takumi’s quick mental reconstruction when he sees her lying in the field, we see that she encountered a pair of deer, one of which had been shot. She attempted to approach them, and the wounded deer attacked her.</p>
<p id="7ZTZy0">In the same way, Takumi is symbolically a “gutshot deer.” He’s metaphorically wounded, both by the imminent destruction of his community and the natural world around him by predatory outsiders, and by the hurt done to his daughter, in part because of his own neglect. As we learn early in the movie, Takumi was sometimes a unreliable father: Hana is only out in the woods alone because she’s taken to walking home from school by herself, since he didn’t always remember to pick her up from school. Like the deer, Takumi lashes out irrationally, not at the source of his pain, but at the nearest available target.</p>
<p id="2n3KyN">“I do think he’s acting out of desperation,” Hamaguchi says. “In that moment, I think he does realize in [seeing Hana’s body] that he’s not able to be the kind of father he maybe wanted to be. And I think there are certain clues within the film where we see that.”</p>
<p id="SgtsXn">While Takumi’s behavior may seem extreme and difficult to understand, Hamaguchi hopes viewers will go back and watch the movie again, and see how his response fits in with other behavior we’ve seen from him.</p>
<p id="ezUQB1">“What I hope I’m achieving is that people feel that each character that appears in the film all have their own individual lives,” he says. “The way they act and what we see in the film are just moments that the cameras happened to capture, of life they each live outside of the film. And once people can feel that these characters actually do exist, then when we see them do something that is not quite understandable, the audience can still feel it’s still possible that they <em>could</em> do these things.”</p>
<p id="mLtjNT">He considers the movie’s ending an invitation to analyze and sit with the story: “When this kind of ending happens, I feel it causes the audience to reflect back on what they experienced before that, to rethink what they just watched, and to reflect upon whether their worldview of what they just saw is in was in fact correct,” he says. “That effect to me is a very interesting way to experience a film, and can result in a lot of interpretations. And so if that’s what it is doing, then I’m very grateful.”</p>

<p id="SsOU3R">In terms of understanding Takumi’s attack, Hamaguchi suggests looking back at his 2018 movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l7uzLZBXLY"><em>Asako I &amp; II</em></a>, about a woman who falls for two physically identical men (played by the same actor) with radically different personas, and has to decide which one to stay with. “In that, a protagonist also makes choices,” Hamaguchi says. “And I think from the perspective of the wider society in which she lives, perhaps the choice she makes can be viewed as a bad choice. But I think from her perspective, it was the only choice she could make.”</p>
<p id="qk70mP">He says the decision helps Asako see herself more clearly, and learn more about what she values. “It’s my perspective of living and the worldview that I have in some ways,” he says. “I think there are moments in our lives where we suddenly understand something about ourselves through the choices we just made.”</p>
<p id="fR1JXF">Similarly, Hamaguchi says that when Takumi sees Hana lying in the field, he understands where his own choices have led. “I think in that moment, he realizes through the failures he has had,” he says. “That leads him to try to figure out desperately about what to do. That action might be read as absurd from the surroundings, or from people around him. But I think to me, this choice that he makes is something that for this particular character, could happen.”</p>
<p id="EjDraW">Put another way: Takumi has been a passive, quiet character throughout the process of the development plan, to the point where Takahashi and Mayuzumi try to hire him as a liaison with the community, a manager for the site who could also quell local tensions. In attacking Takahashi, he’s violently pushing back against the idea that he could be drawn to take their side against his community’s. He’s also defending his territory from outsiders, as a wild animal might. And like a wild animal, he’s acting without thinking about the consequences, or even about whether that action might plausibly achieve his goals. But that’s just one interpretation. </p>

<p id="A0s1x9"><em>Evil Does Not Exist </em>was <a href="https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2023/8/1/02j6ly234psb45yl5pyexs8ee9724d">originally planned</a> as a wordless 30-minute short film, a visual accompaniment for new music by Eiko Ishibashi, who also composed the score for <em>Drive My Car</em>. But Hamaguchi says her music and his location scouting inspired the story of the film — and the title came before that story was locked down. </p>
<p id="EuV0hC">“Before writing the script, when I was thinking about what I could shoot, I went out to where Eiko Ishibashi makes her music,” he says. “She makes her music amongst this very rich natural landscape. It was winter when I was there, and when I looked out into the winter landscape, these words popped up. I thought, <em>OK, it’s very cold right now. Standing here, I feel like I’m going to freeze to death. And yet it’s not that I feel any evil intentions here.</em>”</p>
<p id="fox68M">Hamaguchi says part of that insight<em> </em>came from living in an urban environment, where it’s rare to be far away from other people. The isolated community in <em>Evil Does Not Exist</em> lives far away from that kind of constant engagement, and the people in that community are often alone in nature — which can be a dangerous environment, but not a purposefully or consciously inimical one. As the film’s story developed, Hamaguchi added characters that do live in urban environments, and do act in deliberately harmful ways, but he kept the title throughout. “Looking back at the film that we had made,” he says, “it made me think that watching this particular film against this title is probably an interesting experience together.”</p>
<p id="DMWlpX">But doesn’t the developer bringing chaos to a community for profit act in an evil way? “I think it’s actually a very difficult question to answer properly,” Hamaguchi says. “Say for now, we say that there is no evil in nature. Then the question becomes, <em>Is human society not natural? </em>I think we can say humans are a part of nature. But I think what’s also true about humans is that there might be more choices available.</p>
<p id="ysEjkc">“We can reflect back on our choices and say, <em>I should have chosen this way</em> or <em>I should have chosen this or that</em>, and sometimes make these decisions of whether those are good or bad choices. As human beings, when we’re living our lives, sometimes we think something is bad, or something was a bad choice. But when you interpret this as desire, I think you can also see that was part of nature as well. This is just how I honestly feel at the current moment.”</p>

<p id="SdzUiF">While the opening of <em>Evil Does Not Exist </em>doesn’t seem like it’d offer much inside on the ending, it actually ties directly into Hamaguchi’s point about perspective, understanding, and the natural world. </p>
<p id="MLjdMN">“That particular perspective that we see at the beginning is a perspective that only a camera can manage to capture,” he says. “Because as human beings, even if you look up and keep looking, it’s not possible to have your point of axis not moving, the way it does within that tracking shot. To be seeing that, with [the camera moving at] a very steady speed […] this vision is not necessarily a vision humans can have. </p>
<p id="kswtsG">“And I think through watching through this perspective, this vision for four minutes, my hope was that the people who are looking can acquire a slightly different way of perceiving, or a different way of thinking. Perhaps it’s closer to how a machine sees, or perhaps how nature sees. This is something that I wouldn’t know. But I think the fact that we, the audience, can acquire a different way of looking, perhaps, can lead the audience into understanding the rest of the film in a deeper level. And that’s why I wanted to start the film in that way.”</p>

Some may require cargo pants, but all of these offerings are modest in profile and easy to transport.</p><p><strong>TL;DR: The Best Pocket-Sized Board Games</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/GdD0K" target="_blank">Art Robbery</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Od4q7" target="_blank">Trio</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/bP7Nx" target="_blank">Love Letter</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/le8Lx" target="_blank">Radlands</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3djY3" target="_blank">Friday</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/mLP8y" target="_blank">For Sale</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/G15q8" target="_blank">That’s Not a Hat</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/GdDqq" target="_blank">Regicide</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/2jYP1" target="_blank">The Mind</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/2e3gD" target="_blank">Werewords</a></li></ul><h2>Art Robbery</h2><div id="200973"><p><h3>Art Robbery Card Game</h3></p></div><p>This stylish wonder arrives courtesy of prolific designer Reiner Knizia. The pitch is enticing: in the aftermath of an art heist, players bicker and fight over splitting the loot. This conflict is resolved through card play. You alternate taking turns by playing a single card, with these cards mapping to loot tokens in the center of the table. By playing a card you snatch the corresponding token and place it in front of you. The twist is that you can steal a token from another player instead of taking it from the middle. The second twist is that some of the lower scoring tokens offer alibis. At the end of the game, the player with the fewest amount of alibis is eliminated from play, regardless of their final score. The result is an entertaining back and forth where you gank loot from others yet must balance high scoring options with those that offer protection.</p><h2>Trio</h2><div id="200974"><p><h3>Trio</h3></p></div><p>Everyone is familiar with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">classic board games</a> Go Fish and Memory. Trio splices the two, asking players to flip over three cards of the same number. These cards are facedown on the table, but some are also spread among the hands of the players. When flipping a card from a player’s hand, however, you can only ask them to reveal their highest or lowest card. The goal is to claim three of these trios or just the set of sevens. It’s a simple thing, but it’s one that elicits little moments of drama where a player has flipped two of the same number and is trying to remember where the third card is. It features hand management and surprisingly clever play. </p><h2>Love Letter</h2><div id="198214"><p><h3>Love Letter</h3></p></div><p>When Love Letter hit the market in 2012 it created quite the stir. This little 16-card game has players holding and playing only a single card on their turn. It’s maddeningly simple, but it works, capturing a degree of bluffing and risk management. Love Letter is fun and flexible, but it’s particularly noteworthy as it kicked off the microgame movement that spawned dozens and dozens of offspring. Most of those titles have long since faded, while Love Letter remains a clever and engaging experience. There are now a bevy of different versions of this game, including a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">Star Wars</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Jdnqm" target="_blank">Batman</a>, and wedding-themed set. They all play similarly, so you can’t go wrong whichever you choose.</p><h2>Radlands</h2><div id="155159"><p><h3>Radlands</h3></p></div><p>Radlands is one of the best head-to-head card games in recent years. Each player draws from a shared deck of mutants, raiders, and weirdos, playing these fighters down into one of three lanes on their side of the table. Each lane corresponds to a base that must be protected. The goal is to vanquish your opponent’s defenders and destroy their bases. The magic is in the multi-use aspect of each card. Beyond using them for the characters depicted, they can also be discarded for a card-specific resource. Performing well requires strong tactical intuition and judicious play you'd use in all the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">best strategy board games</a>. All of the interlocking abilities and effects collide to produce a swift-playing and tense battler.   </p><h2>Friday</h2><div id="200975"><p><h3>Friday: A Solo Adventure</h3></p></div><p>This small box is unique in that it’s for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> play only. This card game is based on the story of Robinson Crusoe. You take on the role of his companion Friday, attempting to help Robinson survive and prepare him for the impending pirate attack. This is a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deckbuilding game</a> where you add cards to your deck during play. Each turn you confront a jungle hazard and then play fight cards from your hand in order to overcome the challenge. If you do, the hazard is then added to your deck and may be used in a later fight. You must pick your battles wisely, as you can’t win them all and must be careful in how you shape your deck for the big finale. This is a difficult game that offers a tremendous amount of play and strategic depth. </p><h2>For Sale</h2><div id="165423"><p><h3>For Sale</h3></p></div><p>For Sale crams the buying and selling of real estate into a brief yet satisfying 30 minutes. In the first phase of the game, players bid on a set of buildings by using a limited pool of personal currency. You must bid higher than all previous bids on each of your turns, or bow out of the round and claim the lowest value property available. Determining how long to hang in the auction depends on the value of the property on offer, as well as how stubborn your opponents are. The second portion of the game reverses the process with money cards worth various amounts flipped faceup in the middle of the table. Players secretly select a property they’ve purchased from their hand in an attempt to secure these monetary bids. You all reveal simultaneously and the money is split. It’s an exceedingly easy game to learn, but it’s one full of subtle play that relies on intuition. It’s paramount to squeeze every ounce of value out of your resources, and the player who manages their assets most judiciously will secure victory.  </p><h2>That’s Not a Hat</h2><div id="197491"><p><h3>That's Not a Hat</h3></p></div><p>This is the type of game that is both maddening and hilarious. Each player is dealt a card that sits out in front of them faceup. Cards depict simple objects with black and white line art. These are common things such as a basketball, lava lamp, or a hat. Once play begins, players take turns flipping their card facedown and passing it to an adjacent player. Soon, all cards are hidden and players are trying to track which is which. When you pass a card to a neighbor, you claim what the object is. The receiver of the card may challenge your claim, creating a confrontation of memory. It’s simple but sparks moments of laughter as it’s surprisingly easy to lose track of what card sits in front of you. Eventually someone messes up and the game begins again. This is a wonderful design that consistently delivers joy. </p><h2>Regicide</h2><div id="200976"><p><h3>Regicide: A Challenging Cooperative Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Regicide is a fully <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a> where players work together to overthrow the royal line and claim victory. Each of the 12 enemies must be dealt with one at a time. These bosses map to the face cards in a standard set of playing cards. They are shuffled together and one is revealed. Players then take turns placing a single card on the table to attack the enemy and deal damage. The value on the played card is the strength of the attack with the suit triggering a special power. There’s a fairly thoughtful decision point here in weighing the needed attack versus the desired effect that would most help the other players. It’s a fairly intuitive card game where hand management and timing is everything. The strongest trait is that it’s full of tension as the group is constantly on the brink of defeat. Often, it will appear hopeless until another player tosses out the exact card the group needs, allowing everyone to refill their hands and persist. Regicide is an intriguing experience with a distinct feel. It’s a wonderful little pocket game. </p><h2>The Mind</h2><div id="157808"><p><h3>The Mind</h3></p></div><p>The Mind is a special game. Players are dealt a hand from a deck of cards numbered 1 to 100, with a portion of the cards left out and unknown. Play then flows in real-time. The player with the lowest card in hand must play it on the table. Then the next lowest card must be played atop the previous, and so on. The enormous twist is that players cannot communicate. You can’t talk or nod or gesture. You can just look into each other’s eyes and try to divine the proper time to play your card. It sounds ridiculous, but I assure you, there is a game here. It’s about pausing and feeling out the situation, eventually playing the proper card when it feels like enough time has passed. If approached with the right attitude it can brush up against a metaphysical element, achieving a playstate with similar vibes to a Ouija board. This may not have universal appeal, but it’s a game that presents a singular vision that is capable of achieving transcendent entertainment. </p><h2>Werewords</h2><div id="200977"><p><h3>Werewords: The Hidden Identity Word Game</h3></p></div><p>This small box is basically the classic 20 Questions with the inclusion of a traitor. One player receives a word they must get the group to guess, and everyone else is allowed to only throw out “yes or no” questions. At least one person in the group is a werewolf trying to trip up the villagers. They know the word before play begins and can attempt to mislead or stall the group. If everyone fails to figure out the correct word, however, they get to vote as a group to hang a player they suspect to be the werewolf. If they select the villain, the villagers win regardless of failing to land on the proper word. This strongly mimics the structure of social deduction games such as <a href="https://zdcs.link/weAZR" target="_blank">One Night Ultimate Werewolf</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Od41j" target="_blank">The Resistance: Avalon</a>, but it allows for a more simple and streamlined process with a broadly enjoyable classic game at its core. It’s frankly surprising how effective this concoction is, but it manages to offer inspired play with all kinds of players and tastes. This is one of the most reliably fun pocket-sized games ever designed. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="245" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Bile Titan is akin to the general of the Terminid army in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. It’s a massive beast, towering over everything on four tall legs. There are multiple ways to kill the Bile Titan in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, one of which is quick. Sometimes.</p> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false"><strong>The best way to kill a Bile Titan in <em>Helldivers 2</em> is by turning it to mulch with a powerful Secondary Weapon or Stratagem</strong>. Weapons like the EAT-17 and Quasar Cannon do a ton of damage to the hulking monstrosity, especially if you aim at its head — the Bile Titan’s primary weak point. </p> <h2 id="h-how-to-kill-a-bile-titan-in-helldivers-2" data-injectable="false">How to kill a Bile Titan in <em>Helldivers 2</em></h2> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">It’s up for debate how much damage a Bile Titan must take before toppling over like a stack of lawn chairs. A couple of shots to the face with an EAT can do it, but the bug may need more before you can convince it to give up the ghost. No, you can’t fire away with the Railgun until its head explodes — not anymore, that is.</p>
 <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">As far as Stratagems go, the Bile Titan isn’t a fan of the Eagle 500kg Bomb or the Orbital Railgun. The latter is a better idea if you want to go for the kill shot, but keep in mind that the Titan may shrug off the first slug. Yes, it’s a bit inconsistent. My favorite methods are the 500kg Bomb and the Orbital Laser. Keep in mind that the bomb beacon must be dropped in the Bile Titan’s path. You can be smart about it, though.</p>

For the Titan, the soft, green belly is a smart target for you and your team to take advantage of, and here’s why. </p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"><strong>The Bile Titan has two attacks based on distance</strong>. When close, the Bile Titan will stomp on you with its massive legs. If you’re out of reach, it spews a jet stream of green bile that can kill you in seconds. That’s why you’ll want to target its belly to stop it from firing acid.</p>
 <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="158" data-injectable="false"><strong>Use medium and heavy weapons to inflict damage to its abdomen</strong>. After a while, you can destroy its belly and the Bile Titan will lose its ability to spew acid.</p> <figure data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>

Try it as well as the Quasar Cannon, as they dish out the most damage quickly and reliably.</p>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><strong>The sleeper hit from this list may be the Arc Thrower</strong>. It penetrates armor and can be fired from a considerable distance. The only drawback is that it can result in friendly-fire killings or prioritize smaller fries beneath it. You’d only want to use this weapon if the Bile Titan is by itself.</p> <p data-characters="11" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false"><strong>Do <em>not </em>use:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true"> <li>Flamethrower</li> <li>Incendiary Grenade</li> <li>Stun Grenade</li> </ul>

 <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="141" data-injectable="false">Other Stratagems that aren’t listed here have reportedly worked for other players, but the ones here have been more consistent overall.</p> <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false"><strong>You can also take down a Bile Titan using a sentry and some good planning</strong>. A Rocket or Autocannon sentry both do work against the beast, but you’ll need to drop them well outside of its acid range. </p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">The Exosuit mech is equipped with a heavy machine gun and rocket launcher. <strong>Three to four blasts with its rockets can take down a Bile Titan with ease</strong>. If you’re ever in a pinch and need some fast clearing, this glass cannon can be just what you need to turn the tide in battle.</p>

Body shots don’t seem to faze it, meaning your only shot to take it down during a drop is by clipping it in the head. It’s a lot to ask from a human cannonball.</p> <figure data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="123" data-injectable="false">What else works against the Bile Titan? Well, for one lucky Helldiver, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lucky-helldivers-2-player-kills-a-bile-titan-with-ragdoll-physics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Charger is a potent projectile</a> when used properly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/divinity-original-sin-board-game-expansions-showcase<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So, the sheer volume of content and replayability in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/divinity-original-sin-board-game-review"><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game</em></a> core set wasn't enough for you? You want more? Well, luckily enough, Larian Studios produced a lot more content out of their Kickstarter, and in this article, we'll take a look at each and see what it adds to your games. We'll try to keep it as spoiler-free as possible, so we won't post full images of the box contents in case it spoils anything from the Core Set for you.</p>

<p>If you want to hear all about the <em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game,</em> you can check out our review <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/divinity-original-sin-board-game-review">here</a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-2.jpg?itok=z2gQfYGP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-2.jpg?itok=wu4fKdVu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Divinity: Original Sin The Board Game Miniatures Upgrade Set Part 1</h2>

<p>The main box for&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>included miniatures for the 10 available characters for the players, but the bosses and minions you faced were card standees that linked to the stat cards.</p>

<p>With the Miniatures Upgrade Set 1, it brings your boss battles to life by adding in 9 miniatures for the bosses you might meet during your adventures, along with several miniatures for summons and other effects you can put into play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The miniature for the summons and other effects are very handy, and help with the immersion as it makes their location obvious (there can be a lot going on in the Divine Atlas during games), but the other miniatures are only for bosses that you might not meet during your playthrough. When they do hit the table though, the miniatures are a lot more impressive than a card standee and really help with getting into the game. It's a lot scarier being in the same location as a boss when they have a miniature.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-3.jpg?itok=rT-s4CYq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-3.jpg?itok=V__vfnXh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Divinity: Original Sin The Board Game Miniatures Upgrade Set Part 2</h2>

<p>The second Miniatures Upgrade Set adds in the final 6 miniatures for the available bosses and a bonus miniature for an NPC that you might meet.</p>

<p>As with the first set, the miniatures are only for bosses that you might not meet during your playthrough, so they won't always be in use, and may not come up during your playthrough. While these boss miniatures are a lot small than those in the Part 1 set, they're no less impressive and really help with the immersion.</p>

<p><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>Nightmare Dungeon adds two brand new modes to the game. Dungeon Mode, which takes away the story from the game and turns it into a battler challenge.</p>

<p>The expansion includes a set of cards that tell you which location to use, and a way to generate random enemies at your level (sometimes bosses) that you fight through and gain rewards. Nightmare Mode includes a set of cards that make the minions and bosses you face more challenging (and can also be used in conjunction with Dungeon Mode).</p>

<p>Nightmare Dungeon is a solid way to add an extra dimension to&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game,</em>&nbsp;and also a great way to play a filler game if a member of your gaming group can't make the regular night that you want to progress the story.</p>

<p>I'll always prefer the story mode, trying to find new story paths and secrets in the game, but if you just want to test your character and battle it out against a series of enemies, then Nightmare Dungeon does just that.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-5.jpg?itok=BBKW63a4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-5.jpg?itok=NYIap-gn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Divinity: Original Sin The Board Game Nemesis Expansion</h2>

<p><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>Nemesis adds new items, a new skill school, and extends the core campaign, along with a new boss and minions to face as part of it.</p>

<p>The new items can be used regardless, and can just be shuffled into the core items, but it order to use the Demonology skill cards, one party member has to sign the Demonic Contract at the start of the game, which then means you can access the expansion and boss at the end of the core game. The set includes the miniature for Nemesis, all the boss components, and 3 new double-sided location boards and cards for it.</p>

<p>Nemesis is my favorite expansion for&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game.</em>&nbsp;The Demonology Skill school would be enough for me, but the extra campaign and boss are also extremely enjoyable to play through.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-6.jpg?itok=QiW4sGsx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-expansions-6.jpg?itok=6sVWegSj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Divinity: Original Sin The Board Game Haunted Keep Expansion</h2>

<p><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>Haunted Keep adds new items and a side quest to the campaign. As with Nemesis, the items can be shuffled into the core items at the start of the game, even if you're not using the Haunted Keep.</p>

<p>The Haunted Keep becomes available as you progress through the main quest, and then returns you to the main quests after it's completion. It contains 3 double-sided location boards and a boss and minions to face and a new environmental effect to keep you on your toes.</p>

<p>The Haunted Keep expansion is fun to play through, adding a new dimension from the core set, with some awesome new items, that come at a cost to own them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/divinity-original-sin-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </i>by Larian Studios, the creators of <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, is a tabletop version of their other incredible video game RPG, <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em>. This tabletop incarnation is based on the sequel <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, which was released in 2017. <em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game</em> launched on Kickstarter in November 2019 and was delivered to backers early this year. The delivered version of the game has been through a few iterations of the rules, including a complete rebuild. Larian didn't want to deliver until they were completely happy that the backers were getting the quality product they deserved.</p>

<p>In this review, we'll check out what's in the box, talk about what it's like to play <i>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game</i>, and how long it takes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-full-games-components-_0.jpeg?itok=nxNnWC9p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-full-games-components-_0.jpeg?itok=es8olEJ2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>takes up a lot of space on the tabletop (Photo: Larian Studios).</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game?</h2>

<p>The <em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game</em> box is huge, which will make <em>Gloomhaven</em> players feel at home, but may be overwhelming to anyone else. Players shouldn't judge the size of the box to the complexity of the game though and it is simply an indication of the amount of content you get.</p>

<p>Larian has also designed this huge box extremely well, and the components for your first game, the Tutorial - Torture Chamber, are cleverly placed at the top of the box, all players need to do is gather the components listed on the first game leaflet, and read the first few pages of the rulebook.</p>

<p>Each session of&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>is played on the Divine Atlas, a book of maps that contains game information, and the different locations for that session. Each map has the unique rules for that area, and a series of linked locations that players can explore each turn.</p>

<p>If there are no enemies visible, then players can explore freely, traveling to locations and revealing cards that have that location's details on. Some locations offer interactions, challenges, information, loot, or reveal enemies that immediately turn the game into combat rounds until no enemies are visible again.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=Ue5mW-4Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=otH1SpKr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some simple yet effective skill card combos in&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game.</em>&nbsp; Add wet to an area to make Electirc Dischange and area of effect weapon, or gain invisible to really ramp up the damage on Throwing Knife.</figcaption></figure><p>While in explore or combat rounds, a timer is tracked on the side of the game board. When the timer reaches certain points, events occur that move the story on or can throw the players into combat. When enemies activate, a targeting die is rolled.</p>

<p>The result of the die means they will either target the closest player, or follow their targeting rule, like the player with the highest or lowest health, armor, or a space with the most players in it.</p>

<p>The game also features a number of bosses that the players may encounter. Each boss comes with their own page in the Boss booklet, and their own set of action cards to make them much more challenging than the normal enemies the players may face.</p>

<p>During the player's turns, they get a number of action points that they can use to spend on attacking with equipment they hold or using skill cards from their hand.</p>

<p>Skill cards have a range of effects, depending on what you choose during character creation, and can be offensive, like Tentacle Lash, which is an attack card that can blind your target, and deals extra damage if they're already blinded, or defensive like Defensive Stance, which lets you reroll 1 of your attackers dice, or ignore 1 if you have a shield equipped.</p>

<p>Once used, skill cards go into a cooldown track which means they can't be used again until they're back in your hand, but this clever mechanic also tracks the use of some cards, which are placed face up in the cooldown track, like Cloak and Dagger, which while it is faceup, and you are invisible, allows you can reroll 1 attack dice.</p>

The special symbols activate effects listed on skill cards or other cards you may have in play, and hits deal damage according to the skill or equipment card used. The game comes with 3 types of custom dice:</p>

<ul><li>White, the basic dice</li>
	<li>Blue, which have more special symbols</li>
	<li>Red, which have more hits</li>
</ul><p>The game is controlled by timer-activated location cards, or by the exploration cards that players interact with. Once a card tells the players to progress to the next area, the board is cleared, and the page is turned to the indicated location to start the next session.</p>

<p>In between each session, players may have the option to level up their characters where they gain base stats, earn new talents, and skill cards, heal wounds, revive downed party members, or visit the merchant to buy new equipment.</p>

<h2>Does Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game Have Multiple Story Options?</h2>

<p><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game</em> has all the story options! The Divine Atlas has 48 pages (not all scenario maps), and you won't hit all the pages in your playthrough, in fact, you might only see a quarter of them depending on your choices. Speaking to Larian at a demo night, this is not only for replayability but also so that your choices are meaningful. They wanted your decisions to actually have results based on the choices you make, not just a narrative way of getting you to the same map pages regardless of your actions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=pLWUtcp9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=ooSO7i4A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>includes 10 playable characters and their associated miniatures.</figcaption></figure><h2>Who Can You Play In Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game?</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>tutorial has 4 characters to play, and after that there are 10 characters to chose from (including the 4 from the tutorial). The available characters are:</p>

<ul><li>The Red Prince - An exiled prince, disgraced for cavorting with demons. They start with the Noble and Scholar keywords and are&nbsp;immune to fire damage.</li>
	<li>Sebille - Once previously controlled by magic to kill their own kind, now broken free and seeking vengeance on those that would control others. They have&nbsp;the Outlaw, Rogue, and Corpse Eater keywords, and gain a new skill whenever they defeat a boss.</li>
	<li>Lohse - A haunted performer who suffers from violent episodes. Begins with the Mystic and Rogue keywords, and they or a nearby ally can reroll 1 dice once per round.</li>
	<li>Beast - A banished dwarven usurper. Has the&nbsp;Barbarian and Noble keywords, and a higher starting max health than the others.</li>
	<li>Fane - Was imprisoned in a crypt for eons, and has awoken to find they are the last of their kind. Has&nbsp;the Mystic and Scholar keywords, they can return a facedown skill card to their hand the first time they defeat an enemy each round.</li>
	<li>Vali - Having already traded their mortality for undeath, they now seek to become even more powerful. They have the Culstist and Scholar keywords and start the game with an extra source (which can be spent to reroll&nbsp;once per&nbsp;scenario).</li>
	<li>Farzanah - Having fused themselves with the essence of the Dragon Knights, they now seek to prove themselves worthy. They have the Mystic and Culstist keyword and can move to an adjacent space once per round at no cost.</li>
	<li>Ifan - Having been used as a pawn to kill their own people, they now act as a mercenary, seeking vengeance on those who used them. They start with the Mercenary and Outlaw keywords and roll an extra blue dice when attacking a single target with an equipped item.</li>
	<li>Cassian - Once a Paladin of the Divine Order, now a seeker of justice against those who arranged the conspiracy that ruined their father. Has the Outlaw and Noble keywords, they can equip any 2&nbsp;hand items as 1&nbsp;item, and their physical armor is boosted when wielding 2 melee weapons.</li>
	<li>Tanguistal - A gladiator torn from their family. They have the Mercenary and Barbarian keywords and roll 3 red dice instead of white when making challenge rolls.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=B3GfMscC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=iVAABs21 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Tutorial set up for Sebille in&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game,</em> including a hand of 4 skill cards.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game Have Character Development?</h2>

<p>Each&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game </em>character has 6 levels to advance through on their stat cards, gaining health, action points, level bonuses, and source as they do. While you advance, your character also gains skill cards and talents, which are what drives your character's unique style.</p>

<p>There are 12 schools to chose skill cards from, and they each have 4 levels of cards. Level 1 and 2 can be chosen by any characters, and levels 3 and 4 can only be chosen if you have the talent that unlocks those cards. Each talent is unique, so the player who chooses that talent locks out the level 3 and 4 skill cards for other characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Skill cards are designed to combo with other skill cards, building up status effects on your enemies (like bleeding and burning) and in locations (like charged and wet), and then capitalizing on them with other skill cards that add bonus when those effects are active.</p>

<p>So it's a good idea when you level up for the first time, to have a look through the talents and skill cards, and have an idea in mind of the balance amongst your party, and who will have which talents and skills cards, as those combination attacks can really help you at higher levels of enemies.</p>

<p>One thing we didn't talk about in our review was the random stuff that can happen while you're exploring the Divine Atlas, the items you can find that have an effect on another character you meet or a situation you end up in.</p>

<p>Aside from the great artwork, solid components (did we mention the sleek storage that the box insert is?), fantastic mechanics, the scope of the story, and sheer monumental variety of character development, it's these little moments that set it apart for me from other dungeon crawler type board games.</p>

<p>I won't spoil any of them for you, and you might not even come across any in your playthrough, but it's these little moments and details that make you realize that the focus really is on the choices you've made, and it's not simply an on-rails dungeon crawler.</p>



<p>If you're a fan of the&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin </em>video games, then there's a lot to love here in its tabletop format. If it's your first ever tabletop game, then there is a lot to take in to start with, but the tutorial does a good job of getting you in and then adding in the rest of the rules after. For experienced tabletop gamers, the rules are well presented and while a lot of depth is offered, the rules aren't complex. If you've never played the video games, then the setting and game are fantastic, and you won't be disappointed.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a quick and easy pick-up game, then this isn't it. It's a hybrid between a full-blown tabletop roleplaying game and a dungeon crawler battler. While it doesn't have the full openness of an RPG, or the quick activation turn mechanics of some battler games, this finds a nice balance between the two, and allows a huge variety of character options, whilst keeping character development straightforward.</p>

<p>It does however take up a lot of table space. Once the Divine Atlas is set out, and the character and enemy boards are arranged, even without putting all the cards on the table, it still takes up most of a large dining table, so if you've only got a small place to play on, this car be awkward to set up and play.</p>

<p><em>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game</em> works well with all player levels and is best enjoyed whilst working through the whole story as a group, so make sure all of your players are in for the full experience, in order to get the most out of it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24162613/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-tampon-why-reason-item<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="c8wbv1"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24156442/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-steam-pc-nintendo-switch"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a><em> </em>stands out for a lot of reasons. It has deviously difficult puzzles and a distinct ambiance that appears to be inspired by noir filmmaking. You play as a woman named Lorelei who wanders around an extravagant hotel and solves its many mysteries. The game packs in loads of convoluted secrets, but that’s not actually what intrigued me while playing. The biggest enigma from my playthrough involved one unique item: a tampon. </p>
<p id="xlwJfO">Lorelei can store a variety of items in her elegant clamshell briefcase. When you start the game, you’ll find useful items like your car key and a tampon! Its inclusion stood out to me because tampons are such a common everyday item and yet they rarely appear in video games. I’ve been playing video games for decades and have encountered thousands of different items, but I only remember seeing tampons in one other game (that other example being the wonderful clutter-arranging game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22772131/unpacking-gamecube-retro-gaming-indie-game-pass"><em>Unpacking</em></a>).</p>
<p id="p6gPI7"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>was developed by Simogo, the same team behind the pop-infused racing game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/23/20880283/sayonara-wild-hearts-review-music"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a>. Polygon asked the studio’s co-founder, Simon Flesser, about why the team decided to add the item to the game. Flesser noted that common objects like tampons can help create a specific ambiance or feeling within the game. </p>
<p id="2DIYvU">“These everyday items and actions, like using the restroom and taking the elevator, are all there to establish a sense of mundanity, or normality,” Flesser told Polygon via email. “The more absurd and surreal components of the game feel even stranger when presented together with these ordinary elements.”</p>

<p id="kSv36q">As for the idea, it didn’t come out of any developer meeting, but at home. “It was suggested by my partner, who simply just asked why the woman does not carry tampons in her purse,” Flesser said. </p>
<p id="7Zclk6">Both my colleague Nicole Carpenter (who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24156442/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-steam-pc-nintendo-switch">reviewed</a> the game) and I had not been able to find a use for the tampon. As I’ve played, I’ve been content to try and stick the tampon in random holes and slots. This has not worked. However, this did make my co-worker and I wonder if the tampon <em>did </em>have any kind of practical application for a puzzle. As it turns out, the tampon isn’t some galaxy-brained solution to any of the game’s puzzles. As Flesser said, “It simply exists.” </p>

  <p id="npjSck">Finding the <strong>sea giant’s name</strong> in <em>Hellblade 2</em> requires you to solve another perspective-based rune puzzle. You’ll reach this part of Senua’s journey during chapter 5, “Bardarvik” (“Bárðarvík”) after you find the hiddenfolk. On your way to Bardarvik, you’ll have to fight some draugar, and then you’ll have to complete two rune puzzles before you can find Sjavarrisi the sea giant’s true name.</p>
<p id="BYpAba">To solve both of the puzzles, you’ll have to play with perspective to line up shapes in the landscape to recreate runes — just like you did back in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/24160714/hellblade-2-draugar-settlement-rune-puzzle-solution">Freyslaug</a>.</p>
<p id="YHN8jO">Our <em>Hellblade 2</em> guide will show you <strong>how and where to find the runes</strong> in both of the Bardarvik puzzles.</p>

Categories include Destruction, Excitement, Competition, Community, Challenge, Strategy, Completion, Power, Fantasy, Story, Discovery, and Design.</p><p>Quantic Foundry looked back on what's motivated gamers across the years and found all of these have remained relatively consistent except one: Strategy. "Gamers who score high on this component enjoy games that require careful decision-making and planning," its summary states. "They like to think through their options and likely outcomes.</p><p>"These may be decisions related to balancing resources and competing goals, managing foreign diplomacy, or finding optimal long term strategies. They tend to enjoy both the tactical combat in games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xcom-chimera-squad-review">XCOM</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-review">Fire Emblem</a>, as well as seeing their carefully devised plans come to fruition in games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/26/sid-meiers-civilization-vi-review">Civilization</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-review">Cities: Skylines</a>, or Europa Universalis."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/img-4108-1716395391389.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>But across its 1.7 million surveys, Quantic Foundry found that two thirds of strategy fans worldwide (except China, where gamers "have a very different gaming motivation profile") have lost interest in this element of video games. "67% of gamers today care less about strategic thinking and planning when playing games than the average gamer back in June 2015," the report reads.</p><p>"When we looked for long-term trends across the 12 motivations, we found that many motivations were stable or experienced minor deviations over the past nine years," Quantic Foundry said. "Strategy was the clear exception; it had substantially declined over the past nine years and the magnitude of this change was more than twice the size of the next largest change."</p><p>The trend was analysed but Quantic Foundry couldn't find any distinct separations between, for example, men and women or gamers based in or out of the U.S. It was likened to other trends related to a decrease in attention span, like shorter YouTube videos now generating more views and shorter lengths of time between cuts in films, but Quantic Foundry admitted "it's difficult to pin down cause and effect" and said there's a lack of evidence to solely blame social media, as many do.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"67% of gamers today care less about strategic thinking and planning when playing games.</p></div><p>The likes of Facebook, X/Twitter, TikTok, and other social media apps could have "accelerated the underlying trend", however. "Another potential hypothesis is that the increasing negativity, polarization, intrusiveness, and emotional manipulation in social media has created a persistent cognitive overload on the finite cognitive resources we have," Quantic Foundry said. "Put simply, we may be too worn out by social media to think deeply about things."</p><p>Regardless of the cause, Quantic Foundry said "it's clear that gamers have become less interested in strategic thinking over the past nine years," which "implies that gamers are now more easily cognitively overloaded when they play games and are more likely to avoid strategic complexity."</p><p>This trend may even affect how developers create and market games, though there are still plenty of strategy titles on the way.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-at-tinybuild-connect-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The indie publisher tinyBuild recently premiered its tinyBuild Connect showcase, a 20-minute stream packed with announcements, trailers, and demos. If you weren’t able to watch it live or want a reminder of everything that was shown, IGN has you covered. Here are all the games that were featured during the show:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/level-zero-extraction-1715887348575.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Level Zero: Extraction</strong></h3><p>The upcoming multiplayer extraction horror where players can take on the role of human mercenaries or alien monsters dropped a short teaser hinting at a bigger announcement at the PC Gaming Show this June. IGN got a chance to play it, and you can read all about our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/level-zero-extraction-hands-on-preview-mixing-tarkov-and-alien-isolation-beautifully"><u>hands-on impressions</u></a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/sand-1715887403518.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Sand</strong></h3><p>The Connect gave us our first look at this PvPvE extraction shooter, announced last year with an atmospheric cinematic trailer. In Sand, players descend upon a desert planet recently devastated by a massive ecological disaster. Here, they will traverse the world riding giant mechanical walkers called Tramplers, take the fight to other scavengers both on foot and aboard their Tramplers, and explore cities in search of loot before extracting off planet. If you’re excited to jump into this world, tinyBuild announced the game’s first beta, which will launch this summer.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/duckside-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Duckside</strong></h3><p>Don the feathers of a hat-wearing duck and fly into a persistent survival game with PVP, PVE, crafting, and base building. Shoot your fellow ducks out of the sky, blow up their carefully crafted bases, and keep them from doing the same to you. During the Connect, we learned that the recent beta had more than 150,000 players, but if you weren’t able to take part, good news. TinyBuild also announced a second open playtest on June 6, so you’ll have another chance to dive into the world of Duckside.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/kingmakers-1715887488981.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Kingmakers</strong></h3><p>Announced in February, Kingmakers is a mix of third-person shooter and RTS set in medieval Europe. And yes, the “third-person shooter” part is correct, because you play as a soldier who traveled back in time with a mission to alter history and save the future using modern weapons. The reveal clearly got the attention of gamers — the trailer has 11 million views across IGN’s social channels, making it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingmakers-combines-back-to-the-future-with-army-of-darkness-and-its-blowing-up-right-now-ign-next"><u>the most watched game trailer on IGN’s socials</u></a> so far this year. The new video dropped by the devs showcases even more havoc to be wreaked once the game releases into Steam Early Access later this year.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/drill-core-1715887488981.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Drill Core</strong></h3><p>The tinyBuild Connect gave us a new game reveal with Drill Core, a strategic colony sim. Drill to the heart of planets while allocating workers, researching cutting-edge tech, and fortify against nightly alien attacks. Will you choose the path of efficiency, risking the safety of your workers, or prioritize defense for survival? You can give the game a try with a brand-new playtest that is available now on Steam.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/the-king-is-watching-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>The King Is Watching</strong></h3><p>TinyBuild also revealed The King Is Watching, a kingdom-building rogue-lite with a micromanagement twist — the king’s servants only attend to their duties when he’s actually watching them. A Steam demo is available to play right now.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/rawmen-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Rawmen</strong></h3><p>Rawmen is a light-hearted, soup-slinging food fighter multiplayer arena shooter (that’s a mouthful — pun intended). You can whack the opposing team with mackerel, destroy them with dumplings, let loose with a sausage-shooting minigun, or tap into your souper chef ultimate ability. It’s coming to the Epic Games Store on July 23 and will be free to play.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/voin-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Voin</strong></h3><p>Voin is a fast-paced first-person hack-and-slash RPG inviting you to tear through hordes of enemies with fury and style. As we learned during the show, Voin has an updated demo available to play on Steam.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/astor-blade-of-the-monolith-1715887488980.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Astor: Blade of the Monolith</strong></h3><p>In this fast-paced action RPG, you play as Astor, a young warrior determined to discover the secrets behind his creators’ unforeseen demise. You’ll have an arsenal of runic weapons to use as you hunt down evil through vibrant, colorful environments to save the magical planet. The release date for Astor: Blade of the Monolith is approaching fast — it releases May 30 on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/streets-of-rogue-2-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Streets of Rogue 2</strong></h3><p>This hotly anticipated sequel is a wild, immersive sandbox RPG set in a large, randomly generated world. Your goal is to topple a corrupt president and bring yourself to power, but how you do it is up to you. Fight, farm, build, sneak, steal, or hack your way to victory, solo or with friends. We got a teaser as part of the Connect, but there’s an even bigger reveal coming at PC Gaming Show on June 9, so stay tuned.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/train-valley-world-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Train Valley World</strong></h3><p>This third entry in the Train Valley series expands the scope, allowing you to build and manage intricate railroads across the globe, design your own levels, and become a business mogul — by yourself or with friends. We got a new trailer at the Connect that revealed an August release date, so get ready to be a train tycoon.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/i-am-future-1715887488981.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>I Am Future</strong></h3><p>We’re getting a big content update for I Am Future, a single-player cozy survival game released into Steam Early Access last year, in which you play as a last survivor on Earth set to build a lush and comfy camp on a skyscraper rooftop. The new updates will add a gym-themed setting, a new weather system, quality-of-life improvements, and most importantly, cheese trees. We could all use a cheese tree.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/not-for-broadcast-1715887488981.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Not For Broadcast</strong></h3><p>It's difficult to find a game as unique as Not For Broadcast, the FMV propaganda simulator that is about to get the final DLC to conclude its story. It will bring back the full news team for the first time since 2020 and throw them into a time-bending mystery.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/punch-club-2-1715887488981.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Punch Club 2</strong></h3><p>The showcase also premiered a new Punch Club 2 DLC, called Iron Fist.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-bravo-delta-and-foxtrot-error-codes-explained.878652/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-bravo-delta-and-foxtrot-error-codes-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-bravo-delta-and-foxtrot-error-codes-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="364" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With all the popularity of Ubisoft’s newly released online shooter <em>XDefiant</em>, a few error codes have started to pop up and have become commonplace throughout its early release. Three of the more common <em>XDefiant</em> error codes are Bravo, Delta, and Foxtrot. Let’s take a look at what causes these error codes and what you can do to make them stop occurring.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-what-do-xdefiant-bravo-delta-and-foxtrot-error-codes-mean" data-injectable="false">What do <em>XDefiant</em> Bravo, Delta, and Foxtrot error codes mean?</h2> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="688" data-injectable="true">The <em>XDefiant</em> Bravo, Delta, and Foxtrot error codes indicate that there’s some sort of connection issue with <em>XDefiant</em>, though as of now it mostly pertains to server issues due to the game being overloaded with players trying to connect and play. Each of these three error codes seem to occur with a number 01-10 following them, though the number doesn’t seem to hold relevance.</p>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">In fact, the Bravo, Delta, and Foxtrot error codes themselves seem to all mean the same thing. For example, you can get a Bravo-01 error code, then retry, and immediately after get say, the Foxtrot-05 error code. Despite the difference in error code name and number, the issue is exactly the same: a connection failed.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-fix-bravo-delta-and-foxtrot-errors-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">How to fix Bravo, Delta, and Foxtrot errors in <em>XDefiant</em></h2> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">In most instances, the only thing you can do if you receive the Bravo, Delta, or Foxtrot error in <em>XDefiant</em> is to try again. Typically you just were not able to connect to the servers, which at the moment is because they are very congested due to a high player account. You basically have to try again to see if you get lucky and get in, instead of getting the error message.</p>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">However, if you continue to receive these error codes after the servers are no longer congested, there are a few connection-related troubleshooting methods you can try. Here are ways you can fix the Bravo, Delta, and Foxtrot error codes in <em>XDefiant</em>:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Restart your game.</strong> Sometimes you will have a version mismatch or simply have an unstable connection when launching. Restarting your game can fix both of these issues.</li> <li><strong>Double-check your internet connection</strong>. Make sure there is no outage with your ISP, and if you are on a wireless connection, switch to a wired one.</li> <li><strong>Verify your game files.</strong> It’s possible you have some corrupt data files, which you can fix by heading to the Ubisoft Connect launcher and clicking the three dots on <em>XDefiant</em> and then choosing Verify Files.</li> </ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rolling-stone-which-used-to-have-a-gaming-vertical-launches-another-gaming-vertical.878649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Rolling Stone announced the launch of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/rolling-stone-launches-gaming-section-1235025173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone Gaming</a>, a vertical dedicated to “taking a serious (or deeply unserious) journalistic approach to telling the story of games through the people around them.” You might be thinking, haven’t we done this before? You would be correct.</p><p>Rolling Stone <em>had</em> a gaming site, Glixel, which ran for a bit over a year before <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/glixels-san-francisco-office-closed-team-laid-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down in 2017</a>. Rolling Stone Gaming’s announcement notes this in a roundabout way, with senior editor Christopher Cruz writing, “this isn’t entirely new, <em>Rolling Stone</em> has been covering games for years. But with the launch of our new section, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/rs-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RS Gaming</a>, we’re committing to meeting the community at its own wavelength to tell stories that matter, even if you don’t consider yourself a gamer.”</p><p>Cruz writes that RS gaming is "about community, from the modders keeping beloved games alive after corporations pull the plug to the cosplayers doing themed karaoke after a mobile game meetup.”</p><p>Does that sound a little familiar? Well, when Glixel launched in 2016, general manager John Davison <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rolling-stone-publisher-launching-gaming-site" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “We want to make it very much about the people - not just the people that make games, but the people that play them.”&nbsp;Hm!</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rolling-stone-launches-gaming-vertical-with-help-from-saudi-wealth-fund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Developer</a>, RS Gaming is a partnership with ESL FACEIT Group, though “the nature of the partnership… is unclear.” ESL is owned by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/savvy-gaming-group-purchases-esl-gaming-and-faceit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Savvy Games Group</a>, which Game Developer notes is funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, whose chairperson, Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, has a<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/3/9/mohammed-bin-salman-the-dark-side-of-saudi-arabias-crown-prince" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> pretty shitty record</a> on human rights and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Jamal_Khashoggi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journalism</a>. So this sure seems like the latest volley in the regime’s attempt to spiff up its image through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23948992/saudi-arabia-gaming-investment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaming</a>, an attempt that has also involved <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/14/saudi-arabia-savvy-games-embracer-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the collapse of a deal between Savvy and Embracer</a>, which in turn led to Embracer’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruinous rampage</a> of layoffs and studio closures.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this, Saudi Arabia still maintains minority investments in Nintendo, Take-Two, EA, Nexon, and Capcom, as well as Embracer. Last year, Savvy Games Group <a href="https://savvygames.com/savvy-games-group-completes-acquisition-of-scopely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired mobile developer Scopely</a> for $4.9 billion. In addition, it has <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/09/29/saudi-arabia-invest-37-billion-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set aside $13 billion</a> "for the acquisition and development of a leading game publisher to become a strategic development partner." Saudi Arabia has also demonstrated a particular interest in esports, with companies like Riot rebuffing its advances (<a href="https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/29558777/lec-ends-neom-partnership-following-staff-outrage?utm_source=www.jacobwolf.report&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=saudi-state-backed-esports-world-cup-to-host-league-of-legends-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after staff outcry</a>) in 2020, <a href="https://www.jacobwolf.report/p/saudi-statebacked-esports-world-cup-host-league-legends-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only to participate</a> in the Saudi-backed Esports World Cup this year. All of this on top of substantial Saudi ventures in the worlds of <a href="https://defector.com/tag/saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sports</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_International_Film_Festival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film</a>, and even <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/mma/news/major-update-wwe-future-with-saudi-arabia-before-king-queen-ring-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pro wrestling</a>.</p><p>This is also not the first time Rolling Stone has launched a gaming-adjacent venture since Glixel. In 2021, the publication rolled out its own Twitch channel as part of <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/twitch-partnerships-rolling-stone-complex-vice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a partnership with Twitch</a>. The channel and its hosts were generally well liked on the platform -- a notoriously tough nut for traditional media to crack -- but once the partnership ended, <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1679166251493474314" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so did the channel</a>. </p><p>On the back of yesterday’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad games journalism news</a>, part of me <em>really</em> wants to be excited to see a mainstream outlet investing in gaming, but… well, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2023/03/31/launcher-mission-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we know how these things go</a>. Here's hoping history doesn't repeat itself, or at least we get some good journalism out of it before it does.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the new film has a tendency to treat its namesake as the fulcrum around which a story is happening instead of someone participating in it, which is a shame considering how she’s the big draw.</p><p>Whereas previous <em>Mad Max </em>films have essentially been snapshots from a war-torn future, <em>Furiosa </em>chronicles the entire young adulthood of Furiosa (Alyla Browne in flashbacks and Anya Taylor-Joy closer to the present), one of the last people to know what it was like to grow up in the fabled Green Place of Many Mothers. Furiosa is just one of many kids able to truly thrive in the Green Place thanks to its natural abundance (read: fresh food and water) and relative seclusion within the treacherous Australian wasteland. But for all the safety Furiosa feels in her early years, she’s also keenly aware of how tenuous that security is. When her people are ultimately attacked by raiders, she knows the Green Place’s survival in secrecy hinges on the outsiders’ deaths.</p><p>By opening <em>Furiosa </em>in the Green Place and foregrounding it as the environment that first shaped Furiosa herself, Miller establishes early on how interested he is in using this film to illustrate the durability of ideas. As Furiosa’s snatched away from her idyllic home and enslaved by sadistic warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth), the film spotlights how life in the wasteland can turn people into their most monstrous selves. But Furiosa’s memories of the Green Place, and its impact on how she sees the world, are part of what make her so well-suited to deal with the outside horrors.</p><p>Whereas <em>Fury Road </em>often<em> </em>felt like a gasoline and piss-soaked lucid dream punctuated with guitar riffs and the roar of flamethrowers, <em>Furiosa </em>unfolds much more like a stage play told in bookended acts that all crystalize how Furiosa became a warrior. Miller and co-writer Nico Lathouris emphasize the importance of Furiosa’s perceptiveness as the film fleshes out the cast of weatherbeaten ghouls who serve Dementus. These include The History Man (George Shevtsov) and interpretive dance proclaimer Smeg (David Collins). Though none of Dementus’ goons can make sense of why the enslaved girl won’t speak, through them, she’s able to learn what it means to live among predatory strongmen who harness fear as a weapon.</p><p>It’s interesting to see more of <em>Max Max</em>’s dystopian world from the perspective of Dementus’ gang — a band of motorcycle-riding maniacs who frequently turn on one another both out of spite and necessity.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Furiosa can’t initially perceive it, there’s a distinct difference between the cultures of Dementus’ horde and that of the Citadel where Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme) rules his fanatic War Boys and enforcers like Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke). In Praetorian Jack, you can see shades of Tom Hardy’s Max Rockatansky, which brings a narrative poetry to the larger Furiosa story Miller has been telling with the franchise’s last two films. But from the moment Furiosa meets Dementus, you can almost immediately hear Miller and Lathouris struggling to lock in on what kind of presence they want their mad biker king to be.</p><p>Similar to Fury<em> Road</em>’s Immortan Joe before him, Dementus is another font of absurd masculinity whose cartoonish effects contrast with his bloodlust and penchant for torture. Through a face full of prosthetics that distract more than transform, Hemsworth tries to bring Dementus to life with an energy that’s meant to read as unhinged but tends to play as scatterbrained. You can see the spark of a complicated altruism in the paternal shine he takes to Browne’s haunted, adolescent Furisosa toward the beginning of the movie. But as the film brings the Biker Horde and the War Boys together in a prolonged power struggle, Dementus starts to feel more like a character stitched together from leftover ideas for Immortan Joe that didn’t make it into <em>Fury Road</em> or the 2015 <em>Mad Max </em>video game.</p><p>That feeling of Dementus being an echo of <em>Mad Max </em>villains past intensifies as the younger Immortan Joe — a more level-headed, cautious version of his <em>Fury Road </em>self — becomes a bigger part of <em>Furiosa</em>. The characters’ similarities feel like two expressions of what kind of archetypal tyrant would crave and attract power in the wake of society’s collapse. They’re both macabre brutes whose rages frequently seem to mask deep-seated insecurities about their places in the world. But <em>Furiosa</em>’s characterization of Immortan Joe and his mutilated failsons Scrotus (Josh Helman) and Erectus (Nathan Jones) does so much more to make the movie feel like an organic extension of <em>Fury Road</em> rather than a fancy new limb grafted on in response to the earlier film’s success.</p><p>Immortan Joe and his War Boys are also an important part of how <em>Furiosa</em> brings Taylor-Joy’s Imperator-to-be into the picture. And while the older Furiosa continues to say so little that she often feels like the latest example of the silent / deadly girl trope, she also becomes the focal point of some of the movie’s most impressive set pieces. <em>Furiosa</em>’s action sequences — chases through the desert and battles in places like the oil-rich Gas Town — all feel smaller in comparison to <em>Fury Road </em>in a way that actually helps the film establish its own identity.&nbsp;</p><p>The sequences’ scale and the way shots of explicit carnage are obfuscated by clouds of smoke and sand almost make it seem as if Miller’s reminding you how much more dire things become for Furiosa in the future. But the steely-eyed determination with which Taylor-Joy’s Furiosa moves through the film’s last third is mesmerizing — at least in moments when the movie just lets her be the star rather than the person who’s forced to step up when the men around her can’t quite get the job done.&nbsp;</p><p>For all of Taylor-Joy’s ability to command attention when she’s on-screen, <em>Furiosa </em>still makes its heroine feel like a supporting character in her own movie. This happens essentially right up until its final act, which comes closer to <em>Fury Road</em> than you might expect. And while the two films connect in a way that makes them work as a double feature, watching them back-to-back highlights just how much more the 2015 film gave Furiosa to do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="NjYYdQ">The job of raising a hero destined to save the world is an underrated role. In video games, many of our RPG heroes come to us as fully grown adults who are old enough to handle being whatever kind of hero they need to be for the game they’re in. We don’t need to worry about bathing them, making sure they don’t poop themselves, or raising them in the right way so that they can have the right powers for whatever class of fighter they grow up to be. To be honest, I never considered the early years of the hero. That is, until I played <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417850/Yolk_Heroes_A_Long_Tamago/"><em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em></a>.</p>
<p id="SZ3Vop">Developed by the small studio 14 Hours Productions and published by Astrolabe Games, <em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em> starts with a fairy. She lays an egg (in front of you) and tells you that she doesn’t want to raise it (rude!). She then gives you the egg and says that it’s up to you to raise the creature so that it can grow up to be a hero who saves the land of Faria from the Frog Lord. Thus began the biggest adventure of them all: parenthood. I named my character Beadle (like the scrawny salesman Beedle from The Legend of Zelda games), because I didn’t know what would emerge from the egg. After a brief few minutes of tending to the egg and playing a simple minigame where I protected it from the elements, a whole-ass human baby hatched from the egg — Beadle was a girl!</p>
<p id="C7Yu8p"><em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em> contains all the trappings of your typical pet sim <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24145363/stardew-valley-like-idle-farming-sim-rustys-retirement">and idle game</a> — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23777555/tamagotchi-uni-killed-wore-wedding">like a Tamagotchi</a> — but then adds a whole bunch of other stuff onto that framework. On the most basic level you can tend to your Yolk Hero at the guild where they live. There, you manage your future hero’s four different status bars — energy, hunger, hygiene, and bladder — by taking actions like bathing them or sending them to use the toilet. Each task takes a set amount of time unless you decide to help your Yolk Hero by playing a simple mini game. So Beadle might take a minute and half to poop by herself, but I can shorten the amount of time it takes and lessen her constipation by button smashing my mouse. </p>

<p id="G09sd1">The game gets more complicated when it comes to the “heroes” part of it all. I can send Beadle on little adventures where she’ll fight a series of enemies with short walking breaks in between. A quest might take 30 minutes to complete, but I can step in to allow Beadle to complete the quest much more quickly by helping her fight. These quests introduce systems with a surprising amount of depth: Area 1 contains 12 different quests, during which you can level up your Yolk Hero. Player characters even develop specific skills for different classes like Monk, Ninja, Paladin, and so on. Beadle grew up to be a Samurai, which I didn’t pick but might have been influenced by the training I had her do in her child stage, so I would buy items and upgrades specifically tailored for her class to maximize her odds of success.</p>
<p id="z9WKOX">Turns out I am a bit of a helicopter parent, so I’ve been watching her fight a goose wearing a kimono to the left of my browser as I write this. If I see she’s having a tough time with a fight, I click over and give her a little boost to make sure she stays safe. That might make this game sound a bit demanding, but the greatest part of <em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em> is that I feel like I can put as much or as little time into it as I’d like.</p>
<p id="pu8szC">I still have memories of rushing off to the bathroom to feed my needy Tamagotchi as a child, but I don’t deal with that in <em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em>. I am taking care of a budding hero. She might not be the most powerful warrior in the land, but she’s not so helpless that I need to be checking in on her all the time. </p>
<p id="nxGBRe">What’s more is that the game has settings that allow you to decide details of gameplay like whether or not you want the game to continue to run in the background when you close it or not. So if you want to turn off care for your character for the weekend when you’re away from your desk, you can. Similarly along those lines, features like the task queue allow you to line up a to-do list for your Yolk Hero. So when I left for dinner last night, I set up a little evening routine for her so she would come back with her status bars in good shape. </p>

<p id="8EATfi">Each time I log off, I feel a small pang of anxiety: Will my Yolk Hero be okay? What if she dies on her quest? I worry about my poor Beadle — but never for too long. </p>
<p id="xvBcNd">Again, that’s because <em>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</em> is an idle game that gives you a good amount of flexibility as to how much time you actually spend playing. If you want to get really into adventuring and help your Yolk Hero fight and explore, you can. If you just want to watch them bop around on the side of the screen as you work, that’s also possible. Or if you have moments where it’s just too much, you can just close the game entirely and allow your hero to work through their challenges themselves. </p>
<p id="DQlqSh">The joy of parenthood — at least, as it’s represented in the sweet little microcosm of this game — is about seeing growth, but also knowing when it’s okay to step away and let your child surprise you. </p>

<p data-characters="160" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With two versions of <em>Wuthering Wave’s</em> main character, the Rover, up for grabs at the start of the game, you might be wondering which one you should pick. </p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Many gacha games will put players in this position as they will provide a male and female version of the character, and people will always want to know if there is any advantage between one or the other. In this guide, we will break it all down for you.</p> <h2 id="h-is-there-a-difference-between-the-male-and-female-rover" data-injectable="false">Is there a difference between the male and female Rover?</h2> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">There isn’t any important difference between the male and female Rover. Their abilities and strengths are the same; they will use the same weapon and upgrade materials, and they will go through the story the same way. The Intimacy system that dictates your relationships with other characters will also remain the same, no matter what character you pick.</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">The difference between the male and female characters really boils down to things that can be determined by personal preference. Which character model do you prefer? Do you think the male or female voice actor is better? Do you typically just play as one or the other gender in your games? It honestly doesn’t matter. </p> <figure data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Wuthering Waves Female and Male Rover Comparison" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fzqJU_nb5dI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">The only real difference between the two characters is their attack animations. I’ve embedded a comparison video above so you can have a good look at both characters as they move through their attacks. Personally, I prefer the female animations. There is just something very cool about the behind-the-back sword work that she does after some combos. </p> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="606" data-injectable="false">If you are curious about the other characters and how they stack up when compared to each other, be sure to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-character-tier-list-main-dps-secondary-dps-and-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out our Tier List</a> to find out who is worth chasing down and investing in for your party and who is better off for simple story missions.</p>

<p data-characters="247" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A new developers discussion for <em>Genshin Impact</em> details some new quality of life updates coming in Version 4.7. The most notable change is an increase to the amount of Original Resin a player can hold. Here’s what that actually means for players.</p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="199" data-injectable="false">These changes should take place with the Version 4.7 update, which is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-roadmap-and-update-schedule-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled</a> to be on <strong>June 5, 2024.</strong> We will find out more about what’s new in Version 4.7 when the special program airs on <a href="https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1793129862229827913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 24</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-genshin-impact-s-new-resin-cap" data-injectable="false">Genshin Impact’s new Resin cap</h2> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">With the Version 4.7 update, the total amount of Original Resin a player can hold will be <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/28920205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased</a> from 160 to 200. Since one Resin refreshes every eight minutes, this means your Resin will now cap in about 26 hours instead of the previous 21 hours.</p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">If you were already logging in multiple times a day so that your Resin never reaches the cap, this change won’t affect you. However, for players who only log in once per day, they now have the ability to log in at the same time every day without losing Resin. No matter your preference, this change offers a bit more flexibility for players to play the game on their own schedule.</p> <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">In <em>Genshin Impact,</em> Original Resin is the stamina currency used to earn rewards from gameplay. World bosses cost 40 Resin to claim their rewards, and most other materials cost 20 Resin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">When <em>Genshin Impact </em>first released, the Resin cap was only 120. This forced players to log in every 16 hours if they wanted to maximize their limited resources. The cap was increased to 160 Resin in November of 2020 for Version 1.1.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Images via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-other-quality-of-life-changes" data-injectable="false">Other quality of life changes</h2> <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="105" data-injectable="false">The developers discussion also outlined some other changes coming to <em>Genshin Impact</em> with the next update.</p> <h3 id="h-increased-item-caps" data-injectable="false">Increased item caps</h3> <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">The maximum number of forging ores, character EXP books, artifact EXP, and cooking ingredients will be increased. Hoarders rejoice!</p> <h3 id="h-more-friends" data-injectable="false">More friends</h3> <p data-characters="133" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">The friends list will be expanded to accommodate up to 100 friends.

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has announced that its popular action roleplaying series, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>, will be making its way to Steam for the first time ever. Currently available on PlayStation 4 , Xbox One, Nintendo Switch (cloud) and PC (via the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/epic-games-store">Epic Games Store</a>), the three following titles will make their Steam debut on June 13th, 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</li>
<li>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="KINGDOM HEARTS - Steam Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5_3qdf19BU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In addition, both HD collection and the beefed up KH3 package can be purchased in the Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece bundle. If you’ve been wondering what all the fuss is about, this is the perfect gateway for any curious PC players out there.</p>
<p>Kingdom Hearts made its PlayStation 2 debut way back in 2002 and has continued to grow a zealous following. It’s core concept back in the day was fascinating, fusing together multiple Disney worlds in a quest that had all the hallmarks of a JRPG classic.</p>
<p>Over the years Kingdom Hearts has expanded and mutated across multiple platforms, spinning an increasingly convoluted yarn for more than two decades. The upcoming Steam releases contain more than just the three mainline entries in the series with <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">Square Enix providing a handy breakdown</a> of everything included:</p>

<h3>KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</h3>
<p>This compilation contains four full games, with two additional story experiences for good measure.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS FINAL MIX</strong> – The game that started it all, remastered with HD visuals, improved controls, a reworked soundtrack, and more. This is the game that introduced us to Sora – a brave lad with big feet and a bigger heart.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS Re:Chain of Memories</strong> – Set directly after the events of the first game, Sora, Donald and Goofy enter the mysterious Castle Oblivion, and stumble into an adventure that’s forgettable in the best possible way! …That’ll make more sense when you’ve played it.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS 358/2 Days (HD Remastered Cinematics)</strong> – This story focuses on Roxas, a new character with a special connection to Sora. The compilation features cinematics from the original game, enhanced with additional text and remastered in HD.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS II FINAL MIX</strong> – The second numbered game reunites Sora, Donald and Goofy in an epic adventure across some of the most memorable and unexpected Disney worlds in the series. Like Tron – Tron’s in here!</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS Birth by Sleep FINAL MIX</strong> – Prequel time! This game turns back the clock to before Sora ever wielded a keyblade and shifts the focus onto three new characters: Terra, Ventus and Aqua. It’s an emotional adventure with a wildly entertaining battle system – there’s a reason it’s a real fan favorite.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS Re:Coded</strong> (HD Remastered Cinematics) – This hi-tech tale takes Data Sora into the digital world to seek an answer about a cryptic message. The compilation features enhanced cinematics only.</p>
<h3>KINGDOM HEARTS HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</h3>
<p>This collection of games is a real dream for fans. It contains games that focus on some of the most popular characters in the series, Sora, Riku and Aqua, and set up the climax to the saga.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS Dream Drop Distance HD</strong> – Sora and Riku take their Mark of Mastery exams to become true keyblade wielders. Things do not go as planned – if you thought your exams were stressful, you ain’t seen nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A fragmentary passage-</strong> – Made specifically for this collection, this episode gives you control of Aqua, following the dramatic ending of Birth by Sleep. It’s a short and sweet adventure that leads directly into KINGDOM HEARTS III.</p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS χ Back Cover (movie)</strong> – An HD movie that goes back in the timeline even further than Birth by Sleep. It tells the story of the Foretellers – but who are they and what will they mean for the KINGDOM HEARTS series?</p>
<h3>KINGDOM HEARTS III + Re Mind (DLC)</h3>
<p>The Dark Seeker Saga reaches its climax in KINGDOM HEARTS III. The Guardians of Light gather for the final battle against the forces of Darkness</p>
<p>Before that though, Sora must travel through a whole new set of Disney and Pixar worlds. He’ll team up with Buzz and Woody to explore a toy store, untangle a mother’s sinister plot with Rapunzel, soar across the skies of San Fransokyo with Baymax, and much more.</p>
<p>The PC version also includes the Re Mind DLC as standard. It features additional story content, some of the toughest and most exciting boss battles in the whole series, and loads of additional features, including gameplay modifiers and photo galleries.</p>
<p>In terms of pricing, we imagine the Steam versions will land within the same ballpark as the Epic Game Store releases with HD 1.5+2.5 at £39.99, and the others at £49.99, all with a potential launch day discount.</p>

With the decision to pull the game from sale and turn off its servers for months on end after allowing people to sink their real-life money into unlocking costumes and such (with no refunds), its developers are now looking to seemingly give something back in return.</p>

<p>Player First Games <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes">say</a> they will let anyone who played MultiVersus’ beta hop into its first season’s premium battle pass without paying a penny. That’ll also mean you’ll be able to unlock the game’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-smash-bros-fighter-multiversus-adds-friday-the-13ths-jason-and-the-matrixs-agent-smith-to-its-already-preposterous-roster">absolutely wedge-ified Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th</a> - the first reward on the paid pass - for free rather than paying money, too. (He’ll be offered for in-game currency and character tokens down the road if you miss him.)</p>
<p>The developers also sought to reassure folks coughing up cash for the track that they’ll get their money’s worth, by saying they’re bumped the number of “high-value” items -  ringouts, alternate characters, taunts and the in-game currency of Gleamium, a word I instantly dislike - across both the free and premium passes. In Fortnite fashion, climbing far enough up the battle pass will earn you enough Gleamium (shudder) to cover the cost of the next battle pass without investing any more real money, so you can technically pay once and then just play enough over its eight-week length to keep unlocking everything.</p>
<p>On top of the free battle pass, beta players will also get a costume for Adventure Time’s Finn the Human that sticks the lanky hero in a snug snow suit, plus a “special edition” ringout animation featuring some rising stars.</p>

<p>There’ll be plenty to grab for fans of, uh, anthropomorphic bananas, too, as Adventure Time’s surprise contender, the Banana Guard, will be unlockable as a playable character by working your way through a seven-day tutorial track. Completing the full week-long reward calendar will also get you Lady Banana Guard, who is exactly who you’d expect based on that name. To complete the banana offerings, players back from the open beta will be able to switch their announcer to a Banana Guard voice pack. That’s absolutely… <em>surprising</em>!</p>
<p>To grab the goods, you’ll need to log in to the returning <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play game</a> between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/almost-a-year-after-ending-its-open-beta-multiversus-will-return-on-may-28th">its (re)launch date on May 28th</a> and June 11th. Based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/multiversus-lacks-that-nintendo-polish-but-its-still-a-slick-smash-bros-like-in-open-beta">Ed’s time with it back in 2022</a>, MultiVersus is a fairly promising contender for a slick and entertaining Smash Bros-like on PC - no doubt doubly so if you’re a massive fan of Warner Bros IP, for some reason.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/24162578/delicious-in-dungeon-kobold-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Rt8VSN">Why do <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24025746/delicious-in-dungeon-netflix-finally-some-good-food"><em>Delicious in Dungeon</em></a>’s kobolds look like sexy dog people? You’re not the only one wondering.</p>
<p id="Rg1PAo">If you’ve played <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> you’re probably familiar with kobolds. Introduced all the way back in Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons in the 1970s, the creatures look like small, bipedal dragons in the 5th edition of the tabletop RPG.</p>
<p id="ftB4UQ">But in <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em>, kobolds look… like dogs! So is mangaka Ryoko Kui just messing with us? Not at all.</p>
<p id="IZGU3D"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/kobold">Kobolds come from German mythology</a>, where they’re usually depicted as kind of typical goblin-y critters. They’re mischievous spirits that help or hinder around the house, depending on how annoyed they are with you.</p>
<p id="N49OvN">When Dungeons &amp; Dragons creator <a href="https://www.belloflostsouls.net/2022/01/dd-monster-spotlight-kobolds.html">Gary Gygax wrote his rulebooks in the 1970s</a>, he described kobolds as distantly related to goblins, but with “doglike voices.” Accordingly, the kobold in the original monster manual is depicted as a dog-like humanoid.</p>
<p id="VtZFra">Over the next nearly 50-odd years, Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ kobolds became more and more reptilian with each edition of the game. But in Japan, a different game hit: the computer RPG series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24146605/delicious-in-dungeon-video-game-inspirations">Wizardry</a>. <em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em> came out in 1981, and it was heavily inspired by D&amp;D. But its kobolds kept the dog-like features of the original D&amp;D monster manual!</p>

<p id="gbLeXj">As the years went by and more Wizardry games came out, kobolds continued to resemble humanoid wolves, while the Western tabletop counterpart grew into something more reptilian.</p>
<p id="v95bUb">Ryoko Kui has talked about how <a href="https://x.com/Gaearth/status/1758134409788822011">she grew up watching her dad play the Wizardry games</a>, and how inspired she was by the monster design. Her kobold design has a long legacy in Japan.</p>
<p id="H4IsZ1">That being said, she is perhaps the first person brave enough to make kobolds <em>hot</em>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-modern-horizons-3-spoilers-mdfc-dual-land<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A first look at a unique cycle of lands from MTG's next set.</h2></div><div><section><p>Preview season for Magic: The Gathering’s next set, Modern Horizons 3, is in full swing, and we’ve got an exclusive look at 10 uncommon cards! This is a cycle of two-color MDFCs (modal double-faced cards), meaning you can play them either as the spell on the front side or the land on the back, with each one representing one of Magic’s color pairs. (You can preorder Modern Horizons 3 cards at <a href="https://zdcs.link/R0b5V" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.)</p><p><strong>Flip through the image gallery below to see all 10 new cards</strong>:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>MTG: 10 New Cards from Modern Horizons 3 - Double-Faced Dual Land Cycle</h3></div></output><p>This cycle of double-faced cards is rather unique compared to similar designs – Magic has had plenty of single-color MDFC lands, with a spell on one side and a land that taps for the same color on the other, but this is the first time we’ve seen dual lands like this. The spell on the front uses hybrid mana (meaning its cost can be paid with mana of either color that is shown), providing a lot of flexibility in how each card could be used.</p><p>That will likely be enough to make a few of them an appealing choice for Commander players looking to sneak more spells into their mana bases, and probably useful pick-ups when doing a booster draft for Modern Horizons 3. Of course, I’m certainly no pro, and I generally don’t play the Modern format that this set is largely designed around, so I can’t speak to the exact power level of the individual cards here without inevitably making a fool of myself.</p><p>That said, there are some clear synergies that this sort of design enables that seem worth pointing out. For example, they provide welcome support to a fun but currently fringe card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/brr/18/goblin-charbelcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Goblin Charbelcher</u></a>, which attempts to kill the opponent by using a deck that runs no cards with lands on the front face. That strategy previously had no access to dual lands to fix its mana, but now it has 10 more to choose from (though the red-green and green-blue options are likely the most relevant to it).</p><p>On top of that, it’s possible that the actual effects of these spells might not matter much when it comes to their usability. That’s because some of the most powerful cards currently played in Modern can be cast for free as long as you exile a card of a specific color from your hand. Running a blue-black dual land that can <em>also</em> be used to cast either <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/50/force-of-negation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Force of Negation</u></a> or <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/87/grief" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Grief</u></a> (both Modern staples) for free could just be an appealing enough proposition on its own in the right deck.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But again, I’m no pro, and I’m sure it won’t take long for those who are to pick these cards apart and find all the best (and worst) ways to use them. For my money, I’m just glad they are at the uncommon rarity rather than anything more scarce, as I could certainly see a few of them becoming staples of budget Commander mana bases in the future.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-modern-horizons-3-expansion-is-up-for-preorder">Modern Horizons 3 is available for pre-order now</a>. It's set to launch officially on June 14, with paper prereleases taking place starting June 7 and its digital debut on MTG Arena on June 11. </p><p><em></em><a href="https://x.com/TomRMarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

"Combination of Dota 2, Team Fortress 2, Overwatch, Valorant, Smite, and Orcs Must Die," the account claimed.</p><p>"Hero design pretty much inspired by Dota universe," <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791115270905290793" rel="nofollow ">Gabe Follower posted several days ago</a>. "Main map references modern steampunk European city--little bit like Half-Life. Initially game had sci-fi elements inspired by Half-Life and Portal, but after bad feedback dev team decided to focus on fantasy."</p><p>Several heroes have also been revealed, including the impish Ivy, gentleman demon Infernus, sneaky operative Haze, glass cannon Lady Geist, and pale sniper Vindicta. Interestingly, several of these characters have a "great for new players" tag, suggesting a beginner-friendly approach for newcomers. There's also a closer look at the training modes on offer in the game, giving players a chance to become familiar with the controls and gameplay of Deadlock.</p><p>If Deadlock is Valve's next game, it'll be facing some stiff competition in this market. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/" data-ref-id="5000-509039">Valorant</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> have sizable audiences, while NetEase's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522324/" data-ref-id="1100-6522324">Marvel Rivals</a> also looks set to make a big splash in the competitive gaming genre when it's eventually released.</p>

If you're a fan of Hero Mastery Gauntlet, tough luck, as it'll no longer be available to play starting Season 11.</p><p>"Hero Mastery Gauntlet was intended to bring the high score-chasing excitement of Hero Mastery missions into a multiplayer format," reads an update in the <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/update-regarding-hero-mastery-gauntlet/901366" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blizzard forums</a>.

<p>If you're wondering about the Lifetime Challenges for the mode, these will remain active until the end of Season 10. This includes competing on the mode's top 500 leaderboards.</p><p>Blizzard added that Individual Hero Mastery Solo Courses will continue to be available, and there'll be more courses added in upcoming seasons.</p><p>Hero Mastery Gauntlet has groups of three players banding together in tower defense-style matches, fighting against waves of bots. It spans across 10 rounds, and there are four difficulty options to choose from.</p><p>According to <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/hero-mastery-gauntlet-is-dead-too/903016/38" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">discussions by the community</a>, the reception from many players wasn't especially positive, with some hoping Blizzard would, at some point, iterate on the idea enough to entice players to return to it.</p><p>Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-overwatch-2-is-changing-and-what-the-future-holds-after-hero-modes-cancelation/1100-6519069/#:~:text=On%20May%2016%2C%202023%2C%20Blizzard,it%20was%20scrapping%20the%20idea." data-ref-id="1100-6519069">announced</a> it was scrapping the long-awaited Hero mode back in 2023.

<p data-characters="298" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant</em> is finally here after a long road of development and several beta weekends over the past few years. If you’re like me and have been itching to play this game more, this is your chance to sink your teeth in and get a new flavor of the <em>Call of Duty</em>-style gameplay we’re used to. </p> <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">If you’re enjoying it enough, then you might be considering spending money on the game to support it or get cosmetics. Here are all the Founder’s Packs in <em>XDefiant</em>, their prices, and what they include.</p> <h2 id="h-all-xdefiant-founder-s-packs-and-what-they-include" data-injectable="false">All XDefiant Founder’s Packs and what they include</h2> <figure data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="211" data-injectable="false">At launch, <em>XDefiant</em> features three tiers of Founder’s Pack with increasing rewards, while including everything from the previous Founder’s Packs. Each Pack includes the following at each price point:</p> <ul data-found-items="28" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="1331" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Founder’s Pack</strong> – $19.99 <ul> <li data-index="0">Game Over P90 Skin.</li> <li data-index="1">Game Over Sebastian Skin.</li> <li data-index="2">DedSec Player Card.</li> <li data-index="3">Bronze Founder’s Player Card.</li> <li data-index="4">1,000 XCoins.</li> <li data-index="5">DedSec Faction.</li> <li data-index="6">Five Weapon XP Boosters.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Founder’s Pack Elite</strong> – $39.99 <ul> <li data-index="7">Game Over P90 Skin.</li> <li data-index="8">Game Over Sebastian Skin.</li> <li data-index="9" data-injectable="true">Masquerade Singa Skin.</li>
 <li data-index="10">DedSec Player Card.</li> <li data-index="11">Bronze and Silver Founder’s Player Cards.</li> <li data-index="12">3,000 XCoins.</li> <li data-index="13">DedSec Faction.</li> <li data-index="14">10 Weapon XP Boosters.</li> <li data-index="15">Preseason Battle Pass.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Founder’s Pack Ultimate</strong> – $69.99 <ul> <li data-index="16">Game Over P90 Skin.</li> <li data-index="17">Game Over Sebastian Skin.</li> <li data-index="18">Masquerade Singa Skin.</li> <li data-index="19">DedSec Player Card.</li> <li data-index="20">Bronze, Silver, and Gold Founder’s Player Cards.</li> <li data-index="21">5,000 XCoins.</li> <li data-index="22">Anodized Rhino Skin.</li> <li data-index="23">Anodized Iselda Skin.</li> <li data-index="24">One additional Anodized skin.</li> <li data-index="25">DeadSec Faction + all four Year 1 factions when released.</li> <li data-index="26">20 Weapon and 20 Battle Pass XP Boosters.</li> <li data-index="27">Preseason Battle Pass.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">It’s important to note that if you already have the DedSec faction unlocked before purchasing, you won’t be given a bonus in trade. It’ll simply be less value in the Founder’s Pack.</p> <h2 id="h-which-founder-s-pack-is-worth-buying" data-injectable="false">Which Founder’s Pack is worth buying?</h2> <p data-characters="573" data-current-count="778" data-injectable="false">As for which Founder’s Pack you should buy, it’s suggested that you <strong>don’t go further than the Founder’s Pack Elite</strong>. While some of the perks of the Founder’s Pack Ultimate are nice, the various factions can be earned through gameplay. You’ll also still get the battle pass from the Elite tier. Otherwise, the choice between the Founder’s Pack and Founder’s Pack Elite is up to what you’re willing to spend on the game. Spend some time with the game first and see how much you plan to commit before forking over the cash.</p>

<p data-characters="174" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Netflix YouTube channel just released a teaser that finally reveals Liam Hemsworth in the role of Geralt of Rivia for the upcoming fourth season of <em>The Witcher</em> TV series.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="The Witcher: Season 4 | First Look | Netflix" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kr3br-3i8TY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">The teaser only show’s Geralt’s back, his wolf school medallion, and then his bright face and yellowed eyes. Nothing about his appearance is a departure from the previous look, except for Liam’s leaner physique. Some fans might take issue with it, but the costume crew certainly won’t, as it will result in fewer costumes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-got-so-ripped-for-the-witcher-that-he/1100-6472420/">ripped apart by a Witcher that’s just too buff for them to handle.</a></p>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">You could perhaps say that Liam Hemsworth’s Geralt looks more apprehensive than confident — unlike Henry Cavill’s take on the character. That might be his choice for the role, or a look imbued by reality as he knows he has big shoes to fill after Henry Cavill’s unexpected firing from the show.</p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">My take? Well, he pulls off the Geralt look, and certainly looks much better than Henry Cavill did in that cheap-ass wig from Netflix’s make-up test that somehow ended up as the character’s big reveal. Yes, we will <em>never</em> forget.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Make Up Test: Henry Cavill as The Witcher (2019) TV Netflix" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ET69EGN9iT0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">The big question, I’m afraid, is not whether Hemsworth will look and act the part, but whether he’ll go for a new take on the character, or try to copy Cavill’s outing. Sadly, I believe fans might not be too keen on either. Still, I believe Liam Hemsworth is deserving of a chance, simply for having had the guts to take on the role.</p>
 <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="204" data-injectable="false"><em>The Witcher’s</em> fourth season still doesn’t have a release date, but you can play <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a></em> on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and on PC.</p>

            <p>The classic anime series Gundam examines the traumatic experience of war, particularly the unalterable effect it has on those young soldiers forced to participate in the horrors of fighting for their life while taking the lives of others using weapons of inhuman strength and devastation. Which clearly makes it the perfect fit for a bit of upcoming DLC for military-fetishising interactive gun range Call of Duty.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone-wzm-season-4-maps-modes-zombies-announcement">incoming crossover</a> with Mobile Suit Gundam - as the original seventies animated series was called, before it evolved with the likes of direct follow-up Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and spin-offs such as Iron Blooded Orphans the recent (and very, very excellent) Witch from Mercury - will manifest itself as a set of Operator skins, weapons, finishing moves and other such gubbins in the next season of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Warzone</a>.</p>
<p>Season 4 of MW3 and Warzone will add skins based on two of the iconic mecha in the older series: the RX-78-2 piloted by Amuro Ray, equipped with its Beam Rifle and shield, and the magnificent MS-06S Zaku II controlled by long-running villain Char Aznable, complete with the axe-like Heat Hawk. A third skin will then offer up The Witch from Mercury’s XVX-016 Gundam Aerial, affectionately piloted by Suletta Mercury, and its Beam Rifle, which doubles as a glowing sword in the anime.</p>

<p>The Gundam Tracer Packs will appear sometime next month, and will only run for a certain amount of time before they vanish off to wherever Gundam Evolutions go to when they die. Alongside the full skin and weapon packs, there’ll be some extra unlockables you won’t need to pay money for, offering up the chance to nab another weapon blueprint, a weapon camo, stickers, emblems, a weapon charm, calling cards and more across Warzone and MW3.</p>
<p>What is weird about all this is that the Gundams have to be shrunk down to the size of regular humans to keep things fair - meaning matches might end up looking like a cosplay LARP as people-sized robots run around and do battle. Anyway, this press release claims that “since its debut in 1979, the Gundam franchise has centred around gifted pilots commanding technologically advanced machines into the onslaught of conflict - mirroring the challenges players face in Call of Duty”. I’ll just leave you to ponder that particular comparison.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161947/mad-max-fury-road-doof-warrior-origins-furiosa-george-miller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="UTOReD">Characters like the Doof Warrior don’t come along often. The unofficial mascot of Immortan Joe’s army, and a symbol of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158351/mad-max-fury-road-rock-riders">bombast</a> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>, the masked rocker with the flame-spitting guitar became an instant hit on the internet and received an immediate induction into the movie icon hall of fame. </p>
<p id="Z0Altq">The Doof Warrior is <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> in miniature. Both are combinations of seemingly disparate pieces and random parts, clearly grafted onto one another, but somehow still seamlessly organized to make something perfect and unique. The Doof Warrior is just one of <em>Fury Road</em>’s many miracles, but the story of his creation is also the perfect way to understand how the film reached the legendary status it has today. After all, why wouldn’t the coolest movie of the century so far also have the coolest character in it?</p>
<h2 id="aRwz7k"><strong>The origins of the Doof Warrior </strong></h2>
<p id="jTJT25">Like the rest of <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, Coma, the Doof Warrior, seems to have come about from the perfect intersection of a wildly ambitious, visionary filmmaker and technically excellent craftspeople. </p>
<p id="Tbsmw2">The idea, as far as anyone seems to remember it, was all director George Miller’s. In Kyle Buchanan’s book about the making of the film, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Sweat-Chrome-Wild-Story/dp/0063084341?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Sweat-Chrome-Wild-Story/dp/0063084341?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23925988__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925988__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Blood, Sweat, &amp; Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>, Miller explained that the character is there to “distill the nature of <em>Fury Road</em>: Kind of wacky but rooted in some sort of reality. He was the equivalent of the drummer or the bugler, with his electric guitar.” Production designer Colin Gibson put it even more succinctly in an interview with <a href="https://www.mtv.com/news/9dfq3e/mad-max-fury-road-guitar-player-doof-warrior-colin-gibson">MTV News</a> shortly after the movie’s release, saying “Uncle George, being George Miller, imagined the biggest little drummer boy in the world.”</p>

</p>
<p id="FQFGUT">With that idea in mind, Gibson said that his task, as he saw it, was to “build the largest, last <a href="https://www.thewho.net/whotabs/gear/guitar/marshallstack.html">Marshall stack</a> at the end of the universe.” And that meant having the apocalypse’s coolest guitar to drive those amps. </p>
<p id="xtusH7">For that, Gibson turned to salvage artist Michael Ulman, who did many of the props and vehicles for <em>Fury Road</em>. Ulman put together an incredible, sculptural guitar centered around a porcelain bedpan with a French horn at the center, and Gibson put a real working guitar somewhere in the center of it because, as he put it, “George — unfortunately — doesn’t like things that don’t work.” Thus the Doof Warrior’s incredible ax was born, a feat of engineering and art that could really play music and really shoot flames as it was driven through the desert.</p>
<p id="WJvy6S">“It is the shittest guitar I’ve ever had the misfortune to have hanging in front of me,” said iOTA, the guitarist and performer who played Coma, in Buchanan’s book. But even if the guitar wasn’t ideal to play, that didn’t seem to lessen iOTA’s enthusiasm for the role. </p>
<p id="D1yAS6">The Doof Warrior was one of the many characters that Miller created a fully fleshed-out backstory for. According to iOTA in an interview with <a href="https://movieweb.com/mad-max-4-fury-road-flamethrower-guitar-backstory/">Movie Web</a>, Miller said that Immortan Joe found Coma in a cave and had him schooled in music in order to lead his army into battle. Displaying a kind of dark creativity commensurate with the role, iOTA did Miller one better by suggesting that Coma was found in the cave clutching his mother’s decapitated head, and that Coma took her face off and wears it as his battle mask in her honor. </p>
<h2 id="sXiuYu"><strong>When the Doof Warrior took over the internet </strong></h2>
<div id="i0AwfW"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1bZYdfvmBk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="WYkjnz">The Doof Warrior took the internet by storm the instant he arrived on the scene. As Cory Watson, the director of <em>Fury Road</em>’s behind-the-scenes documentary, told Buchanan, “You can’t even count the number of articles on the Doof Warrior that came out in the year or two after the film was released.” Sure, he quickly popped up in memes and gifs on Twitter and as a prime target for <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/15-fantastic-pieces-of-mad-c1432857850817.html">fanart</a>, but the way websites wrote about him was an almost perfect mirror of the film’s success. </p>
<p id="kVlKcV">While its cultural legacy may be massive now, <em>Fury Road</em> started off small at the box office, with just a $45 million opening weekend. As more people saw the movie and told everyone they could about how incredible it was, the movie became the fabled “word of mouth success,” eventually earning more than $150 million at the domestic box office and nearly $400 million worldwide. </p>
<p id="6p92Mk">Similarly, enthusiasm for the Doof Warrior started small, with critics and writers who saw the movie early <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2015/may/18/mad-max-fury-road-crazy-guitar-guy-doof-warrior-turning-it-up-to-11">writing about how cool the “guitar guy</a>” was, and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/the-doof-warrior-max-max-fury-road">explainers popping up about who exactly the character was</a>. But as more and more people saw <em>Fury Road</em> and started clamoring to learn more about it, internet entertainment outlets started focusing their coverage even more and writing more and more stories.</p>
<p id="7cxfWg">Eventually, most of the stories started calling him by his rightful title, the Doof Warrior, instead of referring to him as <em>Fury Road</em>’s “guitar guy,” and the crew were happy to give reporters a peek behind the curtain. There were interviews with <a href="https://www.mtv.com/news/9dfq3e/mad-max-fury-road-guitar-player-doof-warrior-colin-gibson">Gibson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrqhzZnERWA">Ulman</a>, and even <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/rkqb3m/we-talked-to-the-dude-who-plays-a-flame-throwing-guitar-in-mad-max-fury-road">iOTA himself</a>. Just like the movie, what started as an unbelievable curiosity suddenly bloomed into a cultural fascination that persists to this day: A cult hit that broke into the mainstream to become an absolute classic. </p>

<h2 id="KALGIr"><strong>The Doof Warrior still embodies Fury Road’s spirit</strong></h2>
<p id="8DzcEc">To give you an idea of how close <em>Fury Road</em> came to being a totally different movie, Miller told Buchanan in <em>Blood, Sweat, &amp; Chrome</em> that the studio tried to cut the Doof Warrior several times. <em>Fury Road</em> had several different test screenings, and at most of them the Doof Warrior only had temporary sound, so he was playing the same guitar riff every time, annoying audiences. Miller had plenty of experience keeping <em>Fury Road </em>alive despite studio attempts to shut the production down, and the Doof Warrior was no different — the biggest little drummer boy stayed in. </p>
<p id="QhgO1t">Miller knew exactly what he was doing with Coma: “What I knew and no one else knew is that his music was going to evolve, and eventually that would become part of the full orchestration of the story. Of course, by the time the film was finished, he became probably one of the most popular characters.” </p>
<p id="ffQuCf">And that’s still true to this day. The Doof Warrior is an instantly recognizable symbol of <em>Fury Road</em>. A character too cool to be in any other movie, but also one of Miller and the crew’s dozens of world-building masterstrokes that help propel <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> from a great movie to a true one-of-a-kind classic.</p>

That’s because the demo, officially titled the <em>Umbilical</em> Pre-Release demo, is made in partnership with Baton Rouge-based metal band <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://noladiy.org/thou/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://noladiy.org/thou/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thou</a></span>, who composed the music for <em>Norco</em>. The band is releasing its next album, <em>Umbilical</em>, on May 31, and the <em>Silenus</em> demo acts as a special early release for fans of the band. By exploring the demo, players can unlock all ten of the album’s tracks and listen to them through an in-game media player.</p><p>The gameplay aspect of <em>Silenus</em> sets you on an eerie adventure in an oil refinery recently acquired by a mysterious corporation with goals of automating labor and forcing the remaining human workers into unexplained dance routines dictated by a giant floating hologram. It’s a setting and tone that will be familiar to those who played <em>Norco</em>, which also touched on the struggle of the working class and a Louisiana-inspired setting steeped in the business of oil. </p><figure id="" data-id="1542a02982fb543786e4a1adff145278" data-recommend-id="image://1542a02982fb543786e4a1adff145278" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant hologram figure says &quot;All level 1 personnel are required to dance.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A giant hologram figure says &quot;All level 1 personnel are required to dance.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Geography of Robots</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1542a02982fb543786e4a1adff145278" data-recommend-id="image://1542a02982fb543786e4a1adff145278" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant hologram figure says &quot;All level 1 personnel are required to dance.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Silenus</em>’ demo, while short, gets straight to the point (as a result, it’s sometimes a little heavy-handed. You can find emails and notes from workers questioning if they will face random layoffs, and discover a clear lack of communication from the refinery’s new owners who seem to care little about workers while striving to maximize profits. The full version of <em>Silenus</em> is set to release sometime later this year and is described by Geography of Robots as a “micro-adventure” that won’t take longer than three hours to complete when finished.<br></p><p>What makes the game’s mechanics all the more fascinating is how it ties in the reward of tracks from <em>Umbilical</em>. As protagonist Titian, your job is never an altruistic one, beyond the immediate payoff of the player getting access to tracks. In fact, you have to do a lot of shitty stuff if you want to listen to the entire album. One particularly memorable task involves reporting a coworker to your manager, something that leads to them getting murdered for not following protocol. But you need their keycard to progress the demo, so the dead man is just a means to an end for you to get what you want. It’s a pretty effective allegory for how the in-game company that bought the oil refinery sees its workers, and how real-world private equity seems to do nothing but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/private-equity-publicly-traded-companies/675788/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/private-equity-publicly-traded-companies/675788/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">destroy the things it touches</a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="0b833fd07b5fa18cc697b80635180315" data-recommend-id="image://0b833fd07b5fa18cc697b80635180315" data-format="jpg" data-width="1733" data-height="971" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A worker overlooks a dead body and text reads &quot;The technician is dead.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A worker overlooks a dead body and text reads &quot;The technician is dead.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Geography of Robots</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b833fd07b5fa18cc697b80635180315" data-recommend-id="image://0b833fd07b5fa18cc697b80635180315" data-format="jpg" data-width="1733" data-height="971" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A worker overlooks a dead body and text reads &quot;The technician is dead.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That does seem to be the explicit point of this playable album drop. Thou has long been a politically minded band, which is why the collaboration with Geography of Robots on <em>Norco</em> works so well. That continues here but in reverse. In <em>Norco</em>, Thou’s music was in service of Geography of Robots’ game. In the <em>Silenus</em> demo, Geography of Robots’ game design is in service of Thou’s latest album.<br></p><p>“[T]his record is most especially for the weaklings and malingerers,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/products/sbr342-thou-umbilical&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/products/sbr342-thou-umbilical" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says Thou</a></span>, “burdened by capricious indulgence, hunched by the deep wounds of compromise, shuffling in limp approximation, desperately reaching back towards integrity and conviction.” To reach the end of the <em>Silenus</em> demo, the player needs to be a compromised weakling. Congrats on getting that full album access, hope you don’t feel like a shitty person with all that blood on your hands.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
