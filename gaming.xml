			<p><strong>Nintendo</strong> is due to have its third <strong>Nintendo Direct event</strong> of the year <strong>next week</strong> on <strong>Thursday, February 5, 2026</strong>, and it'll be a <strong>Partner Showcase Direct</strong>, if multiple reports surrounding this rumour are to be believed.</p>



<p>After first coming from known insider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMQiG9bc4c">NateTheHate</a> (who has also predicted that a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/"><strong>PlayStation State of Play</strong> is on the horizon for <strong>February</strong></a>), their report about a coming Nintendo Direct was corroborated by <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016969052132962528">GameXplain</a>, who then added that it would be a Partner Showcase, which was corroborated by NateTheHate, and as of today, both rumours have been corroborated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-next-week-dedicated-to-partner-games/">VGC</a>.</p>



<p>Next Thursday is the predicted date, and if it is indeed a Partner Showcase, that means we can only expect to see <strong>third-party related</strong> announcements, which means we likely won't get any news at all regarding what Nintendo has coming. Instead, it'll be about what the rest of the industry is bringing to the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If this Direct event does happen next week, it'll already be the <strong>third</strong> Nintendo Direct event of 2026, after the year began with the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-nintendo-direct-2026/">Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct</a></strong> that revealed a first proper look at <strong>Yoshi</strong> in the film, followed by a Direct event dedicated to <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a></strong>.</p>



<p>But if you're not looking forward to either the film or Tomodachi Life, then next week's rumoured Direct is likely the first one you might actually tune in for. We could get another look at Switch 2 exclusive titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-gameplay-leak/">The Duskbloods</a></strong>, and upcoming Switch 2 ports like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-into-2026/">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">Borderlands 4</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-delayed-two-months-may-2026/">007: First Light</a></strong>. </p>



<p>This may even be the event where we finally see <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/"><strong>Call of Duty</strong> announced for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and those are just some guesses at some of the bigger announcements we could see. There are also scores of potential indie game reveals that could happen at this rumoured event.</p>



<p>But Nintendo has to confirm it's actually happening before we can really start to speculate at what will be there. The last Partner Showcase Nintendo hosted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">was in <strong>July 2025</strong></a>, and it announced the event the day before it happened. If Nintendo sticks to that same strategy, then we should expect a reveal next <strong>Wednesday</strong>. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Nintendo Direct Rumors Point To An Incoming Flood Of Switch 2 Ports]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/february-nintendo-direct-switch-2-3d-mario-2000664537</link>
            <guid>1420885</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The usual suspects are buzzing about an upcoming Nintendo Direct to kick off February. This one will reportedly be a Partner Showcase, so while I wouldn’t expect teases for anything wild like a new <em>3D Mario</em> game, we’ll probably got a healthy influx of new <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ports-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-ps5-xbox-dlss-outlaws-1851782817">Switch 2 ports</a> to help button down the first half of the platform’s year.</p> <p>Nintendo traditionally holds a February showcase to preview what’s coming and help fill in release calendar slots for its loyal fans. Podcasting insider <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016962284921249815">NateTheHate</a> and YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKp9okfMtdI">GameXplain</a> have both suggested 2026 will follow a similar pattern, though the event will be a Partner Showcase rather than a full-blown first-party Direct. <em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-next-week-dedicated-to-partner-games/">VGC</a></em> was also able to corroborate those claims. So expect a new Nintendo Direct somewhere around February 3-5.</p>

 <p>But what is Nintendo likely to show? Well, we’re still waiting on firm release dates for <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2. The latter was recently rumored to be coming near the end of February. There’s also been plenty of smoke about <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> making it over to Nintendo’s latest console, as well as the port for <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> coming sooner than expected. <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em>, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> also seem like potential candidates.</p> <p>I’m more curious to see where this missing Microsoft support for the Switch 2 is. Some version of <em>Call of Duty</em> is rumored to be coming to the platform this spring and the company still hasn’t confirmed a <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> remake port for the Switch 2. There’s also plenty of lower-hanging fruit like<em> Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Diablo 4</em>, and <em>Avowed</em>, which is coming to PS5 next month. <em>Starfield</em> would also be a big get. Is a Switch 2 port part of the game’s rumored 2.0 plans? Hopefully.</p>

 <p>Announcements for new games would also be nice. We know we’re getting FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-duskbloods-elden-ring-hidetaka-miyazaki-switch-2-1851774753">multiplayer action game <em>Duskbloods</em></a> sometime this year. It’ll be interesting to see if any other major studios reveal exclusive side-projects for the Nintendo platform. But in the new era of every game being playable on every device, that seems less likely than a slew of new AAA ports.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2’s director has put fans’ minds at ease, reaffirming that the game remains unaffected despite the recent restructuring. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusively revealed</a> last week that, despite being one of Ubisoft’s longest in-development projects, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 had survived the recent organizational, operational, and portfolio reset. A spokesperson later confirmed that the game remained a priority for them within their strategy, centred on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world adventures</a>. </p>







<h2 id="h-beyond-good-amp-evil-2-game-and-team-unaffected">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 Game and Team Unaffected</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7421227406130335744/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> post, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 director Fawzi Mesmar reaffirmed that he, the team, and the game “are unaffected by the recent changes.” Mesmar also spoke about the remaining cancellations and studio closures, encouraging people to support those affected in whatever way they can. Check out the complete statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for everyone who has reached out to me over the past few days in regards to recent news at Ubisoft. </p>



<p>Myself, my team and our project Beyond Good and Evil 2 are unaffected by the recent changes. I would direct you to the official press release for more information around the latest organisational structure. </p>



<div><p>Needless to say, I am saddened by the cancellations that has affected my colleagues in other parts of Ubisoft and the industry. I urge everyone – myself included – to offer support whenever and however they can during these times.</p><p>We remain committed and focused on delivering a remarkable game for our players to enjoy.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>For those who may not be aware, Ubisoft’s restructuring has resulted in the cancellation of the highly anticipated&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a>, along with five other games. The new operating model will prioritize open-world adventures and experiences designed for Games as a Service (GaaS), featuring&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five creative divisions</a>. This restructuring has already caused a&nbsp;significant decline in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company’s share price</a>.</p>







<p>In other news, the Black Flag Remake was likely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed by up to </a><span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/" target="_blank">1 year</a>&nbsp;f</span>ollowing the recent restructuring. Additionally, Ubisoft has revealed intentions to make Far Cry, Assassin’s Creed, and Rainbow Six ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-assassins-far-cry-rainbow-six-billionare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual billionaire brands</a>.’  What are your thoughts on the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 director reaffirming the team and project’s status?

            <title><![CDATA[Is PUBG: Blindspot on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pubg-blindspot-platforms-xbox-ps5/</link>
            <guid>1420879</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new entry in the PUBG universe is on the horizon with the release of PUBG: Blindspot into early access, though questions are naturally being asked about the available platforms.</p>



<p>The 5v5 top-down tactical <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shooter</a> is bringing an entirely new approach for PUBG fans, and there’s a strong audience to appeal to, given the vast success of PUBG over the years.</p>



<p>If you want to know whether PUBG: Blindspot is available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X</a>|S, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a>, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pubg-blindspot-on-ps5">Can You Play PUBG: Blindspot On PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No luck. Image via PUBG</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, PUBG: Blindspot will not be available on PlayStation 5 when it launches on February 5, and there’s no end in sight for PS5 players.</strong></p>



<p>PUBG: Blindspot’s early access period is exclusive for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, but, potentially more significant is that there have been no details of a planned release on PS5.</p>



<p>The top-down shooter is an entirely different genre from the main PUBG title, and may not adapt well to PS5, which could explain its absence.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pubg-blindspot-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play PUBG: Blindspot On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>No, similar to the situation with PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S players will not be able to play PUBG: Blindspot on the February 5 launch date.</strong></p>



<p>Again, the early access launch is for PC only, and there is no news on a potential Xbox Series X|S launch in the future, but it is still early days for the game.</p>



<p>More details about any plans for console releases could come deeper into PUBG: Blindspot’s lifespan, with the early access release merely marking the next step on a long journey.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pubg-blindspot-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play PUBG: Blindspot On Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>No, PUBG: Blindspot is not available on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles at launch, though this isn’t surprising given the overall platform status.</strong></p>



<p>Given that PUBG: Blindspot isn’t on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S, it shouldn’t be much of a surprise that there is no Switch launch, and, of all the platforms the title could come to in the future, the Nintendo platform is likely at the bottom of the list.</p>

<p>CM Punk is on the cover of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" id="3461">WWE 2K26.</a></p>



<p>During the Royal Rumble coverage on ESPN 2, WWE CM Punk is the cover star of the standard edition of WWE 2K26. Pre-orders are now open, and the release is set for March 13 worldwide.</p>



<p>Currently, the WWE World Heavyweight Champion, CM Punk, is on the cover of a WWE video game for the first time since WWE ’13 back in 2012. Of course, Punk left the WWE for 10 years after a dispute with Vince McMahon and Triple H, which was spurred on by exhaustion and frustration with the direction of his career.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/">Insider Gaming exclusively reported </a>that Punk would be the centerpiece of this year’s 2K Showcase. Not only will players be able to relive some of CM Punk’s classic career moments, but there will also be the opportunity to play through some dream matches that could have happened had CM Punk not left WWE in 2014.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-more-details-on-what-s-new-in-wwe-2k26">More Details on What’s New in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>Additionally, Insider Gaming reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new match types are coming to WWE 2K26</a>. Of the four game modes, the Dumpster Match is debuting; the other three, Inferno Matches, “I Quit” Matches, and 3 Stages of Hell, make their return.</p>



<p>The Island also returns in WWE 2K26 built around a new storyline concerning three factions. Learn more from our exclusive report <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" id="170633">here</a>.</p>







<h3 id="h-this-is-the-only-cover-not-featuring-triple-h">This Is the Only Cover Not Featuring Triple H</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>All three higher-priced editions of WWE 2K26 will feature Triple H on the cover in some respect. The Monday Night War Edition is slated to provide the most content access. It is also expected to be the most expensive. Learn more about pricing for all editions of WWE 2K26 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/" id="172964">here</a>.</p>



<p>WWE has said that gameplay footage will drop during the Royal Rumble on January 31. Insider Gaming will keep you up-to-date with the latest WWE 2K26 news.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has released a statement regarding the recent censorship of AdHoc's Dispatch on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Dispatch released on Switch consoles. However, many were disappointed to learn there would be some censorship differences on Nintendo's platforms. In versions of the game as it appears on other platforms, there is an option for players to toggle censorship of  explicit content on or off. In the case of Nintendo, though, players were not given this choice, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">explicit content censorship being implemented in Dispatch as standard</a>. This saw black boxes covering characters' exposed breasts and penises, while noises of sexual pleasure were toned down.</p>
<p>At this time, AdHoc said this would not impact Dispatch's gameplay or narrative, stating these "core" experiences remain "identical to the original release".</p>

<p>Nintendo has now shared its own statement regarding the Dispatch discourse. "Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organisations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines," a company spokesperson said in a statement shared with <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much">GoNintendo</a>.</p>
<p>"While we inform partners when their titles don't meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations."</p>
<p>When it first came to attention that Dispatch would be automatically censored on Switch consoles, many were keen to point out that other games which also featured displays of nudity had not been met with the same stipulations. Games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, in which players can customise their Vs genitalia and more, are not censored on Switch consoles in the way Dispatch has been.</p><p>That being said, a specific Japanese version of Cyberpunk 2077 was released separately from the game's standard version, which removed nudity and decapitations. Therefore, some have speculated Dispatch's censorship issues may have come down to AdHoc not wishing to create a separate release of the game for Japan only. Again, though, this is speculation.</p>

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer are big fans of Dispatch, and we are far from alone. Soon after its initial release last year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p>

		<p>Survival games are not a rare commodity, nor are games set on Mars, but what if you could explore the real surface of the Red Planet in a simulation game? That’s the premise for Horizon Journey, which launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769960/Horizon_Journey/">Steam Early Access</a> today, 30th January 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Horizon Journey - Anouncement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7lb32WTnYZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game has been built using NASA-based environmental data and has you facing the extremes you would find on Mars, from drastic temperature variations to fierce dust storms. These are on top of all the usual survival game requirements such as food and health. </p>
<p>“During your journey you’ll discover and expand the N16 base using modular corridor systems, including Labs, Storage, and Crafting modules. Plus, you’ll have the chance to utilise rovers and drones to scan the terrain and navigate the mysteries hidden within the Martian landscape,” say Redivded Studios. </p>

<p>The Early Access version will give you a 4km² region of Mars to explore with a focused narrative that requires the player to investigating a sudden loss of communication with the Endeavor-16 expedition. The full game will launch later this year with a global terraforming system, expanded colony infrastructure, and a Sandbox Mode.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">As was discovered when OpenAI released its Sora video creation tool a while back</a>, it's laughably easy to get Project Genie to spit out copyright-infringing footage.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227">Kotaku</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6ImZCakl0bmxFNGwiLCJwIjoiL25ld3MvODY5NzI2L2dvb2dsZS1haS1wcm9qZWN0LWdlbmllLTMtd29ybGQtbW9kZWwtaGFuZHMtb24iLCJleHAiOjE3NzAxNDAwNTYsImlhdCI6MTc2OTcwODA1OH0.q5OBTD_V36-65oc1EGqPxKYCZF00c7ODvifvagVcwbA&amp;utm_medium=gift-link">The Verge's Jay Peters</a> – who has been given early access to the tool – has gleefully posted that he was able to "generate a bunch of Nintendo-inspired games. Including one featuring Link with a paraglider!" The footage, as you can clearly see, is so close to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> it's <em>almost</em> funny.</p>

<p>The reaction online has been predictably negative.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Peters notes that there <em>are</em> guardrails present in Project Genie, and he wasn't able to rip off any old video game.</p>
<p>"Project Genie wouldn’t generate a world that I prompted with the scenario of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/kingdom_hearts_-_hd_1_5_plus_2_5_remix_-_cloud_version">Kingdom Hearts</a>," he explains. "When I removed the specific names of characters and wrote descriptions of them instead, Project Genie generated a thumbnail preview of the world featuring characters that were dead ringers for Sora (the series’ protagonist), Donald, Goofy, Jack Skellington, and Cloud. But when I tried to generate the actual experience, Project Genie blocked me."</p>
<p>He therefore quizzed Google on why the tool was perfectly happy to plagiarise Nintendo's IP without permission but not Disney's, and was told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Project Genie is an experimental research prototype designed to follow prompts a user provides. As with all experiments, we are monitoring closely and listening to user feedback."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peters adds that he was told that the tool is “trained primarily on publicly available data from the web,” which is almost certainly behind one of the big surprises in his Zelda video, as he explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This probably partially explains why Link deployed his paraglider in my test, which surprised me. At a high level, the Genie model is constantly trying to predict the next frame, and I’m sure there are <em>many</em> videos of people jumping in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and then gliding forward, which the model probably learned from."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Peters also notes that "shortly before publishing this article, Project Genie stopped letting me generate worlds based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> due to “interests of third-party content providers."</p>
<p>Perhaps Nintendo's legal team is already in touch, but it's nonetheless amazing that a company like Google is prepared to risk a battle of that stature when it launches new products like Project Genie.</p>

		<p><em>"Operation Midway Blitz." "Operation Catch of the Day." "Operation Metro Surge." </em></p><p><em>These sound like moments from history that Rob would spend 10 minutes explaining to the rest of us on a podcast, when, in fact, it's the history that we're living through, the most thoroughly public display of state power and violence from the Trump administration—yet.</em></p><p><em>Where is hope in moments like this? How do you move through the day when the news endlessly loops clips of an American citizen being killed? </em></p><p><em>In a letter series written both in, around, and after the murders of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, Rob and Patrick try to figure that out. Sort of, anyway.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob, Jan. 15:</strong> The other day I was driving down to Boston for a doctor's appointment when the semi next to me let out a series of loud blasts from its horn. I briefly panicked, wondering if they were about to merge into my lane or if they'd spotted something up ahead that I couldn't see. Then I caught a bit of movement from the overpass we were approaching. There were people waving from behind a large sign made of pasteboard letters: GET ICE OUT FOREVER.</p><p>A few hours later I was at a grocery store in Lexington and overheard a customer talking to one of the stockers. He was describing being confronted by federal agents sometime recently. Finding himself suddenly surrounded by a bunch of guys getting out of government SUVs yelling at him and the people he was with. "I've heard that's what they do," the well-meaning older white lady said. "They travel in these packs and just swarm people." She then continued on, helpfully explaining the tactics of immigration agents to someone who had literally just gone through the experience. In its way it was a testament to the indomitable spirit of the northeast, where empathy is often expressed in the form of a book report on recent news stories that have upset your liberal interlocutor.</p><p>It's hard not to drive down Massachusetts Route 2, running from Boston through Lexington and Concord and not think about how 250 years ago the road was littered with British dead and swarming with Minutemen in response to provocations that are relatively tame compared to what we see daily on the news. The redcoats on Lexington Common were at least confronting an armed militia force when they opened fire. Jonathon Ross couldn't speak to a mom in a car full of children's toys for ten seconds before he decided to fire half a pistol clip into her at point-blank range. Somehow I don't think John Adams would have taken his case the way he did for the British sentries who carried out the Boston Massacre. Would loyalists have started a GoFundMe for them? "After seeing the woodcuts of the incident I think they were 1000 percent justified in using deadly force."</p><p>There are increasing stories that DHS is going to have another campaign in Boston in the coming weeks, not that its agents ever really left. They were here last year but their tactics have only gotten more aggressive. I feel like you can chart a path of escalation from what they were doing in Boston to what they did in Chicago to what they're doing in Minnesota. To live in an American city or a "blue" state right now is to know that the government sees your home as a stage for state violence and statements of moral and legal impunity. Life goes on, but I can't overstate the degree to which every conversation you have around here is in some way circling around the ongoing crisis. Hell, my doctor couldn't even give me my blood pressure check without caveating, "You know, when you consider the… everything… I think we can feel especially good about this result."</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@shootnmatch?ref=remapradio.com"><span>weston m</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick, Jan. 16: </strong>I was at a PTA meeting for my kids’ school last week where the principal explained a recent decision by the Trump administration to gut a series of educational grants. Practically, it means the school’s Boys and Girls Club program, which primarily serves the 60% of low-income families whose kids attend our school, was going to run out of money soon. The grant subsidizes the program and means it’s “free” for families who need to take advantage of it. It’s not only a form of after care—they get a free meal.</p><p>The principal told us there were plans for a rainy day fund, plans for exploring other grants, longshot hopes a lawsuit against the administration would mean everything would turn out okay…but they were also staring at a situation where the program would have to start charging families to continue operating.&nbsp;</p><p>Is this a cut targeted at a blue state like Illinois, or part of a broader attack on education? I have no idea, man, and I’m not really interested in reading news articles to find out. I raised my hand to find out if there’s a way to personally contribute money to the so-called rainy day fund, and I was put in touch with someone who would tell me what steps to take next. My hope is to livestream a fundraiser in the next few weeks.</p><p>That, at least, feels like a tiny ray of hope. A way I can contribute. But…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Calling the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 “ultra-wide” barely scratches the surface. This thing is enormous. At 49 inches across, it can dominate an entire desk. It’s the kind of monitor that makes dual-screen setups look quaint, delivering a single, seamless canvas that stretches far into your peripheral vision. Right now, it’s also far more affordable than usual. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/">The Odyssey OLED G9 normally sells for $1,249, but Amazon has dropped the price to $900, knocking a hefty $349 off the total for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lose Yourself in Super Wide Worlds</h2>
<p>That massive panel isn’t just about size for the sake of spectacle. The display runs at a resolution of 5120 by 1440, effectively matching two 27-inch QHD monitors fused together. Games and apps have room to breathe, and multitasking feels natural instead of cramped. The 1800R curve gently wraps around your field of view, making long gaming sessions feel immersive rather than overwhelming. It mirrors the way our eyes naturally take in our surroundings, pulling you deeper into sprawling open worlds or competitive arenas.</p>
<p>Speed is another major highlight. With a 240Hz refresh rate, the Odyssey OLED G9 is built for fluid motion and fast reactions. Paired with an ultra-low 0.03ms response time, on-screen action stays immediate and razor sharp even during frantic firefights or high-speed racing. NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro support keep frames smooth and synchronized with your GPU, minimizing screen tearing and stutter so gameplay stays consistent and responsive.</p>



<p>The OLED panel itself elevates everything you put on screen. Blacks are truly black, whites are strikingly bright, and colors have a depth that standard LCDs struggle to match. Contrast is intense and precise, with light and dark areas kept tightly controlled. There’s no distracting glow or bleed around bright objects, which helps scenes look cleaner and more realistic. Games, movies, and even everyday desktop use benefit from the added clarity and vibrancy.</p>
<p>Connectivity is refreshingly flexible. The monitor includes HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, and a built-in USB hub, making it easy to juggle multiple devices. You can keep a gaming PC, work laptop, and another device connected at the same time and switch between them effortlessly. The Odyssey OLED G9 can even detect active sources and automatically jump to the right input. For power users, picture-in-picture and split-screen options allow two different systems to share the display side by side.</p>
<p>Deals like this don’t come around often for flagship OLED gaming monitors. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/">Dropping from $1,249 to $900, the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 becomes far more compelling for anyone ready to go all-in on a truly immersive setup.</a> For players who want size, speed, and image quality in one unapologetically massive package, this is a rare chance to save big.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 has emerged as one of the most inspiring success stories in the gaming industry recently. Its success has influenced other games, such as ARC Raiders, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ditched-free-to-play-because-of-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to abandon a free-to-play model</a> in favor of a reasonably priced one.

Additionally, estimates indicate that more than 250,000 players have logged over 500 hours in the game.</p>



<p>Sales figures for various platforms have been announced, with Steam continuing to dominate the market.

            <p>To celebrate the conclusion of the Fallout show's second season, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> has gone free-to-play for a limited time. It also gained a new $30 DLC pack featuring a camo from the series.</p>
<p>The free-to-play period, which has already started and will last until the 5th February for Xbox and PC players (and the 4th February on PlayStation). You'll have access to all the released updates for the game, giving a pretty substantial peek into what Fallout 76 has got going on.</p>
<p>For those jumping in that are super fans of the Amazon show, the NCR power armour is available too! You'll have to bust out the wallet for it though, as it's part of the new Mojave bundle. It contains the power armour, as well as the ranger power armour paint, NCR flag, New Vegas neon sign, Ad Victoriam super sledge, legion legate outfit, and player titles.</p>

<p>That bundle costs $30. Steam reviews for the bundle currently lie at Mostly Positive, but taking a look at the reviews themselves paint a mixed picture.<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/CirillaFionaElenRiannon/recommended/4250650/"> Some have added a phrase from the show</a>: "Never underestimate the power of brand recognition", <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/moonlitfrappe/recommended/4250650/">while others</a> wish they could buy the NCR power armour on its lonesome: "Only bought it for the Ranger armor, should've been in the atomic shop/earned via quest. I'm tired of Fallout being the staple of microtransactions franchise for content."</p><p>Amazon recent went to great lengths to tempt stragglers in to watch the popular Fallout show recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-watch-the-first-season-of-amazons-excellent-fallout-adaptation-free-on-youtube-but-act-quickly-as-it-wont-be-there-for-long">by uploading season one to YouTube</a>, though only for a limited time. As for Fallout 76, it recently received its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76s-new-update-features-walton-goggins-as-the-ghoul-from-amazons-tv-series">Fallout show themed Burning Springs update</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-45w-nintendo-switch-charger-at-record-low-compatible-with-switch-lite-and-steam-deck-2000664238</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Powering your Switch doesn’t have to be complicated. While you technically can power your console with any third-party USB charger or a power bank, you’ll get the best performance with only a few. The 45W Nintendo charger by Marsdock is one of the most reliable options around.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6960/">It typically sits at an already affordable price of $17, but you can now grab it for only $14 at Amazon – thanks to a 15% discount.</a> This offer applies to the option that includes a 5-foot cable. If you’re looking for something that’s a bit longer, the 10-foot is available for $17, down from $19. Grabbing two of these will knock another 6% off your total. Prime members can enjoy free delivery with their purchase, which brings the overall cost down even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6960/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speedy and Reliable</h2>
<p>For under $15, you’ll enjoy high-speed charging. It gets your consoles from 0 to 50% in just an hour, offering significantly greater charging stability and higher efficiency than the standard 39W options. The adapter supports input from 100-240V and output up to 15V/2.6A, which makes it great for everyday gaming and travel. Compatibility is just as impressive, as the charger plays nicely with most devices that can be charged under 45W via USB-C. These include Switch, Switch OLED, Switch Lite, Switch TV dock, Steam Deck, and Switch Pro Controller.</p>



<p>Marsdock takes durability seriously with this one, too. The premium cord is rated for over 2000 bends, which ensures longevity, while the solid, well-fitting plug maintains safety and offers efficient power transfer. Additionally, there are built-in multi-safeguards and a cooling system that intelligently monitors temperature, offering protection against overcharging, short circuiting, overheating, and sparking. Basically, you can use the charger anywhere, anytime, without worry.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the 45W AC power adapter, with a 5ft AC extension cord. On a regular day, you’d pay around $17 to enjoy the convenience and fast speeds this charger offers, which is already quite affordable. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6960/">The current 15% discount, however, drops it to just $14.</a> Amazon has listed the discount as a limited-time offer, so it’s best to grab it without wasting much time. Now is also a great time to stock up on other gaming accessories and essentials, as we’re spotting quite a lot going for less at the retailer. We’re covering the best offers that are worth your hard-earned money, so be sure to check back for the latest drops!</p>

              <p>The Nintendo Switch Game Voucher is <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-voucher-mario-kart-fire-emblem-discount-1850062170">one of those straight-up good deals</a>. If you’re a subscriber to Nintendo Switch Online, you can buy two coupons for $100, which can then be used to buy two full-price digital games more usually priced at $60 each. Boom, $20 saved, two new games to enjoy. And today, January 30, 2026, marks the very last day you can buy the vouchers. Boo.</p> <p>Back in July of last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-vouchers-pokemon-za-metroid-prime-4-preorder-1851785969">Nintendo announced its intention to kill off the voucher scheme</a> alongside the launch of the Switch 2. With newer game prices nudging up to $70 and $80, it was made immediately clear the vouchers would not be valid for Switch 2 games, but that it <em>would</em> still be possible to take advantage of the scheme for another six months, and that all vouchers bought would remain valid for a full year after the point of purchase. Well, that day has come, and if you want to be sure of a way to pick up a couple of full-price Switch games between now and 2027, this is your last chance. A huge thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/reminder-todays-your-last-day-to-buy-switch-game-vouchers"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a> for reminding us of the deadline.</p>

 <p>It’s still a great offer! Nintendo very notably still hasn’t moved on to focusing its new titles on the Switch 2, and the vouchers will save you a chunk off the just-released <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, and indeed on April 16’s&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi Life: Living the</em> Dream<a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-direct-nintendo-2000664120">,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-direct-nintendo-2000664120">which we learned new details about yesterday</a>. The vouchers are also valid on a really decent range of games including <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>,&nbsp;<em>Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, and even the $70&nbsp;<em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>. These are all first-party Nintendo titles which are&nbsp;very rarely put on sale.&nbsp;You can see the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=df&amp;p=0">lengthy full list of eligible titles here</a>.</p> <p>It’s a double-bummer that this isn’t being extended to the Switch 2, given Nintendo also killed off its <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendos-rewards-program-is-actually-pretty-good-1823654369">splendid gold coins</a>. These were accrued by buying new games, and every dollar spent got you 5c worth of coins. At its best, this meant spending the $100 needed to get two vouchers also got you another $5 off a purchase. Quite why Nintendo’s removed all these advantages and offered no new incentives on Switch 2 is unknown, and a massive disappointment.</p>

 <p>However, if you <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers/">buy a pair of vouchers today</a>, they will remain valid until Jan 30, 2027. That <em>Tomodachi Life</em> was added to the scheme so close to its demise is a sign that&nbsp;maybeNintendo might even put other new Switch 1 releases into the offer even after it can no longer be purchased. No guarantees, though.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-promises-the-world-but-how-much-will-it-deliver</link>
            <guid>1420792</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda. The Witcher. Dragon’s Dogma. Monster Hunter. Street Fighter. And now, GTA 5? Every time South Korean studio Pearl Abyss shows off a new slice of its upcoming open-world, action-adventure Crimson Desert, I feel like I see a new line of influence. Over the six years since its reveal, we’ve seen a fantasy land akin to one Geralt would explore, puzzle shrines in the sky that could easily hover above Hyrule, and a complex combat system rooted in Capcom classics. But in the developer’s latest lengthy video detailing the world of Pywel, a new surprise awaited us: the addition of two new playable characters to join Scottish Jon Snow-alike main protagonist, Kliff Macduff. With whole skillsets of their own for us to now anticipate getting our heads around, I can’t help but be excited, but also cautiously wary. By trying to do so much, does Crimson Desert risk achieving nothing?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I say this as someone who has had the benefit of seeing and playing Crimson Desert more than pretty much anyone outside of Pearl Abyss’ walls, having visited the studio a few months back for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-crimson-desert-hands-on-preview"><u>our IGN First</u></a>. Despite playing a good few hours of it, and having quite a lot of fun with its dynamic systems and satisfyingly flexible action, I still left feeling like I’d only scratched the surface of what Crimson Desert has in store. And I don’t mean that entirely positively – while it’s good to leave a preview knowing there’s plenty more to see, it’s not often you conclude a studio visit still unsure of a game’s big picture. If all those hours of hands-on haven’t successfully communicated what the game is, is something off?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We now know that Crimson Desert’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-open-world-is-at-least-twice-as-big-as-skyrims-and-larger-than-the-red-dead-redemption-2-map"><u>open world is twice the size of Skyrim’s and larger than Red Dead Redemption 2’s</u></a>. I’ve put over 200 hours into Rockstar’s Western masterpiece and feel like I still haven’t seen everything, so it’s anyone’s guess how much awaits in this world. Crimson Desert’s Pywel is a gorgeous piece of geography, too, with streets filled with life and rivers running with glistening water. That water is also systemically linked to the gameplay options, conducting lightning magic to electrocute those who stand in it, and is transformed into blocks of ice when struck by freezing spells. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s all very impressive on a technical level, but leaves me wondering if this is all part of a “we can put it in the game, so why shouldn’t we?” mentality. From what I played, and from talking to the team, the ability to manipulate the elements won’t necessarily have puzzles or challenges built around them to make it a system you’d legitimately find worthwhile. In Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom, for example, you know that if you’re taught how to make giant ice cubes, a puzzle shrine will likely follow asking you to put that lesson into action. Nintendo is a developer that has been making games like this for decades now, though, whereas Pearl Abyss is a studio in its relative infancy, having only released MMORPG Black Desert Online so far. By trying to fit everything it can think a player would like to do in a fantasy open world into Crimson Desert, I fear it may be shooting straight for the moon without learning how to get into orbit first.</p><p>The power trip is there; I just worry about the rest of the journey.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all loops back to this latest revelation that not only will we be playing through Kliff’s story, but stepping into the shoes of two new protagonists along the way. The as-yet-unnamed characters with their own (presumably) complex fighting systems look very fun to play as, don’t get me wrong — I’m particularly drawn to the quick dodging, magic-shifting, pistol-wielding woman who appears at first glance to better fit my more rogue-ish tendencies — but it's yet another layer added on top of an already ambitious cake. I like cake, you can probably tell from a quick look at my face that that would be the case, but when it's stacked so high that even Bruce Bogtrotter would take a pass on it, I worry it's a sign that Crimson Desert should not be trying to have and eat it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other new playable hero is a hulking, giant axe-wielding brute with a machine gun attached to his wrist. If you’ve been keeping up with Crimson Desert, you’ll know that this isn’t your typical fantasy world, but one where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-combat-explained"><u>dragons, steam trains, and mechs</u></a> also roam around. It’s all very exciting in isolation, and genuinely fun to play as your giant metal monsters come face-to-face with helpless medieval soldiers holding only a shield. The power trip is there; I just worry about the rest of the journey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Story and questing are incredibly important to me when it comes to open-world games. The Witcher’s twisting tales and many memorable side stories are what make The Wild Hunt an all-timer in my eyes. The cast of characters in Red Dead Redemption 2 and the way they weave seamlessly in and out of its world are what make it my favourite game ever. Crimson Desert has a lot going for it — the combat is exciting, the world is diverse and beautiful, and its systems are impressively reactive — but I can’t help but feel wary. Most of the missions I’ve played so far, at several different events, have been castle sieges, often ending in admittedly impressive boss battles. But, they’ve all been relatively thin narrative-wise, aside from an interesting detour to a mad inventor’s lair where he’d built <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-golden-star-quest-gameplay"><u>a golden mechanical dragon</u></a>, as you do. I’ve seen little of what’s going to be the thrust story-wise in Crimson Desert as a whole to get me hyped in that regard, nor met any characters that I feel will get close to my heart. And I can’t help but worry that there’s a reason we’ve seen so little of this world’s story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with the surprise addition of two extra playable protagonists to get to know on this adventure that is less than two months away, I worry that Kliff and his friends may well be fun to play as stylistically, but contain little substance within them. I’d be very happy to be wrong, though. I’ve been looking forward to Crimson Desert for a long time now, and have had a genuinely fun time whenever I’ve managed to get hands-on with it. I just wonder how all of these well-constructed building blocks will, in turn, create a greater whole. Will its gameplay systems overlap in interesting ways and be built into mission design? Will authorial intent come to the fore, or will I ultimately feel like a kid being dropped into a sandbox of possibilities with direction? I’m excited, just also a little afraid that by trying to be everything, it may end up achieving nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

Still, the developer said he was "saddened" by the reorganization's effects on his colleagues across the wider company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With an on-again, off-again development stretching back almost two decades, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains an ongoing project within Ubisoft, led by its French team based in Montpellier.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thank you for everyone who has reached out to me over the past few days in regards to recent news at Ubisoft," Mesmar wrote. "Myself, my team and our project Beyond Good and Evil 2 are unaffected by the recent changes. I would direct you to the official press release for more information around the latest organisational structure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This press release was the one which laid out Ubisoft leadership's vision for the company to be split into five "Creative Houses" that lump the publisher's many franchises into groups loosely based around their genre and audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Beyond Good &amp; Evil was announced as being part of Creative House 4, a group dedicated to narrative driven and fantasy-orientated series that also includes Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman and Prince of Persia (though not the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a>, which was canned).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Beyond Good and Evil 2 Concept Art</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Needless to say, I am saddened by the cancellations that has affected my colleagues in other parts of Ubisoft and the industry," Mesmar continued.

Development was put on the back burner while Ancel's team worked on other projects, but Ubisoft re-announced the game with fanfare in 2017 and showed off an in-engine concept featuring space flight and designs to feature multiple solar systems and planets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, however, development struggled — and the project was further impacted by Ancel's departure from Ubisoft and the sad death of its subsequent creative lead Emil Morel. But the last couple of years have seen work coalesce once more, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-has-a-new-narrative-link-to-beyond-good-evil-2">the sequel's characters given intriguing cameos in the new Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-and-evil-2-gets-new-creative-director">the hiring of Mesmar as creative director</a> to steady the ship.

            <guid>1420765</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple AirPods 4 are wireless earbuds with Active Noise Cancellation in a compact form that is convenient to carry and use throughout the day. To enhance comfort and stability, Apple redesigned the AirPods 4 earbuds with a more defined shape and a shorter stem with easy-to-use press controls for playing music and answering calls. For a quieter experience, the Active Noise Cancellation feature helps reduce external sounds as they reach your ears. If you prefer to stay aware of your surroundings, Transparency Mode lets you listen to what is happening around you while continuing to listen to your music.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">You can purchase the Apple AirPods 4 at Amazon for $119. This is a savings of $60 and 34% off of their original price of $179.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Some of Apple’s best earbuds for calls, music, podcasts, and more</h2>
<p>AirPods 4 have an optical in-ear sensor that ensures they play audio only when the earbuds are worn and pause when they are removed. They feature a vent system designed for pressure-balanced sound, which can make extended listening feel much more comfortable. Plus, there are physical controls that let you perform common actions, such as controlling music playback and managing calls, without having to access your phone.</p>
<p>With Active Noise Cancellation, the Adaptive Audio feature combines noise cancellation with Transparency Mode to adapt to your surroundings. Conversation Awareness can automatically lower the volume of what you are listening to when you begin talking with someone nearby, and then raise it back up after you stop speaking. Voice Isolation uses computational audio to minimize ambient noise and improve clarity in noisy environments.</p>



<p>For music, TV programs, movies, and video games, Personalized Spatial Audio features dynamic head tracking to place sound around you. The high-excursion driver, high-dynamic-range amplifier, and Adaptive EQ work together to deliver a consistent, balanced sound that adapts to how well each AirPod fits your ears. The H2 headphone chip supports the processing required for spatial effects and noise reduction.</p>
<p>The USB-C charging case provides additional battery life, extending how long you can listen. With Active Noise Cancellation, you can expect up to 4 hours of listening time and up to 20 hours with the charging case. Five minutes of charging can provide approximately one hour of listening time.</p>
<p>Hands-free Siri can be activated with either “Siri” or “Hey Siri.” Also, with Siri Interactions, you can respond with a nod yes or a gentle shake no. Audio Sharing lets you share audio with two AirPods. Find My lets you locate your AirPods 4 and the charging case<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">. The AirPods 4 and the charging case are both rated IP54 for dust, sweat, and water resistance. Now’s a great time to buy the AirPods 4, as they’re currently $119, down from $179.</a></p>

<p>A new PUBG experience is on the horizon with PUBG: Blindspot, with the release date for early access in the title rapidly approaching.</p>



<p>PUBG: Blindspot is the latest release from developers ARC Team and PUBG Corporation, moving away from the established Battle Royale approach to offer a 5v5 top-down tactical shooter.</p>



<p>For all the details on the release date of PUBG: Blindspot, and the exact time you can dive in and start playing, Insider Gaming has you covered with all the key information.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-pubg-blindspot-release-date">What is The PUBG: Blindspot Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via PUBG Corporation</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>PUBG: Blindspot releases into early access on February 5, 2026, though the precise date will vary depending on where you are located in the world.</strong></p>



<p>PUBG: Blindspot’s early access release is exclusively available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, with no news of a console release yet, but there is still some variation to the release date.</p>



<p>This is due to PUBG: Blindspot, like other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> releases, having a global release structure, and not a staggered release like players on consoles usually experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-pubg-blindspot-release">What Time Does PUBG: Blindspot Release?</h2>



<p><strong>PUBG: Blindspot will be released at 9 PM PT on February 4, with the majority of players in the United States able to jump in before the official release date the following day.</strong></p>



<p>Those in the Central US will be able to jump in on that date, with those on the East Coast having to wait until midnight. Meanwhile, those in Europe have a release in the early hours of the morning, and gamers in the Pacific and Australia face a mid-afternoon release.</p>



<p>All times for the release come through <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3143710/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, which is always a reliable source for this type of information, though, as this is an early access release, the times may be subject to change. If there are any adjustments, all the details in this article will be updated.</p>



<p>The table below has the exact release times for PUBG: Blindspot in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">9 PM – Feb. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Feb. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Feb. 5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Japanese game developer <strong>Comcept</strong>, known for the games <strong>Mighty No. 9</strong> and <strong>ReCore</strong>, has shut down, <a href="https://gamebiz-jp.translate.goog/news/420020?_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Japanese website GameBiz</a>, which spotted a Notice of Dissolution in yesterday's Official Gazette. </p>



<p>The studio was founded by <strong>Keiji Inafune</strong>, a former <strong>CAPCOM</strong> producer who co-created series like <strong>Mega Man</strong>, <strong>Onimusha</strong>, and <strong>Dead Rising</strong>, in 2010. Aside from the small free-to-play mobile game The Island of Dr. Momo, Comcept's debut title was 2014's <strong>Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z</strong>, an action/adventure spin-off in the Ninja Gaiden series for which the studio worked alongside <strong>Spark Unlimited</strong> and <strong>Team Ninja</strong>. Inafune and his team also worked with <strong>Sony's Japan Studio</strong> on the design of the PlayStation Vita exclusive game <strong>Soul Sacrifice</strong>.</p>



<p>Their first brand new project was Mighty No. 9, which Inafune presented as a spiritual successor to Mega Man. The action platform game sought funding on Kickstarter, where it gathered $3.8 million in pledges. Comcept developed Mighty No. 9 with the help of <strong>Inti Creates</strong>, another studio composed of ex-CAPCOM employees. The game was eventually published in late June 2016 by <strong>Deep Silver</strong>, but it wasn't well received at all. On Wccftech, Mighty No. 9 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mighty-9-review-nostalgia-cynic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>was rated just 4 out of 10</strong> by Chris Wray</a>, who summarized his experience with the following words:</p>



<p><em>Mighty No. 9 was designed to be a spiritual successor to Mega Man. If any of that spirit was ever here, it's long since decayed. The game is incredibly frustrating, suffers from bad design choices throughout and offers only middling enjoyment.</em></p>



<p>In the same year, Comcept also released ReCore, which it created in collaboration with the Texan developer <strong>Armature Studio</strong>. This game was received a bit better than Mighty No. 9 (at the time, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/recore-review-eden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it earned an 8 out of 10 from Wccftech's Francesco De Meo</a></strong>), but it still wasn't enough to get publisher Microsoft Studios to give the green light for a sequel.</p>



<p>The following year, Comcept was acquired by <strong>Level-5</strong> and became a subsidiary, helping Level-5 develop games such as <strong>Yo-kai Watch Jam: Yo-kai Academy Y</strong>, <strong>Megaton Musashi</strong>, <strong>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</strong>, and <strong>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</strong>. Now, all its assets will be transferred to the main Level 5 studio.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovos-24-all-in-one-desktop-now-costs-about-as-much-as-a-budget-tablet-on-amazon-2000664269</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Workstation upgrades aren’t cheap. If your desk is in need of a refresh, but you don’t want to shell out big bucks, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6959/">Right now, the 24-inch Lenovo all-in-one desktop computer is down to just $400 at Amazon, after a whopping $199 discount</a>. This bundle comes with everything you need to get started right away, including a pre-installed copy of Windows 11 Home, a wired keyboard, and a wired mouse. However, as you’d expect, the offer is only available for a short time. It’s best to snap it up sooner rather than later, if you want to avoid paying the full $599 price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">Ver en Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ideal for Students and Work Professionals</h2>
<p>You’re getting a stunning 23.8-inch, spacious Full HD display that pushes 1920 x 1080 resolution. You’ll enjoy crisp, vibrant picture quality for all types of content, whether you’re streaming your favorite show or creating an important work presentation. Plus, the anti-glare coating keeps the screen easy on the eyes, which is great for long work sessions or never-ending meetings. Speaking of video calls, you’ll find a high-quality 720p HD camera right above the screen. This camera is paired with Mono microphones that isolate your voice from the background noise and deliver it clearly on the other end.</p>
<p>Performance is impressive for day-to-day use. The system runs on a modest Intel N100 processor that features four cores and four threads with a max Turbo frequency of 3.40 GHz. It’s not a powerhouse, but it’s still perfectly capable of supporting your everyday needs – like office work, streaming, browsing, checking emails, handling light creative projects – without slowing down. There’s an 8GB DDR4 RAM to keep things running smoothly as you work and play. Again, it’s not massive, so you won’t exactly be able to multitask comfortably. But as long as you’re not trying to work on a bunch of resource-heavy tasks at once, you will enjoy minimal lag and decent performance.</p>



<p>Storage is taken care of by a roomy 512GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD, which is plenty for important work files, media content, research documents, and even some games. Note that the system is not expandable, so you won’t be able to increase the capacity as your needs grow, but you can always add external storage solutions to manage space better.</p>
<p>Wireless connectivity options include Intel Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. On the wired side, you’re covered with an array of ports, including two USB-A (Hi-Speed USB / USB 2.0), two USB-A (USB 10Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 2), one HDMI-out 1.4b, one Ethernet (RJ-45), and one headphone or microphone combo jack (3.5mm) – that’s all you need to create a fuller, more productive setup. Getting the wired keyboard and wired mouse in the bundle means you’ve already got all you need to get started with work and entertainment right away.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6959/">The bundle now costs $400, after Amazon took 33% off its usual price.</a> Just note that we’re not expecting the offer to last long. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your workstation without spending a ton, now is your chance to pick a solid, highly-rated option for less. Delivery is free, too, so $400 is all you’ve got to pay today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League has revealed that the 2026 COD Championship will take place at the Michelob Ultra Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. The city was previously revealed exclusively by Insider Gaming in a September 2025 report, but the venue has now been locked in as tickets go on general sale later today.</p>



<p>Those who secured pre-sale access can get the drop five hours earlier than regular customers. To reiterate, the Call of Duty League Championship 2026 weekend will unfold from July 16 – 19.</p>







<h2 id="h-back-to-vegas-for-cod-champs">Back to Vegas for COD Champs</h2>



<p>The 2023 Call of Duty League Championship, which saw the New York Subliners defeat Toronto Ultra in a stunning 5-0 grand final, also took place in Las Vegas. It was housed at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, while the venue for this year’s COD Champs will be the Michelob Ultra Arena (MUA).</p>



<p>In terms of location and accommodation, the MUA is directly connected to Mandalay Bay Resort. It’s a site capable of hosting 10,000 fans, and it promises to be a fairly stunning event, all things considered.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty League hasn’t got off to the best start in terms of impressions and viewership, but things are expected to pick up as the first Major of the season draws closer. It hasn’t been helped by Black Ops 7, this season’s competitive title, receiving record-low sales numbers and ill sentiments from the community.</p>



<p>Call of Duty League Championship 2026 <a href="https://fazevegas.com/pages/cdl-champs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tickets will go on sale</a> later today at 10 AM CST for pre-sale customers and 3 PM CST for the general public.</p>

<p>Cairn allows players to reach new heights with an exploration adventure across the gruelling Mount Kami, and the time it takes to beat the game is variable.</p>



<p>The title from The Game Bakers was released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> on January 29, reaching near the top of Steam’s top-selling chart after its release.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering how long it will take to beat Cairn and climb to the summit of Mount Kami, Insider Gaming has all the details on the number of hours you need to sink in.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-cairn">How Many Hours to Beat Cairn?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New heights. Image via The Game Bakers</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cairn has a completion time of around 12 to 15 hours if you focus solely on the main campaign, though this varies based on exploration and the difficulty selected.</strong></p>



<p>The 15-hour completion mark represents a playthrough on Alpinist difficulty, the standard difficulty in the game, and the one you are recommended to start with, with limited exploration, but the early hours are the hardest as you get used to the control scheme.</p>



<p>The more you explore, the longer it will take to complete the main story, but this is where you can find your rhythm in Cairn and full enjoy the world that has been created.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-cairn-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Cairn Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>Further exploration in the world of Cairn, or playing on a greater difficulty, will increase the time it takes to complete a playthrough, extending it to as much as 30 hours.</strong></p>



<p>Those who stick with a lower difficulty, but who push to explore more of Mount Kami, can increase the playtime to anywhere between 18 and 25 hours. Again, it all depends on how much you explore and push away from the main campaign.</p>



<p>For those undertaking the biggest challenge on a Free Solo run, playtime is pushed up to between 25 and 30 hours, with the added risk of having to start all over again if you die, as there are no saves and death is final.</p>



<p>All of the above times are variable, however, and largely depend on your playstyle and ability levels, which can either shorten or lengthen the run.</p>
