			<p>With the release of the brand new DLC for Elden Ring, players returned to an older FromSoftware classic. While players were waiting to get lost in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-patch-1-12-3-brings-more-balance-tweaks-and-bug-fixes/">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, they returned to Bloodborne.</p>
<p>Bloodborne has always had a huge cult following and has surged back in popularity even ten years later. While players are still waiting and hoping for the day that the game comes to PC, players who have access to the game via a PlayStation 4 or 5 have been jumping back into the game as they waited for the DLC to drop.</p>
<p>A report <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/bloodborne-player-count-july-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from TrueTrophies</a> found that Bloodborne's player count had spiked by a whopping 57% and even spiked by 11% once the DLC had officially dropped. This put Bloodborne back on the leaderboard and was that week's 65th most-played PlayStation game.</p>
<p>If players weren't sinking time into Bloodborne, there was also a rise in popularity for Dark Souls III during the wait for the Elden Ring DLC. However, the number of players who sunk time into Dark Souls III was significantly smaller, at a measly 5.6%.</p>
<p>It's fascinating to see that even ten years later, Bloodborne is still incredibly popular, with many people replaying it multiple times or even people playing it for the first time ever. The fan base has been asking for a 60 FPS patch or even a PC port for many years, but it seems that Sony is still ignoring their call in favor of other PlayStation games, such as Ghost of Tsushima and The Last of Us.</p>
<p>Whether Sony will ever release the rights of Bloodborne back to FromSoftware remains unanswered, and fans can only continue to hope and pray that a Bloodborne PC port will be announced at some point in their lifetime. FromSoftware <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-port-miyazaki-not-opposed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certainly isn't opposed</a>, but it's all in Sony's hands.</p>
<p>With Elden Ring being one of the biggest game releases in recent years and having some of the biggest hype for the DLC, it would be the perfect opportunity for Sony to drop an announcement like that and bring further buzz and excitement to those in the community, as well as making Bloodborne a more accessible game.</p>

<p>Not even hours after news broke that Gothic developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gothic-developer-piranha-bytes-reportedly-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Piranha Bytes has shut down</a>, news of a new studio formed by former senior developers has emerged. Jennifer and Bjorn Pankratz&nbsp;have announced the launching of Pithead Studio.</p>



<p>The announcement came via a <a href="https://x.com/PitheadStudio/status/1810222288484389201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on social media</a> and a nearly six-minute video on YouTube. The video, with English subtitles, explains the decision from both Jennifer and Bjorn to start Pithead Studio as well as their plans for the company.</p>



<p>‚ÄúIn the future, we will focus on developing Indie Games,‚Äù Jennifer Pankratz said. </p>



<p>‚ÄúYes, we wanted to keep doing what we love. This seemed like the best way to do it,‚Äù Bjorn Pankratz added.</p>



<p>As far as the types of games the pair will be developing, that wasn‚Äôt revealed in the video. However, the pair said that every Monday they will be releasing a new video answering questions from the community about Pithead Studio‚Äôs future.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe love to make video games that we personally enjoy playing, and this is exactly what we will do in the future,‚Äù Jennifer Pankratz said. ‚ÄúWe hope you are looking forward to this as well.‚Äù</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a>' seasonal battle pass is undergoing a major rework prior to Season 22's launch. In fact, it's not fully accurate to call it one single battle pass, as Respawn has just announced that starting next season, every season will include two battle passes: one that becomes available upon the season's launch, and one that becomes available during the middle of the season, at the same time as the seasonal Ranked Mode split.</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement was made via a post on the official Apex Legends Twitter account, and was accompanied by an infographic explaining the multitude of changes to the game's long-standing battle pass system.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Starting with Season 22, we‚Äôre evolving the Apex Legends Battle Pass to improve your experience and progression goals.<br>Read on to learn everything to know about the upcoming changes or check out the infographic below to learn more. <br>üìÉ: <a href="https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq</a> <a href="https://t.co/i516ktP9ma" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/i516ktP9ma</a></p>  ‚Äî Apex Legends (@PlayApex) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Previously, each season included a singular, 110-level battle pass that players had an entire three-month season to complete. The battle pass had a free tier, a premium tier available for 950 Apex Coins ($9.50 USD), and a "premium plus" tier that gave those willing to pay 2,800 AC ($28 USD) a helpful boost, unlocking the first 25 levels of the battle pass instantly.</p><p dir="ltr">Starting with the launch of Season 22, players will no longer need to purchase AC, and can instead purchase the first of the season's two battle passes directly. Each of Season 22's battle passes will cost $9.99 USD for the standard premium tier, and will feature 60 levels of unlockable goodies.</p><p dir="ltr">The free version of the battle pass will still be available, as will the "premium plus" version, the latter of which will cost $19.99 and give players an instant 10-level boost.</p><p dir="ltr">"If you opt to purchase Premium+ for $10 USD more than the Premium Track, you‚Äôll receive an additional 6100+ AC value including: 10 Levels, 2 Premium+ Legendary skin variants per Battle Pass that will be exclusive for one year, 10 Exotic Shards (additional to the 10 in the Premium Track), and ALL Legends playable for the duration of the Battle Pass you purchase this for," explained a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> accompanying the Twitter announcement.</p><p dir="ltr">The free rewards track has also been given a boost.</p><p dir="ltr">"AC has doubled across the season: Each split will have 200 AC up for grabs, which brings your total potential currency to 400 AC per season as part of the Free Track," Respawn said of the free battle pass. "We‚Äôve also doubled the Apex Packs, making it 14 Apex Packs per season (7 for each split‚Äôs Battle Pass)."</p><p dir="ltr">The free version of the battle pass will also include upgraded cosmetics: Instead of Rare-tier cosmetics, Apex's free battle passes will include a set of Epic-tier cosmetics that include a Legend skin, weapon skin, emote, and four additional Epic-tier items per battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">But one staple of Apex's previous battle passes will be absent starting next season: Stat trackers have been removed from the game's battle passes, at least for now.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some of y‚Äôall are really passionate about these (especially the designed ones), but there were a lot of under utilized Trackers bloating the BP rewards," the blog post reads. "It‚Äôs one of the first things we noticed. And while they‚Äôre great for gloating, we want you to have bigger and better rewards for your time in-game regardless of how much time you have to spend in the Outlands. We‚Äôll be removing the base level Trackers from the Battle Pass while we work on some quality of life upgrades on the side."</p><p dir="ltr">But Respawn did make sure to reassure players that non-standard trackers featuring unique designs aren't going anywhere. In fact, they'll become much more flexible as a part of the battle pass revamp.</p><p dir="ltr">"Fully designed Trackers featuring art will still be available in the Battle Pass," the blog post explained. "And with our upcoming revamp, Tracker art will become agnostic--meaning you can take any art and put it on any Legend‚Äôs banner card. Bloodhound art on Fuse‚Äôs card? We ship it."</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post also noted that Season 22's first 60-level battle pass will be available to unlock for free by completing a special set of challenges during the first two weeks of the season.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24191650/nintendo-sega-from-software-japan-video-game-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Typically, layoff season arrives around Christmas: a flurry of pink slips, empty desks, the anxieties of the newly unemployed, all so companies can cut costs and fatten up bottom lines just before the calendar year ends. But for those plying their trade in video games, it has been layoff season for the entirety of the last three years. The approximate number of workers let go globally in 2022 was <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2022">8,500</a>; last year, in 2023, that number was <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2023">10,500</a>. According to the latest data, the total for the first six months alone of 2024 is <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">10,800</a>. In the US, some <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/us-video-game-industry-unemployment">experts</a> believe the unemployment rate in the video game industry is as high as 9 percent, over double the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">national average</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Amid the video game industry‚Äôs cruel fire sale of highly skilled workers, one region remains notably untouched: Japan. (Excluding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">Tango Gameworks</a>, which was shuttered at the direction of its US owner, Microsoft.) On the contrary, recent years have seen many of the country‚Äôs firms commit to workers rather than cut them: Sega raised salaries by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sega-to-increase-japan-based-employee-salaries-by-30">33 percent</a>, Koei Tecmo upped wages by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/koei-tecmo-worker-salaries/">23 percent</a>, employees at <em>Persona</em>-maker Atlus saw their incomes jump by <a href="https://kotaku.com/atlus-annual-salary-increase-15-percent-persona-1851025919">15 percent</a>, and Nintendo gave its employees a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-sticks-with-employee-pay-raises-despite-declining-sales">10 percent</a> raise. Most recently, Capcom increased graduate salaries by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-announces-salary-increase-for-all-employees-this-year#:~:text=Graduate%20salaries%20will%20rise%20from,to%20attract%20and%20retain%20staff.">27.7 percent</a>, describing it as an ‚Äúinvestment in the people who support the future of the company.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>The recent words of FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki back up these ostensible labor wins for Japanese workers. Of the mass layoffs that are happening in the US and elsewhere, Miyazaki <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/fromsoftware-boss-addresses-gaming-industry-layoffs-as-long-as-this-companys-my-responsibility-i-would-not-let-that-happen/">said</a>, ‚Äúas long as this company is my responsibility, that‚Äôs something I would not let happen.‚Äù But more so than the personal benevolence of leaders like Miyazaki, it is the country‚Äôs robust labor regulations that most protect workers. </p><p>‚ÄúJapanese employment law is, for certain, what protects employees in terms of stability and contract continuity,‚Äù says Peter Matanle, an expert on Japanese employment at the University of Sheffield in Britain.</p><div><figcaption><em>Hi-Fi Rush.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Tango Gameworks</cite></p></div><p>Matanle outlines a historic picture not of innate employment rights but one in which Japanese courts, at key moments, such as 1975‚Äôs Nihon Shokuen Seiz≈ç case, ruled in favor of workers and unions. As a result, one of the key provisions of the country‚Äôs employment law, specifically on the ‚Äú<a href="https://www.shakaiho.com/single-post/2015/10/15/legal-doctrine-of-abusive-dismissal">doctrine of abusive dismissal</a>,‚Äù is that ‚Äúemployers can‚Äôt just shed employees.‚Äù They can only do so, says Matanle, ‚Äúwhen the employer can prove that the organization would go bust.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Should a Japanese company be found to break the law by, say, reducing its workforce to cynically juice the numbers of a quarterly report, dismissed employees are liable to be reinstated. ‚ÄúYou can imagine the relationship problems,‚Äù says Matanle, ‚Äúof staff who have won a court case against the organization for aggressive dismissal.‚Äù</p><div><p>‚ÄúJapanese employment law is, for certain, what protects employees in terms of stability and contract continuity.‚Äù</p></div><p>If the lack of Japanese layoffs can be explained in terms of law, then the proliferation of US layoffs can be explained in precisely the same way (alongside conventional wisdom that companies overexpanded during the covid-19 pandemic and the contention of analyst Matthew Ball that <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/gaming2024#:~:text=video%20game%20revenues%20are%20falling">gaming revenues are shrinking</a>). The US operates what is commonly known as ‚Äúat-will‚Äù employment, a legal doctrine that some <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/amhist60&amp;div=30&amp;id=&amp;page=">scholars</a> date back to the Reconstruction era. Back then, it was argued that if workers had a ‚Äúright to quit‚Äù without restrictions, employers should have a ‚Äúright to fire.‚Äù The doctrine made its way to the Supreme Court in the early 1900s, thereby enshrining in law a boss‚Äôs power to fire an employee for no reason at all.</p><p>Beyond the labor law they must adhere to, Matanle notes a divergence between Japanese bosses and their Western peers in terms of ‚Äúethical accountability.‚Äù Japanese organizations, he suggests, tend to be run with longer-term horizons and are less fixated on pleasing shareholders than their actual employees. Executives are often recruited under ‚Äúlong-term employment systems,‚Äù arriving as fresh-faced graduates in their early 20s before rising through the corporate ranks. Compare this to the US, where executives are often outsiders to their respective industries, the product of a culture where it is commonplace ‚Äî and even advantageous ‚Äî to switch jobs every few years.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata at the Game Developers Conference in 2011.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Kim White / Nintendo of America via Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>In the light of Japanese labor law, the much-mythologized personal pay cuts of former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/iwata-takes-50-percent-pay-as-he-takes-responsibility-for-3ds">2011</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25941070">2014</a> appear a touch less selfless. (Although there certainly were other options on the table in terms of savings, like voluntary redundancies, which Japanese studio <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/japanese-studio-gumi-wants-80-people-to-accept-voluntary-redundancy">Gumi</a> recently asked around 80 employees to accept.) It‚Äôs worth stressing that when Japanese companies are able to make cuts, particularly those operating internationally, they tend to do so. Case in point: Nintendo, which laid off <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-of-europe-will-lay-off-320-people-this-month-1627924242">320 employees</a> at Nintendo of Europe just a few months after Iwata and other executives took pay cuts in 2014. More recently, Square Enix <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-confirms-us-eu-layoffs-as-part-of-restructuring/">laid off</a> an unspecified number of workers across its US and European offices. These examples speak to Matanle‚Äôs key point: it is Japanese labor law that protects the country‚Äôs workers.&nbsp;</p><p>But even if there is no danger of the layoff season arriving in Japan, the country is hardly a proletariat utopia. When Liam Edwards, co-founder of Kyoto-based studio Denkiworks, started working at Q-Games, the studio founded by <em>Star Fox</em> lead developer Dylan Cuthbert, he encountered a tough working environment. It was one he was acutely well prepared for, having often worked ‚Äú12 hour days, 6 days a week‚Äù at Rockstar Lincoln. ‚ÄúI heard a lot of staff [at Q-Games] complain about overtime, the hours, and expectation [of work],‚Äù he says, ‚Äúnever really from Japanese staff, because they were used to it, but certainly from other foreign staff.‚Äù</p><div><p>‚ÄúMy only real complaint with those years was that I was just working all the time. That‚Äôs just the normal state of things at Japanese studios.‚Äù&nbsp;</p></div><p>Historically, the country‚Äôs game makers have produced some of the most innovative, playful video games under such grueling conditions. Jake Kazdal, co-founder of the 15-person Kyoto studio 17-Bit, worked at Sega in the late ‚Äô90s and early 2000s under the stewardship of <em>Rez </em>creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi. ‚ÄúMy only real complaint with those years was that I was just working all the time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just the normal state of things at Japanese studios.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Japanese studios also rely on contract and temporary labor, which has the effect of creating a kind of two-tier labor system similar to that which exists in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/24/google-temps-fighting-two-tier-labor-system">US</a>. Job security is reserved for those who are permanently employed, i.e., seishain. Those employed on temporary contracts are called keiyakushain, and if cuts are to be made, it tends to come in the form of their contracts not getting renewed. Finally, there are haken, dispatch workers or ‚Äúhired guns,‚Äù says Colin Williamson, lead tech artist at 17-Bit who has worked in Japan for 15 years including a stint at Square Enix in the aughts. In his experience, haken tend to be brought in for short periods of time to do ‚Äúlow-level graphics engineering‚Äù and other ‚Äúhardcore stuff.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Haken aren‚Äôt employed by studios themselves but by outsourcing firms such as <a href="https://www.cri.co.jp/">Creek &amp; River</a> (which has contributed landscape modeling, character modeling, and texture to the likes of <a href="https://www.cri.co.jp/case_studies/produce/000542.html"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> and <a href="https://www.cri.co.jp/case_studies/produce/000517.html"><em>Pok√©mon Scarlet </em>and<em> Violet</em></a>). For the time they spend at the studio, Williamson says haken are ‚Äúhonorary team members‚Ä¶ in the trenches with everybody else.‚Äù But ultimately, their tenure is short-lived. ‚ÄúThe stability isn‚Äôt there,‚Äù continues Edwards. ‚ÄúImagine going to work somewhere for six months, making a life for yourself with new colleagues, all to go away as soon as you leave. That must be tough.‚Äù</p><div><figcaption><em>Hidetaka Miyazaki (center) at the Game Awards in 2019.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by JC Olivera / Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>Still, if video game workers anywhere in the world are safe from the interminable layoffs, then it is those who are permanently employed in Japan. Serkan Toto, a veteran analyst of the Japanese games industry based in Tokyo, points to the country‚Äôs long-term shrinking population (down <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-data/h01967/#:~:text=The%20population%20of%20Japanese%20citizens,women%20and%20423%2C000%20for%20men.">837,000</a> in 2024) as an additional factor that could theoretically benefit workers by pushing up demand for their services. The Japanese language, spoken by relatively few people outside of the country (compared to the world‚Äôs de facto lingua franca, English) might also prove itself a boon to workers, making their roles less susceptible to outsourcing in a country with lower wages. These are idiosyncratic quirks of a country that, stresses Toto, ‚Äúhas its own game culture, its own business culture, its own insular ecosystem of game companies.‚Äù It‚Äôs one that is able to, and often does, march to the beat of its own drum.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet Kazdal and Edwards, expats in Japan with deep connections to Europe and the US, find themselves at the mercy of a currently merciless global video game economy. ‚ÄúMost of our contacts are with western publishers,‚Äù says Kazdal. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the same boat [as Western studios], having to get our next deal signed, competing with everybody else in a funding landscape that is more challenging than ever.‚Äù The mantra Kazdal says he and his colleagues who run independent studios are chanting is ‚Äúsurvive ‚Äòtill 2025.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><div><p>Japan ‚Äúhas its own game culture, its own business culture, its own insular ecosystem of game companies‚Äù</p></div><p>For all the current stresses, 17-Bit is in better shape than it perhaps would have been following an acquisition deal with Embracer, the former conglomerate that, in June 2023, began a cost-saving exercise that resulted in some 4,532 workers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">losing</a> their jobs. Multiple meetings were held and numbers were being pushed around, reveals Kazdal, but in the end, negotiations stalled. ‚ÄúThank God we didn‚Äôt go through with it,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just trashing stuff, throwing people out left and right. It‚Äôs a disaster.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>The actions of Embracer‚Äôs C-suite and those at video game companies couldn‚Äôt stand in sharper relief to the famous <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/7/5/4496512/why-nintendos-satoru-iwata-refuses-to-lay-off-staff">words</a> of Nintendo‚Äôs Iwata who, just over a decade ago, said, ‚ÄúI sincerely doubt employees who fear that they may be laid off will be able to develop software titles that could impress people around the world.‚Äù These are the words Miyazaki was referencing when he spoke about avoiding layoffs at FromSoftware: it is not just the angst, nervousness, and worries of an endemic layoff culture that affects work but also the practicalities of securing alternative employment, drawing focus away from the task at hand.</p><p>For the employees of Nintendo, this is simply not a concern, nor will it be barring changes in legislation. One can speculate whether it was personal conviction or Japanese labor law that ultimately dissuaded Iwata from enacting layoffs (maybe it was both!), but that doesn‚Äôt mean his words ring any less true.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Publisher Paradox Interactive has delayed Cities: Skylines 2's console release once again.</p>
<p>The game was initially slated to arrive on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-october-release-date">Xbox Series X/S and PS5 alongside PC in October last year</a>. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-release-gets-delayed">this date got moved to spring</a>, before getting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">bumped back again to October of this year</a>. At this time, the team said it had been "struggling to get Cities: Skylines 2 to the necessary level of optimisation for a console release".</p>
<p>Now, the game's console launch isn't going to be in October either, as the team has "not yet met the stability and performance targets" it had set for Xbox and PlayStation.</p>

<p>In a new post, <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/console-development-status.1694383/">Paradox</a> said the team is making "slow [and] steady progress", but there are still "unresolved issues" it needs to address before Cities Skylines 2 is ready to make its console debut.</p>
<p>"We expect to receive a new [Release Candidate], which will undergo a thorough review in August," the company said today. "This evaluation will determine whether we can begin the submission process and provide a solid release date, or if further issues need to be addressed."</p>
<p>Paradox said it understood this news was likely disappointing for those eager to see Cities: Skylines 2 on consoles, adding it remains "committed to keeping you informed throughout this development process, even if the updates aren't always what we'd like".</p>

<p>Cities: Skylines 2 has had a rough time of it over the past several months.</p>
<p>Ahead of its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-performance-has-not-achieved-the-benchmark-we-targeted-paradox-admits-ahead-of-launch">Paradox confessed the city building sequel had "not achieved the [performance] benchmark we targeted"</a>, but it still decided not to delay the PC launch. Then, back in April, the company along with developer Colossal Order issued a stark apology for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">state of Cities: Skylines 2</a> and the release of its recent DLC, admitting to fans: "We let you down". </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hideki-kamiya-and-ikumi-nakamura-discuss-okamis-development-brilliance-and-its-many-challenges<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Capcom and Tango Gameworks veteran Ikumi Nakamura hasn't been shy about her love and nostalgia for the project that initiated her into AAA development: ≈åkami. And now in a new video conversation with Hideki Kamiya, the pair have opened up about ≈åkami's development, including Kamiya's belief that its development team as a whole...could have been better.</p><p>This comes from a new entry in a video series presented by Nakamura's new studio, Unseen, called Ask Ikumi. In it, she's been sharing all sorts of behind the scenes game development insights both on Unseen's project, Kemuri, and her own development experience. In this latest video, she sits down to chat with longtime colleague Hideki Kamiya, with whom she worked on ≈åkami, Bayonetta, and briefly on Scalebound. Their conversation largely focuses on ≈åkami's development, and the pair has a lot to say!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The video opens with Kamiya explaining his notorious philosophy of blocking anyone who annoys him on Twitter by asking questions he's answered before, or not addressing him in Japanese. They then launch into a discussion of ≈åkami's development. First, they discuss its original conception in a photo-realistic style. ≈åkami was apparently first conceived while Kamiya was working on Viewtiful Joe, and saw work on the Resident Evil remake for GameCube being done next to him. He was impressed by the realism, and wanted to use that style for something more "light-hearted" than the horror genre. So ≈åkami was conceived as a game about "healing."</p><p>But, he says, the photorealistic style they were aiming for was a struggle to get working on PS2. With ≈åkami in trouble, the team was looking for new ideas, when character designer Kenichiro Yoshimura drew main character Amaterasu with a brush. This design sparked a new visual style for the entire game. Not long after, the studio leads convened a three-day summit over a weekend to revamp the game, during which time the Celestial Brush was pitched, and ≈åkami changed directions for the better.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>≈åkami was supposed to be Clover Studio's signature title...It was supposed to be a dream team with all the best staff in each section. That was the plan, but in the end, not everyone, but as the whole team, I frankly think it was weak.</p></div><p>But even so, Kamiya is candid that ≈åkami could have been even better. For one, ≈åkami was supposed to have a bigger story, but the team ran out of time and ended midway through what Kamiya wanted to do. What's more, Kamiya has apparently been notoriously critical of the team that worked on ≈åkami, as Nakamura brings up. She reminds him that at a party near the end of development, Kamiya apparently said to the whole room, "This team was the worst!" Kamiya admits it, and while he backs off his comments at the time a bit, he goes on to say he was "half right."</p><p>"≈åkami was supposed to be Clover Studio's signature title," he says. "That's why we wanted to create a dream team. It was supposed to be a dream team with all the best staff in each section. That was the plan, but in the end, not everyone, but as the whole team, I frankly think it was weak.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Kemuri Exclusive Concept Art - Fan Fest 2024</h3></div></output><p>"It wasn't a dream team. There was a very drastic contrast within. There were certainly people without whom there would be no ≈åkami. Those members shone brightly. Some of them really shone stronger even more than ones I had worked with previously. I'm not saying this as flattery, but you [Nakamura] certainly did. Naoki Katakai and Keniichirou Yoshimura, Sawaki Takeyasu, Mari Shimazaki, Hiroshi Yamaguchi. I'm really grateful, but when viewed as a whole, it wasn't a dream team."</p><p>Kamiya elaborates a little further in banter with Nakamura here and later in the interview, suggesting  that the issue was that the level of passion and enthusiasm for ≈åkami wasn't high throughout the entire team, but instead was rather uneven. Nakamura acknowledges she noticed this, too.</p><p>"If I think about the Viewtiful Joe and DMC teams, the passion was uniformly high," Kamiya says. "But in ≈åkami's team there was a huge contrast."</p><p>"Because all the users who played and enjoyed ≈åkami, I'm sure they all think it was made by a great team, but actually, that wasn't the case," Kamiya concludes. "This is my honest opinion."</p><p>The full conversation between Kamiya and Nakamura is fascinating and worth watching in its entirety. In it, Kamiya refers to ≈åkami as a "failure" (though he seems to be referring to commercial success) and notes that Clover Studio could have continued existing if it had been successful.

Though lacking proper animations, never mind quests, the mod lets players roam the open world together, engage in firefights, and race across Night City.</p><p>This bare bones version of a full Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer mode is therefore a far cry from official contemporaries like Grand Theft Auto Online but may lay the groundwork for one. JuiceHead noted "no issues with lag or players teleporting around", and, even in a 15-player death match, "the sync was almost perfect."</p><p>The mod currently lacks proper player animations because, as Cyberpunk 2077 only exists as a single-player, first-person game, developer CD Projekt had no reason to make the player look good in third-person.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The mod is still in active development, of course, so there's a chance this will be added before it's released fully. The developer has already made clear it won't receive quest support, however, so the mod won't be as involved as a full GTA Online-style mode. That being said, it does have mod support itself, so there's always a chance other community members will work on additional features after it's released. It has no launch date yet, but as even this basic version seems to work quite well, a full release is perhaps not too far off.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 players have longed for a multiplayer mode ever since CD Projekt itself announced it, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-multiplayer-mode-was-cancelled-following-its-turbulent-launch">the game's infamous launch saw it canceled</a> as work was instead focused on fixing the base game.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-considering-adding-multiplayer-to-cyberpunk-2">It's not ruled out for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> currently in development at CD Projekt, however, so players may have some hope for some official multiplayer shenanigans in the future.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/08/eve-vanguard-roadmap-outlined-for-the-solstice-era-of-the-mmo-shooter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>CCP Games has shared a big update on the future roadmap for their online FPS EVE Vanguard, their latest attempt at creating a counterpart to the long-running MMO EVE Online, as the in-development game shifts from the ‚ÄòFirst Strike era‚Äô to the ‚ÄòSolstice era‚Äô.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vanguard in Focus | A Future Vision" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I1wrjMwUrwk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>EVE Vanguard boils down to being CCP‚Äôs take on the PvPvE extraction shooter, with players dropping into the world of New Eden, scrounging for loot drops, and then trying to get out before other players steal their stuff ‚Äì or trying to grab the loot that others have collected. That‚Äôs then wrapped into an overarching meta game to determine control of New Eden for factions, and with teams able to take on jobs put out there by other players.</p>
<p>The game was opened up to with private Founders‚Äô Playtests through the First Strike era, with plenty fans of CCP‚Äôs last FPS attempt, Dust 514, getting to sample the action. The transition to the Solistice Era was marked with the introduction of a new map, the adaptive weaponry system, new tools and gadgets, new objectives and activities, and more. Through the second half of the year,&nbsp;there will be regular dev diaries and AMAs, as well as a more focused testing and development approach through the second half of this year. These efforts will culminate in a major feature update in November.</p>

<p>The aim is to gradually deepen and grow the gameplay loop within the ethos of EVE Online, to which Vanguard is an additive experience as opposed to a standalone shooter as Dust 514 was. To that end, they‚Äôre trying to deepen that link between Online and Vanguard.</p>

<p>In the fullness of time, EVE Vangard will launch into Steam Early Access, though the timing of this will be announced at a later date, and likely won‚Äôt come this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elex-and-gothic-developer-piranha-bytes-reportedly-shut-down.921549/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Risen&nbsp;</em>developer Piranha Bytes appears to have been shut down by parent company THQ Nordic (itself owned by Embracer Group), if a new report is to be believed.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/piranha-bytes-closed-the-end-of-the-studio-behind-gothic-risen-and-elex" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a report by Polish gaming news platform CD-Action</a>, the developer, which is known for mechanically clunky but ambitious RPGs like&nbsp;<em>Risen</em>,&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Elex</em>, was shut down towards the end of last month.</p>
<p>The report claims that Piranha Bytes was expecting funding to arrive from an investor for its latest project, which CD-Action says would have been a&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>-style dark fantasy RPG created in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/piranha-bytes-shut-down-rumor-elex-2.jpg?itok=DrhWH6Hr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/piranha-bytes-shut-down-rumor-elex-2.jpg?itok=usRf3ByS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't expect any more&nbsp;<em>Elex&nbsp;</em>games any time soon.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that CD-Action simply cites an anonymous "source" who is supposedly a Piranha Bytes employee, but since that employee isn't named, make sure to take this report with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>It does, however, line up with what we already know about Piranha Bytes' situation. Back in January, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-rumors-difficult-situation">described its situation as "difficult"</a>, imploring fans not to "write us off yet" with regards to an unannounced project.</p>
<p>Piranha Bytes said at the time that it would "do whatever it takes" to find a publishing and funding partner for the project, but it seems that if CD-Action's report is correct, those efforts sadly haven't borne fruit.</p>
<p>Additionally, Piranha Bytes creative director and longtime staffer&nbsp;Bj√∂rn Pankratz <a href="https://x.com/PitheadStudio/status/1810222288484389201" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced earlier today</a> that he has founded a new indie studio, Pithead, along with his wife Jennifer, although <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bj%C3%B6rn-pankratz-4b926a5/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his LinkedIn page</a> still lists him as a current employee of Piranha Bytes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/thq-nordic-gothic-remake-piranha-bytes.jpg?itok=tAhUiG5h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/thq-nordic-gothic-remake-piranha-bytes.jpg?itok=1_KzQ68m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>remake is in the works, but it's nothing to do with Piranha Bytes.</figcaption></figure><p>If Piranha Bytes has indeed been closed, then that means the studio's final project was 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elex-2-review"><em>Elex 2</em></a>, an action RPG very much in the Piranha Bytes tradition. There are worse ways to go out, eh?</p>
<p>Of course, this won't impact the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>remake. Although Piranha Bytes was the developer for the original&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>, the new project is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-thq-nordic-studio-alkimia-interactive-to-develop-gothic-remake">being worked on by an internal THQ Nordic studio</a> and doesn't involve Piranha Bytes.</p>
<p>We contacted THQ Nordic for further information on this story, but they refused to comment on the situation. Watch this space for more info.</p>

So that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been getting with this game. The team has decided to let a little bit of that emotion out at times. So it was a lot of fun doing this game because playing down and then being able to erupt and let some of that emotion out that‚Äôs been brewing underneath all this time.‚Äù</p><p>Thornton took over the role of Shadow in 2010, which was long after the character‚Äôs major roles in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, <em>Heroes</em>, his self-titled game, and <em>Sonic ‚Äò06</em>, all of which had him as a major player in the story and lore. In nearly 20 years since, Shadow has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/shadow-the-hedgehog-wasnt-an-edgelord-until-sega-made-him-one&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/shadow-the-hedgehog-wasnt-an-edgelord-until-sega-made-him-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely relegated to a side character</a></span> almost exclusively portrayed as an edgelord, with much of that complex backstory ignored. So it makes some sense that Thornton is getting the bigger picture now with <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em>, which Iizuka says is meant to reintroduce the character by revisiting his past ahead of the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>movie premiering on December 20.</p><p>Hearing that Thornton is getting a better understanding of the character after all this time is exciting because that gives fans hope that Shadow may once again be the antihero fans fell in love with, rather than the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanderization&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanderization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flanderized</a></span> caricature he‚Äôs been for more than a decade. If that testimony wasn‚Äôt enough, the clip the team showed of the <em>Dark Beginnings </em>animated miniseries sparked a lot of confidence in Shadow the Hedgehog‚Äôs future. The 90-second snippet shows what seems to be Emerl, a robot who debuted in <em>Sonic Battle</em>, attacking the space station Shadow and Maria lived on. We‚Äôll have to wait for the series to launch later this year before we get more context, but the animation is pretty incredible, and the dialogue and cinematography are dripping with angsty melodrama. Shadow‚Äôs interaction with Maria in the clip has been especially resonant with fans, as it manages to marry his brooding demeanor with the heartfelt core that has been missing from the character for some time. The folks from Studio Giggex say the series was inspired by legendary anime like <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>,<em> </em>and will draw heavily from the established Shadow lore.</p><p>Though it was barely over a minute, the preview and panel were enough to get fans pumped up for the future of a character who has largely been done dirty for over a decade.</p><p><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on October 25. The <em>Dark Beginnings </em>animated series will be released online, but those who pre-order the game on PlayStation consoles will get extended versions of the series, as well as deleted scenes.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-overhauls-battle-passes-abandons-in-game-ac-currency-option/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new official <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update">blog post</a>, EA announced an extensive overhaul for the Apex Legends Battle Passes, which now abandons the in-game currency pricing option. </p>



<p>According to the post, EA says that ‚Äúthe decision to move from AC to real world currency is not one that we made lightly.‚Äù It also states that ‚Äúit does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community.‚Äù</p>



<p>The new real-world currency pricing option for the Premium Track will be $9.99 USD. The new Premium+ Track will cost $19.99 USD.</p>



<p>Previously, players could use Apex Coins (AC) to purchase Battle Passes each season. Fans could also potentially earn enough Apex Coins in a season to pay for the next. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Starting with Season 22, we‚Äôre evolving the Apex Legends Battle Pass to improve your experience and progression goals.</p><p>Read on to learn everything to know about the upcoming changes or check out the infographic below to learn more. </p><p>üìÉ: <a href="https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq">https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq</a> <a href="https://t.co/i516ktP9ma">pic.twitter.com/i516ktP9ma</a></p></div>‚Äî Apex Legends (@PlayApex) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Apex Legends‚Äô Battle Passes will also be broken down into one for each seasonal split. As a result, EA plans to decrease the required level to earn all rewards, down to 60 from 110. </p>



<p>EA says this change ‚Äúallows us to align seasonal progression more closely with Ranked while also increasing the value for your time.‚Äù It also means that players will need to invest real-world currency for a new Battle Pass for each split.</p>



<p>All of these updates will go into effect beginning with Season 22. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-new-season-new-legend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest season is Upheaval</a>, which reintroduced Solos mode and added the new legend Alter. </p>

<p>With less than 10 days until players finally have a new college football game to play in 11 years, EA Sports has released its first full look at gameplay from College Football 25.</p>



<p>Over the last several weeks, EA Sports has shown short clips of gameplay here and there. However, nothing has been clear cut as what fans got on Monday morning. </p>



<p>The video is over 20 minutes long and features a look at Michigan versus Texas as well as Michigan at Penn State. Controlling the teams are Donovan Edwards (Michigan), one of the game‚Äôs cover athletes, and creator Bordeaux (Texas &amp; Penn State). There‚Äôs also a breakdown throughout from the game‚Äôs developers.</p>



<p>You can check out the first look gameplay in College Football 25 below, and let us know your comments. Of the highlights, Edwards showed he‚Äôs just as good on the sticks as on the real field with his ability to run the ball. He ran for 160 yards on 14 attempts, scoring three times, in the first game.</p>



<p>College Football 25 launches on July 19 for Xbox Series X|S  and PlayStation 5. Those who pre-order the Deluxe edition get access three days early on July 16. If you missed it last week, EA Sports released a full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-drops-massive-deep-dive-into-dynasty-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive into the game‚Äôs Dynasty Mode</a>, featuring 17,000 words of information.</p>

                <p>Disney has announced a new game for iOS and Android called Disney Pixel RPG that's seemingly being released on September 9, according to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/disney-pixel-rpg/id6502584695" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">App Store's page</a>. It's a free-to-play game but in-game purchases will be available.</p><p>The story follows various Disney characters and their worlds suddenly being invaded and broken down by gooey monsters. It's up to the player to trek across these worlds and connect these worlds again. So far, the characters that have been confirmed to be in the RPG are Maleficent, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Ariel, Baymax, Genie, Aladdin, Winnie the Pooh, Aurora, and Stitch.</p><p>The gameplay itself looks like it'll have a turn-based battle system, complete with simple touch controls and an auto-play function.
