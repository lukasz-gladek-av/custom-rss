            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has clarified the company's position on the use of generative AI, pointing out that the technology has IP rights issues and vowing to "deliver value that is unique to us".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Q&amp;A held recently with Nintendo investors</a>&nbsp;(via the folks at <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/99109/nintendo-wont-use-generative-ai-in-its-first-party-games/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TweakTown</a>), Furukawa was asked about his and Nintendo's stance on generative AI in gaming.</p>
<p>In response to the question, Furukawa said that while he recognizes the potential of generative AI to be "more creative" than regular gaming AI, he and Nintendo also acknowledge that it has "issues with intellectual property rights".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-generative-ai.jpg?itok=kP_1sgnM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-generative-ai.jpg?itok=7j3l1kCU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't expect to see generative AI in the next&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>Furukawa goes on to say that Nintendo has "decades of know-how" in creating games for its customers, and that it wants to "deliver value that is unique to [Nintendo]" which "cannot be achieved through technology alone".</p>
<p>It's important to note that Furukawa doesn't outright reject the possibility of Nintendo ever using generative AI; he says the company "remain[s] flexible in responding to technological developments".</p>
<p>However, it sounds like Nintendo is being rightly cautious about using generative AI in its games given the potential of AI to infringe copyright. He doesn't mention AI's <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/glep/article/24/2/9/120588/Generative-AI-and-Social-Media-May-Exacerbate-the" rel="noopener" target="_blank">potentially disastrous impact on the climate</a>, nor its tendency to <a href="https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/basics/addressing-ai-hallucinations-and-bias/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">damagingly "hallucinate"</a>, but these are serious issues facing AI proponents as well.</p>
<p>Nintendo is just the latest company to address the use of generative AI in games, and it's worth noting that the Japanese giant is one of the more skeptical companies; others have been quicker to embrace what they see as AI's potential to improve their games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-skull-and-bones-generative-ai.jpg?itok=OkZ5d3q7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-skull-and-bones-generative-ai.jpg?itok=g1pAIeIr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is one of the publishers that has hitched its wagon to AI.</figcaption></figure><p>Publishers that have embraced the use of generative AI in games include EA, which says <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more">development could become up to 30% more efficient</a> through AI usage, and Ubisoft, which is looking into the potential of generative AI for everything from NPC dialogue to internal processes.</p>
<p>The tech has also been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests">embraced by Xbox</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-by-nvidia-aims-to-prove-power-of-generative-ai-in-games-does-exactly-opposite">graphics card giant Nvidia</a>, although I'd argue that none of these companies have done a great job of demonstrating what's in it for us as players when it comes to AI.</p>
<p>Of course, there's always a chance that Nintendo will change its stance regarding AI in the future, although the gaming giant has never been particularly timely when it comes to trends. Stay tuned for more on all things AI in gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/tiny-garden-looks-like-an-adorable-polly-pocket-full-of-sunshine-for-pc-and-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>A fun-looking farming sim known as Tiny Garden has cropped up on Kickstarter. </p>
<p>Tiny Garden is described as a "tiny farming and easy-going strategy game inside a tiny toy from the 90s". While developer Ao Norte doesn't specify further, it is immediately apparent Tiny Garden's quaint toy-aesthetic has been inspired by Polly Pocket, with its clam shell opening, dolls house-like levels and - of course - its tiny garden.</p>
<p>Other video game inspirations, meanwhile, include the likes of Unpacking and Summerhouse.</p>

<p>"Plant, grow, and trade your vegetables for new plants and items to customise your toy set," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2812450/Tiny_Garden/">game's Steam page reads</a>. "In Tiny Garden, everything revolves around the most humble plastic vegetables. Get some carrot or turnip seeds, make them grow, and trade them for bigger and fancier vegetables, plants, or even furniture items to customise every corner of your garden."</p>
<p>You can see Tiny Garden's Kickstarter trailer above.</p>
<p>Ao Norte promises a wholesome, stress-free game on Tiny Garden's debut, with no death or fail state. Just the pleasure of gardening with the added bonus of "charming items and wonderful secrets" to discover.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Tiny Garden has raised £7368 of its £4234 Kickstarter goal, with 350 backers supporting the project. It actually reached its initial goal in just one hour, but if you are keen to also get involved, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aonorte/tiny-garden-build-your-own-magical-garden-inside-a-90s-toy/description">Kickstarter</a> is running until 1st August.</p>
<p>Tiny Garden does not have a specific launch date as yet, although it is planned for a digital release across Nintendo Switch and PC. Well, trowel be! </p>

It was remade as Ys: The Oath in Felghana for PSP in 2005. The remake was ported to PC in 2012.</p><p>Oath in Felghana completely overhauled Ys III, and this new edition adds quality-of-life enhancements like Turbo mode, optional new character illustrations throughout the game, and voice acting for protagonist Adol Christin. For music fans, this version features three different iterations of the original soundtrack, all remastered in high-quality audio.</p><p>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana follows the adventurous hero Adol and his companion Dogi as they return to Felghana after an eight-year journey. The lands are now filled with deadly monsters and a greedy overlord rules over the suffering residents. While Dogi leaves to seeks help from his former master, Adol stays on to assist the locals and quickly finds himself caught in the middle of new conspiracies and ancient legacies.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 lead system architect Mark Cerny is surprised by the wide adoption of ray tracing, which he expected to see more in the latter parts of the current console generation, and the push for 60 frames per second, which has sort of become a universal rule.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/mark-cerny-at-60-i-the-gi-interview">GamesIndustry</a> last month, the man mostly responsible for the Playstation 4 and the PlayStation 5 discussed his long career, the present, and possibly the future of gaming. Asked about what has surprised him the most in the current console generation, Mark Cerny revealed that he has been surprised by the wide adoption of ray tracing. Adding ray tracing capabilities to the current generation console was a late decision, and he thought that the technology would be used in games released late in the generation. On the contrary, several launch titles supported ray tracing, which made him happy.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 lead system architect was also surprised by the current generation's push for 60 frames per second, which was unexpected based on previous console generations.</p>
<p><em>"The other thing that has been surprising is the push to 60 frames per second. Based on previous console lifecycles, I would have expected there to be a lot more games that are 30 frames per second only, just because the artwork can be so much more detailed if you have longer time to render it. Instead, the almost universal rule this time around has been the games run at 60."</em></p>
<p>During the same interview, the PlayStation 5 lead system architect also commented on the impact Sony's consoles have had on the larger industry, such as putting pressure on the PC world with the PS5's SSD and on the Playstation to PC ports, which have been proven to be simpler than many thought. To compensate for games taking advantage of bespoke console features not available on PC, the minimum requirements for CPU and RAM were increased to compensate, and so far, it is undeniable Sony has done a very good job, barring a few disappointing ports that took some months to fix.</p>
<p><em>"There’s a recent development here, which is console exclusives that were created to run on bespoke PlayStation systems are now making their way to PC. That conversion has been simpler than many thought. The main consequence is that the minimum spec for the PC version of the game gets a bit higher, perhaps more CPUs or more RAM, in order to replace the missing systems."</em></p>
<p>Having led the development of the PlayStation 5, Mark Cerny undoubtedly led the creation of the upcoming Pro model. While the new hardware has yet to be officially announced, we already know, thanks to leaks, that it will come with some new features like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/">PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a> and better ray tracing performance that will likely impact the industry as a whole as much as some of the base model's features did.</p>

For fighting game developers, the inclusion or exclusion of fan-favorite characters is a frequent topic of discussion, more so with each subsequent game.

They go on to say it feels “like pulling teeth” to get her in a game, despite her perceived popularity compared to other characters across the franchise.

Ultimate</em> have taken on the gargantuan task of releasing a game with every previous fighter, Harada says having a <em>Tekken</em> game with “50-70 characters” from the start is “unrealistic in every respect.”</p><p>“It should also be understood that all needs have opposing sides,” Harada wrote. “On top of that, I’ll say it again...your love for the characters is distorting the way you look at things, and it’s so absurd that you unilaterally think negatively about my point of view because of it.”</p><p>Things escalated further when someone else interjected that it would make sense “from a business standpoint” to stop introducing new fighters with each incremental release to “avoid this conundrum [he brings upon himself].” Harada <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1808326188995375348&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1808326188995375348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">didn’t seem thrilled by that suggestion</a></span>, but also seemed tired of explaining the business realities of making video games. Not for free, anyway.</p><p>“Do you need me to explain that to you from every perspective now,” Harada asked. “Then from here on out, I’m going to charge you tuition for lectures on ‘what video games are,’ ‘what game development is,’ ‘what the game market is,’ ‘what the game business is,’ and so on. Also, before we talk about your business perspective, please tell me your business track record.”</p><p>I’d attend that class, to be honest. Harada’s willingness to engage with the <em>Tekken </em>community, despite the annoying shit he sometimes has to deal with, is commendable. It has resulted in some fun and heartwarming stories like fans <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-waffle-house-stage-1851378866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-waffle-house-stage-1851378866">asking for a Waffle House stage</a></span>, and when he helped a player <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-ai-ghost-katsuhiro-harada-kohei-ikeda-lee-1851282635&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-ai-ghost-katsuhiro-harada-kohei-ikeda-lee-1851282635">salvage ghost data</a></span> to remember a lost loved one. <em>Tekken 8 </em>is doing pretty well for itself, though there has been some controversy surrounding <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-steam-rating-battle-pass-microtransaction-1851400527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-steam-rating-battle-pass-microtransaction-1851400527">its inclusion of a battle pass</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1808502613630955567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, the Dead by Daylight team confirmed all of the content coming in July 2024 with an official roadmap.</p>



<p>The devs teased a livestream for the anticipated 2v8 game mode for July 16, ahead of the mode’s release on July 25. </p>



<p>Week 2 will also feature another archive with “Mythic”, as well as the previously announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lara-croft-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight-july-16-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lara Croft survivor</a>. Croft will come with the Finesse, Hardened, and Specialist perks, which emphasize athletic and survival skills.</p>



<p>Week 3 will include both the 2v8 game mode and a Blood and Bones collection on July 25. Finally, week 4 will close things out with a “Forgotten Memory” collection on July 30. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Many fans are already calling for 2v8 to become a permanent mode in Dead by Daylight, following its July debut.</p>



<p>Although the game frequently has popular IP collaborations, it also continues to regularly update and evolve. The new 2v8 mode will greatly increase the scope of a match, and likely invite some surprising new combinations.</p>



<p>In May 2024, fans also got their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heres-a-first-look-at-dead-by-daylight-universe-game-project-t/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first look at Project T</a>, a new game set in the Dead by Daylight universe.</p>



<p>Last month, Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-dev-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced new layoffs</a>, affecting nearly 100 employees. The studio stated that this is part of “multiple strategic changes to its corporate structure. Fortunately, Dead by Daylight still features many healthy updates and fixes.</p>

<p>The game, which sees a party of four characters embarking on an off-kilter and wacky journey to save a kingdom, will arrive on PC via Steam on September 24th, and it's also coming to Switch "a little later", according to a press release.</p>
<p>Said press release also describes the game's tone as "very much like the funny bits of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>", so if you appreciated that game's tabletop-style chaotic shenanigans, then&nbsp;<em>Worlds of Aria&nbsp;</em>is definitely one to check out.</p>

<p>Twelve characters are available, each with a different personality, and you can choose whether you want to use your unique skills to contribute to the party or simply to do your own thing.</p>
<p><em>Worlds of Aria&nbsp;</em>boasts the involvement of&nbsp;<em>Critical Role</em>'s Laura Bailey, marking <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-therapist-critical-role-hades-2">the second game in a month or so</a> to count a&nbsp;<em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>star among its roster.</p>
<p>It's difficult to describe&nbsp;<em>Worlds of Aria</em>'s peculiar brand of madness in words, so if you want to get a better idea of what you're in for, you can check out the game's release date trailer right here.</p>

If you’ve spent the day concentrating on work, doing your taxes, cleaning your home, or caring for others, it’s not a bad idea to also take a little time for yourself to escape from your adult responsibilities.</p><p>These days, play can take a lot of different forms — whether it’s assembling the latest monster Lego project, getting together for a marathon board game, or staying up later than you should with your favorite virtual city builder. On a screen or on a tabletop, virtual or touchable, played alone or with friends — games are a way we can keep ourselves centered.&nbsp;</p><p>We asked the staff of <em>The Verge</em> what games they play in order to give their busy brains a rest — and these are some of the answers we got.&nbsp;</p><p><h3>Tabletop games</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-SPL01-Splendor/dp/B00IZEUFIA?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Splendor</a> board game</h4></p><p><em>Becca Farsace, senior video producer</em></p><div><p>A strategy card game in which players compete to build Renaissance Europe’s most lucrative and prestigious jewelry business.</p></div><p>The best part about the game Splendor is taking a moment to look around and watch your friends thinking really, <em>really</em> hard. This is a board game that has no board, just cards and chips, where the objective is to collect gems and acquire capital and property. It is best played with three to five people on a large table. And it involves a whole lot of strategizing, thinking, and endlessly scanning cards. This makes for great thinking faces!</p><p>I ditched the box for a <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=a6dc4029-3e05-45a2-84c7-39f62c33d79b&amp;website_id=0f9b0f6f-13ac-4498-8e0f-b3beae765e07&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftopodesigns.com%2Fproducts%2Ftopolite-accessory-bag%3Fvariant%3D42979849601077">small pouch</a> and now bring this game to most bar hangs. And when I’m at home, I find it best when paired with a <a href="https://youtu.be/IEt_FpwTD4c?si=AlFVQmD1Fv-WiDo_">long playlist</a> that you won’t have to spend any extra mental strength thinking about.&nbsp;</p><p><h4>Loop strategy game</h4></p><p><em>Joanna Nelius, reviewer</em></p><div><figcaption><em>The Loop strategy game is, unfortunately, hard to find.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Pandasaurus Games</cite></p></div><p>Over the last year, I’ve made a purposeful effort to engage in more screen-free entertainment, and now my shelf is overflowing with fantastic indie board and card games. It’s hard to choose a favorite, but Loop by Pandasaurus Games is so far the best co-op board game I have ever played. The basic premise is to stop the evil Dr. Faux from creating riffs in the space-time continuum across seven different eras while destroying his clones. If an era gains too many rifts, Dr. Faux creates a time vortex, and if he creates too many he destroys the world.</p><p>It sounds simple, but there is a surprising amount of strategy involved, almost like a chess match. You have to think several moves ahead, and not just about what you will do but also how that will affect your teammates when it’s their turn. It encourages players to communicate and plan effectively, yet doesn’t slow down the game’s pace with crunchy mechanics. You don’t have to mess around with dice, stacks of cards, or tons of game pieces, and every playthrough is completely different.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll probably lose a lot (I did), but that frustration kept me coming back to kick Dr. Faux’s butt — and when my team and I finally did, we cheered and high-fived. It was such a cool feeling!</p><p>Unfortunately, Loop is no longer available at most stores, but you may be able to pick up a copy at eBay or your local gaming store.</p><p><h4><a href="https://www.amazon.com/North-Star-Games-Evolution-Limited/dp/B087HXKL16/ref=sr_1_2?tag=theverge02-20">Evolution: Oceans</a> board game</h4></p><p><em>Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, reviewer</em></p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="XB21Oy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/North-Star-Games-Evolution-Limited/dp/B087HXKL16/ref=sr_1_2?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Evolution: Oceans</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->55</span></p><p>A strategy board game in which you enter the mysterious world of the Earth’s oceans.</p></div><p>Finding a board game that will entertain a 13-year-old girl, a 16-year-old boy, my partner, and me is a challenge. We’ve cycled through all the classics as well as newer options — Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride, Catan, and more. While these are all great, inevitably one of the group develops a passionate dislike for the game (usually after a few too many losses) and it drops off our rotation. However, Evolution: Oceans has been a constant crowd-pleaser for over six months now, and we all love it.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the Evolution series from <a href="https://www.northstargames.com/products/evolution">NorthStar Game Studio</a>, Oceans is a beautiful, complicated, compelling, and challenging strategy game. You create new species to fill your ocean and fight to develop them and keep them alive using adaptations and abilities such as schooling and speed, tentacles, and parasitic abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Cards give you your powers, and these are gorgeously illustrated, making this game a visual feast. It does have a fairly steep learning curve, but once you get going and the strategies unfold, the gameplay is smooth and relatively fast-paced. There is a fair amount of player-to-player interaction, so we’ve had a couple of temper tantrums, but nothing big enough to knock this one off our family’s top spot… at least not yet.</p><p><h4><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Horizon-Forbidden-West-Collectible/dp/B09Q46YHKB?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Lego <em>Horizon Forbidden West </em>Tallneck</a> set</h4></p><p><em>Jay Peters, news editor</em></p><p>Legos aren’t exactly a board game, and in fact, I don’t get many Lego sets anymore, but building <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/15/22933964/lego-horizon-forbidden-west-set-guerilla-games-collaboration">the <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> set</a> for my birthday last year was such an absolute delight, that I had to include it here. The Tallnecks are one of my favorite creatures from Sony’s hit video game series, so it was really fun to bring an awesome robot dinosaur to life in Lego form. And best of all, the Tallneck is actually, well, tall, measuring 13 1/2 inches in height and towering over the comparatively tiny Aloy minifigure that comes with the set.</p><p>I sadly had to deconstruct my Lego Tallneck — which I named Aioli — when I recently moved my desk setup into a different room. But I’ve just realized I have a perfect spot to rebuild AIoli once again, and fortunately, there’s plenty of headroom for his head to stand tall.</p><p><h3>Video games</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg28xx">Anbernic RG28XX</a> handheld emulator</h4></p><p><em>Andrew Liszewski, senior news reporter</em></p><div><p>The Anbernic RG28XX is a new, tiny console that feels just as small as the Micro, but with a larger screen and the ability to play thousands of different retro games through emulation.</p></div><p>I have been mildly obsessed with handheld consoles ever since seeing a print ad for the original Nintendo Game Boy in a <em>TV Guide</em> decades ago. Although my favorite Nintendo handheld is still the tiny and highly pocketable Game Boy Micro, its hardware is really showing its age, and I hate carrying around a handful of cartridges. The Anbernic RG28XX is a new, tiny console that feels just as small as the Micro, but with a larger screen that’s easier on my aging eyes and the ability to play thousands of different retro games through emulation. However, my game of choice is frequently <em>Baseball Advance</em>, an obscure Game Boy Advance sports title from 2002. If I find myself with a couple of extra minutes to spare, I’ll usually be going to bat with the Tigers against the Blue Jays for a couple of innings.</p><p><em>Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor</em></p><p>Back in the summer of 2018, I was temporarily unemployed and taking occasional freelance gigs, including one where I worked as an extra for the second season of <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em>. There was a lot of sitting around between scenes, and one woman and I started using our phones to play Scrabble — or, rather, a Scrabble-like mobile game app called <em>Words with Friends 2</em>. When the job was over, we kept it up, and after a couple of weeks, I started another game with a former work colleague. When each game was over, we started another. And it just never stopped.</p><p>I still play with these two friends — friends whom, I might add, I never otherwise see. While the app itself is free, <em>Words with Friends 2</em> can be pretty obnoxious — there are constant ads and never-ending urgings to pay for various upgrades. But I can’t give up yet. I’m behind several games, and I’ve got to see if I can make a seven-letter score at least once this coming round….&nbsp;</p><p><em>Liam James, supervising producer, audio</em></p><div><p><em>Cities: Skylines II </em>is a spiritual SimCity successor that lets you build your own version of a city from the ground up.</p></div><p>Part of my job as supervising producer of audio for <em>The Verge</em> involves building very complicated spreadsheets to track all kinds of important metrics.

Well, I love city-building games because when you boil them down, they are just spreadsheet simulators with a fun and pretty UI on top. My latest obsession is <em>Cities: Skylines II, </em>a spiritual SimCity successor. After a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180033/cities-skylines-2s-fix-for-high-rent-removing-landlords">bumpy launch earlier this year</a>, the game has ironed out most of the bugs and performance issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Most recently, I’ve been experimenting with a city build that has no roads for cars. To get around, my citizens must walk or take mass transit. But without cars and trucks, how do you move commercial goods around your town? Well, the truth is, I don’t know yet, but I am having a heck of a time figuring it out. There are endless ways to get lost inside a city builder, but for me, the most fun comes from solving one problem at a time and seeing how it affects all the other systems — like a column in a spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Sean Hollister, senior editor</em></p><div><p>Duck Game is a 2D arena battle with the frantic energy of <em>Smash Bros</em>, but here you’re playing ducks with guns.</p></div><p>Ouya, the indie game console, was one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019">biggest technology flops of the past decade</a>.

The game doesn’t teach you how to play, and yet, it has so much depth, my friends are still discovering new techniques nearly nine years after we began. You can fire shots at all sorts of angles if you jump just right! Holding a certain box can let you drop faster!

<p>I love a big cast of characters in my free-to-play games. It offers players like me a chance to explore additional playstyles that I normally wouldn’t touch. Alongside the replayability factor, there’s also the fact that a broad cast of characters appeals to more people, which is excellent for the developers. So, with that in mind, these are the playable characters in Zenless Zone Zero!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-playable-character-in-zenless-zone-zero">Every Playable Character in Zenless Zone Zero</h2>



<p>The list of playable characters in Zenless Zone Zero is rather expansive. Each character is part of a unique faction within the post-apocalyptic game world, and they all have a specialization. The available specializations in Zenless Zone Zero include Anomaly, Attack, Defense, Stun, and Support.</p>

<p>That’s quite the list of characters! Who will you be playing as in Zenless Zone Zero? Personally, I’m leaning toward Ben Bigger and Zhu Yuan!</p>







<h2 id="h-will-we-see-new-characters-in-zenless-zone-zero">Will We See New Characters in Zenless Zone Zero?</h2>



<p>If Zenless Zone Zero is anything like Genshin Impact, the studio’s previous free-to-play game, we’ll absolutely see additional characters added to the game with content updates in the coming months and years following release. Over the years, Genshin added countless new playable characters, with more still on the way. We imagine ZZZ will follow suit.</p>



<p>For now, however, the list of available characters is rather massive and should provide plenty of unique playstyles!</p>

<p>MADFINGER Games has just dropped Gray Zone Warfare’s ‘Patch 2’, the highly anticipated overhaul that impacts many areas of the popular open-world extraction shooter. Since being released on April 30, Gray Zone Warfare has gone from strength to strength, presenting players with a unique perspective on the tactical-slash-extraction shooter niche that offers complete freedom and no real restrictions.</p>



<p>It’s a beast of a patch – read on to check out what’s new in Gray Zone Warfare’s 0.1.2 update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-about-the-gray-zone">All About The Gray Zone</h2>



<p>Recently, we caught up with MADFINGER’s Rick Lagnese to talk about the success of Gray Zone Warfare and to plot the future of the game. It’s an exciting and developing space to be sure, and with almost one million copies sold in the last two months, Gray Zone is setting a new standard for what’s expected from extraction shooters.</p>



<p>Here are some of the <a href="https://x.com/GrayZoneWarfare/status/1808427066469003401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">most important aspects of Patch 2</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>9 new landing zones added for boosted convenience</li>



<li>VRAM optimisations to make the game run smoother on various GPUs</li>



<li>Rubber-banding reduced through optimisations (one of the biggest issues in GZW)</li>



<li>Ground Zero’s radiation has been ‘fixed’ in the centre of the map</li>



<li>Disconnect protection has been tweaked, allowing players to reconnect to the same server</li>



<li>Friendlies in base camps can’t be looted – which means no more exploits</li>



<li>More than 100 bug fixes (audio, lighting, clipping, scenery, etc)</li>
</ul>



<p>MADFINGER has also ‘polished various world locations’ and removed a few lines of dialogue and environmental objects because they either weren’t right or they were buggy.</p>



<p>The first <strong>major major </strong>update for Gray Zone Warfare is on the horizon, and MADFINGER has promised that soon, the full roadmap will be revealed. This will give us a date for the day/night cycle and whatever else is coming next.</p>

<p>They say hanging out with friends makes everything more entertaining. I wouldn’t know because we’re talking about an anime game here, and that’s grounds for ridicule in many friend groups. Well, it’s their loss! Will Zenless Zone Zero be multiplayer, though?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-zenless-zone-zero-multiplayer">Can You Play Zenless Zone Zero Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>On launch day (July 4), Zenless Zone Zero will not feature multiplayer. That said, it’s coming. Developer HoYoverse will support a multiplayer mode in Zenless Zone Zero, with some type of Arcade mode, which offers online features, such as mini-games with others. </p>



<p>Furthermore, if you prefer PvP in your free-to-play games, then you’ll be happy to learn ZZZ will also include a battle mode, but that’s down the road a ways.</p>



<p>So, the short answer is that multiplayer is coming, but be patient!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-zenless-zone-zero-free-to-play">Is Zenless Zone Zero Free to Play?</h2>



<p>Is there anything better than knowing an upcoming game you’re completely over the hills with hype over will be free to play? Knowing it has multiplayer is a giant leap forward, but not spending a dime to score potentially hundreds of hours of gameplay? That’s a clear-cut winner in our eyes.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Zenless Zone Zero is entirely free to play. You can download it free on PlayStation 5, PC (Epic Games Store), Android, and iOS. Of course, as a free-to-play game, expect a multitude of microtransactions to help the studio recuperate costs and make a profit. </p>

<p>Prepare for launch day by learning about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zenless-zone-zero-pc-requirements-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zenless Zone Zero PC requirements</a> with us!

                <p>Video game prop weapons are commonly seen in collections or at conventions. But it's a bad idea to carry around a replica video game weapon that has an actual blade attached to it. Anthony Bray, a resident of Nuneaton in Warwickshire, England discovered this the hard way when police arrested him last month for carrying a replica of Link's Master Sword from The Legend of Zelda.</p><p>Via the <a href="https://www.warwickshire.police.uk/news/warwickshire/news/2024/july/anthony-bray-sentenced-to-four-months-for-possession-of-replica-master-sword/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warwickshire police</a>, Bray has been sentenced to four months in prison for carrying a bladed article in public. According to the report, Bray was spotted by officers on June 8 with the Master Sword in his hands as he walked down the street. However, it's important to note that this wasn't simply some toy prop. There was a real blade attached on this Master Sword. </p><p>Bray told officers that he purchased the Master Sword replica online, and intended to use it as a "fidget toy" to keep his hands busy. Bray also told officers that he didn't plan on using the sword as a weapon. But since he was openly carrying blade in public, Bray broke the law whether he intended to or not.</p><p>"It is possible to find fidget toys that aren't six-inch blades, said Warwickshire police Sergeant Spellman in a statement. "It is possible not to walk down the street holding them out in front of you. With a bit more self-awareness, Bray could have avoided contact with us completely."</p><p>In addition to his sentence, Bray will also have to pay a fine of £154. But there was no mention in the report about whether the Master Sword replica will be returned to Bray when he is released from prison.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/45-parabellum-bloodhound-sukeban-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>VA-11 Hall-A&nbsp;</em>developer Sukeban Games has announced&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound</em>, a new and rather strange-looking game that marries turn-based combat with real-time gameplay.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://sukeban.moe/index.php/2024/07/03/parabellum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement on the studio's official website</a>, Sukeban's Christopher Ortiz, otherwise known as kiririn51, describes&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound&nbsp;</em>as an "Active Time Action" game, playfully following up by saying that descriptor "sounds a little bit like nonsense but we like nonsense".</p>
<p>In a similar way to the<em>&nbsp;Parasite Eve&nbsp;</em>series, the game will feature combat in which you move and dodge in real-time while you wait for an action bar to fill up, and once it's full, you can pause the fight and plan your attack.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/45-parabellum-bloodhound-combat.jpg?itok=HRVhef_k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/45-parabellum-bloodhound-combat.jpg?itok=os8WHopP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sukeban Games' newest title blends real-time combat with turn-based strategic planning.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the combat might boast some similarities with&nbsp;<em>Parasite Eve</em>, Ortiz says that's where the similarities end, although&nbsp;<em>Parasite Eve&nbsp;</em>is a personal favorite of his.</p>
<p>Instead, he's building a game with "highly atmospheric environments" and "hand-placed encounters", one that's full of secrets to discover and a "unique cast of characters" to meet, as well as bosses to fight at the conclusion of each level.</p>
<p>According to Ortiz,&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound&nbsp;</em>will have seven chapters to play through, and right now, five of those chapters are playable from start to end, although we're likely a long way from release.</p>
<p>Ortiz says that he doesn't know when&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound&nbsp;</em>will be released, and that in order to avoid repeating <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/n1rv-ann-release-date-delayed-indefinitely">"a&nbsp;<em>N1rvannA&nbsp;</em>situation"</a>, he's not going to give a rough timeline for release either.</p>

<p>While we don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound</em>, Ortiz and his team have promised monthly development updates to showcase how work on the project is going. They'll likely be released via the official Sukeban Games website, so check back often for those if you're interested.</p>

            <p>
<em>Hello! Eurogamer is once again marking Pride with another week of features celebrating the intersection of LGBTQIA+ culture and gaming in all its guises. Today, Florence Smith Nicholls explores experimental escape room Memoirscape and its tale of queer love in the 80s.</em>
</p>
<p>"This room is very gender."</p>
<p>We're in a teen bedroom - the exact location and date is a little hazy, but it's somewhere in Queens, New York City, in 1986. All the hallmarks of adolescence are here, posters on the walls, a brightly covered duvet, knick-knacks. The space is bathed in warm light. I sit down on the bed and pick up a romance novel left nearby. It's comfortable, one might even say cosy,  but we're not alone. Another group is huddled around a cassette player, listening to a recording of a private conversation between two young women. When I look closer at the photographs on the walls, some of the faces seem to be crossed out. Oh, and the novel is <em>extremely gay</em>.</p>
<p>This is Memoirscape, a self-styled 'cosy escape room' created as part of the Design of Interactive Experiences course at Massachusetts' Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Its slightly sci-fi set-up casts players as participants in a live demonstration of Dr. Julia Adler's work on interactive memories. For this particular experiment, they step into one of Adler's own memories, exploring a happy summer she spent in her grandmother's NYC apartment before heading off to college. Here, in an experience combining elements of immersive theatre and environmental storytelling, they're free to interact with Adler's childhood living room and bedroom as they please, learning more about her past - and her long-lost love - through the ephemera in each room. As <a href="https://escaperoom.wpi.edu/">Memoirscape's website</a> puts it,"Let your curiosity guide you, and notice the narrative unfold."</p>
<div data-domain="www.youtube-nocookie.com"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A8Jeyfyk4Ck?si=ReXG5q1E89FWrg2n" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe><p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>Like other escape rooms, Memoirscape features puzzles to solve. Players are tasked with finding a series of cassette tapes and noting down corresponding letters to form a code, for instance, while other clues, such as a cryptic message on the TV, prompt them toward further solutions. Unlike traditional escape rooms, however, there's no time limit and the "escape" is less literal; the ultimate goal is to work out how to help Dr. Adler by leaving the cosy living room behind, finding her office, and figuring out why she's so fixated on reliving the summer of 1986. "It's an experience, like childhood, you'll eventually have to leave behind," continues the official description. "How you choose to do so, what you do when you leave, and how you feel about your memory of it… that's what's up to you." There are even four different endings, none of which diminish the player for not getting further.</p>
<p>Given Memoirscape's billing as a space you can enter, soak up, and leave whenever you feel like, its sense of atmosphere is key - and its recreation of a cosily nostalgic corner of 1986 is certainly impressive. Memoirscape's design is built on what its narrative and production consultant Katherine Crighton calls "asynchronous storytelling through ephemera" - inspired by Punchdrunk's immersive experience Sleep No More and Henning Nelm's 1969 handbook Magic and Showmanship - and, as someone who studies archaeological approaches to games, I was fascinated by this material culture.</p>
<p>The rooms that make up Dr. Adler's memories of her grandmother's apartment are stuffed with authentic 80s bric-a-brac, including carefully curated bookshelves and vintage board games. There are even 80s-style video games programmed specifically for the experience by Samin Shahriar Tokey using a Raspberry Pi and touchscreen. But amid all this richly authentic detail, there's perhaps one element that truly gets to the heart of Memoirscape: the novel I mentioned back at the start, author Nancy Garden's groundbreaking 1982 queer young adult love story, Annie on My Mind.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/pride-week-florence-lounge.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>There's lots of knick knacks to distract you-even sweets! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Florence Smith Nicholls</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As Crighton tells me over email, Worcester Polytechnic Institute's Interactive Media and Game Development program - which Memoirscape was created for - has a vibrant community of queer students, "and so the development of Julia Adler... into a young lesbian in 1986 was a definite 'write what you know' moment". And woven between Memoirscape's more familiar escape room elements is a queer love story that Annie on My Mind mirrors almost serendipitously. "As I started digging into the book to make sure it still fit within our cosy gameplay," Crighton explains, "I discovered connection after connection with not just the characters our students had created, but our larger worldbuilding as well. After that, choosing to make the main thrust of Memoirscape be the love story between Julie and Steph, and the persistence of memory fueled by that love, felt like being given the key to a door we hadn't realised could be opened."</p>
<p>Indeed, Memoirscape's very specific 80s nostalgia goes beyond mere aesthetics. On the path to uncovering Alder's past, for instance, players use genuine, old-fashioned audio cassettes to gather clues - a process Crighton believes encourages them to "practice patience and mindfulness" as they interact with unfamiliar analogue technology. But its 1986 setting also creates a certain kind of tension for a queer person who might be nostalgic for the era, despite it being a less accepting period. I was disappointed but not surprised to discover Annie on My Mind has been the subject of controversy over the years, and even burnt in Kansas City in 1993 just because it's a story about two young women in love.</p>

</figure>
<p>Ultimately, Memoirscape invites a different kind of escapism beyond timed metrics, accommodating a range of playstyles to suit different tastes. For me, combing through its carefully curated period-appropriate books and ephemera was a joy, but other players might choose to simply hang out with their friends, play chess, and soak up its period atmosphere. Or they might opt to speedrun the puzzles and discover Adler's secrets as quickly as possible. Without spoiling too much, the way to progress the story and find Dr Adler's office is always hidden in plain sight and there's nothing stopping players from leaving and finding her lab, even Adler herself. In this way Memoirscape perhaps subverts one of the fundamental principles of escape rooms; it isn't that players are prevented from leaving, they're presented with a space so cosy they don't <em>want</em> to leave.</p>
<p>Given Memoirscape's emphasis on set design and exploration, it reminded me of video games with similar themes. An obvious parallel would be developer Fullbright's walking simulator, Gone Home; as in that game's tale of slowly unfurling familial revelations, Adler's story is told as an epistolary narrative, allowing players to discover more at their own pace. I can't help but wonder what it would look like if other games with rich environmental storytelling like Elden Ring created challenge through distraction rather than conflict. Just imagine if all the books in Elden Ring's Raya Lucaria Academy were readable - it would certainly add a new kind of difficulty for the lore enthusiasts!</p>
<p>With the new wave of dark cosy games like Grave Seasons and Wanderstop upon us, it seems there is an appetite for experiences that question the comfort that they provide. Memoirscape proves that an escape room can be queer not just in terms of subject matter, but through challenging players by creating a literal comfort zone that they need to break out of. It's a cosy escape room that isn't afraid to engage with the complexities of queerness and nostalgia, especially in terms of how we can idealise the past, both on a personal and wider level. As Memoirscape's director-producer Kathleen Morrissey puts it: "You need the darkness in order to huddle closer to the hearth, after all."</p>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon and through Tuesday evening, many Xbox owners were upset to find that <a href="https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1808256771640766610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they couldn’t sign in</a> to Xbox Live due to a server outage. While a service being down isn’t new in the world of gaming, it’s another case against the always online nature of where we are with it.</p>



<p>This wasn’t a situation where servers for games were down. According to Microsoft’s Xbox status page, the Microsoft store was functional, multiplayer gaming was online, cloud gaming was online, and more. What wasn’t was the ability to sign in to your account. This stopped players from pretty much playing anything they had. That includes single-player games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Persona 5 Royal, which Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/nitpicktim/status/1808229756707787091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nitpicktim</a> shared a video of, was completely unplayable despite having no need to be connected. It’s a single-player game. Another game that would’ve been unplayable had it been available during this time is Neon White. Yet another title with no need for online. However, because you couldn’t sign in, you were screwed. </p>



<p>Want to play Elden Ring? Nope. Assassin’s Creed? Tough luck.</p>



<p>This may come across as a, sort of, “old man yells at cloud” type of argument, but I’m on the side of the player here. If you own a game – well, license nowadays – and you just want to play it, you should always be able to play it. It’s pretty straight forward.</p>



<p>I’ve said this countless times and I’ll continue to beat this drum. Forcing an online connection to play single-player games is anti-consumer and absolutely ridiculous. I get it for multiplayer games, obviously. But for games that don’t have any benefit aside from patches to be online, what’s the point?&nbsp;</p>



<p>All this does is restrict people who spend their money on your console and on games. We know the days of buying a game, putting it in your system, and just playing it are over. There’s no going back to that. But with how Xbox is currently set, if you lose internet connection or the Xbox servers drop, you’re completely out of luck no matter what. You shouldn’t need the internet to play a game that’s installed locally on your console. It turns your system into a paperweight.</p>



<p>So, why does Microsoft do this? It feels like it’s for no other reason than control. It’s unfair to everyone who you claim are the backbone of your company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An Xbox on every screen doesn’t mean a thing if you restrict them from playing on said screens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arrowhead Studios’ CEO has confirmed that a PC performance patch for Helldivers 2 should arrive this week. Shams Jorjani, the new CEO, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to inform players about the developers’ increased activity on social media platforms such as Discord, Reddit, and X. </p>



<p>Jorjani was then bombarded with questions about the Helldivers 2’s PC performance issues. He replied that they would focus on ‘performance’ in the next patch.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">update coming this week by the looks of it! hope it does the trick! but we'll keep at it regardless</p>— Shams Jorjani (@ShamsJorjani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1807829995781333360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>If you head over to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r/Helldivers</a> subreddit, you will see players constantly raising issues with PC performance. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dn86eq/its_time_to_acknowledge_pc_performance_issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A massive thread</a> posted nine days ago discusses the number of PC issues players have faced since the first patch, with hundreds of players reporting new problems or agreeing to other issues. Players have been waiting for Arrowhead to acknowledge these performance issues with Helldivers 2, and hopefully, it will all be solved through the next patch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, Helldivers 2’s player base is rapidly declining, with only 10% of the original players still active. The game reached an all-time peak of 458,709 players on Steam four months ago, but this number has plummeted to 34,278 in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. </p>



<p>While this doesn’t signify the end of the game, it does underscore the urgency for developers to address the pressing issue of PC performance, which is what the players are eagerly awaiting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking of Helldivers 2, have you explored the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-download-the-helldivers-2-star-wars-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Star Wars mods</a> available for the game? Also, it’s worth noting that a story mode for Arrowhead’s third-person shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-story-mode-not-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is not on the horizon</a>. What specific performance issues are you hoping to see resolved in the upcoming Helldivers 2 PC performance patch? Share your thoughts in the comments below.&nbsp;</p>
