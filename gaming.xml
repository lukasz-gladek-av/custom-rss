<p data-characters="333" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re a <em>One Piece</em> fan, then you probably take pride in the franchise’s impeccable world-building. If you don’t, why aren’t you? Eiichiro Oda is a genius when it comes to lore development, so much so that new revelations often give rise to a slew of new questions. At least, that’s usually the case.</p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">With the series <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-one-piece-arcs-ever-ranked/">entering its final arc</a>, Oda is starting to drop one big revelation after another, such as the ever-elusive Dr. Vegapunk finally making his appearance. But despite the consecutive lore dumps, there remain multiple unanswered mysteries, such as these. </p> <figure data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via ONE PIECE Official YouTube Channel</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-1-what-is-the-one-piece" data-injectable="false">1. What is the One Piece?</h2> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">The titular treasure is the main driving point of the series’ narrative. Gol D. Roger’s proclamation of the One Piece’s existence spurred the Great Age of Piracy, and Whitebeard’s last words reignited the world’s interest in it. The rules stay the same. Whoever finds the greatest treasure is set to be the next Pirate King.</p> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="836" data-injectable="true">It’s been decades since <em>One Piece</em>‘s release, and fans of the series still have no inkling of what the treasure may be. Interestingly, most characters in the series are in the same predicament. Only those who accompanied Gol D. Roger on his final voyage know what the treasure actually is. While we don’t know what One Piece is, we at least know what One Piece is not. After all, Oda already confirmed that it would not be some nonsense like memories or friendship.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Toei Animation </figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-2-what-is-luffy-s-dream" data-injectable="false">2. What is Luffy’s dream?</h2> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true">Luffy has repeatedly proclaimed his goal to become the King of the Pirates countless times, but that’s not the dream I am referring to. After leaving Wano Country, Luffy told his crewmates about an old dream of his. He also told Ace and Sabo about the same dream during their younger years. Unfortunately, though, we didn’t receive the same privilege. </p>
 <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="196" data-injectable="false">What we do know, however, is that it cannot be something ordinary. After all, both his crewmates and his brothers called his dream crazy, and crazy pretty much aligns with Luffy’s character.</p> <figure data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via ONE PIECE Official YouTube Channel</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-3-what-exactly-is-uranus" data-injectable="false">3. What exactly is Uranus?</h2> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">The Ancient Weapons are said to be the strongest weapons in <em>One Piece</em> verse. Each one is capable of destroying countries on their own. We were acquainted with Poseidon, who turns out to be Princess Shirahoshi. While we are yet to see Pluton in actuality, we are at least aware that it comes in the form of a ship. Franky already destroyed its blueprints, though, so there is less chance for us to witness its destructive glory.</p>
 <p data-characters="220" data-current-count="220" data-injectable="false">Unlike the other two, Uranus remains a total mystery. We only know that Uranus exists, but we have no idea of its whereabouts or its capabilities. For all we know, it may already be in the World Government’s hands.</p> <figure data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-4-what-secrets-does-the-void-century-hold" data-injectable="false">4. What secrets does the Void Century hold?</h2> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">As its name suggests, the Void Century pertains to the time period with almost no historical records. It’s not that the records have magically disappeared; it’s just that the World Government is sparing no effort in eradicating its traces. They destroyed any records about the Void Century and made researching it a capital offense.</p> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true">What exactly happened during the Void Century, you ask? That, we don’t know. However, the Void Century is said to hold the true history of the world. The only remaining means of unraveling its mysteries is by deciphering the Poneglyphs, which is something only Nico Robin can do.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via IMDB</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-5-what-role-does-the-nefeltari-family-play" data-injectable="false">5. What role does the Nefeltari family play?</h2> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">The Nefeltari family was introduced early on with Vivi seeking the Straw Hats’ help to free her country. However, recent developments reveal that the Nefeltari family is more than just ordinary royals. They turned out to be one of the twenty monarchs who established the World Government, but unlike the other nineteen, they opted out of ascending to Mary Geoise.</p>
 <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false">Lili, the then-queen of Alabasta, vanished before returning to her kingdom. With Lili turning out to have inherited the Will of D, a new question arises: What role did and will the Nefeltari family play in the grand scheme of things, especially since learning of Lili’s true identity warranted ending King Cobra’s life?</p> <figure data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-6-what-is-the-will-of-d" data-injectable="false">6. What is the Will of D?</h2> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">Speaking of the Will of D, that is another mystery that is yet to be answered. Many prominent characters possess the initial D, and most of them are said to make waves in the world. A few who bear this initial are Monkey D. Luffy and his kin, the above-mentioned Nefeltari D. Lili and her kin, Gol D. Roger, and Marshall D. Teech.</p> <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">Based on those examples, there really must be something with the initial D. However, only future chapters of <em>One Piece</em> can reveal what that something is.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-7-why-was-zunesha-punished" data-injectable="false">7. Why was Zunesha punished?</h2> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece </em>is no stranger to weird islands, but Zou remains unique. The moving island home of the Mink Tribe can move because it sits on top of a gigantic elephant—Zunesha.</p>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">Recent developments revealed that Zunesha isn’t just a mindless, perpetual-moving creature. In fact, Zunesha was Joy Boy’s companion who was punished for committing a certain crime. As to what that specific crime is, we can only make guesses at the moment. </p> <figure data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-8-what-wonders-does-the-ancient-kingdom-hold" data-injectable="false">8. What wonders does the Ancient Kingdom hold?</h2> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">The Ancient Kingdom was once a very powerful kingdom, so powerful that 20 other kingdoms joined arms to eradicate it. After Luffy and the Straw Hats met Vegapunk, they learned that despite being named the Ancient Kingdom, it was a technologically advanced civilization. </p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">These bits and pieces, however, fail to give the whole picture of the Ancient Kingdom’s grandeur. After all, Vegapunk also stated that despite Egghead being renowned as a Future Island, it was far from reaching the Ancient Kingdom’s level.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via ONE PIECE Official YouTube Channel</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-9-what-secrets-does-blackbeard-hold" data-injectable="false">9. What secrets does Blackbeard hold?</h2> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">Blackbeard is probably one of the most detestable characters in <em>One Piece</em>. He betrayed his original crew, handed Ace to the Marines, stole Whitebeard’s Devil Fruit powers, and the list just goes on. However, it’s undeniable that he is one effective villain, and part of it is how mysterious he is.</p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Blackbeard is the only character known to handle two Devil Fruit powers. According to Buggy, Blackbeard could also go days without a wink of sleep. Marco also noted that he had a rather unique body, though he didn’t specify why. While many theories are floating around — including Blackbeard having multiple personalities — the series has yet to provide a definitive answer.</p> <figure data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-10-who-is-luffy-s-mom" data-injectable="false">10. Who is Luffy’s Mom?</h2> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">A very simple query, yet it continues to boggle many fans’ minds. We already know about Luffy’s father, the revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon, and his grandfather, Monkey D. Garp. However, little is known about his mother and grandmother. So, why focus on Luffy’s mother? Because there are more interesting discussions about her.</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="false">There are many theories about who Luffy’s mom can be, but my favorite is the one involving Crocodile. The theory states that Crocodile was originally a woman who turned into a man using Ivankov’s Devil Fruit powers. Ivankov’s ties with the Revolutionary Army give the theory some weight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163499/girlfight-criterion-karyn-kusama-interview-michelle-rodriguez<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="c4wp9l">Not every filmmaker gets their debut feature enshrined in the Criterion Collection. But not every filmmaker’s debut feature packs the punch <em>Girlfight </em>does.</p>
<p id="LNJbZF">Decades after release, Karyn Kusama’s debut movie, <em>Girlfight</em>, still holds up — it’s no surprise that it launched her career as a director of subversive horror drama (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/19/21524290/what-to-watch-netflix-amazon-hulu-jennifers-body-babadook-over-garden-wall"><em>Jennifer’s Body</em></a>, <em>The Invitation</em>) and memorable television (<em>Yellowjackets</em>, <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>, <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>), along with launching Michelle Rodriguez as a star. <em>Girlfight</em> is coming to the <a href="https://www.criterion.com/films/33189-girlfight">Criterion Collection on May 28</a>, with a brand-new 4K digital restoration supervised by Kusama, new interviews and commentary from the director, and a slick new cover by Jillian Adel.</p>
<p id="rWhsrE"><em>Girlfight</em>, the story of a troubled high schooler who takes up boxing in secret as an outlet for her frustrations, aches with high school emotions in and out of the boxing ring. At the same time, it subverts boxing-movie tropes. Rodriguez plays Diana Guzman, a teenager who’s frequently in trouble for fighting at school and alienated from her father (Paul Calderón) at home. When she tries boxing in secret to get some of that tension off her chest, she shows a real talent for the sweet science. At the gym, she meets a boy (named Adrian, making Diana the Rocky in this equation) and a new father figure in her trainer (Jaime Tirelli).</p>

<p id="8odOLW">Making <em>Girlfight </em>was a long process for Kusama, who wrote the movie after taking up boxing herself in 1992. Production companies begged her to cast a white woman in the lead role, but she stood her ground, insisting on a Latina lead and finding Rodriguez in an extensive audition process focusing largely on non-professional actors. After financiers backed out two days before pre-production in 1999, legendary filmmaker (and Kusama’s former mentor) John Sayles and his creative partner and producer Maggie Renzi stepped in and helped fund the film.</p>
<p id="BZNTDL">Polygon spoke to Kusama on a video call ahead of the movie’s Criterion release. We spoke about revisiting her first movie for the restoration, when she knew she had a star in Rodriguez, and whether <em>Girlfight </em>could be made the same way now.</p>
<p id="BOptin"><strong>Polygon: Congratulations on </strong><em><strong>Girlfight </strong></em><strong>being added to the Criterion Collection. When did you find out, and what was your reaction?</strong></p>
<p id="sA2B7b"><strong>Karyn Kusama: </strong>This must have been last year, Criterion reached out to me and said, “We’d really like to remaster <em>Girlfight</em> and release an edition of the film.” I was floored and so excited. I am such a Criterion nerd, as you might imagine, so it was literally a dream come true. For me, this just felt like the ultimate stamp of approval.</p>
<p id="tBiG5C"><strong>Does it mean more to you because it was this one?</strong></p>
<p id="Gu63K5">I think what I appreciate is that it’s my first movie. And as someone now who’s got more than 20 years of time and experience to look back at the film, there’s so many things I might do differently — I might improve, I might cut, or change or refine. And so the idea that it can still work for anyone, despite the fact that I would love to get back in there and completely retool it, that’s gratifying.</p>

<p id="2kcVRt"><strong>Watching it now, I was struck by the balance between the boxing elements, the family drama, the character study, Michelle Rodriguez’s amazing performance, and the high school romance. How do you think back on the balance of all those elements?</strong></p>
<p id="ipCsFP">I never felt like I would want to make a purely boxing-oriented movie. In some ways, the true story is about this character entering a new world, and finding a place for herself within it. And in doing so, opening herself up to a kind of vulnerability that she doesn’t feel capable of exposing at home. It is so much about this tension between the closed emotional world of her family life and the more expansive emotional world of, paradoxically, a boxing ring. So that was something I knew I wanted to do. But I don’t know at the time if I was really weighing the balance of it all. </p>
<p id="IJLL9B">In somewhat ham-fisted terms, I was trying to tell a story about a young woman for whom traditional expressions of femininity didn’t quite feel true to her. And so it was so much about trying to find a path toward self-acceptance, toward some kind of openness, to whatever kind of weirdo she ultimately was going to be.</p>
<p id="mrAabE"><strong>When you look at the movie now, what would you want to tweak?</strong></p>
<p id="4bciV7">I think I would probably lift some scenes and tighten some scenes. I think I would know a little bit more how to evoke the same emotional impact with fewer cuts or fewer shots. I would just get to the heart of the matter faster. But that being said, I think some of what I wrestle with in the movie is also inherent to it, you know, which is a lot of non-actors, a lot of young, raw performances. And in some respects, that’s part of the charm, I hope, of the movie.</p>
<p id="qAdsgY"><strong>And it helps that the central three of her family are so strong</strong>.</p>
<p id="D5reEq">Oh, good. Yeah, I think so. Obviously, Paul Calderón [who played Marie’s father] was a wonderful and well-known actor at the time, and still, and so he could kind of anchor the rest of the cast. But you know, it’s funny, I always find with movies, for me, it’s a process of making the thing, hoping that I made the truest thing I could make, and then moving on and not looking back. And so what’s really weird about doing the Criterion edition is — the process of looking back is both wonderful and painful. I was looking at the movie a lot. So it gave me a lot of time to think about, <em>Oh, I could have done that. I should have done that. </em>A lot of woulda, coulda, shoulda.</p>

<p id="cR4X2n"><strong>Do you think things have changed in the industry over the past two decades? Would making </strong><em><strong>Girlfight </strong></em><strong>now be the same, easier, or more difficult?</strong></p>
<p id="5OGSTx">That’s something I have to chew on. Because in some ways, obviously we all want the answer to be “Things are better now.” I think the hard reality is that we are still almost even more entrenched in a star-driven system. So it would be even harder now, I think, to make a movie with a completely fresh face as the center of the film.</p>
<p id="4yXalP">And luckily for me, when I made <em>Girlfight</em>, Michelle ended up having a true electric, charismatic star power that allowed her to continue to make movies. But now I find it’s still really, really hard. In terms of the questions around representation? I think the conversations are more deliberately coded around what is permissible. But I think ultimately, there is still a lot of resistance to a complicated or complex depiction of the world as we actually live in it. </p>
<p id="acr3Nv"><strong>Working with Michelle Rodriguez on the movie, what did you learn about what makes a movie star and how to showcase that?</strong></p>
<p id="6ctOC5">Oh, that’s such a good question. I mean, first of all, she has a funny un-self-consciousness as an actor. In the initial auditioning process, and initially working with her, I had to kind of remind her of staying in character and staying on book and all of the basics around being an actor. What she didn’t have was shame. There was a quality to her of just like, <em>I’m here. The world can start now.</em> And that quality of guileless confidence is really important. She demanded attention.</p>
<p id="wWE0ev">And that simple kind of intensity is something that I’ve really learned is actually not common across the board. It’s not like every actor I work with has that same intensity, though I’ve certainly worked with actors who had more training and more experience and more discipline. Michelle has a kind of ineffable charisma. </p>
<p id="pc2rRN"><strong>Was there a specific moment with her where you were like, </strong><em><strong>Oh, she’s different</strong></em><strong>, or is that just something that you learned over the course of filming?</strong></p>
<p id="AYEpox">It’s really funny, because I have such a vivid memory of doing all those initial auditions and having hundreds of people in front of us for interviews and short auditions. And we taped them all. And because I’m kind of obsessed with thoroughness, I decided to just go through the process of looking at all the tapes.</p>
<p id="j6ETch">And it was in that moment of looking at her tape, even though she was untrained, completely inexperienced, completely unprepared, kind of every negative you could imagine, she held the screen with such totality that I felt like, <em>Huh, that’s interesting. I have to keep looking at her, I have to keep engaging with this presence.</em> And so it just meant we kept bringing her back. But that initial feeling about her was definitely something that now I look at and I realize, <em>Oh, that was her. That was her star power.</em></p>

<p id="izlwnN"><strong>Would you have predicted her going on to star in major franchises like the Fast and the Furious?</strong></p>
<p id="EkuCUy">At the time, I couldn’t, but she called it for herself way earlier than I could have. Because she always knew what she liked. Immediately when she read <em>The Fast and the Furious</em>, she was like, <em>I know I have to do this, and I know it will be a global franchise</em>. She understood that part of entertainment a lot better than I did.</p>
<p id="jj93ug"><strong>Have there been opportunities for you to work with her on projects of that scale? Is that something you’re interested in?</strong></p>
<p id="Md2pRi">You mean like the giant franchises?</p>
<p id="QmaBjJ"><strong>Yeah. Doesn’t strike me as totally your vibe, but you never know.</strong></p>
<p id="0kjNlY">No, it’s not really my vibe. And a lot of that just has to do with the idea that you need to be making something that is of a piece of a very large entity with a lot of history, and a lot of relationships that people are already bringing to the characters, into the worlds. For that reason, I’m not sure I’d be the best candidate for that kind of work, but never say never, I guess.</p>
<p id="ZJlTAU"><strong>You’re in this really interesting space with both TV and movie opportunities. Where’s your focus next, and what do you see yourself moving toward?</strong></p>
<p id="eL9BEP">I need to be making personal movies again. That’s where I really learn and flex and experiment and fail and try and all of it, you know. So that’s what’s next for me, is just figuring out what the next feature is going to be. </p>

<p data-characters="264" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Clearing runs in <em>Hades 2</em> relies on you mixing and matching boons and weapons. You need to think about how these things synergize to create a Time-stopping build. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-boons-for-each-god-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best boons in <em>Hades 2</em></a> don’t need outside help; they pretty much break the game on their own.</p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">As it is with many newly launched games, <em>Hades 2</em> is no outlier to busted items. The game is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in Early Access</a>, so it’s likely we’ll see buffs and nerfs to weapons, items, boons, and other upgrades while it’s in development. But until then, there are a few boons you should seek out before they’re changed (<em>if </em>they get changed). </p> <figure data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-break-hades-2-with-the-best-overpowered-boons" data-injectable="false">How to break <em>Hades 2</em> with the best-overpowered boons</h2> <p data-characters="466" data-current-count="466" data-injectable="true">Poseidon offers one of my favorite boons in the game merely due to its game-breaking potential. And it’s not alone in that category. As also spotted by others in the community, several boons completely break Hades 2 at nearly no penalty at all. We’re talking boons that give you free items, nearly unlimited Magick, and invulnerability to projectiles. If you’ve been struggling against the ravages of Time, consider these god-like boons as options.</p>
 <h3 id="h-poseidon-double-up" data-injectable="false">Poseidon – Double Up</h3> <p data-characters="573" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">As hinted earlier, Poseidon’s best boon in <em>Hades 2</em> is Double Up. It doesn’t increase your damage… at least not directly. Damp uncle’s most useful boon has a chance to create a duplicate of a “Minor Find” — items such as Gold Crowns, Psyche, and Ash. But did you know <strong>it also counts toward Poms of Power and <em>Gifts of the Moon</em></strong>? Selene’s boons seem minor at first, but the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-path-of-stars-and-upgrades-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Stars can make you powerful</a> or temporarily invulnerable with the right upgrades. Having double the points for upgrades is nothing to turn your nose at.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">The duplication effect isn’t a rare occurrence, either. <strong>At its base rarity, the boon has a 25% chance to double an award</strong>. It rises to <em>30%</em> at the next level up. That’s a duped item practically one out of every three times, all for free. Can you imagine what’s possible with a triple Pom? </p>
 <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="209" data-injectable="false"><strong>To increase your odds of getting the boon, use <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-keepsakes-in-hades-2-and-how-to-get-them-nectar-gift-guide/#1-best-keepsakes-in-hades-2-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poseidon’s Keepsake</a> ‘Vivid Sea’</strong>. Hell, I’d suggest hunting down the boon just to hear Poseidon’s fantastic laugh whenever it procs. </p> <h3 id="h-hestia-soot-sprint" data-injectable="false">Hestia – Soot Sprint</h3> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="true">Soot Sprint is easily the most useful boon gifted by the goddess Hestia. When taken, the boon destroys all nearby projectiles as you sprint while inflicting the Scorch curse on the enemies that fired. Perhaps that doesn’t sound too fantastic at first since Scorch isn’t exactly the most impressive curse. But <strong>Soot Sprint deletes all damaging projectiles near Melinoe as she sprints while damaging foes, <em>all for free</em></strong>. There is no Magick needed to prime for Soot Sprint to do its thing; you run, and projectiles are erased just like that.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true">For those who have it rough in Oceanus, Soot Sprint is a godsend. Well, literally, I guess. Fellow enjoyers of the original <em>Hades </em>still sing the praises of Athena’s Divine Dash, her best boon, which gave you invulnerability and reflection on dash. Soot Sprint is just as good, and arguably better, as it lasts for as long as you hold the sprint button down. </p>
 <p data-characters="152" data-current-count="152" data-injectable="false"><strong>If you want to give Soot Sprint a chance, you can improve your odds of getting it by equipping Hestia’s Keepsake ‘Everlasting Ember’</strong>. </p> <h3 id="h-hera-born-gain" data-injectable="false">Hera – Born Gain</h3> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><strong>Hera’s Born Gain boon gives you almost unlimited Magick</strong>. No, that’s not hyperbole. Every time you reach zero Magick, your Magick bar is restored with the caveat of having a small amount permanently primed. By primed, I mean a small portion of your Magick meter is reduced. Some boons prime Magick to be used, which means you’ll need to weigh the positives and negatives of having a reduced bar. Usually, that means giving up several dozen Magick points. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="591" data-current-count="891" data-injectable="true">Born Gain, though, uses ten at its most basic rarity. Yes, <em>ten</em>. It takes even less as it levels up. At Epic, it only primes six Magick. If you’re rocking more than 150 Magick before taking the gift, this is a laughable penalty. And it can go lower. If you’re equipped with Poseidon’s Fluid Gain, which drops a bubble that replenishes a small amount of Magick, or the Arcana Card ‘The Unseen’, which passively restores Magick, Born Again’s caveat becomes inconsequential. Keep grabbing Soul Tonics as you see them, and you’ll never run dry of Magick.</p>
 <p data-characters="94" data-current-count="94" data-injectable="false"><strong>To up the odds of getting Born Gain, equip Hera’s Keepsake ‘Iridescent Fan</strong>‘.</p>

Here’s the best Calcharo build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, as well as a team sure to allow him to showcase all of his might. </p> <h2 id="h-best-weapons-for-calcharo" data-injectable="false">Best Weapons for Calcharo</h2> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">The best weapon for Calcharo in<em> Wuthering Waves</em> is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-jiyan-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jiyan’s</a> signature 5-star Verdant Summit. The weapon excels by providing him with a 12% boost in Electro DMG and a total of 48.6% Crit DMG —the latter when at level 90. The 5-star will also allow you to strengthen the damage of his Mercy Heavy Attack by up to 48%. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">If our top pick is not an option for you, my main alternative will be the also 5-star Lustrous Razor. The weapon will provide Calcharo with both a handy amount of ER and a massive amount of ATK. Lustrous Razor also allows him to get an extra 14% boost in Resonance Liberation DMG by performing his Skill twice. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Best 4-Star Alternatives </h3> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">My main 4-star pick for Calcharo is the Battle-Pass exclusive Autumntrace. The weapon will offer him both a 20% increase in Crit Rate at level 90 and an easy-to-trigger up to 20% ATK buff. For those not planning on getting the Premium Pass, Helios Cleaver will be my main pick, given its high ATK value and focused buff.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Calcharo in Wuthering Waves </h2> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">As you might have guessed, the best Sonata for Calcharo is a 5-piece Void Thunder. When equipped, the set will offer a permanent 10% Electro DMG buff and allow him to get another 15% by performing his Resonance Skill. The buff triggered by the Skill will last 15 seconds and can stack two times to a total of 30%. </p>
 <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">For the echoes, I recommend using either Thundering Mephis or Tempest Mephis as your main in a one Overlord, two Common, and two Elites composition. Although Thundering’s moveset is more to my liking, both echoes will buff Calcharo’s Electro and Liberation DMG by 12% after being used. The buff will last 15 seconds. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Best Stas and Substats</h3> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true">Main stat-wise, I recommend that you invest in Crit Rate above all else. This is vital, as Calcharo’s low attack speed while in his regular state will demand it. For the remaining stats, focus on Electro DMG and ATK in equal measure. Crit Rate, Crit DMG, Energy Regen, and ATK will be my substat picks. Make sure to get his Crit Rate to around 60% for optimal damage. </p>
 <p data-characters="89" data-current-count="89" data-injectable="false">To recap, here are the best echoes for Calcharo, as well as our recommended main stats. </p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Echo Tier / Cost</th><th data-align="center">Echo Pick</th><th data-align="center">Ideal Main Stat</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Overlord / 4</td><td data-align="center">Thundering Mephis / Tempest Mephis</td><td data-align="center">Crit Rate</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Elite / 3</td><td data-align="center">Doesn’t Matter</td><td data-align="center">Electro DMG </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Elite / 3</td><td data-align="center">Doesn’t Matter</td><td data-align="center">Electro DMG &gt; ATK%</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Common / 1</td><td data-align="center">Doesn’t Matter</td><td data-align="center">ATK%</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Common / 1</td><td data-align="center">Doesn’t Matter</td><td data-align="center">ATK%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Calcharo Team Compositions</h2> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">The best team for Calcharo in<em> Wuthering Waves </em>will feature him as its main DPS, Jianxin as its sub-DPS/main support, and Verina as its healer. Jianxin is vital here, given her ability to offer a 14-second 38%&nbsp;Resonance Liberation DMG Deepen buff through her Outro Skill. We will then have in Verina both all the healing we might need and the ability to resurrect party members.</p> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true">Using Sanhua in the sub-DPS role can also work, as she can offer a 38% Basic Attack DMG Deepen boost. If you don’t have Verina, Baizhi can also excel. You will have to raise her to R6 to unlock the ability to revive, though.</p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">If her kit remains unchanged, Yinlin will become the best pick for the sub-DPS/support role by a large margin. The reason for that lies in her Outro Skill’s ability to buff Calcharo’s Electro DMG by 20% and Liberation DMG by 25%. Luckily we won’t have to wait too much for her to debut, as she will be the star of the game’s second character-focused banner.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-has-won-its-landmark-destiny-2-cheating-case-against-aimjunkies-phoenix-digital-what-now/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bungie-has-won-its-landmark-destiny-2-cheating-case-against-aimjunkies-phoenix-digital-what-now<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="280" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Bungie has finally won its lawsuit against Aimjunkies/Phoenix Digital, a company that made cheats for games like <em>Destiny 2</em>. The case initially saw Bungie sue the companies for terms of service, but the case took a wild turn after the accused turned around and countersued Bungie. </p> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">Game File journalist <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794154042190700617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1794154042190700617%7Ctwgr%5Eb5746c6dcb14637c50df3410a871a4fbf48ce133%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2F1czyyan%2F%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Totilo</a> broke the story, revealing Bungie’s win, which amounts to $63,210 in damages. The real win, though, is the precedent this case sets. Other devs can now point to a case where a jury has voted in favor of a game developer regarding cheats being made for their games. </p> <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">Though the win was in Bungie’s favor, the case wasn’t without its twists. James May, who Bungie alleged it caught reverse-engineering <em>Destiny 2</em> to make cheats, claimed that he didn’t infringe Bungie’s copyright. Instead, he claimed Bungie infringed his by snooping on his computer. In reality, Bungie has the right, as per <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s terms of service, to use certain methods to detect if you’re using cheat software. </p>
 <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="199" data-injectable="false">Following the loss, Phoenix Digital founder David Schaefer insists he’s going to fight this decision. His first move will be a move to dismiss the verdict, followed by an appeal if that fails. </p> <figure data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-landmark-destiny-2-cheating-lawsuit-isn-t-the-first-of-its-kind-and-it-won-t-be-the-last" data-injectable="false">Landmark Destiny 2 cheating lawsuit isn’t the first of its kind – and it won’t be the last</h2> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">While this case might be the first of its kind that a jury has voted on, it’s not the first time a game developer or publisher has won a lawsuit against companies making cheats. As pointed out by Totilo in a separate <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794215661226651904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> post, “Game companies have been getting default rulings against cheat-makers for years, often with giant, multi-million-$ awards. This was the rare case where cheat-makers pushed back, said their actions weren’t illegal and it was left for a jury to decide.”</p>
 <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">Bungie, who says it has spent millions directly combatting cheats in <em>Destiny 2</em> and has received numerous complaints about in-game cheats over the years, has been battling Aimjunkies/Phoenix Digital since mid-2021. The developer sued for $65,000, which is how much it estimated Aimjunkies made from <em>Destiny 2</em> cheats, but that’s nothing compared to the millions spent on anti-cheat measures. </p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true">The outcome of this case is likely to have reaching implications about how such a lawsuit can be applied in the future. Because this was a jury trial, it can be considered precedent for saying that such cheats infringe on a developer or publisher’s copyright. </p>
 <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="156" data-injectable="false">Bungie has been <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-awarded-12-million-in-latest-destiny-2-cheat-seller-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fighting cheaters for years</a> but cheats inevitably pop up once a game is popular enough, aiming to give those willing to pay an unfair edge. </p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="false">With <em>Destiny 2</em> set to receive much less support in terms of new content once <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Final Shape</a></em> has been released, you have to wonder if Bungie will put the energy and money into a lawsuit like this again. Regardless, it’s a good note to end the game’s legal journey on if that’s what this is. </p>

<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lance-reddick-actor-voice-talent-dies-60-obituary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lance Reddick</a> was a phenomenal actor who brought every character he played to life, whether on-screen or as a voice.<em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a></em> players heard him daily as Commander Zavalla, the head of the Vanguard who pulled us through so many crises. </p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">As we inch closer to the release of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Final Shape</em></a>, I and many other fans have been eager to hear what Commander Zavalla will sound like with Keith David stepping into the role. In the first of a series of ViDocs for the expansion, we were given a few lines of dialogue from David’s Zavalla, and it gave me shivers. The whole room felt cold because it was like I was hearing a ghost speak. But then, Guardians never really die. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odUA7RoEONQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full ViDoc</a> is very much worth a watch if you’re excited about the final expansion for <em>Destiny 2</em>. All you need to hear has been cut and put together by <a href="https://x.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1793677260643508265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny Bulletin on Twitter</a>, though, in case you can’t wait to hear what our new Zavalla sounds like. </p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Lance Reddick was one of the greatest and most prolific actors of our time. A quick check of his IMDB profile shows 121 actor credits, 4 as a producer, and 2 on soundtracks. His voice was fantastic, the perfect blend of depth, attitude, and emotion, allowing him to fit easily into incredibly serious roles by bringing a level of authority to any situation that you simply understood without context. </p>
 <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">When Reddick spoke, you listened, and that’s a hard act to follow. From what we’ve heard from him so far, Keith David isn’t going all in on replicating Reddick’s voice as closely as possible. Instead, he’s bringing to the table what his predecessor did. Raw emotion, depth, attitude, and that same authority that you obey without question because you know this man is asking you to saunter up to the gates of hell for the fight of your life for a reason. </p>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s expansions and seasons have always been pocketed with emotional crescendos. The opening to <em>The Taken King</em>, <em>Rise of Iron</em>‘s tale of the ultimate warriors sacrificing themselves, reconnecting with Rasputin in <em>Warmind</em>, and, more recently, seeing Crow become a heroic character after falling so hard from grace and Eris Morn take one for the team as the most badass witch in the galaxy. </p>
 <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="235" data-injectable="false">Commander Zavalla may not always have been the focal point of these stories, but he has been a stronghold when the game cracks our steely Guardian exteriors and forces us to remember that not everyone is going to come back from death. </p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="false">Handling that kind of role is a huge amount of pressure. In the two clips we’ve seen, though, David demonstrates both a vulnerable Zavalla, and the strong, commanding voice we often need him to be. There’s no doubt in my mind that he’ll be the perfect Zavalla come <em>The Final Shape</em>. Not because of any one particular thing his voice portrays but because of how it embodies the unbreakable pillar of <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p>

            <p>Larian Studios' Swen Vincke has opened up about crunch culture at the studio, acknowledging that the team did, at times, "have to do a bit of crunch" when "things happened that [the studio] didn't foresee".</p>
<p>In the Q&amp;A Vincke hosted after his address at the Digital Dragons conference in Poland, Vincke was asked if the team ever had to crunch – that is, the term given to the extreme overtime studios compel staff to do to get a game ready for its release date – and whilst Vincke said the team wasn't "overly" required to crunch, and it was "certainly less on BG3 than we did in the past", "It would be a lie to say that we didn't" crunch at all.</p>

<p>"We didn't overly crunch," Vincke said (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-had-less-crunch-than-larians-previous-rpgs-but-its-director-says-you-will-always-have-a-little-bit-of-overtime/">GR+</a>). "but we did have to do a bit of crunch. And I think, to be honest, you will always have a little bit when you're trying to finish something, especially when there's so much complexity that needs to be brought together."</p>
<p>Vincke further added that anyone who had to work late was paid for their overtime – many studios purportedly do not – and only "very, very, very rarely" would people work over the weekend or past 8pm at night.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios shared the "disappointing news" that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-xbox-physical-edition-gets-a-bit-of-a-delay-due-to-production-issues">physical PS5 North America deluxe editions have been delayed once again</a>, this time to July 2024.</p>
<p>Larian also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">confirmed its next game will not be Baldur's Gate 4</a>, DLC, or anything else to do with Dungeons and Dragons… but it did tease that it had other games in development.</p>

It’s one thing to make space look good; it’s another thing entirely to faithfully recreate the cockpit of a 747 and the whole world around which it might fly.</p><p>On&nbsp;<a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of&nbsp;<em>The Vergecast</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;the fourth and final installment of our series on the five senses of video games, we asked <em>Polygon’s </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/authors/charlie-hall">Charlie Hall</a> to help us make sense of the current state of the art in flight simulation. Hall, who once spent more than four months in VR <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/14/18182580/elite-dangerous-distant-worlds-2-waypoints-sign-ups">mapping the edge of the Milky Way galaxy in <em>Elite: Dangerous</em></a>, has more experience in a virtual cockpit than most. We wanted to know how the pros set up their simulators to get the most realistic experience and why it’s so complicated to make a virtual world look like the real one.</p><p>Hall makes the case that while VR and XR headsets hold a lot of promise for even more realistic experiences in the future, the best virtual cockpits of today are still made up of multi-monitor setups and power-hungry GPUs.

WB Games’ crossover platform fighter dropped in Open Beta in 2022, and the plan at the time seemed to be a smooth transition to a full launch. Instead the game was temporarily shut down, despite having run multiple Battle Passes and taking real money for skins and other cosmetics. Several months later, a relaunch is right around the corner with 1.0 scheduled for May 28, 2024. So, what happens to all that purchased content, and would there be any compensation for those founding players when <em>MultiVersus</em> returned?

    </div><div>



            <p>2K is rumoured to have secured the official FIFA license to develop the next FIFA game.</p>
<p>That's according to unverified claims from retailer <a href="https://x.com/mohplay_inc_">@mohplay_inc_</a>, which alleges that "the partnership is confirmed, and 2K will be developing a new football game series", albeit without sharing their source.</p>

<p>Whilst not confirmed in any official capacity at all – which means we can only take this news has a hefty rumour for now – it does back up prior claims from <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1756869003518042403">earlier this year</a> that 2K and FIFA may have been in talks for the former to succeed development of the FIFA series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-almost-30-years-ea-is-officially-ditching-the-fifa-brand-1">after EA announced</a> it would be taking its football franchise forward without FIFA branding.</p>

<p>The news has been received with excitement, alarm, and scepticism in equal measure, not least because the leaker claims "FIFA 2K25 is set to launch this year, just in time for the FIFA World Cup 2K26!", which seems an incredibly quick turnaround.</p>
<p>Others are just delighted at the prospect of EA's football series having competition beyond Konami's eFootball franchise, which secured <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/efootball-2022-season-1-review-too-little-too-late">an Avoid in our review</a> when it first released back in 2022.</p>

</span></p><p>EA's long-running football series might have jettisoned the FIFA license, but the publisher was keen to let everyone know it's doing just fine without it, announcing that this year's iteration, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-24-trumpets-11m-players-in-first-week-1m-more-than-fifa-23">EA Sports FC 24, reached 11.3m players in its first week of release</a>.</p>
<p>That's compared to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fifa-23-had-series-largest-ever-number-of-players-at-launch">10.3m players that hopped into last year's FIFA 23</a> during the same period - a figure EA referred to as "record-breaking" and the "biggest launch period" in the franchise's history at the time.</p>
<p>EA Sports FC launched for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Switch at the end of September, earning itself 3 out of 5 stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-24-review-sensible-changes-and-disappointing-constants">Eurogamer's EA Sports FC review</a>. "There are improvements, and there are problems, business as usual," contributor Josh Wise wrote. "The era of EA Sports' FIFA may be over, but the game goes on."</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-delayed-to-second-half-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2</a> was arguably the star of the recent Warhammer Skulls 2024 live stream. The long-awaited sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-maine-2-co-op-operations-mode-6v6-pvp-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed off the multiplayer modes</a> available in the final release: the PvE Operations mode, which runs parallel to the co-op enabled campaign, where you'll play as your own customized Space Marine and work as a team to defeat various Xeno abominations; and the PvP Eternal War mode, where Chaos and Empire will once again clash with chainswords in intense 6v6 multiplayer battles.</p>
<p>In both modes, players will pick between six multiplayer classes with very different gameplay. By playing them, they’ll be able to upgrade these classes with different perks and customize their armor from helm to greaves, with a wide selection of cosmetic elements, such as colors, heraldry decals, pauldrons, gauntlets, and more.&nbsp;On that note, publisher Focus Home Interactive later <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1794020543798427832" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made a clarification</a> that will probably make many fans happy:</p>
<ul>
<li>There aren't any microtransactions in Space Marine 2. No in-game cash shop.</li>
<li>All gameplay content and features will be free to all players. Paid DLCs will be cosmetic only.</li>
</ul>
<p>The six multiplayer classes are Tactical, Assault, Vanguard, Bulwark, Sniper, and Heavy. The classes are similar but not quite all the same compared to the original game, which included Tactical, Assault, Devastator, Raptor, Dreadnought, and Havoc.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now open for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. All pre-orders will receive the Macragge's Chosen cosmetic DLC, which includes the Ultramarines-inspired skin set for the bolt rifle, the chainsword, and the Crux Terminatus pauldron.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SM2_Beautyshot_COLLECTOR_3840x2160_RS_NEWVERSION_PEGI-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Gold Edition, priced at $89.99 on PC and $99.99 on consoles, also provides four days of early access (meaning players would start playing on September 5 instead of 9) and the Season Pass, which will revolve around cosmetics. The $99.99 (on PC; $109.99 on consoles) digital-only Ultra Edition adds the Ultramarines Champion Pack with two unique cosmetics for your Heavy Bolter and Power Armour. Finally, the $249.99 Collector's Edition also includes the Collector’s Case with unique artwork, a finely painted and detailed 8.25 x 6.7" resin statue of protagonist Lieutenant Titus (with two interchangeable heads: with and without the helmet), the game’s official Steelbook, and the 172-page book 'The Art and Making of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2'.</p>

  <p id="Ig3jIz">It’s been decades since games started implementing in-game communication devices that resemble our own real-life phones — and it’s often a successful mechanic for separating and consolidating menus, as well as tracking progress. But recently, I’ve noticed a weird trend: mobile games that are set entirely inside of a simulated mobile device. In other words, phone games where playing them feels like being on your phone. And frankly, I’m over it.</p>
<p id="HLrYqP">Take <em>Guildlings</em>, the very cute turn-based RPG. The game opens with you, a character named Coda, discovering your magical phone (also called a Tome). The phone comes with a purple fairy-like wisp that acts sort of like your avatar to move about the world — when your Tome brings you to new places in Worldaria, you’ll use your wisp to control Guildlings (aka wizards) through battles and exploration. </p>

<p id="WvF9te">The game eventually transitions into these more complex interactions — you can move around, investigate with different items, recruit new Guildlings, and ultimately battle other wisps and wizards — but for the first 15 minutes or so, you’re basically just using a text-like chat on your magical phone to make foundational decisions. It’s... frustrating. And it doesn’t do justice to the game’s otherwise decent gameplay.</p>
<p id="pEbTjq">This chat system carries on throughout the game, and its clunkiness probably doesn’t bother most players. But my patience for my real-life phone is wearing thin, because at this point this thing is more tool and less gadget. When I play a game on it, I want to forget how annoying my phone is to use. Instead, I’m often met — particularly at the outset of a game — with a UI that vaguely imitates the UI of my real phone, but with fewer decisions and less control.</p>
<p id="nraG3G">There are plenty of titles that successfully pull off the design of an in-game phone. Nearly every mystery game I’ve played includes a phone, and it’s not the most exciting part of the game, but it’s often unobtrusive — you usually get notifications triggered by location or plot, and you otherwise don’t need to use the faux phone. In <em>Guildlings</em>, the game <em>is</em> the phone, and for that reason, I have to really try to get into it. Moreover, it’s not the only instance of a clunky phone-within-a-phone game I’ve found.</p>
<p id="nrJpg7">In-game texts in particular feel a bit tired, since this format is ostensibly a much easier way to design game conversations than animating several characters speaking to one another. <em>An Elmwood Trail</em> is an example of this. The game is well written and decently interesting, but it’s primarily set inside faux iPhones that only give you two options for each text you send. For a game, that’s predictable — but for a phone, it’s extremely limiting.</p>

<p id="YVBMjo">In the opening scenes of <em>Elmwood</em>, you’re a detective choosing responses to send to an unknown number that’s trying to blackmail you into solving a case. The conversation is fine, but it ends up being a miss for me because I don’t find it fun to wait for someone to respond to my text. I also wish I could choose between more than two options — we know the technology is out there to put in our own responses and let the game digest and decide what happens next based on keywords we send (looking at you, <em>Scribblenauts</em>). I realize that type of game would be much more laborious to create, write, and design. But something in between the two would be wondrous.</p>
<p id="DEDppo">As <em>Elmwood</em> progresses, you’ll gather other evidence to investigate, and one of the first pieces is another character’s phone. This device has some impressive nuggets of detail that should be celebrated: emails that contain clues, photos of the character’s cat, a Pixabowl (aka Instagram) app.</p>
<p id="XWUJQQ">But this setup falls short for me because it all so closely resembles my real-life phone that it’s almost stressful. Maybe a younger audience finds this <em>more</em> alluring than a game without phones. Ultimately, I’ve found myself wishing developers wouldn’t rely so much on a watered-down version of a real-life item that can do everything to tell their stories. </p>
<p id="Hoa0XH">In <em>Elmwood</em>, eventually you can interact with items on your desk in addition to your device-based evidence. I don’t want to punch down at this game outright, because holistically it isn’t bad — but I do think there’s something uninspired about using incoming texts and calls to introduce the story. Further, I think there’s much more interesting commentary about phones and metagaming to be had. </p>

<p id="BMUnZ5"><em>Reigns</em> is an example of a game that uses elements of smartphone-like UI, but these elements are so piecemeal that the experience is still really enjoyable. Using the “swipe left for no, swipe right for yes” format of lots of dating apps, the game leads you through binary decisions that extend or truncate your reign as king. You can read it a bit as commentary on the way we use dating apps (er, the way <em>you</em> use dating apps — I’m married) — don’t think, just swipe. The game even prompts players to slow down and read to fully understand the implications of their decisions, which sounds like advice plenty of my friends who use dating apps could stand to internalize.</p>

<p id="QVZmyZ">There’s also <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, the steamy RPG with turn-based battles — and a superpower in-game phone. The (very good, very fun) game takes place outside of the device, which is only used for communications between characters and tracking missions. <em>Honkai</em> accomplishes something I haven’t seen elsewhere: The phone UI in this game is better than my real phone. It’s faster with sleeker design and intuitive menus, along with cheeky texts that come as delightful surprises rather than obtrusive notifications.</p>
<p id="Pm6KQR">I’d be a fool to think phones in games are going anywhere, and really, I don’t want them to. But I’m genuinely more enthused by mobile games that create a version of my phone that’s <em>more</em> exciting than the one I use all day every day. Particularly since modern phones are lightning-fast and virtually ubiquitous, I enjoy playing games that synthesize or critique our real-life use of our smartphones rather than replicate it. </p>

            <p>Don't worry, Helldivers – developer Arrowhead has a solution for unscrupulous hosts who are kicking fireteam members from the lobby just before they secure their rewards.</p>
<p>Asked if players could "keep 50 percent of the samples collected if [they] get kicked by an arsehole lobby leader when the dropship has been called" – a fair question given griefing does happen in Helldivers 2 – community manager Twinbeard stressed that a "solution" is on the way.</p>

<p>"We're actually working on a solution to mitigate problems with, well, 'getting kicked by an arsehole lobby leader' as someone once eloquently put it," Twinbeard responded in the game's  Discord community. "No ETA on that, but it's coming."</p>
<p>The inspiration for the suggestion seemingly comes from Deep Rock Galactic, which similarly ensures a player receives 25 per cent of the XP and materials they accrue in the mission, even if they get kicked.</p>
<p>Other suggestions include a reputation system where the Helldivers 2 community itself gives out reputational awards at the end of matches, so good citizens can be matched together and trolls and griefers are forced to played together, too (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/helldivers-2-solution-is-coming-kicked-by-lobby-leaders/">VG.com</a>).</p>

<p>A look at the game's Steam charts shows a steady drop since February, when the game launched. According to SteamDB, at its peak in February shortly after launch, there were 458,709 concurrent players. In comparison, its peak over the last 30 days is 166,305. That's a drop of 64 percent.</p>
<p>The most notable explanation as why this has happened could be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">infamous PSN debacle that kicked off earlier this month</a>. At the start of May, Helldivers 2 publisher Sony announced players on Steam would soon be required to link a PlayStation Network (PSN) account to keep playing. This not only resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">swathes of negative reviews from a very disappointed community</a>, but the game was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">pulled from sale in 177 countries where PSN was not available</a>, forcing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony to backtrack on its plans</a>.</p>

Even for $450, though, the Ace look <em>really </em>nice —&nbsp;I dig the super-minimalist vibe, almost like they’re an early prototype the company shipped. Really curious to see the reviews on these.</li><li><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsurface%2Fdevices%2Fsurface-pro-11th-edition"><strong>The new Surface Pro</strong></a><strong>. </strong>If you’re one of the “why can’t my iPad do more stuff” kinds of people, the device you want might not be an iPad. It might be the new $999 Surface Pro, which Microsoft promises has great performance and battery, comes in cool colors, and has a really nifty new keyboard attachment.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fpaper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch%2F"><em><strong>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>Another great reboot from Nintendo, which is remarkably good at sprucing up old <em>Mario</em> games and getting me hooked on them all over again. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162364/paper-mario-rpg-nintendo-switch">my colleague Andrew Webster wrote</a>, the Switch is turning into a retro <em>Mario</em> RPG machine, and it’s awesome.</li><li><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40Howtown_videos"><strong>Howtown</strong></a><strong>.</strong> I love a good “no mystery too small” show, which is why I’m a religious consumer of things like <a href="https://pjvogt.substack.com/"><em><strong>Search Engine</strong></em></a> and <a href="https://underunderstood.com/podcast/"><em><strong>Underunderstood</strong></em></a>. This new YouTube channel, from two excellent creators, is an insta-subscribe for me. And they have some really fun guests lined up!</li><li><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fretrace-your-steps-with-recall-aa03f8a0-a78b-4b3e-b0a1-2eb8ac48701c"><strong>Microsoft Recall</strong></a><strong>.</strong> One of the cooler AI apps I’ve seen — and maybe the best argument yet for why you need an “AI PC.” Sure, an app that tracks everything you do on your computer feels slightly creepy, but that’s kind of already how your computer works. This just makes it useful.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/786892-furiosa-a-mad-max-saga?language=en-US"><em><strong>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76341-mad-max-fury-road?language=en-US"><em><strong>Fury Road</strong></em></a><em> </em>is one of the coolest movies ever made, if you ask me, and by all accounts, Furiosa is a worthy — if slightly slower and less, uh, bonkers —&nbsp;follow-up. It’s also apparently the rare prequel that adds something to the first flick; guess which two movies I’ll be watching this weekend.</li><li><a href="https://www.stompers.app/"><strong>Stompers</strong></a><strong>. </strong>I’m currently very into silly, chill, less-intense workout apps, and this is such a funny one. You compete with your friends to walk more, and when you’re winning, your friends get, like, virtual bananas to slow you down. Delightful!&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canva.com%2F"><strong>Canva</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Canva <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163356/canva-enterprise-announcement-design-platform-redesign">launched a big redesign</a> this week (at least, if you can find a “secret portal”), which comes with a bunch of clever AI features and some new ways for your IT department to give Canva money. I don’t use Canva much personally, but the folks I know who do tend to love it. This should be good news.</li><li><a href="https://senuassaga.com/"><em><strong>Hellblade II</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>This game sounds genuinely terrifying — and there’s not much I love more than a game that makes me scream out loud. The sound design appears to be particularly intense, so if you need me this weekend, I’ll be holed up in the dark scaring myself half to death.</li><li><a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/"><strong>The Daylight DC1</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Half of me rolls my eyes at anyone who’s like, “Gadgets are bad. Here’s a gadget to save you from gadgets.” And it’s $729! But I love the retro-future aesthetic here, I’m hopeful the screen tech works, and I’ll be keeping an eye on this thing for sure.</li></ul></div><p><h3>Group project</h3></p><p>Last week, I asked you to share your favorite minigames on the internet. Things you can play in a few minutes. Maybe you play once a day, maybe you play it 50 times in a row while you’re on the train to work. Did I ask for this because selfishly I’m sort of bored of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/games/quordle/#/"><em><strong>Quordle</strong></em></a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/puzzles-and-games-dept/name-drop"><em><strong>Name Drop</strong></em></a> and wanted new stuff to try? Partly! But I also suspected I’m not the only one who loves these games.</p><p>Oh boy, was I right. Thank you to everyone who responded! I got a <em>ton </em>of great suggestions, and I want to share as many of them as I can. First of all, here are the ones you recommended the most often:</p><div><ul><li><a href="https://linktr.ee/coffeegolfgame"><em><strong>Coffee Golf</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> A new five-hole golf course to play every day. (This was the most recommended game of the week, by a lot, and I can see why. I love it.)</li><li><a href="https://bandle.app/"><em><strong>Bandle</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Guess the song, one instrument at a time.</li><li><a href="https://travle.earth/"><strong>Travle</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Get from one place to another, one adjacent country at a time.</li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections"><em><strong>Connections</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>Find the four words that belong together.</li><li><a href="https://framed.wtf/"><em><strong>Framed</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Guess the movie, one screenshot at a time.</li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html"><em><strong>Wordle</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Can’t forget the OG!</li></ul></div><p>And here is a list, in no particular order but very slightly categorized, of some of the other great game recommendations I got. First up, there are the games that I’d describe as “<em>Wordle</em>, but not exactly:”</p><div><ul><li><a href="https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/"><em><strong>Worldle</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Guess the country by its shape.</li><li><a href="https://summle.net/"><em><strong>Summle</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> Put the numbers and operators in place to make math equations work.</em></li><li><a href="https://episode.wtf/"><em><strong>Episode</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Like <em>Framed</em>, but for TV shows.</li><li><a href="https://cinequote.net/"><strong>CineQuote</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Guess the movie, one line at a time.</li><li><a href="https://murdle.com/?mode=tutorial"><em><strong>Murdle</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Solve a mystery with only a few clues.</li><li><a href="https://wafflegame.net/daily"><em><strong>Waffle</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Rearrange the board until all the letters are in the right place.</li><li><a href="https://playknotwords.com/"><em><strong>Knotwords</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Like sudoku meets a crossword puzzle.</li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands"><em><strong>Strands</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> A word search with a theme.</li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/games/"><em><strong>Queens</strong></em> / <em><strong>Pinpoint</strong></em> / <em><strong>Crossclimb</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> The three new daily games on LinkedIn, which are all pretty fun.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://housle.house/"><em><strong>Housle</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Guess the house price by the photo.</li></ul></div><p>I heard about a bunch of Immaculate Grid games, which are a huge new category and are very fun:</p><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.immaculategrid.com/"><em><strong>Immaculate Grid</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> The original, I think? Guess the athlete, across lots of sports.</li><li><a href="https://www.geogridgame.com/"><em><strong>GeoGrid</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Guess the country.</li><li><a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/daily-movie-grid-trivia-game-cinematrix.html"><em><strong>Cinematrix</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Guess the movie.</li></ul></div><p>And last but not least, there were the other games. Not all of them are daily, but I think they fit the “it’s a thing you can do a couple of minutes at a time,” so I’ll allow them:&nbsp;</p><div><ul><li><a href="https://cemantle.certitudes.org/pedantle"><em><strong>Pedantle</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Find words in a redacted page to figure out which Wikipedia entry it is.</li><li><a href="https://chrome-dino-game.github.io/"><strong>Chrome’s<em> Dino Game</em></strong></a><strong>. </strong>Best use of a broken webpage <em>ever.</em>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://contexto.me/"><em><strong>Contexto</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Try to guess the word just by guessing other words.</li><li><a href="https://playfootball.games/football-bingo/daily"><em><strong>Football Bingo</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Turns out, I don’t know soccer as well as I thought.</li><li><a href="https://dinakelberman.com/untitledgame/"><em><strong>Untitled Game</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> It loads a blank webpage. You figure out what to do next.</em></li><li>Random battles on Pokemon Showdown.</li><li><a href="https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html"><em><strong>Universal Paperclips</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> You make paperclips. And sell them. As many as you can. Forever.</li><li><a href="https://boxofficega.me/"><em><strong>Box Office Game</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> The game gives you a weekend and some numbers, you try to guess the most popular movies.</li></ul></div><p>I now have about two-thirds of these games bookmarked in my browser, and I will be playing them all every day forever. I may never be productive again. Thanks again to everyone who shared their favorite games, and I hope you find something fun to play!</p><p><h3>Screen share</h3></p><div><p><a href="https://www.threads.net/@davidimel"><strong>David Imel</strong></a> is a man of many talents. He uses weird, old photography equipment to make truly <a href="https://www.davidimel.com/landscapes/o7hwwreg7jbeseaa5lcpk9ecrc6dia"><strong>gorgeous panoramic photos</strong></a>; he makes great videos going super duper deep into <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSHOf1Wlgpek"><strong>how we talk to each other online</strong></a>; he hosts podcasts and makes videos with the rest of <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fchannel%2FUCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ"><strong>the MKBHD crew</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p></div><p>I asked David to share his homescreen, both to see which of his cool photos he picked as a wallpaper and to snoop on whether he had any cool photography / podcasting apps I didn’t know about. Turns out, he’s pretty minimalist! Here’s David’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:</p><p><strong>The phone: </strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><div><p><strong>The wallpaper: </strong>A picture I took in Ohio while chasing the eclipse on a <a href="https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/gfx100s-ii/"><strong>Fujifilm GFX 100S II</strong> </a>Frankenstein attached to my <a href="https://www.chamonixviewcameras.eu/"><strong>Chamonix 4x5 view camera</strong></a>.</p></div><p><strong>The apps: </strong>Photos, Settings, Viewfinder, Fujifilm Camera Remote, Telegram, Gmail, Pocket Casts, Messages, Arc, Spotify.</p><p>Gotta be honest, I generally use the swipe down to search apps gesture every time I want to use an app. I don’t know if that makes me a psycho, but I only keep a few on the homescreen. The widgets are for my bedroom lights and blinds — all running on Matter. 🤙 I get very little light in my apartment, so the blinds close at 9PM and open at 7AM to help me wake up, and I toggle the lights manually.</p><p><a href="https://viewfinderpreview.opticalaberration.com/"><strong>Viewfinder Preview</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This is my favorite app for shooting film. I mostly use it for my 6:17 and 6:24 120 film cameras, but it’s amazing. You can emulate any film format and field of view, and you can take digital copies to both remember which image you shot and what your settings were. It’s also a light meter and has been super accurate.</p><p><a href="https://fujifilm-dsc.com/en/"><strong>Fujifilm Camera Remote</strong></a><strong>.</strong> I use this to transfer photos from my X100 (my daily camera) to my phone. The new app (Fujfilmi XApp) never works for me for some reason, but the old app still works great.</p><p><a href="https://pocketcasts.com/"><strong>Pocket Casts</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This is probably the most-used app on my phone. I’ve used this app since like 2010 for podcasts, and since I bought it once for $7 way back in the day, I got grandfathered in for a lifetime pro tier once they added a subscription model. It’s a really fantastic podcast app, but I am aware that they hide a lot of features behind a subscription now, which kinda sucks.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Farc-search-find-it-faster%2Fid6472513080"><strong>Arc Search</strong></a><strong>.</strong> David, I think you and I are probably both the biggest Arc fans on the internet. The browser is just so delightful, and the desktop app is absolutely incredible for research; segmenting out my work life / accounts / research projects, and spaces is great. I could talk forever about how much I love the actually useful AI features they have in the desktop app like tab renaming, download / file renaming, tidy tab sorting, etc., alongside pinned tabs, the ability to share folders, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>I also asked David to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he shared:</p><div><ul><li>Right now, I’m in the middle of getting a <a href="https://www.filmscanner.info/en/HasselbladFlextightX1.html"><strong>Hasselblad Flextight</strong></a> film scanner up and running. It’s the highest-quality scan you can get outside of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner#Drum"><strong>drum scan</strong></a>, but they’re so old, you have to use a super old Mac for it. My friend Willem Verbeeck <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrKC7h6muOfo"><strong>made a video</strong></a> on it recently. A nice ex-professional photographer in California found out I’m into panoramic photography (especially <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFNcOou59bBg"><strong>my Fujifilm TX-1</strong></a>) and had a mask specifically made for it. It weighs 60 pounds.</li><li>I’m a big fan of Casey Newton and Kevin Roose’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork"><em><strong>Hard Fork</strong></em></a> podcast. It’s not exactly new, but I think they have a great dialogue, and considering they both cover similar things in their respective publications, the conversations are a great mix of funny, intelligent, and engaging.</li><li>I don’t watch a ton of movies, shows, or YouTube, but I’ve been going back through <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40Vsauce"><strong>VSauce’s channel</strong></a> and watching his old videos just because I really like the style of WHY WHY WHY storytelling. Oldie, but very goodie.

There are lots of good choices out there, but let me just save you a bunch of time: buy a <a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/nLedo7"><strong>UE Wonderboom</strong></a>. The whole Boom lineup is great, honestly, but this one’s plenty loud, it’s tiny, it lasts forever, it sounds great, it’s $100. You might be able to beat it on one of those things, but I’ve never found a better “awesome speaker in a tiny box” anywhere. When the weather’s good, mine goes everywhere with me. Maybe we can hang at the beach and sync ours up for some sweet stereo tunes. Hit me up.</p><p>See you next week!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Infamous is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, May 26, 2024. Below, we look back at how its focus on traversal paved the way for modern AAA superhero games.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Soaring over a canyon in an Iron Man-like suit of metal armor in Anthem. Swinging through the financial district as a giant Sandman crushes cars below him in Spider-Man 2. Few mechanics in gaming feel as good as superhuman traversal. One of the most electrifying examples of superhero movement came 15 years ago when Sucker Punch launched Infamous.</p><p dir="ltr">Infamous--which was inspired by Batman Begins, Channel Zero, Shooting Wars, and other comic and comic adaptations--put you in control of the electrically powered superhuman Cole MacGrath. The city he fought to protect--or sometimes abuse if you chose that moral path--was also his source of power.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to give you powers that worked well in a video game context, and video games are really good for shooting things, ranged combat," Infamous game director Nate Fox said in a 2009 interview with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-06-09-interview-sucker-punchs-nate-fox-on-infamous-and-inspiration.html" rel="nofollow ">Engadget</a>. "So we figured we'd have a lot of that in the game, and electricity was a good marriage to that because shooting a lightning bolt into somebody's face is something that everybody understands."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4308137-infamous1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4308137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4308137-infamous1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4308137"></a><figcaption>Cole MacGrath, protagonist of the first two Infamous games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4308137-infamous1.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Outside discharging bolts of electricity, Cole could grind on rails at accelerated speeds, float through the sky using propulsion from his hands, and navigate over nearly any building in Empire City. Infamous's traversal wasn't nearly as fast-paced as Insomniac's later Spider-Man series, but it was also gripping and dynamic. A climbing system similar to the one found in Assassin's Creed underlined everything Cole could do with his powers. It made it feel like every part of the city was scalable--and that's exactly what Sucker Punch was aiming for.</p><p dir="ltr">"We quickly found that electrical powers were super fun and crazy beautiful," Fox said. "After that, we had a ton of development work to do, both building a streaming world and creating a climbable city."</p><p dir="ltr">Empire City was a playground in every way. Buildings were lined with pipes that players could grapple, a railway that Cole could grind ran throughout the city, and rooftops were surrounded by so many climbable objects--power lines, billboards, antennas--that there was never a shortage of routes to take as you flew through the city.</p><p dir="ltr">That achievement was special in 2009 as seamless open worlds weren't nearly as spectacular as what we see in sandboxes today. They had been done before, but something of Infamous's scale was technically impressive as an open-world sandbox that had no slowdown from end-to-end.</p><p dir="ltr">"The urban climbing in Infamous is spectacular," said Sucker Punch co-founder and Infamous programming lead Bruce Oberg in a 2009 interview on the official PlayStation blog. "You can go anywhere you can see, and there are no loading screens. It's truly an open-world sandbox."</p><p dir="ltr">Combining rail grinding and Cole's electrical floating ability was a wonderful way to connect the city and superhero gameplay. The electrical abilities were a natural extension of both the player and the world around them.</p><p dir="ltr">Much like every other major city set in a fictional comic universe, Empire City was loosely shaped to resemble New York City. This was not because of its iconic landmarks or deep history, but because of the influence that Grand Theft Auto 3 had on the team.</p><p dir="ltr">Fox has mentioned multiple times that swinging aimlessly around New York while looking for someone to help was a major point of inspiration for the team. DNA from both games can be seen in the free-flowing gameplay that made Infamous's side missions and collectibles such a joy to complete.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think everybody fired up Grand Theft Auto 3 and thought, 'This game is so cool. I wish I were a superhero in this city!'" Fox said. "I mean it's kind of obvious, right? So, ta-da! That's the game we started to look at and make."</p><p dir="ltr">While Sucker Punch may have been a recognizable name in 2009, Infamous was new to the gaming world. The grungy, gray backdrop of Empire City could have fallen flat if it weren't filled with incredible platforming that's still incredibly fun to play 15 years later.</p><p dir="ltr">The team at Sucker Punch made a jump from making the Sly Cooper series to making a huge, sandbox-style comic-book adventure. Its roots developing a cartoonish and visually colorful platformer with incredibly sharp gameplay shine in how players get Cole McGrath moves around rooftops and highway underpasses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4308153-infamous3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308153" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4308153-infamous3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308153"></a><figcaption>Cole wreaks havoc.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4308153-infamous3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"What we really [wanted] to do is come up with our equivalent, and I am not in any way likening our work to Miyamoto's, but we need our Zelda to the Mario," said Sucker Punch co-founder and Infamous producer Brian Fleming in an interview with <a href="https://www.aol.com/news/2009-03-25-gdc09-an-infamous-interview-with-sucker-punchs-brian-fleming.html" rel="nofollow ">AOL</a>. "We need a title that works better earlier in the lifecycle of the game, of the platform, we need something that is a good complement, that brings out different skill sets that we have, but is similar enough that the technology you build and things could be brought forward into a Sly game someday."</p><p dir="ltr">Little did Fleming, Fox, and Oberg know in 2009 that Infamous would go on to become a cornerstone of Sucker Punch much like Sly Cooper. Its sequels built on its amazing traversal mechanics and made Infamous a beloved name in open-world superhero game design--even if the last entry, Second Son, released in 2014. Fans have been clamoring for a new entry or remake every year since.</p><p dir="ltr">"We developed a bunch [of] different pitches and the idea of doing a superhero comic sort of universe," Fleming said. "It kind of felt like a half step away from that, but still played off some of the strengths in terms of art, and presentation and all that, so you know, you start talking about it, and then we had a lot to learn about doing realism and character design, and play control with real people. It took a long time. It's a journey."</p><p dir="ltr">Traversal is the most important element in open-world game design and Infamous is one of the earliest games to make superhuman movement the core gameplay. Insomniac's Spider-Man--one of the most celebrated superhero games of the last decade--shares DNA with Sucker Punch's latest Infamous game, Second Son.</p><p dir="ltr">Iteration is a huge element in how the entire game industry--not just a single game or series--gets better. Infamous was one huge step in improving how it feels to control a superhuman in a sandbox. While Cole may not be as notable as Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne, he's a big part of why it feels so good to swing, parkour, and fly around the big city in dozens of other games.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Druckmann Set The Story Straight About ‘Misleading’ Sony Quote]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/neil-druckmann-sony-quote-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/druckmann-set-the-story-straight-about-%E2%80%98misleading%E2%80%99-sony-quote.881766/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/neil-druckmann-sony-quote-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Neil Druckmann was recently targeted in the media for a quote recorded in an interview with Sony. Per the statement, he made a bold claim that his next project would ‘redefine the mainstream perceptions of gaming.’ This caused dissent on social platforms, with many believing that Druckmann was getting too big for his britches and trying to make himself look like some God of Gaming, capable of altering the paradigm with a single release.</p>



<p>However, the man himself recently appeared on Twitter (X) with a copy of the interview’s transcript, setting the story straight and confirming that he was effectively misquoted because of ‘edits of his rambling answers.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-truth-will-out">The Truth Will Out</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In his post on Twitter</a>, Neil Druckmann revealed that he was indeed misquoted by Sony, but it was mostly because his answer to a particular question was lengthy and spun off into a few tangents here and there. He did speak boldly about his next game, stressing that he ‘can’t talk about it our (his) bosses will get very mad,’ and he did say that he’s excited to see how the world will react to the ‘incredible moving experience’ Naughty Dog is creating, but he didn’t use the words ‘redefine the mainstream perceptions of gaming’. </p>



<p>The transcript that Druckmann revealed on Twitter was juicy, though. He said that the developing title is something ‘fresh’ for Naughty Dog and that it’s the ‘most excited’ he’s been for a project <strong>ever</strong>. That’s hugely important, as the passion that was poured into both The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II was unparalleled, producing a multi-award-winning series that went on to become one of the most widely beloved live-action adaptations ever made. </p>



<p>The closest Druckmann came to Sony’s quote was:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think it just kind of opens the eyes of a bunch of people that just weren’t aware of the kind of experience that exist in games … People even outside of gaming are looking at us to see what it is that we put out next.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It isn’t known what Naughty Dog is cooking at the moment, but recently, the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-officially-cancelled/">cancelled a planned multiplayer project</a> that would have been set at the heart of The Last of Us’ universe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked-finally-launches-with-fallout/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fortnite has finally launched Chapter 5: Season 3, "Wrecked," and with it come the new unique points of interest and skins for all you madmen out there.</p>
<p>Well, instead of going through the long patch notes released by Epic Games, we'll give you guys a rundown of what to anticipate with the new season. As always, the new Wrecked season brings exciting in-game content for gamers, this time focusing more on a post-apocalyptic theme, fitting the likes of Fallout (<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-enters-fortnite-in-chapter-5-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as previously teased</a>), with the Brotherhood of Steel's T-60 Power Armor being the most iconic Battle Pass skin.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the Mad Max-esque map changes first, though. The developers said that a "sandstorm" struck Fortnite Island, creating a new biome on the south side called the "Wasteland." With that, the game sees the inclusion of three new POIs: the Redline Rig refinery, Nitrodrome arena, and Brutal Beachhead operation base, all complementing the Wasteland theme. Below is the new map with the added Wasteland biome, making the island bigger than ever.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Moving on, Fortnite has added new consumables and collectives under the "Nitro" collections, where gamers have access to "Nitro Splash" and "Nitro Barriers," both of which give a severe boost in moving speeds when applied to moving items such as players and cars. When applied to a player, Nitro allows much faster movement, explosive bashing power, higher stamina, quick reloading speeds, and fall damage immunity, giving you the feeling of a madman.&nbsp;Nitro for cars allows fast movement, lesser fuel consumption, and explosive ramming power.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>What's a season without new weaponry? Well, Fortnite has catered to this perfectly by adding interesting weapons, with the first of them being Nitro Fists, which allows you to perform a 3x punch combo and give a "meteoric" impact when you aerial punch the ground. Nitro Fists will have a total of four chargers, with each recharging after eight seconds. Along with that, another weapon is the Boom Bolt, or in simple words, a madman's crossbow. It's a fast-firing crossbow that shoots explosive bolts, and by the looks of it, it does seem like a pump shotgun with a bow attached, or maybe I am missing the old days.</p>
<figure>

<p>Nuke Cola and Kind Cacti are interesting additions to the health department, with Nuke Cola responsible for restoring little health and shields immediately. At the same time, Slurp Cacti heals you when you hit it with your pickaxe after multiple times, even while in a car as well.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>Finally, we also have new vehicles and vehicle mods, all revolving around the Wasteland concept. We'll drop the list for vehicle mods below, but the addition of War Bus is something interesting to discuss. They are driven by patrollers on the island, and two of them are present on the battlefield. Each of them features a cannon on top, along with a horn that comes with an EMP pulse, damaging nearby targets and reducing their health and shields.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Machine Gun Turret</strong>&nbsp;(roof slot): Have a passenger fire a machine gun while someone else drives!</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Grenade Launcher Turret</strong>&nbsp;(roof slot): Some would call this littering, but the Grenades will get rid of themselves by exploding.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Spiked Bumper</strong>&nbsp;(front bumper slot): Deal more damage to players and objects on impact.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Cow Catcher</strong>&nbsp;(front bumper slot): Boost your ramming power and give your car some defensive armor.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Bulletproof Tires</strong>&nbsp;(tires slot): Tired of tire poppers? Make your tires indestructible!</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Chonkers Off-Road Tires</strong>&nbsp;(tires slot): Make your car more off-road friendly. Especially useful if you’re not driving an SUV!</em></li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>Here are the new Battlepass Skins, which will unlock once you level up the pass:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Machinist</strong>&nbsp;(unlocked right away!): Control your fire.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Rust</strong>: Shred the wasteland.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Peabody</strong>: Phil, Earl, and Axle. Three peas in a podcoat.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Ringmaster Scarr</strong>: Rule the chaos. Run the destruction.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>T-60 Power Armor</strong>: Courtesy of the Brotherhood of Steel.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Brite Raider</strong>: Drive fast. Burn bright.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Megalo Don</strong>: Nitro-fueled apex predator.</em></li>
</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reference-design/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-next-will-be-a-%E2%80%9Creference-design%E2%80%9D-for-manufacturers-to-make-their-own-devices-%E2%80%93-rumor.881757/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reference-design/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Next is going to be a very different gaming device compared to its predecessors, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>According to Windows Central's <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1794219028598153613">Jez Corden</a>, Microsoft's next-generation console will likely be a reference device with a heavy Windows slant for manufacturers to make their own devices, like the Surface Pro 11 is a reference device for AI PCs. This would be a huge departure from the previous Xbox consoles, as it would essentially make it a PC that could potentially run Steam games as well, and thus even the former PlayStation exclusives available on Valve's digital store like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-comparison/">Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-this-month/">God of War</a>.</p>
<p>Jez Corden using the Surface Pro 11 as an example is very interesting, as it was rumored earlier this year that the Xbox Next development is being led by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-xbox-surface-team/">Surface team</a>. The next Microsoft console is also said to be released in multiple SKUs, including a handheld one that will be capable of running games natively while also supporting cloud gaming.</p>
<p>As of now, very little is known about the Xbox Next other than that it is in the works and that it will deliver the "<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">largest technical leap"</a> ever seen. How this will be achieved remains to be seen, but it is likely that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-ram-storage/">software and storage advancements will play a big part in it</a>, as simply doubling specs, such as RAM, would not be economically viable.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-destiny-cheat-lawsuit/</link>

<p>It was recently reported that Bungie has won a lawsuit against Phoenix Digital (Aimjunkies) after alleging that the cheat provider infringed on a copyright. This is far from being the first time that a case like this has unfolded, but per Stephen Totilo, it could be a worldwide first that a jury has had to step in to settle the claim.</p>



<p>With Phoenix Digital filing a counterclaim and stressing that Bungie failed to prove a copyright infringement, it was left to a jury to pass the ultimate verdict – and they ruled in favour of Bungie.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-history">Making History</h2>



<p>Destiny is just like any other multiplayer-based game when it comes to cheaters – there’s a constant slew of malicious operators making their way into the game’s ecosystem and disrupting the ‘legitimate players’. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1792660056435200497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo’s earlier report</a> filed on May 20, it was revealed that – potentially for the first time – a jury would decide the outcome of a copyright claim by a publisher against a cheat provider. That came about because of Phoenix Digital’s standpoint that Bungie was the malicious party in this debate.</p>



<p>In just a few days, that case has been wrapped up, with the jury siding with Bungie. Even though the compensation wasn’t substantial – sitting at just $63,000 – it’s an industry-first result that will go down in the history books. Phoenix Digital has already stressed that it will be appealing the jury’s decision based on a claim that Bungie ‘illegally accessed their computer systems.’</p>



<p>Totilo <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794154042190700617" rel="nofollow">forwarded a statement</a> that was handed to him by Bungie’s lawyer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are grateful for the diligence, professionalism, and care exercised by the Judge, his staff, and the Jury. We’re committed to our players and will continue to protect them against cheats, including taking this and future cases all the way to trial.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In recent months, the number of developers and publishers filing claims against cheat providers has risen sharply. Activision Blizzard has been a key player in this realm, taking on all comers and – in most cases – receiving a default verdict that often results in multi-million-dollar reparation orders being documented.</p>



<p>Despite these efforts, the number of people cheating in video games seems to be rising.</p>

<p>Deadlock is widely rumoured to be Valve’s next title, a third-person, hero-based shooter rooted in a multiplayer-focused, lore-rich universe. In recent weeks, we’ve seen more than 100 leaks hit social media and content-sharing platforms worldwide, with the quality of said leaks improving over time. From full-fledged gameplay edits to walkthroughs of the character library, a stunning amount of content has been pulled from Deadlock – but Valve has yet to formally acknowledge that the game exists.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-might-as-well-be-here">It Might As Well Be Here</h2>



<p>Some of the gameplay edits that have surfaced on platforms like Twitter (X) have featured scenes that look remarkably well-polished. The earliest leaks from Deadlock looked drab and disappointing, but it’s believed that – despite dropping mere days ago – they were from a much earlier build of the game. Here’s an example of the most recent Deadlock leaks that have been turning heads on social media:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Once known as Neon Prime, Deadlock has evolved, turning from more of a sci-fi title to something that’s a diverse mix of various aesthetics. In the game, there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-all-characters-in-valves-deadlock/">a range of characters</a> that float between an array of themes, from robots to Victorian police officers and from traditional monsters to ethereal warriors. With obvious inspirations from Team Fortress 2 leaking through to the surface, Deadlock could be a solid contender to the likes of Overwatch 2. </p>



<p>However, despite all this information and content appearing online, Valve has yet to recognise that the game <strong>exists</strong>. It isn’t known when it’ll be released, but the expectation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/">is that it’ll drop in 2025</a>. These playtests that are causing most of the leaks to surface are seeing plenty of positive feedback about a game that’s cleaning up very nicely.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Deadlock?</p>

<p>On June 2, ASUS will release the ROG Ally X, the next iteration of the substantial handheld device that turned heads almost a year ago. It emerged as a solid competitor to Valve’s Steam Deck but boasted Windows 11 as an OS, which meant it could theoretically play ‘more games’. However, the high-priced handheld failed to hit the mark with a wide audience because of a few key drawbacks – but the ROG Ally X features some new internals designed to tackle those issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-same-but-different-but-still-the-same">Same – But Different – But Still The Same</h2>



<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/the-rog-ally-x-leaks-with-twice-the-battery-of-the-original-and-way-more-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to recent leaks</a>, the ROG Ally X will feature a battery twice as powerful as the one found in the ASUS ROG Ally, launched almost a year ago. That was one of the biggest flaws of the handheld, and playing a top-tier game on ‘Turbo’ mode would leave players with a device that died within around 40 minutes. The 40Wh battery in the original model has been replaced with an 80Wh battery in the ASUS ROG Ally X. </p>



<p>Further, ASUS has cast away the original 16GB of RAM and jammed in 24GB of LPDDR5 RAM, which should boost the device’s gaming performance dramatically. It was suggested that the original AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip would remain unchanged, and the touchscreen – which was also a sticking point for players – would be the same as the one in the original unit. Some minor changes have reportedly been made to the outer shell, such as a smoothing of rougher edges and tactile introductions being made to the buttons. </p>



<p>It’s expected that the ASUS ROG Ally X will retail for around $800. If ASUS has truly addressed the shortfalls present on the ASUS ROG Ally, this could be a killer handheld that dominates the ever-growing market.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-players-question-if-crosshair-expansion-from-jumping-should-make-your-weapons-fire-sideways/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-players-question-if-crosshair-expansion-from-jumping-should-make-your-weapons-fire-sideways<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While <em>XDefiant</em> has had a few errors and glitches after finally launching, most fans agree that it’s a pretty solid shooter, even if the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiants-weapon-progression-is-criminally-slow-and-fans-want-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progression system is absolutely pants</a>. However, some issues persist, and players have found that one of the strangest bends bullet arcs if you jump too much. </p> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">Jump spamming is a pretty big problem in <em>XDefiant</em> at the moment. A player’s hitbox seems to become smaller or just harder to hit with gunfire when they’re moving, so you can be almost invincible if you sprint for the perfect amount of time. Jumping works a treat, too, but now that appears to have its own problem, and it is bizarre. Not only does it increase your crosshair size, it makes shotgun bullets fly sideways out of the barrel.</p>
 <h2 id="h-if-you-jump-too-much-in-xdefiant-your-shotgun-will-fire-left-and-right-not-forward" data-injectable="false">If you jump too much in <em>XDefiant</em>, your shotgun will fire left and right, not forward</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">Fans on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1d08sla/is_shotgun_spread_working_as_intended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>XDefiant</em> subreddit</a> have been discussing this issue at length because they can’t work out if it’s intentional behavior or not. User bopchara demonstrates what happens to a shotgun’s bullet spray after you’ve jumped so much that the weapon’s crosshair is as big as it possibly can be. While I’d expect to see some shots veer off to the side a little, shooting directly left and right feels like a joke. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="800" data-injectable="true">Bullets shooting to the side of the barrel is obviously not how any weapon is designed to work in a first person shooter, and I’d be surprised if that wasn’t a glitch here. However, as user Billy3King points out, “It could also be to stop people from jump spamming, just a thought.” Herein lies the trouble. We don’t know if crosshairs are meant to behave this way, widening with every jump to deter jump spamming or if it’s a glitch that’s yet to be fixed. </p>
 <h2 id="h-is-this-an-issue-or-a-design-choice" data-injectable="false">Is this an issue or a design choice?</h2> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">I jumped into the game to test this for myself and got the same results that others are reporting. If I jump to maximize the crosshairs with any weapon other than a shotgun, I can still land pretty accurate shots in front of me. With a shotgun, I can barely see any bullet holes where my shots have landed because they fly around me instead of toward the intended target. </p> <p data-characters="638" data-current-count="1010" data-injectable="true">Ubisoft will almost certainly address this in a future <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-may-24-update-patch-notes-practice-zone-enemy-health-bar-glitch-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>XDefiant update</em></a>, but user SuttonTM points out that making shotguns suffer more than any other weapons might be intentional. “It’s almost certainly not intended to be that wide, but shotgun’s they have to be very careful with when it comes to adjusting because if they become OP they will easily become the most annoying gun to play against and ruin fun in modes like Hard Point etc, just look at the Akimbo Shotguns <em>CoD</em> recently had like a month back, required no skill to one shot people just by looking at them essentially, and ruined the flow of the game.”</p>
 <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">It’s hard to argue that shotguns can ruin a shooter if they’re overpowered. I remember playing <em>Destiny 1</em> and using the good old slide and shotgun or shotgun and melee tactics while they worked in Crucible. For now, all I can suggest is that you don’t jump spam in <em>XDefiant</em> so you can avoid an embarrassing encounter when an enemy is up in your face and your shotgun showers them in a glorious halo of pellets before they end you with a single pistol shot to the skull. </p>

<p data-characters="345" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em> has inspired players from launch day with its incredible visuals and gameplay that makes you want to drop into just one more mission all through the night. Fans have created all sorts of artwork that bring its gritty battles to life, but oil and canvas might be the perfect medium for depicting what is now <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-has-entered-a-second-galactic-war-after-players-failed-to-kill-enough-automatons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Second Galactic War</a>. </p> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">Since <em>Helldivers 2</em> was initially launched in February 2024, I’ve seen players make some incredible fan art. From the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/incredible-helldivers-2-fan-film-nails-the-feel-of-every-mission-in-just-over-60-seconds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gritty film that portrays the tension of being inside a Hellpod</a> before deployment onto the battlefield to Terminid miniatures that would look at home in <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cz4e16/check_out_my_recent_helldivers_2_oil_paintings_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit user WriterSafe9019</a> has set a new standard for incredible <em>Helldivers 2</em> art with their oil on canvas series that brings to life the elation and fear of spreading managed democracy around the galaxy. </p>
 <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-oil-on-canvas-paintings-breathe-new-life-into-the-game-s-hellish-war-torn-landscapes" data-injectable="false"><em>Helldivers 2</em> oil on canvas paintings breathe new life into the game’s hellish, war-torn landscapes</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via WriterSafe9019 on Reddit</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true">The four oil on canvas paitings by Reddit user WriterSafe9019 were posted on the <em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit, where they’ve recieved understandable praise. While there’s the usual collection of democratic Officer-approved responses and references to these being painted with oil produced from dead Terminids and Automatons, there’s also genuine appreciation for the work. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">User ALargeTuna commented that, “These are great! love the feel of 1 and 3 the most. great scenes and mood.” I agree with the first image being one that stands out, but I prefer the last one over the third because it’s reminiscent of the Anchorage Memorial ion <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-fallout-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 3</a></em>, as well as real statues dotted around the world that memorialize wartime events. </p>
 <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">In fact, I’d go so far as saying they make <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s chaotic battlefront look beautiful. From these images alone, you wouldn’t know that Helldivers blast down from ships in orbit and step out into swarms of giant bugs and metal monstrosities that want to tear them limb from limb. </p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">They all make Helldivers look heroic, which is absolutely how the game makes you feel while playing. They also dodge the mayhem that ensues when several Dropships start bombarding your squad or the crushing sadness of watching a Pelican fly away with your team just as you were diving toward the open door to join them.</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">I think the whole series is the perfect translation of real wartime paintings we have in museums like the <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/10-paintings-of-wartime-london" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK’s Imperial War Museum</a> today. Artists of the time captured moments they saw both in the heat of the moment during terrifying air raids and long after certain events because of the images etched in their minds. </p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="false">While <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s warfare is obviously restricted to our screens, some battles have been pretty damn harrowing. You only need to mention Malevelon Creek to get some players to shudder with fear, but even in those horrible moments there is beauty to be found and isolated within canvases like these. </p>

            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/which-mad-max-movies-do-you-need-to-see-before-furiosa/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=which-mad-max-movies-do-you-need-to-see-before-furiosa</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-mad-max-movies-do-you-need-to-see-before-furiosa.881640/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/which-mad-max-movies-do-you-need-to-see-before-furiosa/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=which-mad-max-movies-do-you-need-to-see-before-furiosa<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="381" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the long-awaited release of <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em>, the overall <em>Mad Max</em> franchise has once again been thrust into the mainstream spotlight. The series started its engine way back in 1979 with director George Miller’s <em>Mad Max.</em> Since then, it has become a multimedia juggernaut recognized the world over and beloved for its unique look and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-weirdest-and-wildest-characters-in-the-mad-max-universe/">many weird and wild characters</a>.</p> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">At the same time, just because it has a colorful cast and a sprawling world doesn’t mean the <em>Mad Max</em> franchise is perfect. The lore and overall timeline is a bit confusing, and there’s a lot of ground to cover with ancillary media like novels, video games, and comics. Therefore, it can appear daunting for those new to Miller’s post-apocalyptic creation. </p> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true">If you’re one of those newcomers who was beckoned by the chaotic, action-packed <em>Furiosa</em> but doesn’t want to watch <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mad-max-movies-order/">every single <em>Mad Max</em> movie in order</a> to prepare, here’s what you should watch at the very least before checking out Miller’s latest creation.</p>
 <h2 id="h-mad-max-fury-road-makes-for-a-good-starting-point" data-injectable="false">Mad Max: Fury Road makes for a good starting point</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image vis Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="777" data-injectable="true">Released in 2015, <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> is a hard-hitting, visually-stunning watch. It centers on Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), who gets swept up in a feud between the vile ruler of the Citadel, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). This marks her first appearance in the <em>Mad Max</em> series, and between the action, drama, and worldbuilding the film brings, it’s quite an impressive one. After all, it got <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kojima-has-seen-mad-max-four-times-because-he-is-right-and-good/">Hideo Kojima to go see it four times.</a></p>
 <p data-characters="608" data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true">In terms of the <em>Mad Max</em> timeline, <em>Fury Road</em> takes place years after <em>Furiosa</em>, so there’s an argument to be made that it should be saved for after a <em>Furiosa</em> screening. However, giving it a watch first can make <em>Furiosa</em> a more interesting viewing. Knowing the title character and who she ultimately becomes ahead of time adds a layer of intrigue to her origin story. It can be rewarding to know her final form and watch what she goes through to reach it. Think witnessing Anakin Skywalker’s journey to become Darth Vader in the <em>Star Wars</em> prequels decades after the completion of the original trilogy.</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">Not to mention, if you’re a bit unsure if what you’re getting into stylistically with <em>Furiosa</em> is for you, <em>Fury Road</em> is similar in aesthetic and tone. It can act as a good primer in that regard as well. If you like what <em>Fury Road</em> has to offer and want more, then you can go scratch that itch with <em>Furiosa</em> afterward.</p> <h2 id="h-the-original-mad-max-trilogy-is-optional" data-injectable="false">The original Mad Max trilogy is optional</h2> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">There’s no denying the pop culture influence and overall science fiction awesomeness of the original Mad Max trilogy. <em>Mad Max</em>, <em>Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior</em>, and <em>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</em> are all worth a watch decades after their premieres, and Mel Gibson’s rendition of Max Rockatansky remains iconic. With that said, these movies aren’t all that essential to one’s viewing of <em>Furiosa</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">The main reason why you can watch <em>Furiosa</em> without having seen the <em>Mad Max</em> trilogy is time. <em>Furiosa</em> and <em>Fury Road </em> are set in the mid-21st century, with the original trilogy spanning the mid-1980s to somewhere between the late 1990s to the early 2000s. These sets of films are so far apart chronologically and their casts are so radically different that, in terms of the core narrative, passing on the trilogy won’t impact your understanding of <em>Furiosa</em> much at all.</p>
  <p data-characters="514" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">Then again, what if you simply want to learn as much about the lore of this universe as possible? Well, you might still be better off skipping the trilogy, or looking at it as its own entity. Whether the first three <em>Mad Max</em> movies truly are in the same continuity as <em>Furiosa</em> and<em> Fury Road</em> remains a hot topic. Miller hasn’t shared a concrete verdict, and fans continue to debate if Gibson and Hardy are the same Max, if they’re related, or if the name is more of a mantle passed from person to person. </p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">All of that is to say that ahead of <em>Furiosa</em>, you <em>could</em> watch all of the existing <em>Mad Max </em>movies to prepare if you so desire. If you’re seeking narrative cohesion and nothing more, though, your best bet is to stick with <em>Fury Road</em> alone. It ties in the closest to <em>Furiosa</em>, forming a highly entertaining duology with it.</p> <p data-characters="63" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga </em>is now playing exclusively in theaters.</p>

The landmark decision may be the first time a jury has agreed that a cheat creator violated a gaming company’s copyrights.</p><p>Yesterday’s jury decision awarded Bungie (<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24689095-bungie-v-phoenix-digital-group-jury-decision?responsive=1&amp;title=1">PDF</a>) a tidy sum of $63,210. Bungie counsel James Barker said in a statement emailed to <em>The Verge</em> that the company is “committed to our players and will continue to protect them against cheats, including taking this and future cases all the way&nbsp;to trial.” </p><p>In 2021, Bungie sued AimJunkies and four defendants (here’s a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.300479/gov.uscourts.wawd.300479.1.0.pdf">PDF</a> of the complaint), alleging, among other things, that they hacked <em>Destiny 2</em> to copy the code used to make cheats. Some of Bungie’s complaints — like that AimJunkies violated a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201">DMCA provision</a> forbidding circumvention of copyright protection tech — went to arbitration and saw <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/bungie-wins-4-3-million-award-against-cheat-seller-in-arbitration-230220/">Bungie winning $4 million</a>. AimJunkies appealed after the judge confirmed that award. That appeal is still in process, as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161935/bungie-destiny-2-cheating-jury-trial-aimjunkies"><em>Polygon </em>wrote this week</a>. </p><p>Phoenix Digital founder David Schaefer will move to dismiss the jury’s verdict and appeal it if necessary, <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794156492784087319">according to Totilo</a>. However that shakes out, the verdict is significant, given that cheating lawsuits tend to conclude in other ways, like settlements. (For example, a judge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/take-two-grand-theft-auto/us-judge-blocks-programs-letting-grand-theft-auto-players-cheat-idUSL1N1V71ZK/">shut down a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> cheat distributor</a> in 2018 following a Take-Two Interactive lawsuit, or when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/17/23172558/destiny-2-bungie-cheat-settlement">Bungie settled</a> another cheating lawsuit in 2022 for $13.5 million.)</p><p>The win may only mean pocket change for Bungie, and it won’t likely put an end to online cheating, but it does put a jury on record about the legality of creating such cheats. That makes this more significant than the pocket-change-for-Bungie $63,000 award lets on. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bungie has won its court battle against cheat and mod site, AimJunkies.</p>
<p>As reported by journalist Stephen Totilo, AimJunkies, aka Phoenix Digital, was instructed to pay the Destiny 2 developer $63,210 in damages – that's the revenue the company is thought to have earned selling the cheats – setting a new precedent in what's thought to be the first lawsuit wherein a jury has ruled on a game-cheating case.</p>

<p>The jury threw out AimJunkie's countersuit that Bungie had illegally accessed one of its computers, but founder David Schaefer says they will "fight this" and appeal the verdict.</p>
<p>"We are grateful for the diligence, professionalism, and care exercised by the Judge, his staff, and the Jury," Bungie's lawyer, James Barker, told Totilo.</p>
<p>"We're committed to our players and will continue to protect them against cheats, including taking this and future cases all the way to trial."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>$63,210 in damages, to be specific</p><p>To my knowledge, this is the 1st time a jury (in the U.S., possibly the world) has ruled on a game cheating case.</p><p>With this, we now have a jury verdict that supports game companies' frequent claims that cheats like these infringe on copyright <a href="https://t.co/qvDhFwq0zK">pic.twitter.com/qvDhFwq0zK</a></p></div>— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1794155396065800511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>This isn't the first time Bungie has favourably settled a lawsuit. Back in July 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-wins-lawsuit-against-destiny-2-player-following-racist-harassment-and-threats-to-employee">the studio won a lawsuit against a player who repeatedly harassed, threatened, and doxxed one of its employees</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Tropical Haze, the developer of open-source Switch emulator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">Yuzu, agreed to pay $2.4m in damages to Nintendo</a> and cease all operations in response to the Mario maker's recent lawsuit.</p>

<p data-characters="349" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Magic: The Gathering </em>is packed with a wide variety of creatures whose identities revolve around their abilities and how they fit into a deck’s strategy. No matter what set you started playing MTG during, you’ve certainly seen cards that contain words such as <strong>Flying</strong> or <strong>Haste</strong> which provide abilities to the card they’re printed on. </p> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Some of these cards have “reminder text” printed along with them that gives a brief explanation as to what the words mean. Unfortunately, not every card has enough room to include rules for each Keyword Ability– especially those that contain multiple abilities on a single card.</p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true">There are currently 18 evergreen Keyword Abilities in MTG. These are abilities that are commonly printed in new releases and have spent years of playtesting to earn their lifetime spot in the TCG. Overall, there are 170+ Keyword Abilities in MTG.

<p data-characters="136" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Studio SARU and Production I.G have just unveiled a teaser for an upcoming <em>Ghost In The Shell</em> anime, titled only <em>The Ghost In The Shell.</em></p> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">The original <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> is based on the manga of the same name, and this new project seems to be a new adaptation of that. New media in the <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> franchise isn’t necessarily a rare thing, though, with the franchise spanning multiple animated adaptations, video games, and even an infamous Hollywood movie that starred Scarlett Johansson. </p> <figure data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="TVアニメ『攻殻機動隊（仮）』特報｜2026年放送｜THE GHOST IN THE SHELL" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ix7QURhM7jE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">The project is being helmed by Studio SARU, which recently made <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</em> for Netflix, a reimagining of the classic comic that earned critic and fan acclaim for its bold and refreshing take on the beloved story and characters. </p> <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">Will we be seeing a similar approach with the new <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> adaptation? Fans are already speculating we could be looking into something similar to <em>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.</em></p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i cant believe they're making ghost in the shell brotherhood. not something i neccesarily want but i guess i shall be seated. i'm curious at the very least</p>— yuuko from nichijou (@headfallsoff) <a href="https://twitter.com/headfallsoff/status/1794393622948794423?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">Will Studio SARU pull off something incredible, or will it go the safe route? The teaser doesn’t reveal much, so we might be looking at a couple of years of intense speculation.</p>
 <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Despite various other adaptations taking a stab at the story, the original <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> film is still considered the best outing in the franchise and is one of the most beloved works of sci-fi in history. Even if you haven’t seen the original movie, you’ve seen one of the hundreds of properties inspired by it. Though it came out in 1995, it hasn’t aged a day, and its story is still a poignant and relevant tale backed by some of<em> </em>the best — if not the best — animated sequences in the history of Japanese animation.</p>
 <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="137" data-injectable="false">The new <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> anime will hopefully land in 2026, but you can currently watch the original <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> on Prime Video.</p>

 <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="217" data-injectable="false">The latest special SBC might have just two tasks, but you should opt to go for the cheapest solutions in <em>EA FC 24.</em> This will help to ensure that you don’t end up wasting in-game resources like fodder and coins. </p> <p data-characters="22" data-current-count="239" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Serie A</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true"> <li>Dani Parejo 86</li> <li>Cristiana Girelli 86</li> <li>Bella Bixby 84</li> <li>Nacho Fernandez 83</li> <li>Merle Frohms 85</li> <li>Koke 84</li> <li>Dabritz 84</li> <li>Alex Grimaldo 84</li> <li>Koen Casteels 84</li> <li>Paulo Dybala 86</li> <li>Romelu Lukaku 84</li> </ul>

 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">The Henrikh Mkhitaryan TOTS SBC is an absolute bargain of a challenge in <em>EA FC 24</em>. For about 100,000 coins, you get a 93-rated card which can operate as a CM or CAM. In my opinion, this budget beast offers amazing playstyle+, incredible work rates, and great in-game stats. </p> <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="false">Like the Ademola Lookman RTTF SBC, you can’t go wrong by completing this SBC. If you have a bigger budget, the Trinity Rodman TOTS SBC is also worth looking into. </p>
