			<p>Following the launch of NVIDIA DLSS 4, NVIDIA confirmed today that PC gamers can use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA app DLSS Override functionality</a> to enable the new transformer AI model and even Multi Frame Generation in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-demo-out-now-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo of The First Berserker: Khazan</a>. Of course, Multi Frame Generation is only available to owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX 5090</a> or the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5080-suprim-soc-16-gb-gpu-review-superior-cooling-stunning-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX 5080</a> (the RTX 5070 and 5070Ti are slated to launch later this month). The First Berserker: Khazan is scheduled to be released on March 27; you can read our take on the action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>As part of an NVIDIA DLSS news round-up, NVIDIA said that the Unreal Engine 5 powered <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> remaster supports DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, though the DLSS Override functionality isn't enabled for either the new transformer AI model or Multi Frame Generation. The same goes for Level Zero: Extraction, the multiplayer extraction horror shooter developed by Doghowl Games and published by tinyBuild, which has recently launched out of early access with standard DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation integration.&nbsp;In two days, developer Aesir Interactive and publisher NACON will release Ambulance Life: A Paramedic Simulator, which is described as the first paramedic simulation game. This title also supports standard DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation.</p>
<p>Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth supports standard DLSS Super Resolution (you can turn it into DLAA by simply setting both maximum and minimum Dynamic Resolution Scaling values to 100%). For some graphics enhancement mods, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-greatly-improves-environmental-textures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our previous coverage</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, Warhorse's excellent (as evidenced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our perfect score review</a>) Kingdom Come: Deliverance II launches today with built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA. Through the NVIDIA app, users can activate the DLSS Override to force the transformer AI model to take over for improved image quality.</p>

<p>According to the latest announcement, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has sold more than 5 million units globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bandai Namco’s 2024 3D arena fighter, the latest instalment in a decade-old game series, has hit a major sales milestone. Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, the successor to the iconic Budokai Tenkaichi series, has sold over 5 million units across PlayStation, Xbox Series X/S, and PC since October 8, 2024 (less than 4 months since release). The developers have <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1886686193535848650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thanked</a> the fans for their passion and support in helping them achieve this milestone. </p>



<p>Moreover, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has shown no signs of slowing down. The developers have already released the first DLC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-hero-of-justice-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero of Justice</a>. The latest expansion introduces 11 new playable characters, with the likes of Beast Gohan, Orange Piccolo, Cell Max and more from Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie joining the roster. The developers have also released a new game mode and fresh cosmetics with the new DLC. 2 more DLCs are planned, introducing more than 20 characters to the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are several reasons why Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has sold 5 million units. Most importantly, fans appreciate that the developers stayed faithful to the source material. They built upon the already perfected gameplay from the Budokai Tenkaichi series by enhancing it with stunning visuals, destructible arenas, and a roster of nearly 200 characters. Additionally, the game’s multiplayer aspect is easy to access, and the story mode offers a refreshing experience with new Episode Battles and Custom Battles.</p>

<p>VALORANT is one of the most popular online multiplayer titles in gaming, attracting thousands of players a day to the tactical shooter genre. With so many agents and abilities, the game consistently receives fixes when these abilities aren’t working properly, like the one in today’s 10.02 patch.</p>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown of bug fixes coming to <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT</a> in Patch 10.02.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-valorant-10-02-patch-notes">VALORANT 10.02 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>VALORANT Patch 10.02 doesn’t feature any significant gameplay changes or improvements, save for one to Killjoy’s Alarmbot. It features a number of bug fixes, primarily targeting agent abilities that were bugged. Here are those changes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Vyse</strong>: Fixed an issue where Arc Rose and Razorvine were visible when placedon specific water surfaces.</li>



<li><strong>Tejo</strong>: Fixed an issue where players could rarely survive running straight through the full duration of Armageddon.</li>



<li><strong>Killjoy: </strong>Fixed an issue where Killjoy’s recall minimap indicator could get stuck in a state where it was invisible.</li>



<li><strong>Killjoy: </strong>Alarmbot logic has been updated to be more intelligent.
<ul>
<li>In niche circumstances, <strong>the Alarmbot will now path towards players if they are on ledges and explode on them</strong> if they would be hit by the size of the explosion rather than trying to run extremely long paths around the map.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where certain types of damage could leave players with Regen Shields at 1 HP when the damage should have been lethal.
<ul>
<li>This also fixed issues where <strong>Clove</strong> could tank lethal damage specifically when Regen Shield and Pick Me Up were active at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed a bug where Observers were seeing inconsistent player team outline colors.</li>
</ul>



<p>The following fixes to Premier, VALORANT’s seasonal competitive mode, apply only to PC players: </p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where long team names could overlap each other on the playoff bracket screen.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where dropdowns on the standings sometimes cut off text.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the division name text was not always correctly aligned on the match history screen</li>
</ul>



<p>Since his arrival at the start of the season, Tejo has become a popular fixture amongst competitive and pro players. However, his destructive ultimate Armageddon was sometimes not killing players caught in it’s full blast. Now, thanks to patch 10.02, players caught in the full duration will die.</p>



<p>Arguably the biggest change in VALORANT Patch 10.02 is the improved intelligence of Killjoy’s Alarmbot. Players are no longer safe from the Alarmbot if it they’re up on a ledge above it.</p>



<p>What changes do you want to see added to VALORANT in a future patch? Let us know down below and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It will launch in 2025. <span id="more-941729"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Atari:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Breakout Beyond</em> is a vibrant new reimagining of the <em>Breakout</em> series that invites players to break on through to the other side. This new entry into <em>Breakout</em> lore will challenge players not just to break every brick, but to creatively breach the wall with score-building combos. <em>Breakout Beyond</em> features a whole new sideways perspective, 72 levels for players to blast through, and two-player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [229 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play, designed to share the high-octane brick-breaking with a friend.</p><p>In this neon-infused twist on the classic 1976 <a title="Genres > Arcade [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade game</a>, players smash through each puzzle by clearing bricks to reach the final goal. However, the script has been flipped—literally! Players now progress sideways, breaking through barriers and building up combos that ramp up the intensity of the effects, rewarding the most skilled players with a dazzling light show. Breaking special blocks offers powerful advantages, like massive brick-clearing blasts, a protective barrier to shield the ball, and a laser cannon to carve a path forward. Each one unleashes stunning dynamic effects, delivering dazzling visuals never seen before in <em>Breakout</em>.</p><p>Featuring 72 challenging levels, players’ brick-blasting skills will be pushed to the brink—but they won’t need to face the challenge alone. Block-breakers can forgo going solo and team up with a friend for local two-player cooperative play and tackle the mayhem together. Alternatively, a new focus mode slows down time, sacrificing a higher score for greater control.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Unlockable endless mode with an online global leaderboard.</li><li>72 challenging levels that will put players’ brick-breaking skills to the test.</li><li>Two-player cooperative play to manage (or ramp up) the chaos with a friend.</li><li>Procedural audio and visual effects that increase in intensity with each combo.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

                <p>Elgato has announced a brand-new version of its free digital audio mixer took, dubbed Wave Link 2.0. Like the original software, the 2.0 version is designed to give content creators a flexible suite of options for managing their audio feeds while also adding in several quality-of-life upgrades designed to address the challenges that streamers and podcasters regularly run into.</p><p>One of the big new features is Voice Focus, which Elgato says was developed in collaboration with audio company AI-Coustics and can be used to remove unwanted noise, room reverb, and echo. At the same time, Elgato claims that a user's voice can be isolated and elevated to "professional" quality standards and this toolset is designed to deliver high-quality results in seconds. Essentially, if you're in a rush to get started on on your project and you don't want to tweak audio settings, this can potentially make you sound like a pro with minimal input needed from you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438403-wave_link_software_shadow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438403" data-ratio="0.60703125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438403-wave_link_software_shadow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438403"></a><figcaption>Wave Link 2.0</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438403-wave_link_software_shadow.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438405-wave_link_software_hero_macos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438407-wave_link_software_hero_windows.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438408-wave_link_software_vst_open.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438405,1300-4438407,1300-4438408" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4438405-wave_link_software_hero_macos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4438407-wave_link_software_hero_windows.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4438408-wave_link_software_vst_open.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438405-wave_link_software_hero_macos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438407-wave_link_software_hero_windows.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4438408-wave_link_software_vst_open.jpg"></figure><p>Managing multiple audio channels should also be easier with the new simplified layout in Wave Link 2.0. The overhaul includes one-click audio-routing allows users to instantly assign apps to channels, app-grouping for better organization, and input channel-renaming to streamline your layout. Additionally, digital tools like a compressor, de-esser, equalizer, and reverb adjuster have been retained and you'll still be able to use third-party audio plug-ins.</p><p>Naturally, Wave Link 2.0 is designed to work best with Elgato hardware--the current version can be used with other microphones if you prefer--and the company says it is aiming to introduce meaningful user experience improvements with the new software. If you're looking to get into livestreaming or podcasting, Elgato's gear is recommended as it has a very user-friendly design and offers high-quality results at a reasonable price.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Wave-Microphone-Podcasting-Capacitive/dp/B088HHWC47?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Elgato Wave 3 condenser microphone</a> is a favorite amongst streamers for its plug-and-play design, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RMXK59C?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stream Deck</a> is pretty great for livestreams as this is a 15-button customizable panel that you can assign specific functions to.

But it wasn’t made for the PlayStation console you might have played in the ‘90s. Instead, it was developed for the failed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-play-station-prototype-will-be-auctioned-off-i-1840485537&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-play-station-prototype-will-be-auctioned-off-i-1840485537">Nintendo PlayStation</a></span>—a proposed device that would let the SNES play CD games. </p><p>“The first thing they showed us was that  Nintendo Sony PlayStation, like a [working] prototype,” said Yoshida. “And also they had almost finished a game on it and I got to play the game on the system  the day I joined.”</p><p>According to Yoshida, the game was a 2.5D or 3D space-shooter-like thing and used the power of the CD to stream in assets to create something similar to the Sega CD title <em>Silpheed</em>. Sadly, Yoshida doesn’t remember who developed it, suggesting it might have been a team in the U.S. or Japan. When asked if it’s possible that this never-before-seen Nintendo PlayStation space shooter game still existed somewhere within Sony’s archives, Yoshida seemed to think it was. </p><p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if [the game was saved]. You know it was like [on a] CD so yeah,” explained the former PlayStation Studios president. </p><p>Now someone within Sony just needs to find that game and dump the rom online. Or maybe that will be one of the secrets buried in the next <em>Astro Bot</em> game. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo has revealed new Switch sales figures from the first nine months of the current financial year--ending on March 31, 2025--and while sales of the console and its games have been below expectations, there is a silver lining here. The Switch has sold over 150 million units since launch, making it the first console to do so in 13 years.</p><p>The last video game console to reach these numbers was also a Nintendo device (<a href="https://x.com/stealth40k/status/1886674034206593488" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as spotted by Stealth on X</a>), specifically the Nintendo DS. The dual-screen handheld had numerous hardware revisions over its lifespan, ranging from the original futuristic clamshell model to a streamlined design before the Nintendo 3DS eventually succeeded it, and it was quite popular with Nintendo fans thanks to its strong library of games and affordable pricing.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1569535285" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Nintendo DS. The top spot still belongs to Sony's PlayStation 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-ps2s-sony-made-in-its-lifetime/1100-6528175/" data-ref-id="1100-6528175">as after its lifetime sales were updated</a>, it was revealed that over 160 million of these consoles were sold in total.</p><p>In other Nintendo news, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html" rel="nofollow ">the company has now sold over 1.3 billion units of software</a>, with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continuing to be a hit with 5.38 million sales in the latest period and 67.35 million overall. Overall sales on Switch hardware were down by 30.6% year-on-year, while game sales declined by 24.4% year-on-year.

            <p>
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has said that fan expectation around <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> isn't the primary cause of Switch 1's plummeting sales.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-sales-below-expectations-as-wait-for-switch-2-continues">Nintendo admitted it had failed to hit its own targets for Switch 1</a> over the course of 2024. The company has revised its finacial forecast as console sales dipped by 30 percent, and sales of Switch 1 software also slumped.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors following the announcement, Furukawa dismissed the suggestion that anticipation for Switch 2 was to blame. 
</p>
<p>
"We don't think the impact of refraining from purchasing [because of Switch 2] is that great," Furukawa said, as repoted by Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250204-KB2S2JK245IALH4D6JO4NVHOZU/">The Sankei Shimbun</a>. "We think it's a solid eighth year, but we haven't reached our target."

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
It's fair to suggest that, after eight years, any console maker should expect sales to be in decline - as indeed they have for Switch 1 since the console's sales peak, back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
2024 was also a much quieter year for Switch 1 software releases overall, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and Mario Party Jamboree selling well but not as strongly as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> back in 2023.
</p><p>
And while the internet may be hanging on Nintendo's every word for news on Switch 2, there's still a large audience of Switch owners who are less engaged with Nintendo's preparations for what's next. Regardless, Nintendo has seen a steeper drop off in Switch 1 sales this year than any previous - and more than the company  had predicted.
</p>
<p>
That said, it's clear Nintendo will continue to push its hugely-successful Switch 1 - for the time being. Furukawa noted the company would continue Switch 1 support "as long as there is demand". 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has previously said similar ahead of launching new hardware in the past - and it's not a surprise. The company already has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beloved-wii-u-exclusive-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-coming-to-nintendo-switch">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition due in March</a>, before <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> and Pokémon Legends Z-A arrive on Switch 1 later this year.

			<p>Beyond the recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/">laid-off</a> employees, a number of former <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> developers at BioWare are now said to be allocated "permanently" to other projects by EA, a shocking move for the employees involved.</p>
<p>The report comes from Jason Schreier (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODM1MTgzMSwiZXhwIjoxNzM4OTU2NjMxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUVlXVThUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.91ztnslkcG02JwTwRRfVCXIJp8FOdqGBjCNQgz-bE8k&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">via Bloomberg</a>), who says that BioWare initially claimed that the employees were meant for a temporary transfer, but later on, EA decided to make this permanent without informing the individuals involved.</p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>But this week, the group was informed that the loans had morphed into permanent relocations, according to people familiar with what happened. They were no longer BioWare employees who were temporarily on assignment elsewhere; now, they worked for whichever EA subsidiary had borrowed them.&nbsp; </em><em>If they want to work at BioWare again in the future, they would have to look for job openings and re-apply.</em></p>
<p><em>- Bloomberg</em></p>
<p data-component="paragraph">This is a pretty interesting development, considering that BioWare already suffered a round of layoffs last year. According to Bloomberg, BioWare now has less than 100 employees, which is certainly a lot less than you'd expect from a triple-A studio. In a statement from EA to IGN, the publisher provided a vague response:</p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>The studio's priority was Dragon Age. During this time there were people continuing to build the vision for the next Mass Effect. Now that The Veilguard has shipped, the studio's full focus is Mass Effect. While we're not sharing numbers, the studio has the right number of people in the right roles to work on Mass Effect at this stage of development</em></p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>- EA via <a href="https://pk.ign.com/dragon-age-4/235195/news/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">IGN</a></em></p>
<p data-component="paragraph">BioWare fans are no doubt very disappointed by the news. It will be interesting to see how such decisions impact ongoing projects like the next Mass Effect title, which can potentially decide the studio's future in general. The once-beloved developer likely cannot afford another commercial disappointment.</p>

<p>According to the latest earnings release, the Nintendo Switch is now a step closer to the PlayStation 2 in sales, having sold more than 150 million units.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/switch-worldwide-sales-top-150-86-million-super-mario-party-jamboree-tops-6-17-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>, the Nintendo Switch sold 150.86 million units as of December 31, 2024, just 10 million shy of the best-selling video game console of all time, PlayStation 2. The 2017 console sold 4.82 million hardware units and 53.7 million units at this time. Interestingly, Nintendo has yet to beat DS’s sales numbers with the Switch, as the former has sold 154.02 million units in its lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-best-selling-first-party-nintendo-switch-games">Best Selling First-Party Nintendo Switch Games</h2>



<p>Nintendo also released its best-selling first-party Switch games, with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe still leading the pack, selling 67.35 million units. The next three in the list feature Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, selling 47.44 million, 35.88 million and 32.62 million units, respectively. The last title in the top 5 best-selling games for Nintendo Switch is Super Mario Odyssey, with 29.04 million units sold.

<p>Nintendo also revealed sales numbers for its newly announced first-party games, with Switch Sports selling 15.74 million units. Newer games like Super Mario Party Jamboree and Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership have sold 6.17 million and 1.84 million units, respectively. Other recent games, such as The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, sold 3.91 million units, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door sold 2.06 million, and Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD sold 1.80 million units.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-revises-forecast-again-nbsp">Nintendo Revises Forecast Again&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Nintendo sold 9.54 million hardware units, a 30.6% decrease year over year. On the software side, 123.98 million units were sold, a 24.4% decrease year over year. Hence, the console manufacturers have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lowers-annual-forecast-after-switch-sales-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revised their financial forecast </a>for March 2025 again. This change was made “in consideration of the sales trend through the nine months ended on December 31, 2024.” The hardware and software unit sales forecasts have also been revised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new estimates for net sales are 1.19 billion yen, down from 1.28 billion yen. The operating profit forecast was decreased from 360 million yen to 280 million yen. The ordinary and net profit estimates have also changed, down from 420 million yen and 300 million yen to 370 million yen and 270 million yen, respectively.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Elden Ring Nightreign Details to be Released Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-details/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-elden-ring-nightreign-details-to-be-released-next-week.1099569/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that new Elden Ring Nightreign details are scheduled to be released next week, including a release date.</p>



<p>That’s according to source familiar with the games plans, who said that information will be released on February 12. It’s understood that the announcement will include media previews and a final release date for the game, which is currently slated for the end of May.</p>



<p>For those out of the loop, the timing could make a lot of sense, too, as a recent rumor has also suggested that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play could be taking place in the same week</a> (although it could just be a coincidence). </p>



<p>But likely, the announcements and embargos are because of the Elden Ring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-will-have-a-network-test-starting-february-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightreign network test</a>, which takes place on February 14 – 17, which is undoubtedly going to see the games contents leak online. So it would make sense for FromSoftware to get ahead of the them with official announcements.</p>



<p>Announced during The Game Awards 2024, Nightreign is a cooperative experience that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can only be played solo or in a trio</a>. FromSoftware has already confirmed that the game cannot be played as a duo.</p>



<p>Elden Ring’s Game Director Junya Ishizaki clarified why such a decision was made, ““The reason that we went with a three-player focus was that we wanted to retain that sense of accomplishment you get from battling a boss together or from conquering a map together and that sense of enjoyment, but we wanted to recreate that in a fresh way. And we felt like focusing on a three-player co-op experience would provide a brand new sense of accomplishment with it.”</p>



<p>The game is scheduled to release on the PlayStation 4, Play7sTation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

That’s pretty wild. What the hell are they doing??”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne is of course one of the biggest conundrums in the video game industry. The FromSoftware masterpiece launched on PS4 to critical and commercial acclaim, but since then Sony hasn’t touched it. Fans are desperate for an official next-gen patch that would make the game run at 60fps, up from 30fps, but there are also calls for a remaster and a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recently, fans managed to get PS4 emulators to deliver something akin to a remaster on PC. The tech experts at <a href="https://youtu.be/-zjzBbdl7hk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry released a video</u></a> covering “a breakthrough in PS4 emulation” via ShadPS4, which means Bloodborne is now fully playable start to finish in 60fps. Could this breakthrough have triggered an aggressive response from Sony? IGN has asked Sony for comment, but it has yet to respond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1886240870560899319" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offered</a> what he called his “copium theory,” though: that Sony could be working on an official remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My copium theory is that Sony DMCAed the 60fps patch and the video about the Bloodborne demake so that when they announce a 60fps remake, google searching for ‘bloodborne 60fps’ and ‘Bloodborne remake’ won’t have collisions with our fan projects,” McDonald said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Let me cope.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then: “Like if they plan on trademarking ‘bloodborne 60fps’ and ‘Bloodborne remake’ they need to actually clean up in order to actually file a trademark request. Right??”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite these latest aggressive actions by Sony, the company has so far offered no indication that it plans to return to Bloodborne in any way. Last month, former PlayStation executive Shuhei <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory"><u>Yoshida delivered his Bloodborne no-show theory</u></a> in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with Kinda Funny Games</u></a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida began. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Bloodborne remains dormant nearly 10 years after the first game came out. But is there hope? In interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5"><u>Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod now available for download introduces ray-traced global illumination and significantly improves lighting, but with a barrier of entry.</p>
<p>The FF7 Rebirth RTGI Remake-Grading ReShade preset, now available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/222?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, addresses what is possibly one of the game's most glaring issues, the lighting, which makes the image look washed out and is a considerable step down from Final Fantasy VII Remake's lighting. The aim of the preset created by ShinObi12 is to bring the contrast and tone closer to that of Remake, which was used as a reference, and tame the adaption to feel more natural while adding RT bounce lighting. Judging from the comparison screenshot, the preset definitely achieves what it sets out to do, giving the game a more natural look in both indoor and outdoor locations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this ReShade preset is not exactly available for free, as it requires Pascal Gilcher's iMMERSE Pro shader, which can be downloaded by subscribing to the developer's <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> Ray Tracers tier. On the other hand, the cost of the subscription is only $5, which is definitely worth the visual improvements the shader can bring to a lot of games both old and new.</p>
<p>Despite some issues besides the downgraded lighting system over Remake, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is doing great on PC, as the game was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-had-great-steam-launch-best-selling-game-of-the-week-ending-jan-25/">best-selling game on Steam for the week ending January 25th</a>. The game's success is totally deserved, as it is an excellent continuation of the series, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <p>If, like me, you failed and failed and failed to get a decent score in arcadey reaction game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-super-hexagon">Super Hexagon</a>, then take solace in this: there are a bunch of other games by the same developer you can fail at. Terry Cavanagh, also the maker of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dicey-dungeons">Dicey Dungeons</a>, is releasing a collection of his freeware bits and bobs on Steam next week, called simply <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terrys-other-games">Terry's Other Games</a>. Looking at the games included, it summons a nostalgic giggle just to see just how many of Terry's short games have been intriguing enough to grab the eye of an RPS writer over the years. I mean it literally. One game is called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grab-them-by-the-eyes">Grab Them By The Eyes</a>. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>There are 21 games in total. Others in the collection which we've previously written about include the clever isometric illusions of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-entire-world-is-a-lie-in-vvvvvv-creators-nayas-quest">Naya's Quest</a>, minimalist rando-gen thief 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/free-loaders-heist-heist-baby">Tiny Heist</a>, and first-person co-op puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/at-distance">At A Distance</a>, which demands to be played on two machines side by side for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watchngame-at-a-distance">full lateral-thinky effect</a>. </p>
<p>"But it also includes a bunch of smaller, messier games," says Cavanagh on the Steam page, "experimental games made in a weekend, an unfinished prototype, joke games I made for game jams, a game I made as a teenager." </p>

<p>That sounds as much an act of vulnerability as it is releasing a game, like those videos where artists <a href="https://youtu.be/V1F8YfAYOdk?si=vdGzsME9GUUPHcaE&amp;t=18">tour their sketchbooks</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNPFs_wBVzM&amp;t=0s">go through old work</a>. There is some achievement hunting to the proceedings as well. Each game in the launcher comes with a couple of tasks to fulfil for twinkling stars. But wait, this may be a trap. I have chased after all the shiny trinkets in VVVVVV, and I can tell you: it was only partially worth the hair loss. </p><p>Terry has <a href="https://distractionware.com/blog/2025/01/so-whats-in-the-collection/">written up the reasoning</a> for many games he has included, but also his thoughts on those he has excluded. Constellation - a swell wee browser game about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/super-hexagon-creator-releases-constellation">typing random words to see what appears</a> - didn't make the cut because you'd need a keyboard and he wanted every game to be uniformly playable on controller. </p>
<p>"Also! This game is weirdly tricky to localise," says Cavanagh, "because the word list is really particular and built about what words prompt you to think of other words, and those connections don’t quite seem to translate from one language to another."</p>
<p>Makes sense! I always get the feeling localisation and language is important to Cavangah. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dicey-dungeons-can-now-be-played-in-irish-with-a-gamepad">Dicey Dungeons was translated to Irish</a>, for example, and this collection is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/unaminh.bsky.social/post/3lgspcwft6s2o">getting the same treatment</a>. You don't have long to wait, it'll be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824580/Terrys_Other_Games/">releasing on Steam</a> on Feb 13th, and will package all the games together for a to-be-decided price. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The UK government has said it won't tighten the law to protect video game fans who feel ripped off when a product they've bought becomes unusable - such as when a live-service game sees its servers switched off.
</p>
<p>
In a lengthy <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">statement</a>, the government said it "had no plans to amend consumer law on digital obsolescence", and that video game companies would simply continue to be bound by existing legislation.
</p>
<p>
The government's comment comes in response to a petition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">backed by the Stop Killing Games campaign</a>, which argues that current laws do not do enough to dissuade video game companies from switching off games, partly or fully, "as a form of planned obsolescence" - leaving owners unable to continue using their purchase.
</p>
<p>
"We are aware of issues relating to the life-span of digital content, including video games, and we appreciate the concerns of players of some games that have been discontinued," the UK government said.
</p>
<p>
"Video games sellers must comply with existing consumer law - this includes the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA) and Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPR).  However, there is no requirement in UK law for software companies to support older versions of their products.
</p><p>
"Decision-making is for those companies, taking account of commercial and regulatory factors and complying with existing consumer law. There may be occasions where companies make decisions based on the high running costs of maintaining older servers for games with declining user bases."
</p>
<p>
So, what are the provisions under existing law?
</p>
<p>
The CRA requires that products are fit for purpose and sold as described to consumers, and the government has acknowleged this extends to digital content, such as games bought via Steam or the Nintendo eShop, as well as physical items such as boxed games that contain a cartridge or disc.
</p>
<p>
But the government's response here also acknowledges that "it may be difficult and expensive for businesses to maintain support" over time. Ultimately, the government simply states that "if software is offered for sale that is not supported by the provider, then this should be made clear" - although in the majority of cases, video games are sold in a working condition, only for services to be switched off later.
</p>
<p>
The CPR, meanwhile, covers the information about a product available to a consumer at the time of purchase, and is designed to ensure buyers can make informed decisions about what they buy. 
</p>
<p>
"If consumers are led to believe that a game will remain playable indefinitely for certain systems, despite the end of physical support, the CPR may require that the game remains technically feasible (for example, available offline) to play under those circumstances," the government wrote.
</p>
<p>It's interesting to see live-service battler <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thats-all-folks-another-warner-bros-live-service-bites-the-dust">MultiVersus take this approach when it shuts down</a> - this time for good. Publisher Warner Bros has said the game will remain playable offline for those who previously bought a copy.</p>
<p>
What can you do if you think the law has been broken? You can report a suspected breach of the CPR to Citizens Advice, which can then refer complaints to Trading Standards and the Competition and Market Authority (CMA). The recent Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC) links into this, and from April will give the government "the power to add, amend or remove" any commercial description deemed unfair.
</p><p>
If you live outside the UK, the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/countries">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign is pushing governments to respond to the issue elsewhere, including via a similar petition to the EU. The initiative is the work of YouTuber Ross Scott, and was set up after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">Ubisoft announced it was shutting down racing game The Crew</a>.
</p>
<p>
The other side to the loss of games is the disappearance of the creative work itself - something that has been highlighted by a growing awareness of the need for proper video game preservation. Silent-era American films have a better survival rate than classic video games - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-preservation-took-steps-forward-in-2024-but-still-has-a-long-way-to-go">as Will Butler summarised today, despite some improvements there is still a lot of work to be done</a>.

<p>There’s plenty that we might guess could appear through this showcase, with 11 Bit having released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> on PC last year and might have a console port to announce, or acting as publisher to the upcoming soulslike deck builder Death Howl. Panic, meanwhile, has a bunch of games they’re publishing, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/09/time-flies-is-a-fly-simulator-about-life-and-death/">Time Flies</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/everything-announced-during-day-of-the-devs-tga-2024-edition/">Blippo+</a> and more. Akapura also has an intriguing title they’re publishing, the 2D role playing game Cabernet, where you play as a 19th century vampire lady. That sounds like it sucks… but in a good way!</p>
<p>So plenty of possibilities, for what is sure to be a busy showcase!</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 can't come soon enough, as the Japanese company has clearly overestimated the life left in the current consoles, according to a well-known analyst.</p>
<p>Commenting on the company's latest financial report with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-cant-come-soon-enough-nintendo-lowers-forecast-again-as-switch-sales-decline-30/">VGC</a>, which confirmed the original Switch surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-sales-surpass-150-million-units-milestone/">150 million units sold worldwide</a>, Kantan Games' Serkan Toto highlighted how the new system can't come soon enough, as the company clearly overestimated the life left in the current system, which was highlighted by Nintendo revising its hardware sales forecast two times. The analyst, who feels that even the new lower forecast will be missed, is not sure why Nintendo thought they would sell 14 million units in the current fiscal year, especially with a pretty empty release schedule, which currently only includes Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. As such, the Nintendo Switch 2 can't come soon enough, and hopefully not this Fall, the analyst added.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of a solid release date for the Nintendo Switch 2, the excitement surrounding the system continues to be high among both fans and developers.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civilization VII</a> executive producer Dennis Shirk recently talked with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-dev-firaxis-remains-coy-on-nintendo-switch-2-mouse-joy-con" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a> about the system, saying that Nintendo is doing something very cool with the new Joy-Con controller and that it would be equally cool if the controller could be used as a mouse, as the reveal video suggested. While this is not exactly a confirmation, it definitely feels like there's still a lot we do not know about the new controller.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed 2025 release date worldwide.</p>
