		<p>C-Smash VRS: New Dimension has a release date, with the flatscreen port of the excellent VR sports game launching for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> on 26th September. A free update for existing owners on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a>, the game will also feature hybrid online multiplayer.</p>
<p><iframe title="C-Smash VRS New Dimension - Release date and Hybrid-Online-Play Announcement (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWd1t7BDklw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>New Dimension switches C-Smash VRS from first person VR to third person, much like arcade and Dreamcast original that inspired it. To do this there’s a whole bunch of new gameplay mechanics, animations (like a charge shot flip) and visual tweaks.</p>
<p>Underneath it all, this is the same minimalist game of space squash, and that’s allowing RapidEyeMovers and Wolf &amp; Wood to cater to cross-format multiplayer. Whether playing on TV, on PlayStation Portal or with a PSVR 2 headset on your noggin, you can play against and with all other players. PS5 vs PS5, PS5 vs PSVR 2 or PSVR 2 vs PSVR 2.</p>
<p>The new version of the game is available to play at BitSummit Drift this weekend.</p>

<p>Since its launch last June exclusively for PSVR 2, C-Smash VRS has been supported with several major feature updates, including an endless mode, co-op play, AI opponents, more levels, more music and plenty besides. In April it was also released for&nbsp;Meta Quest and Pico standalone VR headsets.</p>
<p>In our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/14/c-smash-vrs-review/"> C-Smash VRS review</a>, I wrote, “With the simplicity of squash and block smashing at its core, C-Smash VRS is a virtual racket sport delight. The bat and ball physics are tricky to master, but stick to the easier Zen mode, or play with a friend in multiplayer and co-op, and there’s plenty of joy to be had here.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-brings-back-chaotic-portal-based-arena-shooting-next-year.930732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>1047 Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, a sequel to its successful 2021 portal shooter. The game is due to arrive on PC and consoles sometime next year.</p>
<p>Per a press release, the sequel will retain the fast-paced portal-hopping first-person shooting of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/splitgate">the original</a>, but since it's been built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, it'll feel like a totally different beast.</p>
<p>This time around, you'll get the chance to choose between three unique factions: the "agile" Aeros, the "time-manipulating" Meridian, and the powerful Sabrask. They'll duke it out across a "large variety" of arenas and modes, wielding a range of weapons as they do so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-2-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=j_EriBgN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-2-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=_JaLUAwT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>brings back the fast-paced portal-shooting action of the original next year.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not entirely clear whether the new game will have a stricter class-based system that makes it more akin to a hero shooter than a standard arena FPS, but 1047 says&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will offer "multiple playstyles and loadouts for strategic team setups" within factions.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you want to know more about your particular faction, you'll be pleased to know that 1047 has <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released a companion app</a> that offers the chance to delve into the background lore of the game, and that the first installment of a "five-issue comic book series" offering further lore explorations is available today.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>announcement trailer, which shows off some of the game's characters and factions, right here.</p>

<p>Per an official&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.splitgate.com/faq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ on the game's official website</a>, the sequel will be free-to-play, just like its predecessor. It won't have a single-player campaign, but it will have different gameplay modes that offer "distinct experiences".</p>
<p>1047 is refusing to be tied down to a release window more specific than 2025, but the developer does jokingly say that&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be released in one of the year's twelve months. Thanks for narrowing it down, guys!</p>
<p>For&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, 1047 CEO Ian Proulx says he's recruited an "all-star team", with the studio's staffers currently comprising people who've worked with studios like 343 Industries, Bungie, and Riot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's hoping all of that experience translates into success for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, which launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010012" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate-2/9pf5q1b0fhsl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a> in 2025. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24201098/metaverse-matthew-ball-apple-vision-pro-fortnite-gaming-spatial-internet-3d-decoder-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week on <em>Decoder</em>,<em> </em>I talked to author Matthew Ball, who was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23269170/what-is-the-metaverse-matthew-ball-interview-decoder-podcast">last on the show in 2022</a> to discuss his book&nbsp;“The Metaverse: And How it Will Revolutionize Everything.” It’s 2024, and it’s safe to say that has not happened yet. But Matt’s still on the case — in fact, he just <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324095286">performed an almost complete update of the book</a>, now with the much more sober title, “Building the Spatial Internet.” It’s out next week on Tuesday, July 23rd. </p><p>Matt and I talked a lot about where the previous metaverse hype cycle landed us and what there is to learn from these boom and bust waves in technology. We also talked about the Apple Vision Pro as a marker or symbol of where the metaverse is now and where it has to go. If you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">read or watched my review</a> when it came out, you’ll know I think the Vision Pro is sort of an end point for one set of technologies, and I wanted to know if Matt felt the same and what needs to happen to make all of this more mainstream and accessible.</p><p>Matt’s overall point is that it’s tempting to think that the metaverse just fizzled out after the huge explosion of hype that came after Facebook renamed itself to Meta, hype which the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23451629/meta-quest-pro-vr-headset-horizon-review">lackluster Quest Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23391895/meta-facebook-horizon-worlds-vr-social-network-too-buggy-leaked-memo">messy Horizon platform</a> couldn’t really live up to. And hype which eventually got totally washed away by the arrival of generative AI. </p><p>But the metaverse didn’t just disappear. The major players — Meta, <em>Fortnite</em> maker Epic Games, <em>Roblox</em> — are all still plugging away at the idea, albeit gradually. While Meta and Apple go head-to-head on hardware, the gaming companies whose engines make the 3D internet come to life are still working on some of the core technical ideas — like interoperability and what combination of AR and VR consumers actually want.</p><p>That’s all while game makers contend with an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite">industrywide downturn that’s led to waves of layoffs</a> in addition to a pretty stark lack of consumer enthusiasm in the whole metaverse concept. Combine all of that<em> </em>with some intense backlash against both AI and crypto, and you can start to see why we’re not racing as fast toward this next-generation internet as we might have once thought. </p><p>Matthew and I got into all of that and more, and he makes his case for why the ideas that power what we think of as the metaverse today are a whole lot bigger than just buzzwords and futurist predictions. He’s optimistic that we’re still on the path toward this new, spatial, or more 3D version of the internet — progress is still being made and that maybe these booms and busts are just part of the trajectory from where we are now to where we might be in the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Splitgate developer 1047 Games has today said it will launch the sequel to its surprise hit indie shooter in 2025. 
</p>
<p>
The original Splitgate racked up 22m downloads, and received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-review-the-appliance-of-science">positive reception to its mix of fast-paced Halo-esque combat with the ability to traverse portals, Portal style</a>.
</p>
<p>
Splitgate 2's pitch is clear. All of the above, but now with a bigger budget and with a much larger roster of veteran development talent - including people who worked on Halo back in the day.

<p>
"The original Splitgate's development was ambitious but scrappy,” said Ian Proulx, co-founder and CEO of 1047 Games. "The game was created from a dorm room, and the massive success and community it earned surpassed our wildest dreams.
</p>
<p>
"This time around, Splitgate 2 has been designed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 to deliver the AAA FPS experience our fans deserve, with the series' signature action completely overhauled by an all-star team composed of the most talented individuals in the industry."
</p>
<p>
Not mincing his words, Proulx went on to describe Splitgate 2 as a "revolutionary step forward for competitive shooters", a fresh entry point for newcomers, as well as a worthy upgrade from the original for those who bought that.
</p>
<p>
PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S versions of Splitgate 2 are all on the way next year. 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, there's the first episode of a new digital comic series and unlockables for the upcoming game over at Splitgate.com, and a new Splitgate companion app available today via iPhone and Android. 
</p>
<p>
Word of a sequel does not come as a surprise. Back in 2022, 1047 Games explained it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-is-ending-feature-development-so-dev-can-focus-on-new-game-in-same-universe">stepping away from further updates to the original Splitgate</a> to work on something new in the same universe - something that was built on UE5 and launched as a free-to-play game. And indeed, two years later, here we are! One to keep an eye on for 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-about-finding-a-family-and-saving-the-world-with-them-says-bioware/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of the ongoing Game Informer monthly coverage, BioWare has <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/17/bioware-on-returning-to-the-dragon-age-series-10-years-after-inquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> its focus on companions for Dragon Age: The Veilguard in greater depth. Creative Director John Epler stressed that the game's storyline will feel like finding a family of people and saving the world with them.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age has always been about characters but to some degree, it's almost felt like we've lucked into that. Inquisition is a story that ultimately, you, the main character, have the biggest part to play. We wanted to tell a story this time where you literally cannot save the world without these characters. Beyond that, though, we also wanted to give them their own arcs that can run parallel to the main story and really give them that kind of deep storytelling our fans really enjoy.</em></p>
<p><em>They [the companions] have their friendships, they have their rivalries, and lean into that concept. You're not just pulling together a bunch of people who will do whatever you say. You're assembling a family, and that becomes the core of what the Veilguard is all about. It's about taking this group, this found family, and saving the world, side by side with them.</em></p>
<p>Former franchise producer Mark Darrah, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> as a consultant on Dragon Age: The Veilguard, clarifies:</p>
<p><em>The thing that is so amazing about Veilguard is this is the game where we finally said out loud that BioWare's greatest strength is telling stories through characters. If you go all the way back to Baldur's Gate 1, Baldur's Gate 2, these games are telling stories through characters, but there wasn't an intentionality behind that. And in this game, we're finally putting that intentionality first and foremost, putting the characters first, building the game around that, around those character moments, which is really the best way that BioWare knows how to tell stories.</em></p>
<p>Darrah also said that the development team is now much more knowledgeable with the Frostbite engine. That, coupled with the greatly improved hardware capabilities, will provide a level of visual quality that wasn't really possible in previous games. For example, each character now moves in a certain way instead of moving exactly like the others.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is scheduled to launch at some point this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.

It looks like a Joy-Con grip with a USB-C port and a small platform to hold it up. We don’t know the price yet but the device comes out on October 17. The response from fans is what you might expect. “Nice accessory but I feel like this should’ve been a thing seven years ago,” commented one. “Can I plug it in to fix my drift?” commented another. Every other modern console has had a controller charging accessory since basically whenever it came out. </p><p>The Switch didn’t really need a charging stand since that’s effectively what the console is when its docked, but for multiplayer games and players circulating through multiple Joy-Con, having the ability to always keep one set charged it makes a lot of sense. The timing of the announcement seems to be pegged to the recent release of Nintendo World Championships, and <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> is out the same day as the charging stand in the fall.</p><p>But some think this might also be related to the upcoming reveal of the Switch 2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/scully1888/status/1813850946767659269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/scully1888/status/1813850946767659269" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As <em>VGC </em>editor Chris Scullion pointed out</a></span>, recent rumors point to the Switch 2 having <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-joy-con-magnets-1851437754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-joy-con-magnets-1851437754">magnetic strips on the sides</a></span> to keep controllers attached, potentially indicating that existing Joy-Con won’t be able to connect to the sides.

<p>Nintendo has recently unveiled a new Switch accessory called the 2-Way Joy-Con Charging Stand, which will hit the shelves on October 17. This new peripheral enables players to recharge their Joy-Cons without attaching them to their Switch consoles.</p>



<p>The innovative Joy-Con Charging Stand is designed to cater to various user preferences. Its versatile design lets you choose between propping it up or laying it flat, providing flexibility to suit your space and needs. This accessory is a game-changer for users with multiple Joy-Cons, offering the convenience of charging a pair while having another set ready for local multiplayer games. With this stand, you can keep the fun going without interruption.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Additionally, players can use this stand to charge the Switch Nintendo Entertainment System controllers; however, a price has yet to be revealed. Once it arrives, interested players can grab the Joy-Con accessory through My Nintendo Store and other participating retailers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players have expressed concerns about the belated introduction of this accessory, especially considering that the Nintendo Switch Console has been on the market for seven years. Furthermore, numerous third-party manufacturers have released similar accessories with enhanced Joy-Con support over the years. Given its delayed release, players wonder whether this accessory will be compatible with the Joy-Cons of the anticipated Switch 2.</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo has provided <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-august-release-date-for-mysterious-emio-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an August release window for their mysterious ‘Emio’ game</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA+ might be arriving</a> for Nintendo Switch consoles in the near future. What are your views on the new 2-Way Joy-Con Stand? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-controller-leak-teases-new-special-edition-release-possibly-coming-august-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Loosely translated from reliable leaker Billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-nouvelle-manette-sans-fil-xbox-va-bientot-sortir-voici-tout-ce-que-vous-devez-savoir-sur-cette-edition-speciale-55911" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Dealabs</a>, the next Xbox Wireless Controller is possibly the “Sky Cipher Special Edition.”</p>



<p>Billbil-kun revealed a variety of key details about the upcoming controller. They claim Microsoft will officially announce the controller on July 31, 2024, also when pre-orders should open for fans.</p>



<p>They also estimate that the actual release date will fall around August 13, 2024. However, Dealabs clarifies that they also “have several candidate dates,” so that isn’t quite a concrete date.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 UPCOMING RELEASE 🚨</p><p>Here is eveything we know about the next Xbox Wireless Controller:</p><p>💠 Sky Cipher Special Edition 💠</p><p>You'll find the following details in the report:<br>🖼️ Controller color<br>📅 Announcement &amp; Release date<br>💰 Pricing<a href="https://t.co/4lL409YiCA">https://t.co/4lL409YiCA</a></p></div>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1813927527829954573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>In the report, Dealabs further claims the price tag will be $69.99 USD, or about 69.99 euros. This would be consistent with previous Xbox special edition controllers.</p>



<p>However, Billbil-kun did not have concrete details about the Sky Cipher’s appearance. They only extrapolate that it will likely have blue elements, given that “Sky” is in the name.</p>



<p>Dealabs could not confirm if it will feature Haptic feedback, either. Previous Xbox special edition controllers, such as the Stellar Shift, include features like textured gripping, Bluetooth technology, and more.</p>



<p>Xbox just recently announced a giveaway featuring a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-releases-new-controller-with-deadpools-butt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool-themed controller</a>.  It generated a lot of buzz for its unusual design, which is just as amusingly crass as similar tie-ins with the upcoming Deadpool film. Deadpool and Wolverine releases as soon as next week, further boosting Xbox’s collaboration.</p>



<p>Last March, Xbox also introduced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-fallout-xbox-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Fallout controller</a> that players can customize, tying into the success of Amazon’s live-action series.</p>

                <p>Microsoft and Nvidia have teamed up to allow users to launch Xbox games directly from Xbox.com via cloud streaming through Nvidia GeForce Now. Already, supported games could be launched through Microsoft's own cloud gaming service, but now users will they have the option to stream via GeForce Now instead.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2024/07/18/ignore-game-passs-new-option-to-play-on-geforce-now/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a> and others, selecting GeForce Now simply redirects users to the GeForce Now website. For a more optimal experience, many recommend downloading the GeForce Now app. The app has more settings than the browser version and is generally understood to be a better experience.</p><p>One of the sticking points of Microsoft getting the deal done to buy Activision Blizzard was around cloud gaming and streaming. To help get the deal done, Microsoft made several assurances to regulators that the company would only allow users to stream games through Microsoft's own streaming service but also through a range of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-microsofts-big-cloud-gaming-deal-with-ubisoft-is-all-about-according-to-phil-spencer/1100-6517196/" data-ref-id="1100-6517196">third-party providers like Nvidia, Boosteroid, and Ubisoft. </a></p><p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/memberships/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">All GeForce Now memberships are half-off right now</a> as part of a summer sale, bringing the price of its Ultimate plan down to $10/month or $50/year. This subscription tier supports up to 4K and 240fps, while there are less-expensive subscription options, too, that have scaled-backed features and functionality.</p><p>Streaming is a big focus for Xbox going forward as the company looks to expand the reach of Xbox beyond the platform itself. In another major streaming development, Microsoft just added streaming support to Fire Stick TV devices, and you can get a bundle that has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prime-day-deal-gets-you-everything-you-need-to-play-xbox-without-an-xbox-for-70/1100-6525002/" data-ref-id="1100-6525002">everything you need for under $100.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/18/splitgate-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-has-been-revealed-and-it%E2%80%99s-coming-out-in-2025.930684/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/18/splitgate-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Splitgate 2 has been announced by 1047 Games, a sequel to what the surprise FPS hit of 2021. Splitgate 2 is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One and PC in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splitgate 2 Cinematic Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8zPMku7q9hU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Splitgate 2 is a full sequel to the original, retaining core aspects of its arena shooter action like portals, but aiming to use Unreal Engine 5 and a full new production cycle to create a much higher quality product. The quip-filled chit chat of the announcement trailer will almost certainly grate with an older generation of player, but the snippets of gameplay looks on the money for this genre and from the original.</p>
<p>1047 Games co-founder and CEO Ian Proulx said, “The original Splitgate‘s development was ambitious but scrappy. The game was created from a dorm room, and the massive success and community it earned surpassed our wildest dreams. This time around, Splitgate 2 has been designed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 to deliver the AAA first-person shooter experience our fans deserve, with the series’ signature <a title="Genres > Action [2,015 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> completely overhauled by an all-star team composed of the most talented individuals in the industry. This is a revolutionary step forward for competitive <a title="Genres > Shooter [3,818 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a>s. It’s the perfect entry point for players new to the world of Splitgate and a comprehensive upgrade worthy of our existing community.”</p>
<p>There’s some key new features that 1047 is introducing into the game, with a progression system that will have players unlock new capabilities for different Factions, upgrade weapons and improve their player loadouts. Those factions will have specific abilities, such as Aeros being able to dash, Meridian having time-manipulation gear, and the raw power of the Sabrask.&nbsp;With a 4v4 shooter set up, you’ll be able to build a quick and complimentary team composition, though you’ll fundamentally have to master the weapons and use of the portal gun.</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 has been on the cards since 2022, when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/05/splitgate-development-to-end-so-1047-games-can-work-on-aaa-sequel/">1047 halted production on content for the original game</a>. While the original release into beta had quickly raced to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/20/splitgate-beta-will-continue-as-shooter-hits-10-million-downloads/">over 10 million players</a>, satiating some of the appetite for a tight arena shooter and drawing comparisons to the Halo series as it did so, 1047 quickly realised that they needed to revamp many aspects of the game, and not just produce more content for it. While they started down that path with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/01/splitgate-beta-season-2-building-a-better-shooter-for-the-future/">two seasons of support</a>, it was eventually decided to start over completely.</p>
<p>It will be very interesting to see how everything has come together when Splitgate 2 launches next year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netherrealms-mobile-games-in-danger-as-layoffs-strike.930681/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netherrealm-mobile-shut-down-rumor-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Injustice&nbsp;</em>developer NetherRealm has apparently closed down its entire mobile team, leaving an unknown number of employees without work.</p>
<p>According to QA analyst <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tony-lazzara-83b00319_opentowork-activity-7219362131924672513-snus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tony Lazzara</a>, NetherRealm's mobile team was "shut down" recently. Lazzara doesn't give a reason for the shutdown, nor does he state how many employees have been affected by this shutdown.</p>
<p>While Lazzara's report seems to be the only one claiming a full team shutdown, his account is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219442604168368128/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">corroborated</a> by at least <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/samanthaedward_opentowork-activity-7219060836563079168-9MXz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" rel="noopener" target="_blank">three other</a> NetherRealm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219144299609829378/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">employees</a>, all of whom are now looking for work. Another employee didn't directly say they were laid off, but did <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamoritz/recent-activity/all/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">share a link</a> to recently-posted jobs in the gaming industry.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netherrealm-mobile-injustice-2.jpg?itok=rUmISNvZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netherrealm-mobile-injustice-2.jpg?itok=Z3cnBJXo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The future of NetherRealm's mobile games appears to be in doubt.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, since NetherRealm hasn't made an official statement about these layoffs, we don't know whether the future of the studio's mobile games is safe or not, but it's probably reasonable to assume games like&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat Mobile&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Injustice 2&nbsp;</em>could be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>If that's the case, the timing of this decision seems a little strange given that&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat Mobile&nbsp;</em>received a major new update just yesterday, and it's one that seems to have gone down pretty well with fans of the game, too.</p>
<p>Warner Bros' gaming division is in a strange place at the moment. On the one hand, sales of February's&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>were a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win">huge disappointment</a>, with WB chalking up a loss to the tune of $200 million thanks to the game's failure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, last year's single-player RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>was a huge success for WB Games, racking up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-smash-through-15-million-barrier">millions upon millions of sales</a>. A Director's Cut version of the game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report">reportedly in the works</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-suicide-squad.jpg?itok=1nLHEDG6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-suicide-squad.jpg?itok=CYdJtbWh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Not all of Warner Bros' gambles have paid off recently.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to find somewhere to lay the blame for&nbsp;these purported NetherRealm mobile layoffs, you could perhaps do worse than&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s failure, but there's another elephant in the room, too; Warner Bros' <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warner-bros-discovery-wbd-zaslav-struggles-streaming-media-strategy-analysis-2024-7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">failed Discovery merger</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be716ec2-1c02-467c-94af-7c8ef9ae1963" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported by the Financial Times</a>, Warner Bros' share price is dropping, and the company is apparently currently eyeing up a breakup plan that would see its movie and streaming divisions spun off into a different entity.</p>
<p>While these problems aren't directly related to Warner Bros' gaming division, it's all part of the same corporate structure, and so problems in one area will almost certainly have a knock-on effect in others.</p>
<p>For now, though, we'll just have to wait and see what happens next. We've reached out to Warner Bros for comment and will update this story as soon as we hear anything back.</p>

It’s an accessory that many Switch gamers would have welcomed seven years ago when the handheld launched, and while third parties have long offered alternatives, Nintendo’s arrives with some extra flexibility.</p><p>Unlike most wireless controllers that can be charged with a USB-C cable, the Nintendo Joy-Con, as well as the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200753/nintendo-deal-gaming-nes-gamepad-controller-wireless">retro wireless NES and Famicom gamepads</a>, can only charge when attached to the Switch. A separate charger makes it easier to keep more than two Joy-Con controllers powered up, so it’s an odd move for the company to release an accessory like this as the original Switch’s lifecycle winds down and its successor is expected to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">revealed early next year</a>.</p><p>Nintendo’s Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way) accessory can accommodate two controllers at a time, drawing power from the Switch dock’s USB-C port or another power adapter. The charger’s vertical support can also be removed, improving its portability.</p><p>Nintendo hasn’t revealed pricing for the accessory yet. <em>The Verge</em> has also reached out to the company to confirm that the charging stand will be available in North America, as so far, it has only been announced in Europe and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fjp%2Ftopics%2Farticle%2F8d855df8-7c17-4c40-a11b-d85c9925a2ee">Japan</a>.</p><div><p>The new accessory will be part of what is probably Nintendo’s last big holiday push for the aging console, joining the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24190886/nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-preorder-price-release-date-zelda">“Hyrule Edition” Nintendo Switch Lite</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>, which both release on September 26th, as well as new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180977/a-new-mario-party-game-is-here-to-ruin-your-family-relationships"><em>Mario Party</em></a> titles.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A good immersive sim, by its very nature, offers myriad varied approaches to solving problems. And yet, I find myself wanting to get hyper-specific when writing about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/corpus-edax">Corpus Edax</a>, because it has an incredibly gratifying metal pipe sound, whether you’re stealthy wrapping it around the back of a blissfully unaware fool’s noggin, or lobbing it directly at their knee caps. In fact - although the game does have a delightful array of classic verbs, along with a few surprises - many of them are simply conducive to a stirring round of fisticuffs, to write my most British sentence of the week.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You’ve got other options, of course, although I can’t help feel a little implied judgement in the fact one of the non-fighting stats is simply named ‘Nerd’. There’s also a thoughtful and flesh-out trait-and-stat-based dialogue system that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>-heads among you are bound to get a kick out of it. Waking up on a hospital bed at the beginning of the game, for example, my character gets a special option to complain about his bones because he’s over 60. This is reactivity I can get behind. My bones hurt too!</p>
<p>However, I surmise you’re here for the punching. Have a combat trailer:</p>

<p>As you can see, even if you don’t go for the elaborate method of stamping on a wooden chair to use the leg as a weapon, the basic melee is decently fleshed out with blocks and dodges and kicks. Oh, go on, have another one <a href="https://youtu.be/X3fpulkOX_c">here</a>. An impromptu tube light beating that also electrifies your opponents? I am giddy with glee.</p>
<p>A big part of this variety comes from the conceit that guns have been outlawed as part of the setting, which I really appreciate as a creative limitation. Less gun-ching, more punching, as they say. Do they say that? Doesn’t matter. You can download Corpus Edax’s demo on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2017610/CORPUS_EDAX/">here</a>. It's more fun than singing God Save The Queen in a bath of beans, to outdo my previous most British sentence.</p>

<p>The developers of Mortal Kombat have been hit with mass layoffs as the entire NetherRealm  Studios’ mobile team has been let go. </p>

<p>“Good morning internet. Unfortunately, yesterday NetherRealm’s mobile team was shut down,” quality assurance analyst Tony Lazzara posted. “A ton of very talented people were put out of work.”</p>



<p>“It hurts me to announce I’ve been laid off from NetherRealm Studios after about 10 years of working there,” Animator Elizabeth Ramirez said.</p>







<p>NetherRealm Studios is owned by Warner Bros. Games. Insider Gaming has reached out to both NetherRealm and Warner Bros. Games for comment on the division closure and layoffs. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>At least 50 people have been impacted by these latest layoffs. This brings the year total to <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 11,000 people</a> let go from jobs in the gaming industry, that we know of. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/18/24200304/voicemod-key-xbox-playstation-voice-changer-soundboard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Popular voice changing software Voicemod is finally going to work with game consoles like the PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch. While Voicemod has been available as an app on Windows PCs for more than five years, platform limitations have forced Voicemod to create dedicated hardware to bring its popular voice changer and soundboard to game consoles.</p><p><a href="https://www.voicemod.net/vmkey/">Voicemod Key</a> is a tiny USB-C dongle that turns your regular gaming headset and mobile phone into a voice changer and soundboard for game consoles, phones, and tablets. “The original idea was from the community, we found it on YouTube,” explains Voicemod chief operating officer Jochen Doppelhammer in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Voicemod can’t build an app for Xbox or PlayStation, so Voicemod users had been using headsets within headsets to get the voice changer working with their phones and consoles. One person even put together a bunch of audio splitters that fed the output of a microphone into Voicemod and then back out into the microphone input on a console. “They put it together and I was like, I need to try that! That was the initial idea, and with the splitter you find problems and to solve them we needed electronic components,” says Doppelhammer.</p><p>Voicemod Key works by using two audio jacks and a USB-C port to route your gaming headset into the Voicemod app on mobile and back out into your console. You plug your wired headset into one port, a stereo cable into the other, and then connect up the other end of the stereo cable to your game console. The dongle then plugs into the USB-C or Lightning port on your phone, where you can launch voice changing features or the soundboard.</p><div><figcaption><em>How Voicemod Key connects to a console.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Voicemod</cite></p></div><p>Voicemod’s AI voices and real-time voice changing features will all be available, alongside buttons to launch custom soundboard audio that your friends will hear in a party chat. Voicemod is also planning to get its Key hardware working with voice chat apps on a phone in the future. Voicemod will turn its Key dongle into a virtual device so it loops back the audio and any iOS or Android apps will then receive the modified voice changing audio as if it were the real microphone. It’s similar to how Voicemod works on macOS or Windows, with virtual audio devices.</p><p>Doppelhammer and the Voicemod team have had to create hardware to solve a software restriction in closed platforms like iOS, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch. You can publish apps on many of these platforms, but Apple, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo don’t let developers get deep access to the audio components.</p><p>I get the sense that Voicemod Key is a solution that Doppelhammer and the team are reluctantly having to build to try and prove to platform holders that they should open up and allow apps like Voicemod.</p><p>Voicemod Key will only work with wired headsets, largely because of the way it captures the audio and modifies it. Proprietary solutions like Xbox Wireless won’t be supported, and the latency of Bluetooth would make a real-time voice changer like Voicemod challenging. Doppelhammer says the “vast majority of our target audience” is more inclined to use a wired headset or have access to one, so he’s not too concerned about the lack of support for wireless headsets at launch.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Voicemod Key hardware will be bundled with subscriptions.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Voicemod</cite></p></div><p>If Voicemod were able to build a native app on Xbox and PlayStation consoles, the wireless problem would be solved. “We don’t want to build our own device. This will enable a lot of conversations, because people will see how it works, what it takes, and that there’s a market,” says Doppelhammer. “This whole thing made me realize one thing: PC and Mac are the only platforms left that are half-way open. Everything else is locked down.”</p><p>Voicemod has grown in popularity in recent years as people look to real-time voice changing software and soundboards to be more expressive in online words like <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Roblox</em>. Voicemod was once a niche app for Twitch streamers, but Voicemod Key aims to bring the software to people who play <em>Fortnite</em> on console or <em>Roblox </em>on a tablet or mobile phone.</p><p>The first version of Voicemod&nbsp;Key, with support for a console mode, will soon be available for <a href="https://www.voicemod.net/vmkey/">registered beta testers</a>. Voicemod is planning to bundle the hardware with its Voicemod Pro subscription, so you won’t need to purchase it separately. The team is targeting a launch later this year in the US, with a second version supporting both console and mobile early next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new game brings back said wormhole-based carnage together with newly "faction-forward" teamplay, and if you want to know what "faction-forward" means when it's at home, I encourage you to stick your whole head into the below crackling cinematic trailer-vortex. I promise nothing bad will happen to it on the other side.</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 sports three factions, each favouring a particular style of quantum superpositional skull-splattery, in addition to new arenas, weapons and modes. We see a bit of that in the trailer: one character has a pop-up holo-shield, another has an electric frisbee, a third keeps things simple with a homing rocket launcher. It's apparently a big step up in production scale from the 2021 game, which the developers characterise as something they slapped together in their pyjamas at a sleepover, using detergent bottles and jam. Since then, 1047 Games have swelled to around 150 people, amongst them veterans of such venerated gunalots as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/halo">Halo</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call Of Duty</a>.</p>
<p>"The original Splitgate's development was ambitious but scrappy; the game was created from a dorm room, and the massive success and community it earned surpassed our wildest dreams," 1047's co-founder and CEO Ian Proulx observes in a release. "This time around, Splitgate 2 has been designed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 to deliver the AAA FPS experience our fans deserve, with the series' signature action completely overhauled by an all-star team composed of the most talented individuals in the industry.</p>
<p>"This is a revolutionary step forward for competitive shooters," he went on. "It's the perfect entry point for players new to the world of Splitgate and a comprehensive upgrade worthy of our existing community." Thank you Mr Proulx, I have filled out my press release bingo card now, though you forgot to tell me how laser-focussed Splitgate 2 is on delivering immersion.</p>
<p>Hark at me and my jadedness! I'm just grumpy because I keep accidentally writing "Slipgate". You'd think I'd be more receptive to the sequel to a game Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-review">tagged with a Bestest Best</a>, summarising it as a "raucous shooter that goes beyond its portal gimmick, with first-rate arenas and gutsy gunfights". For my part, I can only comment that the screens below remind me of Halo's louder map designs. I'll have to give the 2021 game a try.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-has-been-integrated-in-xbox-game-pages-premium-memberships-are-discounted-and-there%E2%80%99s-new-games-too.930630/</guid>

			<p>It's a pretty big GeForce NOW Thursday, as NVIDIA has confirmed that its cloud streaming service has been integrated into Xbox.com game pages, making it even faster and easier to launch supported PC games. As you might recall, a few Xbox users <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-streaming-seems-to-be-available-directly-on-xbox-game-pass-for-certain-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> GeForce NOW on game pages a couple of weeks ago, and it looks like the feature is now officially rolled out to everyone.</p>
<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg, though. NVIDIA is also discounting Premium Memberships for a limited time; both the Priority and the Ultimate tiers are half off until August 18, allowing GeForce NOW users to subscribe for a monthly $4.99 or $9.99, respectively. If you're a regular cloud user, you may want to pick the discounted six-month subscription, which would be $25 for the Priority tier and $50 for the Ultimate tier.</p>
<p>Of course, there's also a wave of nine games added to the library, seven of which have just launched or are launching today.</p>
<p>● The Crust (New release on Steam, July 15)<br>
● Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder (New release on Steam, July 16)<br>
● Nobody Wants to Die (New release on Steam, July 17)<br>
● Dungeons of Hinterberg (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, July 18)<br>
● Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, July<br>
18)<br>
● Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (New release on Steam, July 18)<br>
● Norland (New release on Steam, July 18)<br>
● Content Warning (Steam)<br>
● Crime Boss: Rockay City (Steam)</p>
<p>The highlights of this GeForce NOW round are Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess and Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, which we have recently reviewed favorably:</p>
<p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-night-full-terrors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.5/10</a>) is a breath of fresh air. Despite a slow start, a low challenge level, and an almost non-existent narrative, this action game-meets-tower defense experience is engaging and can be enjoyed by all sorts of players, even those who aren't typically into the genre. Hopefully, the game will turn into a series in the future, and a sequel will address the few shortcomings that hold Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess back a little.</em></p>
<p><em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-accessible-and-fun-soulslite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10</a>) is an enjoyable and highly accessible Soulslite. A44 created a great entry point for the genre, not to mention an exciting fantasy setting that mixes black powder, magic, and influences that go beyond the usual European medieval style. The combat is fun and won't cause you to break any controllers. The story is also worth following, although the game perhaps ends up too soon, leaving narrative and gameplay possibilities to be explored by a sequel.</em></p>

<p>As spotted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-sues-social-media-user-for-excessive-slanderous-and-insulting-comments-against-employee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Eurogamer</a>, Sega has issued a <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/240717_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> via its Japanese site confirming that it reached a settlement against a social media user who harassed an employee.</p>



<p>Loosely translated, the press release explains the individual “made excessive slanderous and insulting comments” against one Sega employee for a long time. </p>



<p>Sega continues that “the subject will pay damages to our employee, delete the slanderous and insulting comments, and refrain from such actions in the future.” It is currently unclear just how extensive the payments are.</p>



<p>Following the settlement, Sega reinforces that “we will continue to take appropriate action based on our Customer Harassment Policy when we judge any behavior to be malicious.” Sega seems prepared to take further legal action when necessary against social media harassment.</p>



<p>Last March, workers at Sega of America became the first staff of a major gaming company to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-workers-become-first-major-gaming-company-to-ratify-union-contract/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ratify a union contract</a>. It spans a variety of offices, and it covers approximately 150 full-time and temporary employees.</p>



<p>However, that same week, Sega also revealed plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-layoffs-studios-hit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lay off hundreds of employees</a> across a wide range of studios. Jurgen Post of Sega said in an email that “we need to respond to the changing economic landscape.”</p>



<p>On the content side, gamers are looking forward to the new Crazy Taxi, which Sega recently revealed will be an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-new-crazy-taxi-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open world multiplayer title</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24200542/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-review-ps5-xbox-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In a world terrorized by gods, <em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</em> sees you step into the vengeful boots of Nor Vanek — armed with a cutlass, a flintlock, and a tiny magic god. The steampunk, open world of Kian needs saving as the armies of the dead flood from a magical doorway. But despite some clever ideas, an intriguing cast with excellent performances, and varied environments, this third-person souls-“lite” action RPG can’t escape the trappings of a clearly limited budget and lack of polish — which is a shame because it could’ve been an excellent way into the genre.</p><p>Players are thrust into the shoes of Nor during a battle that looks like it’s straight from both World War I and every generic dark fantasy. There are soldiers in uniform, with muskets and flintlocks, firing at zombies pouring out from some strange gateway in the distance. There are trenches and barbed wire, helmets on infantry, and medals on generals, while magical beings tear apart Nor’s comrades.&nbsp;</p><p>While the game does an acceptable job of introducing you to its mechanics, it does absolutely nothing when it comes to the setting. Even now, I cannot tell you much about the world. I can’t even tell you what “gods’’ are, aside from the fact that you are tasked with killing them.</p><p>Kills earn Nor reputation points that linger like “souls” or <em>Bloodborne</em>’s Blood Echoes. However, unlike soulsborne games, you can immediately claim the reputation. If you do not claim the reputation, you bolster a multiplier, which exponentially increases how much reputation you then earn, through each subsequent kill. However, if you’re hit even once, you lose it all. It’s a brilliant risk-reward system, balancing the unfairness of losing everything against the safety of immediate usage. You can use reputation points on upgrades, to purchase items, and so on.</p><p>The combat is fast-paced, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23437043/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-sony-ps5">the new <em>God of War</em> games</a>, allowing Nor to use a variety of melee weapons, her flintlock, or a sniper rifle on the fly. She also gains access to magic after she meets an adorable god called Enki. He is in the shape of a cute fox with a soothing voice and wants to assist Nor in her goal of defeating the other gods. Like <em>God of War</em>, you have a constant companion, with whom Nor exchanges charming dialogue, commenting on the world or situation. Their relationship grows from one of distrust to friendship and proved the golden thread for me throughout the experience.&nbsp;</p><p>With Enki as both the source of magic and a wielder himself, combat turns into a balletic foray into weapon usage, dodging, and spells. Unfortunately, unlike soulsbornes or <em>God of War</em>, the animations are stiff and do not feel responsive. Fluidity and timing are key in such games, and the lack of polish isn’t merely “nice to have” but essential, given the split-second decisions and sense of flow constitutive of these experiences. This is especially felt in boss or miniboss fights, or against larger enemies, where their stiff animation is readily apparent.&nbsp;</p><p>The game is also cursed by repetition: similar enemies resulting in similar fights, with only the background changing. Dying and respawning alongside enemies is of course a key staple of soulsborne games, but enemy variety helped undermine sterility. Flintlock does not really have this.&nbsp;</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kepler Interactive</cite></p></div><p>The lack of polish is most damning here. You can see it in the game’s dated graphics, even if the designs remain creative. Stiff animations are compounded by faces that lack expression. The environments — ranging from snowy mountains to rock lands, deep caves to magic arenas — are varied, but it’s hard to ignore the ugly textures, poorly drawn nature, and questionable lighting.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a pity because the game relies a lot on dialogue and interaction with NPCs. For example, Nor travels initially with her surrogate father Baz (with the iconic voice of Elias Toufexis). He’s a merchant and smith of sorts who assists Nor in her travels, having injured himself in an initial foolish raid that led to many soldiers’ deaths. But, due to the poor character details, it was often hard to tell his emotions and feelings. The voice acting did all the lifting.&nbsp;</p><p>The frustration also rests with how the game communicates information. Those of us who suffer through FromSoftware games are used to obfuscation. However, those games don’t rely on dialogue, as they do not even feature a voiced protagonist (unless you count your choice of screaming and ignoring Sekiro for now). But <em>Flintlock</em> drips in dialogue, yet provides no background, introduction, or setup that allowed me to understand who Nor is or what the fight is about.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of that can be conveyed through well-designed cutscenes, with silence and expression doing a lot of work as with Kratos and Atreus in the new <em>God of War</em>. But, because <em>Flintlock</em> does not have that level of polish, we are denied that. Cutscenes are generally spartan and devoid of frills, simply guiding you from one area to the next.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kepler Interactive</cite></p></div><p>I felt like I was playing the sequel to a game that had introduced me to this world and these characters. Like I’d opened up to a late chapter in a thick fantasy book, without a glossary.&nbsp; While it was wonderful uncovering the weird world of Kian, I still felt detached from it.&nbsp;</p><p>I did love that Nor and Enki’s journey to defeat the gods does tangibly change the world. Villages can be rescued from bandits and others, returned — in the blink of an eye, with zero cutscenes — to the people. This opens up merchants and quests. Nor can also recruit NPC who provide permanent bonuses and equipment on her quest.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Flintlock </em>makes for a comfortable introduction to the intimidating soulsborne genre and even creates its own unique spin with its risk-reward mechanic. However, I am hesitant to outright recommend it, given its lack of polish and repetitive play. Its varied environments and the central relationship between Nor and Enki deserve praise, but it doesn’t quite stick the landing for veterans of such action RPGs, let alone for newcomers. </p><p><small>Flintlock <em>launches July 18th on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Why don't we just wait here for a little while, see what happens?</p>

            <p>I've been fumbling for a grasp on Bokeh's skull-splitting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slitterhead">Slitterhead</a> since I first heard the words "brought to you by Keiichiro Toyama, former designer of Silent Hill, Siren and Gravity Rush". Thanks to a new interview, I now have a proper description of the relationship between protagonist and antagonist. Friends, Romans and countrymen: this is a game about a war between two sets of body-stealing monsters, waged in the neon shadows of a fictional East Asian city. It all puts me strongly in mind of a certain John Carpenter movie about squelchy goings-on in Antarctica.</p><!--more-->
<p>Never seen The Thing? A quick summary: it's a creature feature in which a bunch of scientists near the South Pole find that their base has been invaded by an alien monster that can assume the form of whatever it eats, prompting an immediate spiral into foam latex and KY jelly-flavoured chaos. Slitterhead takes the idea, shifts it a few thousand miles north, and swaps out Kurt Russel for a bodiless force, the Hyoki, with the ability to possess human beings and enhance their skills. </p>
<p>You play the Hyoki, and your job is to chase down the Slitterheads - nasty insects who are <em>also</em> able to possess and transform human bodies, but rather more messily. In <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/slitterhead-how-silent-hills-creator-is-building-2024s-craziest-horror-game/">a demo attended by the active and avid folk of VGC</a>, the player begins as a stray dog, recalling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku7qnh261CY">the opening scenes of The Thing</a>, with perhaps a touch of commentary on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/animal-human-disease-kill-epidemic-covid-b2440567.html">real-life zoonotic diseases</a>. Can you pet the dog? Possibly, but I strongly advise that you stay away from dogs in the context of anything remotely influenced by The Thing.</p>
<p>Each hapless host has different capabilities. Some are armed. VGC feels that Slitterhead's combat isn't anything to write home about, despite the ability to warp into a bystander's head for a cheeky backstab, but there are some amusingly grisly mechanics involving traversal and exploration. For example, you can portal through a fence gap to a body on the other side, or leap your current host off a roof so that you can bounce to another in the street below. Toyama says the developers have leaned into the idea of civilians as disposable fodder. "Originally, they were supposed to be powerful, but that proved to be not entertaining," he told the site. Please say that again, Toyama, with a drawn-out, sinister pause between "not" and "entertaining".</p>
<p>My thoughts gravitate immediately and predictably to stealth gameplay. I like the idea of posing as a shopkeeper, eyeing up the clientele for wriggling temples and other symptoms of infestation. Perhaps it'll be like Assassin's Creed's old PvP modes. That said, I'm not sure how amenable Slitterhead will be to such foetid, forensic sandboxing in practice. "One decision we made early in the game was that we originally wanted an open-world setting for the game, but it wasn't reasonable with the budget," Toyama told VGC. "That decision worked well, boxing in the missions and progressing through the storyline."</p>
<p>Here's hoping the neighbourhoods are nicely crowded, at least, because I have seen more Quit/Restart screens than you've had hot dinners, and as such, I'm going to burn through plenty of hosts in my time with Slitterhead, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bokehs-silent-hill-and-siren-esque-slitterhead-gets-release-date-and-new-in-game-trailer">out on November 8th</a>. Take a few cues from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/will-we-ever-get-to-play-one-city-block">Warren Spector's legendary single city block RPG pitch</a>, maybe?</p>

			<p>A Final Fantasy IV high-quality AI movie was recently shared online, and it's so good it could pass for an official adaptation.</p>
<p><em>(Light spoilers for Final Fantasy IV will be found ahead. Avoid reading if you haven't experienced the first few hours of the game.</em></p>
<p>The movie, which was created by the same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AILab.-fv8qb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user</a> behind an earlier<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vi-ai-live-action/"> Final Fantasy VI AI movie</a>, covers the events from the beginning of the game up until Cecil becomes a Paladin, giving viewers a look at some pretty accurate recreations of Cecil, Rosa, Kain, Rydia, Kain, Edward, Tellah, Yang, Palom and Porom. While it is evident even at a glance that it is an AI-created movie, it's still impressive how accurately it depicts characters and events from the classic entry in the Square Enix series.</p>

<p>Unlike the sixth entry in the series, which was only remastered and ported a few times, Final Fantasy IV did get a full 3D remake, originally released on Nintendo DS before being ported to other gaming systems. The 3D remake introduces new gameplay mechanics, CGI cinematics, and voice-acted cutscenes that breathe new life into the classic.</p>
<p>Those looking for a more authentic experience can play the Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster. This remaster is available on PC, PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo Switch, alongside the remasters of the other 2D entries in the series.</p>
