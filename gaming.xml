		<p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> will launch on 25th March for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Want to try it out sooner? Well, there’s a closed beta coming in February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Siren Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5hsuRpMiDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Killing Floor 3 closed beta will take place from 20th-24th February across all platforms, giving Tripwire a great chance to stress test the live launch. You need to sign up for access, which you can do on the <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup">Killing Floor website</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Closed Beta Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RCHPgFjXXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s multiple editions of the game, some region specific, in partnership with Plaion as their distributions partner.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Edition </strong>(MSRP of $39.99) – Available in North America, includes the base game and a pre-order bonus, either the limited timed exclusive Clamefield Patrol Specialist Skins Pack<strong>, </strong>or the Flatline Tactical Bundle (at select retailers).</li>
<li><strong>Day 1 Edition </strong>(MSRP of $39.99/€39.99/£34.99) – Available outside North America, includes the base game, Flatline Tactical Bundle, and Clamefield Patrol Specialist Skins Pack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there’s two digital editions, in addition to a base game version:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deluxe Edition </strong>(MSRP of $59.99) – Includes the Shadow Agent Specialist &amp; Weapon Skin Sets, Launch Nightfall Supply Pass, and 1000 Creds.</li>
<li><strong>Elite Nightfall Edition </strong>(MSRP of $79.99) – Includes everything from the Deluxe Edition plus Year 1 Premium Nightfall Supply Pass Access (four passes) and 3000 Creds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Killing Floor 3 takes the already dark war against the Zeds and jumps forward 70 years from Killing Floor 2, with a new army of Zeds on the march from megacorp Horzine. You’re part of a group known as Nightfall which is trying to fight back.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s all just a wrapper for the 6-player co-op in which you face off against waves of incoming Zeds. There’s six Specialist character classes, each with complimentary abilities and roles, and an array of weapons that you’ll be able to upgrade and adapt, both through the overarching player progression and by buying equipment between waves.</p>
<p>The M.E.A.T. System returns as well, ramped up to give even more guts and gore, which is sure to make wielding a katana rather visceral.</p>
<p>In general, though, fans of horde more games and previous Killing Floor titles will know what to expect from Killing Floor 3. This is a wave-based zombie horde shooter that will keep you on your toes as enemies hound you, forcing you to get around the map, set traps, use the environment, and survive as long as possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s a bad time to be a diehard BioWare fan – or a BioWare employee, for that matter. The house that <em>Dragon Age</em> and <em>Mass Effect</em> helped build is being taken apart piece by piece, with EA <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reallocating employees</a> to its other studios following <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s bumpy landing and <em>Mass Effect 5</em>’s apparently stunted development. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reports</a> that less than 100 people remain at the once-revered studio. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about how it all came to be.</p><p>We’re joined by Kat Bailey, former news director at IGN and current host of the <a href="https://bloodgodpod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axe of the Blood God</a> podcast, to discuss a news week that’s certainly been… interesting. First we talk about the entire staff of long-running video game site God Is A Geek <a href="https://aftermath.site/god-is-a-geek-calvin-robinson-nazi-salute-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quitting after its now-ex-priest owner threw up a Nazi salute</a> at a pro-life conference. Guess you can only get away with that shit if you’re a billionaire.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we dig into BioWare’s recent post-<em>Dragon Age</em> woes, with EA reshuffling some developers into non-BioWare teams and laying off others. Is the next<em> Mass Effect</em> in trouble? And beyond that, does BioWare as we know it have a future?&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, in response to a variation on the age-old question of which Pokemon would taste best to eat, we pose another: Could Moltres die of avian flu?&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can purchase BioWare and give its developers enough money to finally make their dream game, free of needless trend chasing. There will be just one stipulation: No more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeX0scFunQc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">punching reporters</a>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Kat: </strong>Things aren’t super amazing at BioWare right now, unfortunately. From what I’ve heard from people who are connected to it, there are people who are on preproduction for <em>Mass Effect 5</em> – which is still in pre-production because a lot of those folks were working on <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> – and then there are a number of people who are on loan to other teams at the moment, for example <em>Skate</em>. Yeah, remember <em>Skate</em>?&nbsp;</p><p>And then the rest have unfortunately been laid off, including some veterans like the Weekes. Trick Weekes and their partner, Karin, were laid off. Trick Weekes has been around since the original <em>Mass Effect</em> and was I believe the lead writer on <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, among other things. So some notable names from the heyday of BioWare are being let go.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Can you speak to the scope of the layoffs? EA is being very unclear about it.</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> I can’t speak to the actual scope. I can only say that the mood is not amazing at BioWare at the moment. It’s hard to say where they go from here. Not detecting a lot of optimism around <em>Mass Effect 5</em> at the moment either, unfortunately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>EA as a company is kind of in a weird place. If you look at Maxis, Project Rene [the next <em>Sims </em>game] has been spinning its wheels for literally years now. The <em>EA Sports FC</em> fell off quite a bit on the sports front. They’ve got this wild Manhattan Project going on with <em>Battlefield</em>, which encompasses four or five studios, and it’s going to be the everything shooter. They’ve got a lot of franchises on ice, and oh by the way, last year they did a huge presentation that was centered almost entirely around AI.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong><a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-ai-demo-imagination-creation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All of their boxes</a>! They’re very proud of their boxes.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>So much of this mush of “Oh, it’s a live service, it’s a shooter, it’s AI.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It all means nothing. It all sounds vaguely pleasing to investors.</p><p>But yeah, it strikes me as telling of where things are at for BioWare. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> wasn’t a bad game, but neither did it land with the kind of impact they needed. It was yet another mid triple-A game, which is what a lot of triple-A games have been lately as a result of an unwillingness to take risks due to the amount of money invested and the size of audiences they’re trying to attract. All of these games are kind of OK.</p><p><strong>Kat: </strong><em>Dragon Age</em> is an interesting case, because it was in development for something like a decade and was rebooted at least twice. It began as a totally different game, then it became a multiplayer live service game. Then the directors on that ended up departing, and they effectively hit the reset button again. And they were using some of the leftover materials from that version. They were using the tech stack. A lot of what happened with <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is due to the fact that it started its life as a multiplayer game – particularly in the way the hubs and the mission structure ended up working.&nbsp;</p><p>In my view they did their best with what they had, but it was by all accounts quite a grueling production process. They got the entire <em>Mass Effect</em> team to help, and they dragged themselves across the finish line. They put a lot of focus on being as polished as possible, because they were aware that this game would get completely battered and end up in a 50 Metacritic score territory, and instead it ended up in the 80s, which is where they were aiming for.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there was a lot of hope that maybe that would be enough, but it didn’t quite land with the base. The word of mouth around it was mixed, especially around the moment-to-moment writing. Because there wasn’t a huge amount of enthusiasm from the actual community – outside certain elements; my sister platinumed that game – and they were getting hammered by, frankly, <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a hate campaign</a>, it was tough to achieve liftoff. That’s kind of where we ended up with <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, unfortunately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I saw the sales numbers for it. 1.5 million, right?</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> Maybe just under, because they included EA’s subscription service, where people were getting access to it as well. I think the word they were using was “engagements.”&nbsp;</p><p>A lot was riding on <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> in many respects. The eye of Sauron was upon BioWare, and it was kinda known that they had to get this game out and have it do well. What they were able to accomplish by getting it into the 80s was almost a bare minimum “OK, ship a product and have it not be a complete tire fire.” <em>Dragon Age</em> was not a tire fire.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What was the last major game that didn’t have a troubled development cycle or reboot mid-development or change to accommodate whatever the new trend of the day is in a way that ultimately felt half-baked?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> And <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was tremendously successful.</p><p><strong>Kat: </strong>It was developed by a fully independent studio that was not beholden to a publisher and was able to make it on their own timeline, and when they needed to cut off development and get the thing shipped, they did. And it went longer than they expected it to – considerably longer. But they plotted out their runway, and it ended up working. They were making a game that they wanted to play and not necessarily catering to mainstream audiences. What’s the result?<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is one of the most successful games of the last couple years.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics"><h3>James Gunn Can’t Stop Making Suicide Squads</h3></a><p>Groups of freaky little guys are the stuff of comic book history, and maybe the future of comic book movies.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not"><h3>I Am Disgusted By Elon Musk’s Gaming Setup</h3></a><p>Watching these streams hurt me but I have to know: is one of the wealthiest men on earth using a mediocre streaming setup?</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Marking the 25th anniversary of series, EA has re-released the first two games and all their expansion in The Sims: Legacy Collection and The Sims 2: Legacy Collection.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Sims &amp; The Sims 2 Legacy Collections - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QQUMkHngWjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Both are available now ahead of the franchise’s birthday on 4th February, on sale separately or combed in The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle along with The Sims 4 Grunge Revival Kit and The Sims 4 Throwback Kit bundled in with each game respectively.</p>
<p>Both games have been tweaked and updated to help them work with modern Windows 10 and Windows 11 machines.</p>
<p>For The Sims it now supports aspect ratios other than 4:3 and will automatically set itself to your monitor’s aspect ratio on launch. There’s also crisper rendering – though you can cycle through different scaling options with Alt + Enter – and they’ve fixed a handful of crashes and bugs while they’re at it.</p>

<p>The Sims 2 seemingly needed more work to get working, with the following change list:</p>
<ul>
<li>GraphicsRules.sgr now supports modern hardware configurations</li>
<li>Fixed a shadow bug that surrounded Sims with a big black square</li>
<li>Wide screen and higher game resolutions are now supported</li>
<li>UI scales better to higher resolutions</li>
<li>Texture memory corruption and “pink soup” are fixed</li>
<li>Dragging The Sims 2 window from one monitor to another works more smoothly</li>
<li>If your computer has a lot of RAM, The Sims 2 is able to use it</li>
<li>Fixed several crashes</li>
<li>Improvements and fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite this, there’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iej4qa/sims_2_legacy_not_launching_for_me/">plenty of technical complaints with DirectX 9.0c errors</a> for some with The Sims 2 – seemingly high refresh rates and/or resolutions above 1080p don’t play too nice. It’s also quite a shame that, even though it would have taken more work to re-port them to new hardware, there’s no Mac versions for these releases.</p>
<p>Oh, and the IKEA pack is missing from The Sims 2, much to the dismay of quirkily named flat pack furniture fans around the world.</p>

The new turn-based game from Firaxis Games and the titular, legendary designer is set to release on PC and modern consoles in on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224532/civilization-7-release-date-february-2025">February 11th, 2025</a> — over eight years after the last installment.</p><p><em>Civ VII</em> promises to expand the scope of how players can write their own historical fantasy, offering the freedom to mix and match civilizations with different historical figures, such as Hatshepsut reigning over the Roman empire in the Age of Exploration. It’s the kind of game that easily consumes hundreds of hours of playtime, constantly offering new and unexpected ways to engage with its deep city-building systems. Our own Ash Parrish details in her <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24224489/civilization-7-hands-on-demo-impressions-firaxis-games">hands-on impressions</a> how she only managed to scratch the surface in a lengthy three-hour demo.</p><p>Here’s all our coverage of the next major title in the <em>Civilization</em> series.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTM5OTI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24224489/civilization-7-hands-on-demo-impressions-firaxis-games">Civilization 7 lets you mix and match history — and it’s a blast</a></h2><div><p>Imagine Caesar Augustus at the head of an army of Mongol warriors or Ben Franklin building the Great Wall of China. In Sid Meier’s <em>Civilization 7</em>, such flights of historical fantasy can become historical fact. The game has new ages to experience, new civilizations to build up, new leaders to guide them, and — for the first time in franchise history — the ability to mix and match leaders and civilizations to build the empire of your wildest dreams. <em>The Verge</em> had the opportunity to test out the game and talk with its developers at Firaxis Games. The brief, three-hour demo wasn’t enough time to get a feel for how well leaders and different civilizations work together, but I left feeling excited about all the ways <em>Civilization VII</em> aims to change the course of history. </p><p>In previous <em>Civilization </em>games, civs were always tied to a specific leader who was usually, but not always, a noteworthy head of state. Later iterations of the game offered multiple leaders for civs, and on a couple of occasions where it made historical sense, one leader could straddle multiple civs like France and England both having access to Eleanor of Aquitaine, who, during her unusually-long-for-the-time-period life, was the queen of both countries.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24224489/civilization-7-hands-on-demo-impressions-firaxis-games">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Here are the PC requirements for Civilization 7.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471">Check ‘em out</a> to see if your PC can run the game when it comes out on February 11th.

In those scenes, Destiny 2 will enable subtitles by default in order to carry the narrative forward despite the missing audio.

            <p>
John Gonzalez, lead writer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> and Horizon: Zero Dawn, has announced his return to Obsidian Entertainment after 14 years elsewhere in the industry - but not, he suggests, to work on a Fallout: New Vegas 2.
</p>
<p>
Gonzalez originally joined Obsidian in 2008, after a two year stint as lead narrative designer at Ubisoft. He was only with Obsidian for a little over two years, but his impact - as "lead story guy" on the hugely beloved Fallout: New Vegas - was significant. He was responsible for its quest and "most of" its dialogue, introducing characters such as Mr. House and Yes Man.
</p>
<p>
After that, Gonzalez spend two and a half years at Monolith Productions, working as lead narrative designer on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review">acclaimed Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>, and in 2016 he made the move to Guerrilla Games, where he served as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-horizon-zero-dawn-really-be-a-aaa-game-without-cynicism">narrative director on the hugely popular Horizon: Zero Dawn</a> and its sequel. Since then he's worked on a number of smaller projects - including his "ultimate video game novel" God Mode - and now he's come full circle.

<p>
Gonzalez announced his return to Obsidian Enterintament in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnrgonzalez_im-happy-to-share-that-im-starting-a-new-activity-7290785057554767873-EjZ9">brief post on LinkedIn</a>, and his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnrgonzalez/details/experience/">updated profile</a> confirms he's officially joined as the studio's new creative director. As to what he'll be working on, that isn't yet known beyond vague allusions to "exciting times". Gonalez did, however, append a quick note adding, "No, it's not Fallout: New Vegas 2."
</p><p>
Of course, "exciting times" at Obsidian is a tantalising prospect given the studio's usual stellar output - which in recent years has included <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, Grounded, and Pentiment. Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2 are up next for the studio, but it's unlikely Gonalez will have much, if any, involvement with those, seeing as the first is out in three weeks and the second is out this year. All of which suggests he's been drafted in to help imagine Obsidan's next project.
</p>
<p>
The question, though, is whether Gonzalez's attempt to get ahead of the Fallout: New Vegas 2 speculation is genuine or a cheeky bit of misdirection. After all, back in 2022, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-new-vegas-2-reportedly-in-very-early-discussions-at-microsoft-and-obsidian">Obsidian was in "very early" talks with Microsoft</a> to work on a sequel to its much-loved post-apocalyptic RPG, and that there was "a lot of interest to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
Almost three years later, there's been no hint of an update, so it's unclear if those talks were in any way fruitful. But even if Gonzalez <em>hasn't</em> been drafted in to work on a Fallout: New Vegas sequel, there's enough semantic wiggle room in his denial to still leave hope among fans that <em>some</em> form of new Fallout might be on the cards. Still, with Gonzalez having only just joined Obsidian in January, it'll likely be some time before we learn anything more - especially with two big new Obsidian RPGs releasing this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magpie-games-and-failbetter-games-announces-official-fallen-london-ttrpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Failbetter Games has announced a crowdfunding campaign for <em>Fallen London</em>. The campaign isn't for a videogame spin-off but an official <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em> being developed alongside Magpie Games.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>The <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em> was announced <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/failbettergames.bsky.social/post/3lgx6srhssc2a" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Bluesky Social</a> by the official Failbetter Games account. It announced that the Kickstarter campaign will go live on February 11th at 10 AM ET.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-london-ttrpg-clocktower-artwork.jpg?itok=mQPhsOrv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-london-ttrpg-clocktower-artwork.jpg?itok=NIK-F_N9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, if you sign up for their official newsletter, you will receive a Quickstart Guide for the game. This guide contains six premade characters, the core rules, and a playable adventure titled "The Disappearance of the Transfigured Poet."</p>

<p>The official Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magpiegames/fallen-london-the-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> promotes additional incentives for the <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em>. In addition to several physical products, the core rulebook, a GM screen, custom six-sided dice, etc., stretch goals include digital items for your character in the Fallen London browser game. Lastly, those who back the campaign in the first 48 hours will get a physical Devilbone Die at no additional charge.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-london-ttrpg-physical-goods-image.jpg?itok=heEsoobO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-london-ttrpg-physical-goods-image.jpg?itok=ewkYTL2- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The campaign doesn't state what system the <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em> will run on. However, given Magpie's track record of adapting properties like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/avatar-legends-republic-city-supplement-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/root-tabletop-rpg-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Root</em></a>, there's a good chance it will use the Powered by The Apocalypse system. A mechanically light, story and character-centric system where players just roll 2d6 to resolve challenges.</p>

<p><em>Fallen London</em> made its debut in 2009, originally under the name <em>Echo Bazaar</em>, as a browser-based interactive narrative game. The game was packed with branching story decisions, involved <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallen-london-to-conclude-ambition-storylines" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ambition Quests</a>, and in-depth worldbuilding of a version of Victorian London that had sunken into a vast cavern under the Earth called the Neath.</p>

<p>In this new suberranean home, London changed into something twisted. The city streets twisted into a labyrinth, inhuman creatures arrived trading in esoteric goods like human souls. and even physical law itself has faded in this state of darkness. The original experience is still receiving new quests and updates to this day.</p>

<p>Alongside the impressive longevity of this main game, Failbetter Games has developed other titles set in the Fallen London universe. These include the shipfaring horror game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sunless-sea-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sunless Sea</em></a>, the sequel <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/sunless-skies-fallen-london-anniversary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sunless Skies</em></a>, and the visual novel <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mask-of-rose-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mark of the Rose</em></a>.</p>

It’s since been followed by survival sim <em>Grounded </em>and the Renaissance detective RPG <em>Pentiment</em>, with <em>Avowed</em> arriving next month and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> expected by the end of the year.

Will it be the team’s next big RPG franchise, or a completely different genre mash-up that explores new territory for the studio? I’ll be happy with whatever it might be, as long as it arrives sometime this decade. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>BioWare’s headcount is . According to a new report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, the company now sits at less than 100 employees after having over 200 people just two years ago.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODM1MTgzMSwiZXhwIjoxNzM4OTU2NjMxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUVlXVThUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.91ztnslkcG02JwTwRRfVCXIJp8FOdqGBjCNQgz-bE8k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The report says</a> that a number of employees who were put “temporarily” on new teams were informed that those moves were permanent. No longer were they BioWare employees helping out in a different area. </p>

<p>“If they want to work at BioWare again in the future, they would have to look for job openings and re-apply,” Schreier writes. He adds that, for now at least, a small team will  work on the next game in the Mass Effect series. This team is being led by “company veteran who oversaw the development on the original trilogy as well as on 2019’s&nbsp;Anthem”. The goal is to then expand as needed later on in production.</p>







<p>As sources told Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-moves-some-employees-to-other-ea-projects-while-developing-mass-effect-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the memo</a> from BioWare was released, there is still an internal evaluation being done in order to see where things can be improved. There is still a worry from those who spoke under the condition of anonymity that more layoffs and moves within the studio are coming.</p>



<p>Neither EA nor BioWare have responded to multiple requests for comment on the state of things at the studio.</p>

He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>A popular <em>Bloodborne </em>framerate mod is no longer available thanks to a DMCA takedown request from Sony. Australia-based Twitch streamer Lance McDonald first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0tqppZDYxw">developed the mod back in 2020</a> before <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1359037954576928769?mx=2">making it available to download in 2021</a>. Lance <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1885347693125566806">announced today in a post on X</a> that Sony Interactive Entertainment asked them to remove download links for the patch.</p></div><p>The hack’s sole purpose was to get <em>Bloodborne </em>running at a smoother 60 fps with improved frame pacing. FromSoftware originally released <em>Bloodborne</em> back in 2015 for the PlayStation 4, and the game has always been locked at 30 fps with occasional stuttering from inconsistent pacing (the 30 frames within each second were not always on-screen for equal amounts of time). The beloved game’s graphical limitations have persisted even on the PS4 Pro and while playing it via backwards compatibility on the PlayStation 5.</p><p>Lance’s mod has received its share of testing and praise from the “Soulsbourne” community that covet FromSoftware games but wish their technical and graphical chops were more cutting-edge. This includes being spotlighted by creators like Digital Foundry, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hDIvDPRcPA">interviewed McDonald about his hack back in 2020</a>, used his mod to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOn2ludP6gM">a 4K / 60 fps representation on PS5 using AI upscaling</a>, and recently published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zjzBbdl7hk"><em>Bloodborne</em> PS4 emulation video</a> that really juices up the performance and has an extra-spicy video thumbnail aimed squarely at Sony.</p><p>For years, the most rabid of <em>Bloodborne </em>fans have been quick to jump at any <em>Bloodborne</em>-related news as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173905/sony-teases-bloodborne-in-astros-playroom-update-hours-ahead-of-summer-game-fest">a potential clue</a> to an upcoming, long-awaited remake. And in this case, it only takes a short scroll of McDonald’s replies on his post to see people speculating that this takedown means Sony <em>must </em>be nearing some kind of announcement in time for the 10-year anniversary of <em>Bloodborne’s</em> release. Or, perhaps, Sony is just taking a page from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Nintendo’s playbook</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Clash, introduced in season 12, is <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s newest game mode. As director Aaron Keller describes it, the mode was inspired by the original hero shooter’s two-point capture maps, and was meant to give players a mode in which they could shift rapidly between attacking and defending objectives. After feedback from players, however, Blizzard has decided to temporarily remove it from the game’s ranked play in season 15.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,196049" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24167662/director-s-take-looking-back-and-looking-ahead/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24167662/director-s-take-looking-back-and-looking-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Director’s Take blog</a></span>, Keller says that the team wants to reexamine the Clash mode and see if it can make it feel more fair.

If one team manages to steamroll another and keep that momentum going, a Clash match can end almost as quickly as it began. This is unlike most <em>Overwatch 2</em> modes in which, even if you start the match on the wrong foot, you feel like regrouping with your team for a coordinated push can still win you the round. While the team sorts out what changes it wants to make, Clash will stay in quickplay rotation, meaning you can still play the mode if you’re not trying to climb up the ranks. Fans seem pretty jazzed about this, as several have found Clash to be lopsided and frustrating. Keller’s full explanation reads as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Speaking of game modes, we want to take a moment on what to expect for Clash in Quick Play and Competitive. This past year, we introduced Clash, which was inspired by the original Assault maps, but gave players a chance to attack and defend throughout the course of the match. Clash has had some really good matches, but we’ve also seen a lot of constructive feedback. Right now, Clash has a few problems, with some matches having a team steamroll and ending much faster than a typical <em>Overwatch</em> game. It can also be confusing as to which point is active for some players. So starting in Season 15, Clash maps are going to be removed out of Competitive Play, as we take the time to look at these maps and work to find ways to deliver the best Competitive experience for all of our players. We’ll keep you updated on the progress we make there. In the meantime, we are going to keep Clash in Quick Play and other unranked game modes. </p></blockquote><p><em>Overwatch 2</em>’s 15th season begins on February 18, which will be shortly after Blizzard hosts the <em>Overwatch 2 </em>Spotlight event on February 12. The team is promising something big for the game, which it desperately needs right now as it’s been struggling to regain lost ground after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>blew up in December.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Warner Bros. is holding up the cartoon white flag and saying “That’s all Folks!” to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, with support for the character-filled brawler coming to an end after Season 5 on 30th May 2025. On that date, the game will be removed from online stores and servers will be shut down, but it will still be playable offline.</p>
<p>All online features will run up until 30th May at 9AM PST (5PM UK time), after which point the game will be playable offline only, with solo AI battles or couch multiplayer with up to four players.</p>


<p>In order to keep the game accessible, you must play and log in at some time during Season 5 – from 4th February to 30th May – which will create the necessary save file and online account links to allow you to play offline with all earned and purchased content.</p>
<p>As a precursor to the game’s shutdown, real money purchases have been taken down from today. You can no longer purchase Gleamium, though it and character tokens can be used through to the server shutdown.</p>
<p>For more information, you can visit the <a href="https://go.wbgames.com/MVSFAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus Season 5 FAQ.</a></p>

<p>The MultiVersus team at Player First Games wrote a little thank you at the end of the announcement:</p>
<p>Most importantly, we want to thank every player and person who has ever played or supported MultiVersus. All of us on the Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games teams have poured our heart and soul into this game. We will be forever grateful for the incredible support of the MultiVersus community throughout this journey.​</p>
<p>&nbsp;​We hope that you all enjoy the final Season of MultiVersus.</p>
<p>MultiVersus burst onto the scene in 2022, offering a Super Smash Bros. contender filled with characters drawn from across the Warner Bros. media empire. However, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/27/multiversus-open-beta-already-smashing-steam-records/">after an initial surge of popularity for the open beta</a>, the rapidly growing community started to highlight gameplay deficiencies and developer Player First Games struggled to keep up, while also producing all the regular content that a free-to-play live service needs.</p>
<p>So the game was pulled from storefronts, instead of trying to roll through to a full release, and only reappeared last year.&nbsp;While the revamp has certainly benefitted MultiVersus in some respects, Miguel wasn’t overly enamoured by the game’s return last month <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/multiversus-2024-preview-back-but-is-it-better/">in his write-up</a>. On one hand some of the game’s rough edges have been rounded off and the inclusion of singleplayer/co-op content helps bolster the overall MultiVersus package. However, the reduced tempo of combat has proven divisive and when it comes to monetisation, the game is no less aggressive.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. admitted in financial reports that MultiVersus’ revival had underperformed expectations, so alongside <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">the end of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, the writing was on the wall.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping Player First Games get the opportunity to craft something new and fun.</p>

			<p>It's not been a secret that the games market has been struggling for a while now, with there being constant layoffs and studio closures all across the globe, whether it be from people not playing the games, not wanting them, or just simply being unable to afford them. It's becoming increasingly common that games are getting more expensive, meaning people may not be able to find the money to purchase them, especially in a cost-of-living crisis. Despite these factors, it's been said that the games market will grow by 4.6% in one with inflation. This information comes from <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MiDiA Research</a>'s Global Games Forecasts.</p>
<p>One of the key points that is mentioned is that the games market is mature, so it is highly unlikely that it will ever experience double-digit growth, and instead, the industry will only see slight growth during this period. It's also estimated that software revenues will continue to grow thanks to massive premium releases coming out this year. This includes Grand Theft Auto 6, Monster Hunter Wilds, and the games that will be released for the Nintendo Switch 2 when that inevitably releases.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, there are a ton of live-service games, with major developers deciding to try their luck with live-service games and not having the expected outcome. This has happened with multiple titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">Concord</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/">MultiVersus</a>. However, it's predicted that instead of developing live-service games, developers will go back to premium games, with in-game spending decreasing to 67% near 2031.</p>
<p>"It is time to say goodbye to "survive 'til 25" and hello to "stick 'til 26" and beyond, but with tempered expectations for future growth in this mature market. The market (again, also including hardware, software, and subscriptions) will grow from $236.9 billion in 2025 to $280.1 billion in 2031," says Rhys Elliott, Games Analyst at MiDiA Research.</p>
<p>While there will always be a debate within the gaming community about whether mobile gaming makes you a gamer, mobile continues to do a significant amount of lifting for software revenue, with 54% of all software revenue coming from mobile games. The significant premium games being released this year will also be a huge boost for revenue, especially with games like Monster Hunter Wilds, Civilization VII, and Assassin's Creed Shadows all being released in Q1.</p>
<p>"Things will continue to be difficult in the games market, and these challenging market conditions mean developers are being forced to think smarter to succeed. Luckily, the industry is teeming with some of the smartest, most creative, and passionate minds in the world," says Elliott.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since James Gunn became the new boss of DC studios, it feels like he sticks to one formula: everything looks like his Suicide Squad.&nbsp;</p><p>2008, the year of the housing crisis and the subsequent Great Recession, is as good a time of death as any for the fiction of the American Dream. Economic forces manipulated by kleptocrats have completely unbalanced our received wisdom that anyone, regardless of their station and prestige, was afforded the opportunity to rise to success. But you can’t really kill a dream in America; you can only commodify it. That same year, the American Dream was reborn, repurposed, and repackaged by corporate America. Not for people, but for a new promise that any <em>property, </em>afforded the opportunity, could rise to prominence.&nbsp;</p><p>Marvel Studios’ “Avengers Initiative” was a project built from necessity. Facing bankruptcy in the 90s, Stan Lee and pals found themselves selling off the film rights to their most successful characters<em>—</em>Spider-Man, X-Men, the Fantastic Four<em>—</em>just to stay afloat. All they were left with once they had the chance to make a go of it themselves were the B-Stringers: an alcoholic tech bro, an Allied Propaganda mascot, a technically public domain anyway Norse god, a Hulk. To everyone’s multi-billion dollar surprise, they made it work. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They made it work so well that it kind of ruined movies.</a> But, significantly, it defeated the conventional comic book movie wisdom that to make a huge runaway hit, you needed a Superman or a Batman. Maybe you could build your empire on some weird little freak nobody’s even heard of. But how weird, how freaky, can we really get here?</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>James Gunn became one of the most successful men in Hollywood today answering that question. Coming up with the proudly sophomoric and sloppy underdogs of Troma Entertainment (think <em>Toxic Avenger</em>), he made his studio bones on a couple pretty decent <em>Scooby-Doo </em>movies, and proved his superhero bona fides on the pitch black Rainn Wilson and Elliot Page comedy <em>Super, </em>which does a better job of being a <em>Watchmen </em>movie than Zack Snyder’s <em>Watchmen</em>. So it was only a matter of time before Marvel Cinematic Universe mastermind Kevin Feige, known so well today for his modus operandi of taking promising, unique independent filmmakers and chaining them like Prometheus to his studio system, tapped him to make something Marvel.&nbsp;</p><p>Feige had been talking in public about adapting the rather obscure ragtag Marvel space heroes, the “Guardians of the Galaxy,” since at least 2010 during that year’s San Diego Comic-Con. Though the team had existed in some form or another since 1969, the version of the team that Feige was interested in—the one we’d see at the movies—was brand new. The Guardians as we know them, Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon, didn’t actually exist as a team anywhere until 2008, in a series relaunch by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. No stranger to working as the underdog, it was just the project where James Gunn would thrive.</p><p>How DC got their hand on that ball was a matter of some cancel culture serendipity. During the space between the second and third <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>movies, <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/07/james-gunn-fired-guardians-of-the-galaxy-disney-offensive-tweets-1202430392/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some outrageously tasteless tweets</a> James Gunn wrote ten years prior resurfaced. Disney, the owners of the Marvel Studios brand since 2009, cut ties with Gunn over it for about a week<em>—</em>just long enough for DC’s own parent company, Warner Bros., to swoop in with their own Guardians-caliber offer. But who were DC’s equivalent to Marvel’s scrappy Guardians of the Galaxy?</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="THE SUICIDE SQUAD – Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jz1FrtMIh5c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That was was a puzzle DC had already solved, poorly but accurately, with the Academy Award winning 2016 <em>Suicide Squad </em>(Best Makeup and Hairstyling). The influences Gunn had on what Warner Bros. wanted their Suicide Squad to be were apparent to anyone with eyes, ears, or a short term memory: the needle dropping soundtrack, the gleeful gore, the often puerile comedy. But without Gunn himself, the film had none of the heart, or sense of character. Unlike the Guardians, the Squad as we know them today—give or take a Harley—has existed with its current premise since 1986. And as fortune would have it, they’re even better suited to Feige’s original hail mary casting of the Guardians for unleashing the spigot on that IP-flowing fountain. Because that’s exactly what they were designed for 40 years ago.</p><p>Here’s something I often find myself writing when we’re talking about comics: let’s go back to <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths. </em>In 1985, DC Comics published their first major crossover event to clear the decks on 50 years of crufted up comic book continuity, all to present a less intimidating face to new readers. One benefit of this was, with nearly every character starting over on equal footing, it didn’t just have to be Batman and Superman rising to the fore. There were new opportunities for the thousands of characters starting fresh right alongside them. It was to this end that John Ostrander and Len Wein created a new vehicle to showcase the obscurities of DC’s roster, giving them new cause to get in front of readers’ eyes: a new, Post-Crisis incarnation of the Suicide Squad.</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>The original Suicide Squad, a team which appeared in issues of <em>The Brave and the Bold </em>in the late 50s and early 60s, wasn’t much more than a riff on Jack Kirby’s Challengers of the Unknown. But in the 1986 <em>Legends </em>miniseries, setting up much of the early status quo for the Post-Crisis DC Universe, Wein and Ostrander took the concept in an entirely new direction—one which, under the complex, authoritative figure of Amanda Waller, would feature a rotating team of cast-off villains, forgotten heroes, and former supporting characters. Not just the likes of lesser Batman and Flash villains like Deadshot and Captain Boomerang, but heroes like Vixen, whose own solo title was preemptively aborted in a 1978 industry crunch; Bronze Tiger, blaxploitation martial arts sidekick to Dennis O’Neil’s <em>Richard Dragon, Kung-Fu Fighter</em>; Enchantress, a former backup feature to Supergirl; and Nightshade, part of a collection of characters recently acquired from the defunct Charlton Comics which DC sought to integrate into their own Post-Crisis universe.</p><p>The resulting spin-off, 1987’s <em>Suicide Squad, </em>thus became one of the most versatile titles in DC’s catalog. Amanda Waller’s nuanced morality allowed for the team, depending on its roster, to take on missions from either side of the morality spectrum at any level of scale, from quelling small town white nationalists to grappling with the forces of Darkseid on Apokolips. Following in the tradition of the Golden Age Justice Society of America, whose <em>All-Star Comics </em>in the 1940s was functionally a home for heroes to stay in the spotlight without titles to call their own, <em>Suicide Squad </em>literally served as a rehabilitation clinic not just in fiction as sentence-reducing labor for its incarcerated members, but for the images of those characters themselves, elevating what might have once been a C or a D list character as high as a B. As Iron Man—nobody’s favorite superhero before 2008—would prove to the world, a B is really all you need.</p><p>So, James Gunn does <em>The Suicide Squad, </em>a loose sequel to the previous non-definite articled <em>Suicide Squad </em>that doesn’t require you to watch the first film at all. Not a lot of people watched this one either, but most were charitable in affording that to the continued horrors of a deadly pandemic, and HBO Max’s short-sighted year long “Same Day Streaming” policy which had filmmakers none too pleased. Critically, it was the fifth-best reviewed DC film of all time.</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>If anything made <em>The Suicide Squad </em>work, it was the massive number of weirdos at play. Some pulled from the deepest benches of DC history, like Javelin and The Weasel; some invented for the story, like The Detachable Kid and Ratcatcher 2. Like the first movie, much of it revolved around Harley Quinn—a character who was at first controversially associated with the Suicide Squad franchise in the 2011 “New 52” comic relaunch, and 14 years later is still more often than not the series star. Unlike the previous film, <em>The Suicide Squad </em>gave emotional arcs to its less prominent players. The likes of Polka-Dot Man, King Shark, and even the generally Squad-ubiquitous but dry-toast-bland Rick Flag all got their own beats that elevated them into new favorites.</p><p>One character, a comic relief turned third act villain, would be the focus of Gunn’s next DC project. John Cena’s Peacemaker was credibly both hilarious and threatening, but we never got to know the man under the helmet like we did the other central members of the team. The legend goes that Gunn spent one week during production of <em>The Suicide Squad </em>banging out a full 8 episode script for a <em>Peacemaker </em>TV show. It was greenlit right away.</p><p>The internet loved <em>Peacemaker</em>, with its <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/peacemaker-dance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modern dance intro</a> and stream-of-consciousness dialogue. But despite the title, Gunn always insisted that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/peacemaker-was-a-comic-book-show-in-all-the-right-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Peacemaker </em>was an ensemble piece</a>. And it was! Just as important as Peacemaker’s own story arc reckoning with his Neo-Nazi father who pushed him into vigilantism is his brilliant supporting cast of Amanda Waller’s estranged daughter, Leota Adebayo; put-upon Belle Reve warden turned problem asset babysitter John Economos; disguised alien agent on the side of humanity, Clemson Murn; James Gunn’s wife, who is fine; and an autistically swagged up incarnation of Marv Wolfman’s Vigilante. James Gunn had created another Suicide Squad.</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2022, as we were all still doing the <em>Peacemaker </em>cast’s “Do You Wanna Taste It” dance, Warner Bros. did something extremely rare: they made a good decision. With the future direction of the DC cinematic universe in shambles after power plays from Zack Snyder, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and a seemingly endless cascade of otherwise bad reviews, the corporate leadership turned to the one guy who, if you at least looked at it accepting the outside influence of a pandemic, hadn’t fucked it all up. Along with his established business partner Peter Safran, James Gunn was put in charge of what would now be called “DC Studios.” Where none had really existed before, Gunn and Safran would be DC’s own Kevins Feige.</p><p>James Gunn got to work announcing a full slate of new DC projects. The very first would be an animated series which just wrapped up on HBO Max: <em>Creature Commandos</em>, a series about a team of misfit monsters embarking on a suicide mission for Amanda Waller<em>. </em>It was yet another Suicide Squad. He announced a film adaptation of Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch’s <em>The Authority, </em>a team of morally ambiguous superhumans who do the things heroes won’t. Another Suicide Squad. Even <em>Superman</em>, the live action film DC has pinned all its hopes on as the ground claimed by superhero movies for a decade gives way to video game movies, is full of weird superheroes: Hawkgirl, Metamorpho, Mister Terrific, and Guy Gardner, the most obnoxious Green Lantern. Anyone familiar with the mythology of the Justice League can recognize what Gunn is doing: setting up his own simulacrum of Keith Giffen and JM DeMatteis’ most irreverent vision of the team, Justice League International, a collective of third-stringers cast in the shadow of the more famous heroes they couldn’t get. That’s right. It’s another Suicide Squad.</p><p>So why does this keep happening? Is it the only move Gunn has? I don’t think so. He’s proven himself a more versatile filmmaker than that. But imagine you’re wagering hundreds of millions of dollars on the success of a film. That’s going to make it difficult to break the mold, and make a risky decision. You’re going to stick with what works until it doesn’t. And so far, at least critically, what seems to work for Gunn is Suicide Squads. We’ll see if that bears out in real dollars, but it’s a better bet than a complete unknown.</p><p>From a creative standpoint, it’s not a bad thing either. The best thing about DC Comics, when it gets out of its own way, is that it’s not actually the Batman and Superman Company. It’s a publishing house filled with strange, imaginative, often contradictory characters and concepts, which really buzzes at its best when you get those A-Listers out of the way. There are 30,000 freaks and weirdos who live together in this universe created by hundreds of creative voices over 90 years of work, and the absurdity of their coexistence compounds that exponentially. This is comics. It’s Suicide Squad.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea"><h3>BioWare Is In Big Trouble</h3></a><p>"A lot was riding on Dragon Age: The Veilguard"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not"><h3>I Am Disgusted By Elon Musk’s Gaming Setup</h3></a><p>Watching these streams hurt me but I have to know: is one of the wealthiest men on earth using a mediocre streaming setup?</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Fortnite OG has officially entered the next phase, going into Chapter 1, Season 2. There have been some re-added points of interest that are bound to get the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-og-sees-a-million-active-players-in-first-20-minutes/">nostalgia flowing</a> for those long-term Fortnite players, while others will get to experience the beginning of Fortnite for the first time. This, of course, includes places like Tilted Towers and Shifty Shafts. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/go-full-tilt-into-fortnite-og-chapter-1-season-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other memorable areas</a>, such as Junk Junction, Haunted Hills, and Snobby Shores, have returned to the game after being gone for a while. If you want to see what to expect from the new season, you can check it out in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Go Full Tilt - Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 2 is Live!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9b543Z6aus?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since it's a new season, a new battle pass comes along with it. The all-new OG Pass is out, offering players 45 tiers of rewards that are based on iconic moments throughout Chapter 1 Season 2. This includes items that are inspired by Sparkle Specialist and Black Knight, which were outfits that OG players would have been able to get in the original Chapter 1 Season 2 Battle Pass. It also includes the Cuddle Team Leader, which was an outfit that first came out during Chapter 1 Season 2.</p>
<p>This battle pass functions exactly the same as the other battle passes that are available in the game. You just have to play the game and get XP in any Fortnite experience, which will then add up and allow you to claim rewards across the battle pass. The OG pass is a single track combining both free and premium rewards. You can either purchase the pass for 1,000 V-Bucks or get it by subscribing to Fortnite Crew. The Season ends on March 25, giving you plenty of time to get your games in and unlock the rewards on the pass.</p>
<p>The loot pool has been expanded, introducing gear from the classic Chapter 1 Season 2, including items such as Cozy Campfire, Chug Jug, and Suppressed Pistol.</p>
<p>Alongside this event, the Valentine 2025 update has gone live in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life, where you can wander around town spreading love and gaining the ability to earn a Cupid's Surprise. You can also get Flowers, Love Letters, and Heart Wands as gifts to give out. This update also comes with new daily activities that you can participate in. The<a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-brick-life-the-valentines-2025-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> full details</a> have been posted on the official Fortnite website, where you can read all about it. The Valentine's event is due to end on February 21.</p>

                <p>Just over four years ago, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-acquires-esports-tournament-platform-smashgg/1100-6485077/" data-ref-id="1100-6485077">purchased the esports tournament organizing platform</a> Start.gg, which was then known as Smash.gg before its rebranding. Now, Start.gg has announced that Microsoft no longer owns the site and stated that it will "be returning to its roots as an independent company supporting grassroots and professional esports communities."</p><p>Chris Ogle--the co-founder of Smash.gg--shared the news on <a href="https://blog.start.gg/start-gg-returns-to-its-roots-816f31962d3b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Medium</a> and thanked Microsoft and Xbox for their support. He also noted that the site will continue with members from the original Smash.gg team alongside "grassroots tournament organizers, and engineers who are passionate about improving the platform for the communities we support."</p><p>One of the biggest changes going forward is that starting on February 14, Start.gg will be charging a registration fee to support the expenses of running the site. In addition to making that change for the sustainability of the business, Start.gg will be upgrading its user interface and tournament support.</p><p>"Since our inception back in 2015, our goal has always been to foster esports communities around the games people love to play," wrote Ogle. "This goal remains at the heart of everything we do, and we look forward to continuing our journey with you."</p><p>Despite some downward trends in the gaming industry, esports remain popular. Last year's Evo 2024 was officially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evo-2024-is-officially-the-largest-esports-competition-ever/1100-6524526/" data-ref-id="1100-6524526">the largest esports competition ever</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evo-2025-lineup-includes-street-fighter-6-marvel-vs-capcom-2-and-the-next-fatal-fury/1100-6528830/" data-ref-id="1100-6528830">Evo 2025</a> will look to maintain that momentum when it returns to Las Vegas between August 1-3.</p>
