The segment may have come about from producers reading <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/15/theres-no-stress-gamers-go-offline-in-retro-console-revival&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/15/theres-no-stress-gamers-go-offline-in-retro-console-revival" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repeated</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/02/why-are-younger-generations-embracing-the-retro-game-revival&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/02/why-are-younger-generations-embracing-the-retro-game-revival" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stories</a></span> about the resurgence of retro gaming in <em>The Guardian</em>. Who doesn’t love a nice trip down memory lane back to the ‘80s and ‘90s, when gaming was still a novel escape from the drudgery of life and not associated with the battle cries of the worst people you’ve ever encountered online?</p><p>But the segment went off the rails immediately when the camera zoomed in on the props: a ZX81, a Nintendo Wii, and a SNES with an NES cartridge stuffed into it. There’s no way to harp on this without reinforcing the worst <em>Simpsons</em> comic book guy stereotypes, but, I mean, come on folks. This is like stuffing a VHS tape into a DVD player. I hope anyone planning to get back into retro gaming took it as a helpful warning of what not to do. <br></p><p>“As Nick shared on the programme, it’s no surprise that older titles and classic consoles are back in demand,” UKIE posted on LinkedIn. “Retro gaming taps into a powerful sense of nostalgia and community, offering players a way to reconnect with their past and share the games they loved with a new generation.”</p><p>The organization later distanced itself from the retro gaming debacle. “For transparency, the studio team set up the in-studio display independently and handled the placement of the consoles—unfortunately, we couldn’t adjust it whilst on air,” a spokesperson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-want-to-report-a-crime-bbc-mocked-for-its-wonky-nintendo-setup/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-want-to-report-a-crime-bbc-mocked-for-its-wonky-nintendo-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>VGC</em></a></span>.<br></p><p>In fairness, the SNES’s lack of backwards compatibility <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTzyz2TgGls&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTzyz2TgGls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confounded news broadcasters</a></span> back when it came out as well. The fact that it couldn’t “mix-and-match” games with the NES was seen as part of Nintendo’s uphill battle to sell parents on a pricey next-gen upgrade. That’s a problem the Switch 2 doesn’t have. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bbc-mario-bros-nes-snes-retro-gaming-switch-2-1851786266]]></content:encoded>

In the game’s recreation of <em>THPS 3</em>'s iconic Canada level, someone has been removed: The dude pissing off the edge of the map. I decided to reach out to the developers at Iron Galaxy to get to the bottom of this very important issue. We also talked about other stuff, too, I guess. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,195618,196358" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First up, I had to know, why did Iron Galaxy remove the pissing man from Canada? Is this some grand conspiracy? What’s going on? Well, according to Iron Galaxy, the pissing man wasn’t removed from <em>THPS 3+4</em>. But he does have better bladder control. </p><p>“Overall, we’ve made a few changes to the game so we could cast skating in a more positive light,” said Kurt Tillmanns, <em>THPS 3+4</em>'s director. “Our old Canadian friend is not gone, he has just learned some much-needed bladder control. There is even a pro goal where you can help him hydrate.” </p><p>When I asked about other changes players have spotted in <em>THPS 3+4</em>, like a ramp being in a different spot or an area being slightly re-themed, Tillmans said that the studio’s main goals for levels are to make something “cooler” and “more fun.” </p><p>“Our goals for environment design are to create a visual spectacle and provide interesting opportunities to skate. Those two motivations inform all our decisions,” said Tillman.</p><h2 id="h6692"><a id=""></a>Missing levels and big changes</h2><p>Speaking of changes, the biggest and most controversial change (besides the ever-important presence of the pissing dude) was to<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836"> how <em>THPS 4</em>'s levels work in the remake</a></span>. They aren’t open-world anymore and instead work like <em>THPS 3</em>'s levels, with two-minute timers and a list of goals to complete in that time. I asked if there were ever plans to do the <em>THPS 4</em>'s levels as open-world playspaces, but it was never an option. </p><p>“We set out to create a game that joins and embodies the best of what both of the classic games offered. The two-minute timer is the emblematic<em> Tony Hawk</em> gameplay loop,” said Tillman. “Players who aren’t as interested in that can customize the length of the timer, up to an hour. Many goals from <em>THPS 4 </em>return, and we can share goals and gameplay across both titles, bringing gameplay like Skitchin’ and COMBO goals to the <em>THPS 3 </em>parks. We feel that this best-of-both-worlds approach is a benefit to both games.” </p><p>And while the new levels—like Waterpark—in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-photo-mode-option-tool-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1851786140&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-photo-mode-option-tool-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1851786140"><em>THPS 3+4</em></a></span> are good, I had to ask about the missing levels, like<em> THPS4</em>'s Chicago. According to Tillman, they were cut as part of the process for delivering a “unique experience rather than just a predictable remaster.” </p><p>“When it came to rebuilding the parks from the ground up, we prioritized the ones that seemed to be the favorites, according to the community consensus. Passing on Chicago and Carnival freed us up to build Waterpark, Pinball, and Movie Studio, the first brand-new [<em>THPS</em>]<em>&nbsp;</em>parks in over a decade.”</p><p>Oh, and here’s Tillman’s full response about Eric Sparrow appearing in the game for all big fans of Tony Hawk’s Underground. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Every game needs a villain. We just thought this would be a fun callback to the <em>Underground</em>. A lot of time has passed, so this is a chance to find out the path he has led himself down with his treacherous ways.</p></blockquote><p>Hmmmm.... That’s not confirmation of <em>Underground </em>getting a full remake one day, but at least it’s nice to know the devs behind <em>THPS 3+4</em> know their Tony Hawk lore. Looking forward, Iron Galaxy still has an “opportunity to update the game post-launch.” We know at least one change that will be made in a future update, as the developer confirmed after this interview that it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-banjo-guitar-hero-easter-egg-trash-1851786211&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-banjo-guitar-hero-easter-egg-trash-1851786211">going to remove a joke from the Waterpark level.</a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re watching like a hawk as players drop back into the parks. We still have an opportunity to update the game post-launch, so we’ll keep an eye on their feedback.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-peeing-guy-canada-level-removed-censor-1851786232]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I spent about 35 hours in <em>Hitman World of Assassination</em> this past weekend—interrupted mostly by the non-optional need to sleep and occasional concerns over the health of my GPU running for so long in a non-air conditioned apartment room in New York City in the summer. But I was determined to find out if the Agent 47 experience could really satisfy the stealth nerd in me. As it turns out, I’ve been so, <em>so </em>wrong to neglect modern <em>Hitman</em>’s potential as a third-person stealth game; I thought it fell drastically short in that regard, but in fact it’s quite capable of delivering the hide-and-seek thrills I came to love in games like <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,197541,196013" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I blame my failure to recognize the freedom to go off-script and sneak around like Sam Fisher on the way the game foregrounds certain specific approaches you can take to each hit, which come with defined objectives that had me waiting around for the right costume to reveal itself, or for some waiter to leave an unattended glass nearby so I could slip some poison into it at just the right time. As I milled around waiting on these narrowly defined opportunities, I found myself wanting to just obsessively crouch-walk around every map, rarely changing outfits, slipping in and out of rooms never to be seen, but always lethally focused on my target. But can <em>Hitman</em> actually be played like this? Yes, I hear the diehard fans screaming right now, you always could just go off-script and do your own thing.</p><p>In my defense, <em>Hitman</em>’s default settings and game modes make it tough to ignore those narrative opportunities at first. These sub-quests are usually triggered by snippets of overheard NPC dialogue, followed by your handler narrating a bit of what’s going on. You’re then treated to a bright bluish-green lightbulb icon you can follow to victory through the whole map. Play the scenario right, and you probably never even have to crouch or stay out of sight. Hell, you could probably just play the game using the mini-map alone at that point. Straying from these narrative moments also results in a serious difficulty spike; guards are quite perceptive on higher difficulties, and there are more enforcers who can see through your disguises. So it’s easy to get discouraged and come to the conclusion that, yes, the easiest way to take out your hit is to wait for that perfect disguise, or that quick turn of a wrench on some piece of machinery that will crush your target. </p><figure id="" data-id="fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-recommend-id="image://fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A person in a mascot outfit leans out from the corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A person in a mascot outfit leans out from the corner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-recommend-id="image://fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A person in a mascot outfit leans out from the corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The comically macabre story scenarios are an undeniable part of the theater of <em>Hitman</em>. But once I shut the guides off via Master difficulty, I found a very similar experience to the kinds of stealth games I grew up playing—and, dare I say, <em>Hitman</em> might even offer more interesting stealth opportunities? Before I knew it, I was clearing levels while going almost entirely unseen, rarely changing outfits, and waiting for <em>my</em> opportunity to land the killing shot. While some maps feel very familiar to ones I’ve played in other stealth games, <em>Hitman</em> also excels at providing types of maps that few dedicated stealth games seem willing to experiment with.</p><p>When was the last time Solid Snake had to infiltrate a suburban residential neighborhood? When did Sam Fisher ever have to break into a bank vault in the middle of the day while also assassinating the greedy, evil CEO? Yet here I was, using techniques and instincts baked during my many years spent playing as one of the many Snakes. I was surprised by just how organically it felt to crouch-walk everywhere while timing my takedowns with split-second urgency, instead of waiting for them to line up at just the right moment for me to deliver a low-effort execution by flipping a switch or turning a wrench on faulty equipment.</p><figure id="" data-id="c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-recommend-id="image://c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 waits around a corner to strike his opponent." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Agent 47 waits around a corner to strike his opponent." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-recommend-id="image://c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 waits around a corner to strike his opponent." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To be clear, some <em>Hitman</em> levels are easier to play in the style of <em>Metal Gear</em> or <em>Splinter Cell</em> than others. But the variety of environments, from a militia compound to a bougie high-tech hospital in Japan, makes for a nice mix of the familiar with unexpected scenarios that I’d never come across in the standard milsim milieu in which many stealth games operate. And even if I largely opted to ignore the narrative approaches the game offers to its various scenarios, they still exist on the periphery of my playstyle, making the maps feel more alive, sometimes presenting opportunities to get out of a sticky situation. I feel like I’m trespassing into spaces occupied by real people, not just mindless drones endlessly repeating a watch shift. And even when you don’t interact with them, turning a corner to find two NPCs flirting with each other, for example, makes these places feel occupied. You get the sense that you’re intruding not just because the HUD tells you that you’re trespassing, but because you’re clearly spying on or are within earshot of something you’re not supposed to be. </p><p>The narrative moments also helped me survive some failure burnout. As I consider getting spotted a fail state, I have a decades-learned habit of hitting “Restart Mission” every time a wrong move ruins my perfect stealth run. It’s not unusual for me to drill the same part of a mission over and over again until I can slip through, preferably without even firing a shot or taking down a guard. I aim for ghostly runs as often as I can. </p><figure id="" data-id="32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-recommend-id="image://32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 crouches below an office desk to hide from two NPCs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Agent 47 crouches below an office desk to hide from two NPCs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-recommend-id="image://32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 crouches below an office desk to hide from two NPCs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But stumbling upon a possible narrative opportunity during my stealthy trips around the map can be something of a release valve, helping me let go of the frustration of getting spotted. Or sometimes I’ll give in and disguise myself as a security guard. The fact that the game allows for this versatility is what helped me rack up 35 hours of play this weekend, and it’ll continue to call me back for future missions as well.</p><p>If you, too, have found that <em>Hitman</em> hasn’t been as stealthy as you wish it was, start changing the HUD settings and ramping up the difficulty; you’ll find a sneaking experience that might even make Big Boss sweat a little.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hitman-woa-stealth-metal-gear-splinter-cell-freelancer-1851786255]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Playing defense is one of the most crucial elements to success in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>. While you might want to sim through all of the defensive series in a game or just use the coach's suggestion plays to get through a drive, you can really turn the tide of a game if you actually concentrate on defense.</p><p>If you want to make that job easier on yourself, it's imperative to use the right defensive playbook in College Football 26. A majority of the game modes allow you to select any team's playbook on offense and defense, giving you freedom to choose what kind of plays you have access to.</p><p>Of course, defensive plays are a little trickier to understand than offensive ones. So, to make matters simpler, you can take a look below at our picks for the best defensive formations and playbooks available in CFB 26. If you make your own custom playbook and combine these formations We've already covered the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-offensive-playbook-to-use-in-college-football-26/1100-6533072/" data-ref-id="1100-6533072">best offensive playbooks</a> if you want to check out that side of the ball.</p><h2>Best defensive schemes in College Football 26</h2><p>When it comes to selecting a defensive playbook, you have to consider a few different factors. You need to determine if you want to run a specific kind of defense and what that defense is. Of course, you can also select a solid all-around playbook that features plays from various formations, giving you access to a wide selection of plays.</p><p>Fortunately, we've got you covered regardless of your preferences. Below, you can see our pick for the best schemes, collectively making up the best defensive playbook in the game.</p><h3>3-4 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529644-img_6836.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529644" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529644-img_6836.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529644"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529644-img_6836.jpg"></figure><p>Let's start off with a classic. The modern 3-4 Defense was popularized by now North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick during his 40+ years in the NFL. In CFB 26, it's arguably the best standard defense that covers all of your bases when it comes to countering what play an offense will run.</p><p>In 3-4, you'll have three defensive linemen and four linebackers on the field. 3-4 relies on some stability from the interior of the defense, which means your defensive tackles and inside linebackers need to ensure they're covering the middle of the field. However, you also don't want to leave any passing lanes exposed, which is where your other linebackers come into play. For 3-4, you generally want to user the middle linebacker to cover passing lanes or possibly the defensive tackle to try and get pressure on the opposing quarterback.</p><h3>3-3-5 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529645-img_6839.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529645" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529645-img_6839.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529645"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529645-img_6839.jpg"></figure><p>Next up, we have an alternate defensive playbook, which uses the 3-3-5 defense. This defensive formation utilizes three down defensive linemen, three linebackers, and five defensive backs. Naturally, with one less lineman/linebacker, you're going to have to get creative when it comes to pressuring the quarterback.</p><p>Fortunately, the 3-3-5 defense utilizes plenty of safety and cornerback pressures to compensate for the missing pass rusher. You can also use your six linemen and linebackers to shoot different gaps on passing and rushing plays. 3-3-5 defense can come with some risk if you don't guess the right play or make the correct pre-snap adjustments, but it can also be a truly difficult defense to play against if you can cover all your bases.</p><h3>3-2-6 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529646-img_6838.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529646" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529646-img_6838.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529646"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529646-img_6838.jpg"></figure><p>The 3-2-6 defense is one you want to use if you're overly worried about defending against the pass in CFB 26. Utilizing six defensive backs and only two traditional linebackers, you'll have a difficult time getting any consistent pressure on the quarterback with this defense. However, that abundance of DBs makes it incredibly difficult for the quarterback to find any open receiver.</p><p>Moreover, the defense often makes use of speedier linebackers that drop into coverage as well, meaning you might only have three defensive linemen trying to stop the run and get to the quarterback. As long as you can predict when a pass is coming and use the right plays accordingly, the 3-2-6 defense will be a thorn in the side of any opponent that wishes to pass to ball.</p><h3>4-2-5 Defense</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529647-img_6837.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529647-img_6837.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529647"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4529647-img_6837.jpg"></figure><p>Finally, we have the 4-2-5 defense, which is a mix between the 3-2-6 and 3-3-5 defenses. Compared to the 3-2-6 defense, which is all about defending against the pass, the 4-2-5 focuses more on defending the run and getting to the quarterback. While you do still have five defensive backs in the mix, one of them is often responsible for applying pressure from the outside. This, mixed with four down defensive linemen and a linebacker or two, makes getting to the quarterback much easier.</p><p>Of course, what makes the 4-2-5 great is that you also have some flexibility to defend against the pass. You can use all five DBs to drop into coverage along with your two linebackers. On plays where the offense takes some time to develop, you can cover all receivers and possibly get to the quarterback with your four linemen. Quick passing plays might beat the 4-2-5, though, so watch out for those.</p>

                <p>As one of the biggest games in the world, Fortnite has long had its fair share of bad actors targeting it and its players. Epic Games has responded over the years by beefing up its safety and security capacities and investing in protective measures to ensure the stability of the game.</p><p>Recently, Epic took legal action against two individuals, a cheat seller and the perpetrator of a string of DDoS attacks against Fortnite creators. According to Epic's comments on the matter, the DDoSer had been disrupting livestreams of Fortnite content, in addition to conducting "stream sniping" campaigns. The other person, meanwhile, had been selling and using permanent Fortnite bans.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1944788275711054250" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We took legal action against two people who cheated and broke our rules:<br>One sold and used cheats and the other carried out cyber attacks on content creators who were livestreaming gameplay (aka: DDoS attacks).

Their social media accounts have also been scrubbed of content.</p><p>In their apology video, the DDoSer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD-KyTph9DI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zebsi</a>, shared that they carried out the cyberattacks under a particular username. They also apologized for the "damage" the attacks did to Epic, the community, and the targeted streamers. The cheat seller, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyqijCVqMGM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mirrored</a>, admitted to using, selling, and distributing "cheats and hardware," and they said that they had cheated in Fortnite tournaments. They also shared that they were permanently banned from the game and would face additional legal action if they cheated again.</p><p>Epic has taken a hard line against cheating in abuse in recent times, and this move to force public apologies from two individuals is a clear example of the company's efforts to increase deterrence. Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-wins-legal-judgment-against-fortnite-cheater/1100-6532743/" data-ref-id="1100-6532743">Epic won a judgment against a different cheater</a>, resulting in the levying of a $175,000 fine that the company donated to charity.</p>

                <p>Late last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> got some serious competition in the realm of hero shooters when NetEase launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a>. A number of new Overwatch 2 features have also drawn comparisons to Marvel Rivals, including the recent reveal of the third-person <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-roadmap-reveals-future-heroes-maps-and-game-modes-coming-in-the-next-few-months/1100-6531278/" data-ref-id="1100-6531278">Stadium mode</a>. But according to Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller, Stadium mode and other features weren't made in response to Marvel Rivals. Instead, many of them were planned before Marvel Rivals debuted.</p><p>"I think that competition is healthy," said Keller during a guest appearance on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2508946186" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay3's stream</a>. "It does force people to innovate more and to always be putting your best foot forward, but I don't think what you're seeing in Overwatch 2 right now is a response to Marvel Rivals. So much of what we were doing this year--from perks to Stadium to map voting, we did full hero bans--so much of what we're doing here and all the heroes we're releasing has been in the works for over a year as part of a new strategy for the game to have a big annual kick off to the year."</p><p>Keller suggested that there may things added to Overwatch 2 in the future if the games are still actively competing, but he didn't add any specifics beyond that. During the same stream, Keller acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-director-acknowledges-that-game-needs-more-story-content-to-be-firing-on-all-cylinders/1100-6533118/" data-ref-id="1100-6533118">Overwatch 2 has had very little of the story content, cinematics, and animated shorts</a> that helped define the world in the first game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summer 2025 anime lineup</a> is an embarrassment of riches. While many of its catalog is top-heavy with big marquee shonen series like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dan-da-dan-is-a-lovey-dovey-madcap-sci-fi-anime-drama-about-finding-your-balls-2000540322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dan Da Dan</em></a>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-doesnt-just-redefine-shonen-anime-it-anoints-itself-as-the-next-big-thing-2000622249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sakamoto-days-premiere-review-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Sakamoto Days</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kaiju-no-8-season-1-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kaiju No. 8</em></a>, what impresses me most about this new lineup is how my basket of cherry-picked, must-watch shows feels heavier than it has in previous years. Two series that I’ve become utterly captivated by are <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GKEH2G0X4/takopis-original-sin?srsltid=AfmBOoqAal1Qp8aY0Fde1aSXQJLF8Ar56UNHq8NjM-ih_K30abgK-f_y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Takopi’s Original Sin</em></a> and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81948057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The</em> <em>Summer Hikaru Died</em> </a>because they evoke the fleeting, nihilistic, and disturbing vibes of compelling anime from the aughts.</p><p>When I say these two anime evoke a vibe of disturbing anime from yesteryear, I mean the kind of fatalistic, dark anime that doesn’t seem to be made anymore: your <em>Higurashi</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=escc512WoDw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>When</em> <em>They</em> <em>Cry</em></a>) or <em>Assassination Classroom</em>. Despite being on opposite ends of the spectrum—one being oppressively bleak and the other an absurdist riot—both anime feature big ideas wrapped in cutesy packaging with an unsettling, violent thematic throughline that would <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassination-classroom-censor-manga-shooting-florida-1850334204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get them banned in schools</a>. These shows were iconic at the time and still stand out in retrospect because they are so visceral. The same is true for <em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em> and <em>Takopi’s Original Sin</em>, which, despite their source material being from 2021, feel so deeply connected to a more daring era of anime history that they surpass the rest of the summer 2025 shows as nostalgic, novel, and refreshingly dark takes on horror.</p><p>Let’s start with Crunchyroll’s six-episode limited series, <em>Takopi’s Original Sin</em>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="アニメ『タコピーの原罪』ノンクレジットOP映像｜ano「ハッピーラッキーチャッピー」" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ciFvLHCThdg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Created by <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/56101/Taizan_5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Taizan 5</em></a> and animated by <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1991/Enishiya" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio Enishiya</a>, <em>Takopi’s</em> <em>Original Sin</em> is a blend of the normal, human cruelty of <em>Higurashi</em> with the zany mascot of <em>Assassination Classroom.</em> The series follows Takopi, an alien on Earth on a mission to spread happiness. He’s from a planet called Happy Planet and has various "Happy Tools"—magical-girl-style items like a Happy Camera that resets its subjects to the moment a photo was taken, a Reconciliation Ribbon, a red string of fate meant to make people friends instantly, and a Transformation Palette that allows Takopi to impersonate others. Takopi ends up meeting Shizuka, a lonely fourth grader. After befriending Shizuka, Takopi takes on a <em>Smiling Friends</em> mission to improve her life. The series also contains viewer advisories for suicide helpline links, adult themes, profanity, and violence, which it earns.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Takopi’s Original Sin | OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7dxZjwIhu0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Typically, overly cutesy shows like <em>Takopi </em>is a warning sign that <em>Takopi </em>might be an evil agent meant to worsen Shizuka’s life, similar to <a href="https://kotaku.com/madoka-magica-beginnings-may-be-better-than-the-series-5950073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</em></a>. While Takopi is indeed an unreliable narrator with a bubbly, naive view of Shizuka’s intense bullying by classmate Marina Kirarazaka, Takopi ends up acting like a desperate visual novel player trying to save a doomed protagonist from a bad ending. Watching Takopi’s pure optimism corrupted by Shizuka and Marina’s respective perils can’t be solved by a wave of a magic wand, in tandem with the extraterrestrial ball of hope getting ground down by how Shizuka willfully rejects the idea that an eye for an eye isn’t a viable solution, is wildly captivating to watch. Like <em>Madoka Magica</em>, <em>Takopi </em>is a deconstruction of the magical girl anime trope that situates its instigator on the back foot as he realizes that magic can’t fix a <em>Higurashi</em>-coded visual novel tragedy. You start feeling for the little chibi guy whenever disaster strikes, and, instead of being met with admonishment for his misplaced meddling, he’s flashed with a glittery smile as Shizuka enlists Takopi to <em>Weekend at Bernie's</em> folks that’ve made her life a living hell.&nbsp;</p><p>Now let’s dive into Netflix’s adaptation of <em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="「光が死んだ夏」ノンクレジットオープニング「再会」Vaundy：The Summer Hikaru Died Opening" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UP7la6a1H1g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dan Da Dan</em></a> explores horror, <em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em> is an anime series deeply immersed in the macabre. Additionally, it's a boys' love story crackling with sensual, creepy energy that both arouses and disgusts equally. Created by <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2024-07-24/small-town-horror-with-the-summer-hikaru-died-creator-mokumokuren/.211571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mangaka Mokumokuren</a> and animated by <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1893/CygamesPictures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyangames Pictures</a> (famous for <a href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Uma Musume</em></a>), <em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em> is set in a familiar horror setting: a quiet rural village in the mountains. The series follows Yoshiki, a high school student mourning his childhood friend Hikaru, who mysteriously died in the mountains. However, as the title hints, Hikaru isn’t actually dead and a mysterious, menacing entity has taken root beneath his friend's skin.&nbsp;</p><p>Hikaru wises up to the facade early in the show’s first episode, but what happens next is much more interesting than if the show had gone with a traditional body-snatching mystery like<em> The Thing</em>. “Hikaru,” now a mixture of memories and affection fermenting inside his host, doesn’t just ask to keep pretending to be human; he asks Yoshiki’s permission to keep living as his best friend. To Yoshiki’s horror, he agrees—and opens the door to his small town’s occult mysteries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from <em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em>’s impressive feature film-quality animation and composition, one of the most remarkable aspects of the anime is its clear queer narrative between its leads. While people are sure to debate online over whether they’re “just friends” who explicitly say they love each other, supporters of this view can argue with their mommas because The Summer Hikaru Died being “yaoi-coded” doesn’t start to describe it accurately.&nbsp;</p><p>Deadass, there’s a scene in its second episode, “Suspicion,” where “Hikaru” asks Yoshiki to reach into his chest cavity to learn first-hand how he dispensed of a yokai that was stalking him. This leads to an overtly sensual and disturbing scene where the former shudders, muttering shit like “Yeah, that’s the spot!” prompting Yoshiki to ask “This feels good?” and “Hikaru” responding, saying “Feels just like a good pat on the head. Nobody’s ever touched me here before” between moans.&nbsp;</p><p>While “Hikaru” protests to Yoshiki (who visibly enjoyed their chest fingering despite how scary it was) for wiping his hand off on his shirt, Yoshiki blushes and looks away after “Hikaru” tells him to get a good look at his abs. The scene is hilariously capped off by Yoshiki describing his tactile chest fingering, describing it like a touching marinated chicken. A remark the anime capitalizes on with a frame of marinated chicken (<a href="https://x.com/tsuchi31478044/status/1944085827648176493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which the staff later enjoyed as karage</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>While other horror works like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/uzumaki-anime-review-adult-swim-junji-ito-production-ig-2000501288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Junji Ito’s manga</a> set the gold standard for stomach-churning horror, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/uzumaki-anime-bad-animation-episode-2-jason-demarco-2000509050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their anime adaptations often lose their edge</a>. However, anime like <em>Takopi’s Original Sin</em> and <em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em> go beyond those shortcomings. They’re darker, sharper, and messier in ways that feel more authentic to emotional horror, resisting genre polish and pushing boundaries with every frame. They focus less on jump scares and more on existential decay, replacing loud panic with quiet unraveling. These qualities don’t just honor a past era of anime; they make them stand out amid today’s streaming riches and serve as exciting reminders of the wonder anime can still create.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick"><h3>The Penny Farthing Is Alive And Well In 2025</h3></a><p>The National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race takes place every summer in Frederick, Maryland</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime"><h3>Pretty Girl Horse Racing Game ‘Uma Musume’ Is Engrossing And Weird As Hell</h3></a><p>Breed horse girls to create even better horse girls, so that they can achieve their dream of winning races and performing a concert literally right after</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/outlier-best-mens-pants-indestructible-pants"><h3>All My Pants Are From Outlier Because They Appear To Live Forever</h3></a><p>Outlier makes pants that will survive the abuse of several presidential administrations.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The next Nintendo Direct might be coming up very soon. That's according to reputable source Nate the Hate, who said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a> today, July 14, that the next Direct is slated for this month.</p><p>"It is the million dollar question. I have been told there is a Direct this month, the month of July, but that Direct will not take place until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-release-date-trailer-gameplay-details-and-everything-we-know/1100-6530797/" data-ref-id="1100-6530797">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> releases," he said. "Beyond that, I have no additional information. I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point."</p><p>Bananza launches on July 17 for Switch 2, so a possible Direct would happen after that if this report proves to be accurate.</p><p>That's all he had to say about a possible upcoming Direct. Nintendo could have any number of things to announce at a Direct, like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-team-returns-for-a-donkey-kong-film-listing-reveals/1100-6533131/" data-ref-id="1100-6533131">potential Donkey Kong movie</a> or confirmation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">Red Dead Redemption II for Switch 2</a>. Activision is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/" data-ref-id="1100-6532276">keen to bring Call of Duty to Switch.</a></p><p>There is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-july/1100-6531854/" data-ref-id="1100-6531854">Pokemon Presents event slated for July 22</a>. Nate the Hate pointed out that this Nintendo-adjacent event <em>and </em>a Nintendo Direct in the same week is not unprecedented, but he feels safer speculating that the July Direct could happen during the last week of the month instead. If that's true, it would happen just before Nintendo releases its latest earnings results on August 1.</p><p>The latest Nintendo Direct took place on June 18 and was exclusively dedicated to Bananza. Before that, there was the big Switch 2 Direct on April 2 and then a Mario Kart World Direct on April 17. Nintendo did not hold a Nintendo Direct event in July 2024 or July 2023, but that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/archive/?srsltid=AfmBOoo-X7hRDf7qr3vJ94YQpTr-eGgfDvyx6gP0lkrBREZtbPWVlMDV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historical precedent</a> might not mean anything. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>You might also want to keep an eye on the Nintendo Today app, as Nintendo is known to make announcements there just ahead of sharing information in other places.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How The Fallout TV Show Shapes Fallout's Future</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Corden said from what he has heard, part of the forward push for Fallout 5 and Fallout in general came at the expense of ZeniMax Online's next MMO, codenamed Blackbird, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">canceled as part of Microsoft's latest round of layoffs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As Corden explains, MMOs are expensive to build and have to compete with established games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> and even ZeniMax's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/" data-ref-id="5000-140736">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. With that in mind, Microsoft made the decision to cancel ZeniMax's unannounced project and invest that money into Fallout, an established IP that would more likely be a "surefire win."</p><p dir="ltr">"From what I heard, it was a case of 'Do we want to sink a ton of money into getting this [project Blackbird] to a point where it can compete with the established players in the market, or do we want to allocate that investment towards making Fallout 5?'" Corden said.</p><p dir="ltr">It is worth noting that Corden states that he doesn't have enough information to write a full story about Fallout 5 or who may be developing it, so it's worth taking the information above with a grain of salt.</p><p dir="ltr">Project Blackbird was still in pre-production when it was canceled, but no official details about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-revealed-about-elder-scrolls-online-devs-rumored-canceled-game/1100-6532943/" data-ref-id="1100-6532943">next game from the Elder Scrolls Online dev</a> had been announced. It had reportedly been in development since 2018, ran on a new engine, and was to be a new sci-fi IP. Development on the game was said to have been going well and had begun ramping up, with higher-ups at Xbox seemingly approving of the game just a few months prior to cancellation.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of who is developing Fallout 5, the fact that it is just now greenlit means it will likely be many years before it releases. However, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">Fallout 3 remaster is reportedly in the works</a> that could arrive sooner. Renewed interest in Fallout reached new heights with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-is-more-popular-than-ever-on-steam-thanks-to-the-tv-show/1100-6522828/" data-ref-id="1100-6522828">Amazon's Fallout TV show</a> in 2024, with star Walton Goggins recently offering an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-gets-update-from-walton-goggins/1100-6529385/" data-ref-id="1100-6529385">update on Fallout Season 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the next Elder Scrolls game is currently being worked on, with Bethesda Game Studios head Todd Howard recently reassuring fans that it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-obviously-being-worked-on-amid-oblivions-remaster-todd-howard-says/1100-6531019/" data-ref-id="1100-6531019">"obviously" working on Elders Scrolls 6</a> even amidst the release of Oblivion Remastered.</p>

                <p>The definitive edition of one of the greatest Warhammer 40K games of all time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war/" data-ref-id="5000-20083">Dawn of War</a>, is just around the corner, and fans who own the previous anniversary edition will get a substantial discount on this new and improved version.</p><p dir="ltr">Announced back in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/warhammer-skulls-2025-all-the-game-announcements-and-news/2900-6608/" data-ref-id="2900-6608">May as part of Warhammer Skulls</a>, Warhammer 40: Dawn of War – Definitive Edition now has a release date of August 14, developer Relic Entertainment has announced. This updated version of the classic real-time-strategy game first released by Relic in 2004 will make the game far more playable on modern hardware and will include widescreen and 4K resolution support, upscaled textures four times that of their original resolution, an improved camera, HUD optimizations, and upgrades to lighting, unit reflections, and shadows.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY_JzB0WxSA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pY_JzB0WxSA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This version of the game has also been upgraded to a 64-bit platform to "support the ongoing efforts of the modding community" and will be fully compatible with existing mods, according to a press release.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3556750/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Definitive_Edition/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dawn of War – Definitive Edition</a> will be $30 and additionally include each of the game's three expansions: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm. Each expansion added new playable armies, multiplayer maps, and additional campaigns (in the case of Dark Crusade and Soulstorm, non-linear campaigns playable with different armies). Some of the armies added in Dawn of War's expansions include fan-favorites like the Imperial Guard, Necrons, and the Sisters of Battle.</p><p dir="ltr">The definitive edition of Dawn of War will essentially replace a previous anniversary edition released in 2006 that bundled together all of the game's content. Those "loyal fans" who own the anniversary edition will receive a 30% discount on buying the definitive edition, with the discount remaining active "for the foreseeable future," according to Relic. That puts Dawn of War – Definitive Edition's price at $21 for anniversary edition owners.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate the release date announcement, Relic dropped a 4K enhanced version of the original Dawn of War's iconic CGI trailer, one that shows the Space Marines of the Blood Ravens engaged in a desperate battle against an Orkish horde.</p><p dir="ltr">While fans seem to appreciate the updated trailer overall, one change--the removal of a Space Marine sergeant's scream and its replacement with voiceover from a well-established character not depicted in the trailer--has ruffled the feathers of some. Relic in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-dev-says-replaced-space-marine-scream-was-even-more-beloved-than-we-realized-as-intro-cinematic-changes-spark-backlash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> said the Space Marine's original "roar was even more beloved than we realized," and that "we may have something for OG roar enjoyers before long."</p><p dir="ltr">In other Warhammer 40K video game news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2s-new-siege-mode-unleashes-endless-waves-of-enemies/1100-6532761/" data-ref-id="1100-6532761">Space Marine 2 recently received its long-awaited Siege mode</a> update, while the remastered re-release of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-pc-remaster-had-so-many-launch-issues-sega-is-offering-refunds/1100-6532885/" data-ref-id="1100-6532885">Space Marine has been mired in so many issues</a> publisher Sega has begun offering refunds.</p>

I’ve been tracking a handful of cards that stood out this month, with some pulling in surprising gains and others dropping harder than expected. Here’s a quick look at which Pokémon TCG cards are crashing and climbing ahead of the final Scarlet and Violet sets release in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/pixel-9-55-1752506840543.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been keeping an eye on Scarlet and Violet base set prices lately, and the Psychic-type Illustration Rares seem to be the ones pulling ahead. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXBEO?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ralts 211/198</a> has been quietly climbing. It's sitting around $38.99 now, which is up about 28% this month. For a Basic card with simple art and a single Psyshot attack, that's not something I saw coming. Same goes for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDxGw?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kirlia 212/198</a>. It's up to $27.99, mirroring Ralts's percentage jump. That evolution line seems to be gaining popularity as a set, more than just individual play value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of evolutions, <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpW7v?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gardevoir ex 245/198</a> is definitely riding that same wave. It’s hit $54.99 recently, up from $41.19 just a month back. I don’t play Gardevoir myself, but the Psychic Embrace ability keeps showing up in deck lists, so the price hike makes sense when you look at both collector and competitive demand feeding into each other. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObrgE?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Miraidon ex 244/198</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3Gr1m?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koraidon ex 247/198</a> are seeing their own upticks, both sitting around $23.99 now. Not massive jumps compared to Gardevoir, but steady enough to notice if you’ve been following these since launch. Miraidon especially, thanks to that Tandem Unit ability, looks like it’s still holding value in Lightning-heavy builds.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/pixel-9-53-1752506866583.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other end of things, some cards are definitely cooling off. <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03015?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fidough 213/198</a> took a 15% hit, now hovering around $13.74.

There were discounts on quite a few popular games and many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">popular jigsaw puzzle brands</a> had all-time low prices. But if you happened to have miss all of those deals, Woot is currently having a small sale of its own that gives you a second chance at savings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There aren't a ton of options in this sale, but there are enough to make it noteworthy.

The overall best deals are on 3D puzzle builds that are collaborations with popular franchises like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Marvel, and Star Wars.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-fc-26-will-be-revealed-this-week-zlatan-ibrahimovic-confirmed-to-be-a-cover-athlete.1243374/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has confirmed that it will fully reveal EA Sports FC 26, the next entry in its annual football simulation series, later this week, on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. It has also revealed one of the cover athletes for this year to be iconic Swedish player, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who will appear on the cover of the Ultimate Edition of the game. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Zlatan is being added as an icon item in the game, adding him to the roster of legendary footballers to have their careers celebrated in EA Sports FC. Though there's no official release date yet for EA Sports FC 26, veteran players of the series should expect it to fall where it usually does in the year, which is sometime in the early fall, more specifically in September. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>If you want to catch up on the state of the EA Sports FC series, you can try out last year's entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-the-alters-ea-sports-fc-25-and-more-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-june/">EA Sports FC 25 on Xbox Game Pass</a>, since it joined the service just last month. Not that EA particularly wants players, or anyone, really, to look back on last year's entry. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-ceo-explains-why-fc-25-failed-to-meet-financial-expectations/">EA Sports FC 25 missed its financial targets</a>, a huge blow to the company that relies on its annual sports games to make up the bulk of its revenue. While it saw huge success with the return of <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football</a>, the main breadwinner for EA has always been its football series and the live service side of it, Football Ultimate Team (FUT).</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">EA shut down projects and laid off developers at Respawn</a>, and it <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">shut down the studio it built to make a new Black Panther game</a>, cancelling the game. It's difficult to imagine that EA wouldn't make more cuts if it goes through another year of its flagship sports game missing its targets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An unexpected co-op board game has won this year's Spiel des Jahres. The <em>Bomb Busters</em> board game has taken the acclaimed award, one many believed was reserved for the critical and commercial card game darling, Flip 7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/07/14/co-op-designs-continue-to-dominate-board-gamings-biggest-prize-as-bomb-busters-seals-spiel-des-jahres-win/" rel="nofollow">BoardGameWire</a>, the <em>Bomb Busters</em> board game winning this year's Spiel des Jahres marked several momentous occasions. It is the first time in the event's 46-year history that the winner came from an Asian game designer. Considering the event is held in Germany, it is a testament to the rising popularity of board games around the world.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bomb-busters-board-game-hisashi-hiyashi-award-image.jpg?itok=XfBbRqL9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bomb-busters-board-game-hisashi-hiyashi-award-image.jpg?itok=mBXZpcj5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game, created by Japanese designer Hisashi Hiyashi, is a reworked version of his 2020 board game, <em>Bomb Squad</em>.&nbsp;This updated version of the game, which was presented to the Spiel des Jahres jury, included 66 different missions.</p>

<p>As the name implies, it is a co-op game where players work together to disarm different kinds of bombs. Different colored tiles represent the wires on each bomb. Those tiles are placed in front of each player, meaning only they can see which wires are a certain color.&nbsp;If both players cut each wire in the correct order, the bomb is disarmed, and they win. If the team messes up, the bomb "explodes" and everyone loses.</p>

<p>The <em>Bomb Busters</em> board game winning this award was also considered an upset for another tabletop critical darling. <em>Flip 7</em>, the press-your-luck card flipping game designed by Eric Olsen, has been winning awards left and right this year. Those include the 2024 Origins Awards Best Party Game, the 2024 Golden Geek Party Game, and the 2024 Board Game Quest Awards Best Game Award.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hayashi stated the main inspiration for his award-winning board game was <em>Babanuki</em>, a traditional Japanese card game. It is also known by another name in the US: <em>Old Maid</em>.</p>

Those were the PS5 Pros which were limited to just 35,000. But the PS1-style DualSense did still sell out quickly, with many missing out once the initial pre-order frenzy subsided. </p><p>The restock may cut down on some of those issues, including problems with scalpers, by requiring every person to have a PS Plus membership. At the same time, the emphasis on “highly limited quantities” makes it sound like Sony is content to still leave some fans out in the cold. Most of the other limited-edition DualSense controllers, like those for <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>The Last Of Us Part </em>2, <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>(lots of sequels this generation!) ranged from underwhelming to ugly. It’s a shame the only one everyone agrees looks awesome is also the hardest to get. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps1-30th-anniversary-ps5-dualsense-stock-pre-order-1851786249]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Black Ops 7 was first announced in June during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. Activision didn't do much in the way of hyping or teasing the reveal beforehand, and that was intentional, as the company was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-will-be-like-a-beyonce-album-release-activision-says/1100-6532275/" data-ref-id="1100-6532275">actively trying to copy Beyonce's approach.</a></p><p>The game is set in the year 2035 and aims to be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/" data-ref-id="1100-6532238">"most mind-bending" Black Ops game yet</a>. Black Ops 7 is also notable because this is the first time Activision is releasing Black Ops games in back-to-back years. Treyarch and Raven Software are the main co-developers for Black Ops 7, and these two studios also co-developed 2024's Black Ops 6.</p><p>In addition to Black Ops 7, it's expected that Call of Duty: Warzone will get new updates in the future tied to Black Ops 7. In fact, the Black Ops 7 trailer concluded with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-new-call-of-duty-warzone-map-teased-in-black-ops-7-trailer/1100-6532265/" data-ref-id="1100-6532265">possible tease for a new Warzone map</a>.</p><p>Black Ops 7 stars Milo Ventimiglia (This is Us, Gilmore Girls) as David Mason. The celebrity cast also includes Kiernan Shipka (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) as Emma Kagan, with Guardians of the Galaxy's Michael Rooker reprising his role as Mike Harper from Black Ops 2.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. There was no announcement about a version of the game for the Switch 2, but Activision and Microsoft have said they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/" data-ref-id="1100-6532276">remain committed to bringing Call of Duty to Nintendo systems.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Square Enix is prepping a remake of Dragon Quest VII, according to a new report. The RPG originally launched on PlayStation in 2000 in Japan and 2001 in the US, with this new take supposedly set to arrive sometime in 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/square-enix-developing-dragon-quest-vii-remake-for-release-in-2026" rel="nofollow ">MP1st</a>, the Dragon Quest VII project is labeled as a "remake" instead of an "HD remake," like the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-history-repeats/1900-6418319/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> that arrived last year. So the RPG could be receiving much more than just a fresh coat of paint, such as gameplay alterations. Before then, however, Square Enix has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon/1100-6530455/">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake</a> set to launch on October 30.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake - 7 Minutes Of Playstation 5 Gameplay | Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Interestingly enough, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka stated earlier this year that he would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-dev-wants-to-do-final-fantasy-6-next/1100-6527894/">love to tackle Final Fantasy VI next</a>. Hayasake made it clear this was just his personal preference while also noting that the beloved RPG was a major reference point for Octopath Traveler, the first HD-2D game.</p><p dir="ltr">This wouldn't be the first time Square Enix has updated Dragon Quest VII, either.
