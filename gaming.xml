            <p>Fairgame$ - the heist shooter from Jade Raymond's new studio, Haven - has allegedly been delayed.</p>
<p>Whilst we don't know much about the live-service game other than it was expected later this year and is in development for PC and PlayStation 5, Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb revealed during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72WmrtMEfm8">Game Mess Decides</a> podcast that the release had slipped to 2026.</p>

<p>Grubb didn't offer any explanations as to why the project may have fallen behind schedule, but said it was unlikely to make an appearance "this year".</p>
<p>"No Fairgame$ this year," Grubb said, "Fairgame$, as far as I’m aware, has been pushed to 2026."</p>
<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects cancelled, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">including two just last month</a>, thought to be one from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and one from Bluepoint.</p>
<p>Despite being in development for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">for eight years</a>, Sony's 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PC and PS5 debut</a> last year, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">lackluster launch and weak sales</a>.</p>
<p>Numerous other live service games have also been cancelled by Sony, including London Studio's co-op game, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">the studio also shut down last year</a>. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">Naughty Dog cancelled its standalone multiplayer game set in the world of The Last of Us</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">live service Twisted Metal project at Firespite was similarly cancelled</a> along with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">co-operative live service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac</a> entitled Spider-Man: The Great Web.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Sony for comment and will update as and when we hear back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-improves-98-of-the-interiors-textures/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth finally landed on PC less than a month ago. While PC gamers had to wait nearly a year since the original PlayStation 5 launch to play it, Square Enix made it worthwhile by including several graphics improvements, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-to-launch-on-pc-on-january-23rd-with-improved-lighting-enhanced-textures-and-nvidia-dlss-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhanced lighting and character models</a> over the console version.</p>
<p>However, even this supposedly definitive version of the beloved game (which just won the Best RPG of 2024 prize at <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-24-best-games-of-2024-and-most-anticipated-of-2025-from-staff-and-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our annual Wccftech Awards</a>) still had visual shortcomings. More specifically, many textures were relatively low resolution for today's standards.</p>
<p>Thankfully, one modder quickly took it upon themselves to improve this graphical aspect of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Romi969 <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-4k-texture-packs-tifa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> 4K upscaled texture packs for some of the main characters, including Cloud, Tifa, Aerith, Barret, and Yuffie, just a week after the PC launch.</p>
<p>A few days later, the modder also <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-greatly-improves-environmental-textures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> Natural Fantasy, a mod that greatly improves environmental textures through upscaling. And yesterday, they have completed the circle with the release of the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/349" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upscaled Interiors mod</a>. As you can easily guess by the name, this one is focused on improving around 98% of the interiors textures. According to Romi969, around 14K textures have had their resolution doubled in size through AI upscaling.</p>
<p>They also claimed that there is practically no noticeable performance impact, which makes it all the more puzzling why Square Enix did not do this themselves, especially since there are so many great upscaling models nowadays.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Vanilla/Upscaled</figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, Square Enix is now fully dedicated to the sequel of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the third installment in the FFVII Remake trilogy. So far, we've learned that the next title might include <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-combat-freedom-different-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased combat freedom</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-director-wants-to-add-a-different-twist-for-a-new-and-exciting-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some sort of twist to make it a fresh, exciting experience</a>. Meanwhile, the story and concept have been completed, and the developers have <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committed</a> to the map being fully explorable with the airship.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266353/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>It seems like Nintendo just revealed its mysterious device that recently crossed the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251736/nintendo-mmwave-device-24ghz-fcc-filing">Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</a> — and it’s not <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">the Switch 2</a>. On Wednesday, Nintendo announced, of all things, the “Alarmo” alarm clock. But in classic Nintendo fashion, the clock has some playful tricks.</p><p>The clock responds to your movements, which you can use to snooze your alarm with motion. Its faces feature Nintendo characters from franchises like <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, and you can set the alarm to wake you up with music from those franchises. The Alarmo can also track how much you move in your sleep.</p><p>The Alarmo — officially, the “Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo” — is available to purchase in “early access” for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers and at the Nintendo NY store. We’ve actually already picked one up, and we’ve published some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">initial impressions and a bunch of photos</a>.</p><p>Here’s all of our coverage of Nintendo’s Alarmo clock.</p></section><div><div><h2>Highlights</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266353/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock#dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTE5NjY=">Nintendo’s original alarm clock prototypes were a lot less playful</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266353/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock#dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTI3OTA=">Nintendo is making an alarm clock so you can wake up to Zelda and Super Mario sounds</a></li></ul></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTQyNzU=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">A closer look at Nintendo’s adorable Alarmo clock</a></h2><div><p>Look, I’m a sucker for instant gratification. It’s often one of my favorite things about living in New York City. This morning, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">Nintendo announced its $99 Alarmo clock</a>, and when the company’s store in Rockefeller Center opened a couple hours later, I walked in and picked one up. Did I feel a little iffy about paying $108.91 after tax for a plastic alarm clock? You bet. But fortunately, in my field, this counts as a work expense. (Technically, this product is called Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo — but no one is ever going to refer to it that way. It’s Alarmo.)</p><p><em>The Verge</em>’s senior entertainment editor Andrew Webster will have a full review of Alarmo coming up, but I wanted to check it out for myself. Mostly, I was curious about the audio quality. If the speaker in this relatively tiny clock sounds tinny or shrill, that would ruin the whole concept for me.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Now anyone can buy an Alarmo.</p><p>Nintendo’s motion-sensing (and <em>Doom</em>-playing, with some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/3/24286842/nintendo-alarmo-doom-hack-usb-custom-firmware-instructions">unsanctioned modification</a>) alarm clock is now available for anyone in the US to buy from its online store “while supplies last,” the company <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1890491214639645040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1890491214639645040%7Ctwgr%5E6aaf9cb3f67b6ae3103de2b26e2a29621a11952d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2Fhome%2Fsmart-home%2Fanyone-in-the-us-can-now-buy-nintendos-alarmo-clock-from-the-online-store-171945008.html">announced yesterday</a>.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTkwNQ==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342984/nintendo-alarmo-wide-release-date">Nintendo’s Alarmo will be available for everyone starting in March</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Another day, another announcement from Nintendo that isn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/11/24341043/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-details-leaks">the next Switch</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/infinity-nikki">Infinity Nikki</a> developer Papergames earned almost $1 billion in 2024.</p>
<p>As spotted by director of research and insights at Niko Partners, Daniel Ahmad, the Chinese firm has been "credited with the rise of Chinese otome games" - that is, romance games written primarily for women - both nationally and overseas.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2025/02/14/ai-boyfriends-make-chinese-gaming-entrepreneur-yao-runhao-a-billionaire/">Forbes</a>, Papergames - which also developed dating simulator game, Love and Deepspace, which boasts over six million monthly active users and is available in Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean - is so successful, it generated sales of around $850 million worldwide last year, generating a $1.3bn fortune for Papergames' 37-year-old founder, Yao Runhao.</p>
<p>Though both developed and published by Papergames in China, in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, Infinity Nikki is published by Fearless, and elsewhere - including the US and Europe - Infinity Nikki is published by Infold Games.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/">Infinity Nikki - which is the fifth instalment of the dress-up game - will soon make its debut on Steam</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Infinity Nikki developer Papergames ushered in the new year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-studio-details-upcoming-optimisations-and-improvements-for-gacha-hit">word on a range of improvements and optimisations</a> it's working on for the dress-up-themed free-to-play gacha hit.</p>
<p>The plans for the open-world action-adventure were formulated after gathering "millions of suggestions" from players. A significant chunk of these fall into the "optimisations" bucket, starting with improved game performance on mobile devices - which the developer says it recognises as a "significant challenge that must be addressed".</p>
<p>Our Jessica had good things to say about Infinity Nikki in her four-star<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-review"> review</a> last year, calling it a "true step forward for open-world gacha games" that "finally brings some much needed competition to the miHoYo monopoly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Farm 51 has just released the playable demo for Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone. This post-apocalyptic-like, open-world game plunges players into the heart of Chornobyl, throwing them head over heels into a multiversal, ambitious survival RPG. It’s not a far cry from the first game, which was released in 2018, but the demo reveals a few flaws that need ironing out.</p>



<p>I picked up a preview copy of Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone a few days ago and was able to complete the playable demo in around 80 minutes. It’s a great glimpse behind the curtain, and it sets up some solid expectations for the full game, which will be released on March 6.</p>



<p>Check out my preview below to learn about my major gripes with Chernobylite 2.</p>

<h2 id="h-looks-great-doesn-t-play-well">Looks Great, Doesn’t Play Well</h2>



<p>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone looks fantastic on the surface. The character models and animations are scarily good, and the open-world environment of the Exclusion Zone is authentic and feels great to look at. The enemy models are pretty much the same as the last game and look intimidating enough, and there are enough small details scattered around to make the world feel populated.</p>



<p>With all that being said, exploring Chernobylite 2 – even in the limited demo – doesn’t feel too sharp. It’s not the best experience and the new model that requires you to switch between a first- and third-person perspective to explore and fight is pretty jarring. I’d rather have it locked to a first-person perspective, just like the first game. </p>



<p>Combat is a little janky, and the first boss you encounter (a mini one, at least) presents a cumbersome, clunky battle that feels uninspired at best. There are a few classes to choose from, or you can pick a combination of multiple class types and use a mix of ranged, melee, and elemental attacks.</p>



<p>As I played the Chernobylite 2 demo, I found that no fight scenes felt satisfying or entertaining. I was just tapping buttons and awkwardly dropping targets.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chernobylite-2-early-access-release-date/">Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone</a> is a survival RPG of sorts. There are branching skill paths that players must traverse, and at the heart of the game sits the typical tropes that accompany that genre – base-building, crafting, upgrades, and looting. The UI is simple enough, but the density and depth of the menus and the sheer amount on display can feel a little overwhelming.</p>



<p>Within the first hour of the demo, you’re introduced to the game’s major mechanics, but that’s just a scratch on the surface of this game. Before long, I was plunged into a base defence sequence, taught how to manage and maintain a full-fledged doomsday bunker, and instructed how to harness the power of radiation, turning it into fearsome fire and ice attacks.</p>



<p>That all sounds a little scattered, right?</p>



<p> I loved the first Chernobylite game, and admittedly it was just as complex, but it felt like more of a slow burner. It’s my impression that you’re thrown into the deep end in Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone quite quickly.</p>

<p>Another thing I have an issue with is the voice acting in the game. The main character has the sound of a middle-aged man from Yorkshire, and it doesn’t suit the model one bit. Everyone seems to have an accent that doesn’t suit them, and I’m not sure to what extent these voice actors are real people…</p>



<p>I found various spelling errors and grammatical blips in the game’s UI and text-based segments, and I had a few visual glitches here and there as I explored the demo. One thing I didn’t like was the heavy motion blur and frame rate issues that I experienced. And I’m playing Chernobylite 2 on a <strong>very </strong>high-end PC, so that shouldn’t happen.</p>



<p>I was less than encouraged to learn that the Chernobylite 2 demo had been pushed live early because the team at The Farm 51 had experienced unresolvable technical issues with Steam. I hope that’s not a case of ‘start as you mean to go on’ and that further issues won’t surface down the line.</p>



<p>I feel it’s worth stressing that The Farm 51 is a small studio that has crowdfunded to finance much of the development of Chernobylite 2. It’s not fair to criticise the game without pointing that out.</p>



<p>Chernobylite 2 could be something special, if only because I’m a massive fan of post-apocalyptic games. I love titles like Fallout <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-patch-fixes-bugs-and-overhauls/">and STALKER 2</a>, and Chernobylite (2018) wowed me through and through. I’m willing to settle into the game and give it a solid run to produce a full review shortly, but right now, I’m approaching the full release with guarded expectations and a tentative attitude.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/613495/while-waiting-review-switch-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Boredom is something of a dying concept. Our phones, filled with games and videos and social feeds, allow us to fill every moment with <em>something</em>, whether we’re on a long flight or in line for 30 seconds waiting for coffee. But the silly and playful <em>While Waiting</em> is a good reminder that that can be a good thing — an opportunity for our minds to wander in unexpected directions.</p><p>Possibly the best way to describe <em>While Waiting</em> is that it’s what would happen if <em>WarioWare</em> also tried to tell the story of a human life. Which means that it’s a collection of extremely short, often weird minigames that all fit together to follow the story of a singular character through moments of waiting. It starts right from the beginning: the first thing you’re asked to do is wait to be born.</p><p>From there, you jump through time via idle moments. You have to wait for the commercials to end while watching a show with your parents, or wait to fall asleep while lying in bed, or wait for the water to heat up to take a shower. In each instance, you can simply wait and do nothing, and eventually, time will pass and whatever you’re waiting for will happen. But this is a game, after all, so you can also mess about.</p><p>There are a handful of stickers to collect in each level that hint at what you can do. While you wait to get your grade on an exam, for instance, you can sneak around the classroom and spy on your friends’ grades. It plays out like a stealth game, as you have to avoid your teacher’s gaze, lest you be forced back to your desk.</p><p>The tricky part is figuring out what you’re able to do, and how to do it, in a very limited timeframe. And since almost every level is different, that challenge repeats itself over the 100 or so minigames. This is eased by the incredibly simple controls. You use one stick to move around and one button to interact with things. That’s it, aside from another button that does nothing but let you play with a fidget toy.</p><p>For the most part, the minigames are very silly. You have to make sure you remembered to pack underwear for a flight or push through crowds to get a better view of fireworks. One of my favorite stages involved making up constellations to impress a date. It’s all very charming and goofy, often using wonky physics to add some slapstick comedy. Some of the stages can be melancholy as well; one involves simply waiting to grow up.</p><p>But each one shows that, in those brief moments of idling around that we’re so eager to fill with distractions, something surprising can happen — if only you’re bored enough to pay attention.</p><p><sub>While Waiting <em>is available now on the Nintendo Switch and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
