In Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, you play one of the hazmat-sporting goons at a government checkpoint during a zombie apocalypse. Your job is to let refugees through the gate one by one, and appraise them for evidence of infection. You know the kind of thing: hidden bite marks, weird heartbeats, high temperatures, people ripping your face off without showing appropriate documentation, etcetera. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can pop vagrants who are looking a bit oozy in glass-walled cells, but do bear in mind that not every illness is a case of the Romeros. That groaning woman might just have indigestion. Still, best keep her in the same pen as the guy whose arms have mysteriously rotted off, just to be safe. When not working out whether pink-eyed civvies are potential shamblers, you'll set up military defences and fend off hordes of 100% confirmed zombies. It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/papers-please">Papers Please</a> with base-building and wave survival elements, in short.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/">The Steam demo</a> has been very popular, attracting 1.8 million players in two months and garnering one million Steam wishlists. Like a stack of meat strategically left out in the baking midday sun, that popularity has attracted the hideous ghouls of Devolver Digital, who have signed on as publishers. To mark the occasion, here are some Key Features.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Immersive Inspection Mechanics: Use tools like UV flashlights, thermometers, and manual scanners to uncover signs of infection or contraband in people and their belongings.
</p>
<p>
- Resource Management: Balance limited supplies of test kits and inspection tools while maintaining order and ensuring your checkpoint remains secure.
</p>
<p>
- Dynamic Threats: Face an evolving queue of refugees--some healthy, some carrying ordinary illnesses, and others harboring deadly zombie pathogens.
</p>
<p>
- Intense Decision-Making: Choose whether to admit, quarantine, or liquidate individuals based on visual clues, document verification, and medical tests.
</p>
<p>
- Strategic Progression: Manage daily routines, from morning base reports to nighttime defenses, as the stakes rise with each passing day.
</p></blockquote>

I think this has the makings of an engrossing sim, but also a very bleak one. I'm interested to know whether there's any accompanying commentary on real-life border politics, or whether all of this is just yucking about with well-known movie tropes. In the absence of anything more substantial to say about the mechanics and supporting fiction, I would like to propose a more wholesome variation in which you try to work out whether every person at the checkpoint is secretly Buster Keaton or Barney the Dinosaur. 
</p>
<p>
Is this <em>the</em> Barney the Dinosaur or is it just a regular dinosaur called Barney or is it Buster Keaton dressed as Barney the Dinosaur? "I love you," you growl, caressing the barrel of your flamethrower. "Do <em>you</em> love <em>me</em>?<em> Are we a happy family?</em>"</p>
<p>If the subject remains silent, that's surefire evidence you've got a Keaton on your hands, and you should on no account permit him access or he'll start doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nkkUZ6e3jM">comical things with ladders</a> and reduce your crack squad of grizzled exterminators to a laughing stock. Actually, that sounds great, let him in already. Anyway, Quarantine Zone is out in November.

There was the moment when the judge in the case allowed one of the jurors to ask the then-Editor-in-Chief of <em>Jezebel </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/civil/ex-gawker-editor-hulk-hogan-had-limited-privacy-right-on-sex-tape/2269326/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/civil/ex-gawker-editor-hulk-hogan-had-limited-privacy-right-on-sex-tape/2269326/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether she had slept with<em> Gawker </em>owner Nick Denton</a></span> to get the job. It was unclear what bearing that would have had on the case. Also, Denton is gay. Every day in our political life is now this stupid, and with way more at stake for everyone involved.</p><p>Then there’s the bizarre trajectory the whole circus ultimately sent <em>Kotaku</em> itself on. It was sold at auction along with its non-Gawker sister sites to Univision, the Spanish-language broadcasting company that was then mounting a confused and ill-timed foray into digital media. Left mostly to its own devices, <em>Kotaku</em> briefly reached its highest headcount ever in 2018. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/univision-taps-vincent-sadusky-as-ceo-succeeding-randy-falco-1527026754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/univision-taps-vincent-sadusky-as-ceo-succeeding-randy-falco-1527026754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thanks to the shifting whims of distant CEOs</a></span>, the relative honeymoon was short-lived.

The new company was called G/O Media, short for Gizmodo/The Onion. Spanfeller told us in his very first meeting that he came up with it on a napkin just before the deal was finalized.</p><p>That anecdote proved a harbinger for how carelessly the websites themselves would be treated (“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/opinion/deadspin-sports.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/opinion/deadspin-sports.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stick to sports</a></span>”) over the subsequent years. I can tell you from experience that Spanfeller’s management style was an unusually disqualifying mix of ignorance, pettiness, bullying, gaslighting, and perversely ill-informed micro-management. I cannot, despite the dozens of hours I’ve wasted contemplating it, tell you what the logic behind any of it was.</p><p>What it achieved, however, was the slow, painstaking disfigurement of <em>Kotaku</em> amid an unceasing exodus of beloved colleagues, cuts to resources, and interference in its day-to-day operations (“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stick to guides</a></span>”), which have served millions of readers year-in-and-year-out for over two decades now. Some find it is easy to blame COVID, unions, and the hollowing out of the internet by tech monopolies for all of these things.

But I would be willing to bet the house we would never have been sold to fucking Jim Spanfeller.

To me, it will mark the end of one of the most idiotic storms <em>Kotaku</em> has ever weathered, which is saying something. July is also the month the site was sold to new owners Keleops, reuniting it with at least one of the other old Gawker sites, <em>Gizmodo</em>. I don’t like to piss on people’s graves, but I do like to toast the future, and <em>Kotaku</em>’s is finally one I’m looking forward to again. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000]]></content:encoded>

		<p>11 bit studios has announced that Frostpunk 2 will launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on 18th September, bringing the city management sequel to consoles almost a year to the day after the PC release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 2 | Console Release Date Trailer." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffDlQ5RsF4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frostpunk 2’s console release was expected for this summer, having been included on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/frostpunk-2-is-coming-to-consoles-this-summer/">the game’s roadmap updates from 11 bit</a>. The next stop after the console launch is the Spectrum DLC, which they cryptically described as being able to “help us learn more about ourselves and the people of our great city in more ways than one…” More expansions are then planned for 2026.</p>
<p>Another project for 11 bit is a remake of the frigid cult classic original, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/frostpunk-1886-has-been-announced-by-11-bit-studios/">Frostpunk 1886 announced at the game’s 7th anniversary</a> in April, promising to rebuild the game within Unreal Engine 5 and introduce some game mechanics from its sequel.</p>
<p>We didn’t review Frostpunk 2 for its PC release, though will look to catch up on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/frostpunk-2-wins-polish-game-of-the-year-at-digital-dragons/">Polish Game of the Year</a> game when it hits consoles, but looking back at that original game, Jason wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk review,</a> “Frostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it’s so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolfenstein-tv-series</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-production-for-prime-video.1253547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, a TV show based on id Software and Bethesda's legendary&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>franchise is currently in development, and it's set to air on Prime Video.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, the show will be produced by&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>studio Kilter Films, with executive producer duties being handled by Keyframe Films' James Altman and MachineGames' Jerk Gustafsson, the latter of whom served as director on&nbsp;2014's&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein: The New Order&nbsp;</em>and 2019's&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em>.</p>

<p>We don't yet know what the story of the series will be, but as Variety points out, the logline for the series is simply this: "the story of killing Nazis is evergreen". It's hard to argue with that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-colossus.jpg?itok=JWPaEvZx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-colossus.jpg?itok=p6g4rqpr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>TV series is in development for Amazon.</figcaption></figure><p>Although story details are being kept under wraps, if it were me, I'd probably adapt the narrative of&nbsp;<em>The New Order</em>; it's almost certainly the strongest the series has to offer.</p>

<p>Casting also hasn't been revealed yet, but if you ask me,&nbsp;<em>Reacher</em>'s Alan Ritchson was essentially born to play swole hero B.J. Blazkowicz, so if he doesn't end up in the lead role, something's gone seriously wrong.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Station Eleven&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Maniac&nbsp;</em>creator Patrick Somerville will serve as the showrunner for&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein</em>, so it'll essentially be up to him and Amazon what direction the show decides to take.</p>

<p>No third mainline game in MachineGames' rebooted&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>series has been revealed yet (I'm very much trying to ignore&nbsp;<em>Youngblood</em>); while&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/indiana-jones-and-great-circle" rel="nofollow">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>&nbsp;</em>had more than its fair share of Nazi-punching, this might be the closest you're going to get to more&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>for some time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-order.jpg?itok=y72U415q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-order.jpg?itok=WBlJYOG4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>games might not be on the way for a while, so the TV show could be the best you're going to get.</figcaption></figure><p>This&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>series is the latest in a string of video game-to-TV-series adaptations in recent years. Other successes on that front include <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-tv-show-proves-last-of-us-wasnt-fluke" rel="nofollow">Fallout</a>&nbsp;</i>(also made for Amazon), HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, and&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' <i>Arcane</i>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow">won't be the only&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>show soon enough</a>.</p>

<p>As well as these shows, plenty of as-yet-unadapted games are getting their own TV adaptations as well, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clash-of-clans-tv-show" rel="nofollow"><em>Clash of Clans</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-two-souls-tv-series" rel="nofollow"><em>Beyond: Two Souls</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-soon" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed</em></a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Call of Duty Season 5 arrives to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> next month, and Activision has confirmed the season will launch with the final map for Zombies. Treyarch has since released a series of teaser clips, showing what players can expect for this major story conclusion. This includes the map's Pack-a-Punch location and possible new enemy type with the "Mechaklaus."</p><p dir="ltr">Following the events of Season 3's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shattered-veil-story-easter-egg-guide-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/2900-6418/" data-ref-id="2900-6418">Shattered Veil</a>, the setting of the final map takes place in Janus Towers. Three short teaser clips have been released so far, and they all feature the perspective of Janus Tower security cameras with the grainy look of a '90s-style found footage film.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1948058077296722249" rel="nofollow ">first Zombies teaser</a> shows Janus Towers in chaos with fires inside the building and a glimpse of the undead. The <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1948378886670356717" rel="nofollow ">second teaser</a> seemingly reveals that one of the towers was being used to manufacture robots. It also gives a first look at the map's Pack-a-Pack machine, which is located by a large circular device that could be some sort of teleporter. Janus Towers is a set of three large towers in Liberty Falls, so the teleporter could be a way for players to navigate the separate locations.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1948741274833461339" rel="nofollow ">latest Zombies teaser</a> is even more intriguing, as it gives us the first look at what could be the map's elite enemy type or some other sort of miniboss threat. This likely foe is a bulky mech suit similar to the Panzers from previous Call of Duty Zombies games. This mech suit is already being dubbed the "Mechaklaus," as this was an enemy type previously leaked in the game files. The character inside the suit also looks and sounds like Klaus from Black Ops Cold War.</p><p dir="ltr">Klaus was a robot ally featured on the Mauer der Toten Zombies map, where he helped the main characters save the day and eventually sacrificed himself by walking into the Dark Aether. It's possible Treyarch is teasing that Klaus has returned from the Dark Aether with a mech-suit upgrade, or it could be a completely different Klaus manufactured by Richtofen in Janus Towers.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll likely get a full trailer and learn more details in the coming days, as Season 5 should launch on or around August 7.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/help-or-hindrance-we-asked-the-experts-what-the-bafflingly-large-confusing-uk-online-safety-act-could-mean-for-video-games.1253523/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Today,<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer"> the UK's new Online Safety Act</a> comes into effect, with the aim of making the internet safer - especially for children. It will apply to all "search services" and services that allow users to interact with one another, including social media, video-sharing platforms, and of course - video games.</p>
<p>While it's a UK law, it will apply to any company or service with a significant number of UK users, with Ofcom - the UK's independent regulator of online safety - enforcing compliance.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Act requires companies to take "robust action" against illegal content (including the likes of child sexual abuse, extreme pornography, or terrorism); and against content harmful for children (including pornography, bullying, or abusive content). Adults will also be impacted, allowing greater control over the type of content and the people they're able to engage with online.</p>
<p>But what does this mean for the video game industry? How will online game services be affected? And just how enforceable will this new Act be?</p>
<p>The Online Safety Act will be wide-reaching in its impact across the internet, but to what extent has the games industry really been considered during the hearing process?</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"From the moment the government had the idea of an Online Safety Bill and published its white paper on it in 2019, social media firms were in the crosshairs," says George Osborn, editor of Video Games Industry Memo who was head of campaign and communications at Ukie during the time of bill negotiations.</p>
<p>"This makes loads of sense because those platforms are more likely to be somewhere you can share harmful stuff. They have a bigger reach to more people. They let you share images and video content more easily. And it was hard to hold them to account, despite things like terror content, child sexual exploitation material and disinformation popping up on them."</p>
<p>This is why the likes of Discord, Reddit and BlueSky are rolling out new safety features. Just this week, BlueSky added age verification to its direct messaging.</p>
<p>"However, the decision to bring all services that have user-to-user communication meant that games would get folded in," Osborn continues. "And even though the industry did respond to consultations, spoke with ministers and with the new regulator Ofcom, there was little to no effort to understand how the bill would hit games companies or much focus on them.</p>
<p>"It's why the 300-page act barely mentions games (I think it literally references it once), even though it puts loads of responsibilities on companies."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Dr. Celia Pontin, director of public policy and public affairs at Flux Digital Policy, notes that such a wide-ranging regulation needs a variety of companies to be involved in the regulatory process - including video game companies of all sizes for diversity of voice.</p>
<p>"Although trade bodies played their vital part in engaging with legislators and regulators, when you look at the responses submitted to public consultations there were no individual voices from the video games industry beyond a couple of the largest organisations," says Pontin. "Video games companies of all types and sizes need to feel empowered to get involved in policy development because when it comes down to implementation, they are the experts in their field."</p>
<p>From today, any game with user-to-user communication (such as voice or text chat) that's available in the UK will need to follow the law. Broadly, Osborn explains, studios will need moderation tools to remove harmful content, better reporting processes, and measures in place to protect children if a game is accessible to them.</p>
<p>"That's the bare-bones version of the law," Osborn warns. "The reality is that a lawyer will likely tell you that you've got to do a hell of a lot more to meet the provisions of the 300-page act and the many volumes of guidance put out by Ofcom. And given that the regulator can dish out fines of up to £18m or 10 percent of your global turnover, and in some rare cases bang up a senior exec, it is something that you really need good advice on quickly."</p>
<p>He adds: "The only crumb of comfort is that Ofcom is still rolling out the final bits of the act and has said it'll take its time to fully enforce. But with games having historically been a target for moral panics and policymaker madness, you don't want to bet too closely on not being picked up."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Call of Duty will be one of the biggest series impacted by the OSA, thanks to voice chat and communication features. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Activision</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Speed is certainly of the essence, as Mike Pappas, CEO of Modulate explains. Modulate is a voice moderation service for regulation and compliance, used in <a href="https://www.modulate.ai/case-studies/modulate-activision-case-study">Activision's Call of Duty</a> and <a href="https://www.modulate.ai/blog/rockstar-gta-online">Rockstar's GTA Online</a>. Pappas states the new requirements "re-affirm the value of what we're doing."</p>
<p>"While most online platforms today have some flavour of content moderation, the new codes require things like 'swift action' on harmful content and determining appeals 'promptly', requiring a renewed focus on speed," he says.</p>
<p>"This reinforces the need for AI moderation (ideally in combination with humans!), as AI is the only way to maintain high speed at high scale when conducting this work. Further, these codes push platforms to more proactively monitor for harmful content, relying less on user reports alone - which is something we've been pushing for years, and a capability ToxMod is built to support from the very beginning."</p>
<p>AI will likely feature heavily in age verification tools. Just last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">Roblox introduced new safety features</a> including an AI to estimate a teenager's age by taking a video selfie (a similar feature is being used on BlueSky, as of 25th July, too).</p>
<p>k-ID is another company focused on digital compliance, listing the likes of Capcom and Discord as clients. "This is a significant moment that puts online safety at the heart of game design," says CEO and co-founder Kieran Donovan. "It has been encouraging to see some businesses not view these obligations as a compliance burden and instead focus on the positive opportunities that effective child safety systems provide. Forward-thinking studios understand that it will enable them to create age-appropriate experiences that empower young users and build trust, unlocking audiences they couldn't safely serve before."</p>
<p>There are plenty of challenges ahead, then, for developers. Yet while Ofcom may have the biggest AAA games in its sites, will this new legislation disproportionately affect indie developers who may not have the resources to meet requirements?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Smaller games with less explicit chat functionality, like Sky: Children of Light, are left in a predicament by the OSA. | <span>Image credit: <cite>ThatGameCompany</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"It is my understanding there are different expectations placed on studios of different sizes to help mitigate these challenges, both in terms of what they are expected to do and in what timeframe," notes Dr. Rachel Kowert, PhD, research psychologist and founder of <a href="https://rkowert.com/psychgeist/">Psychgeist</a>.</p>
<p>However, Osborn states the Act is "far too big for indies who have chat functions to comply with easily".</p>
<p>"Back when it was being passed," he says, "the bill was constantly referred to as a 'Christmas tree' because people kept whacking baubles onto it while it took years and years and years to pass.</p>
<p>"And the result of that is it empowered Big Tech and social media companies, rather than putting a muzzle on them. Yes, there are loads of ways they can be collared now. But because they have big legal teams, great external counsel and policy pros and public affairs agencies lobbying for them, the biggest businesses have been able to pay up for the right advice to adapt their services to meet the rules in advance."</p>
<p>He adds: "But for small businesses including indie game developers who have the misfortune to have things like text and voice chat in their games, following all the rules is really hard." Even with the likes of Modulate and k-ID to assist, it remains hard for small businesses to comply in the short and long term, says Osborn.</p>
<p>Pontin concurs: "Although Ofcom has acknowledged concerns over varying levels of impact and adopted what they term a 'risk based and proportionate approach', there's no getting away from the fact that some requirements will have disproportionately larger effects on indie developers in terms of resources or even technical feasibility. Depending on what services they provide, they may need to implement or license age assurance systems, content moderation tools and secure reporting mechanisms, potentially requiring substantial investment in technology and engineering.</p>
<p>"There are also costs in understanding and executing the auditing and reporting requirements, since risk assessments, audits, and reports require specific staff and processes. The compliance cost associated with the OSA could represent a significant barrier to entry or continued presence in the market, particularly for small developers, who might seek to minimise this by reducing the use of social and UGC features in their games. Importantly, some indie studios may not have access to the legal expertise to understand the extensive requirements of the Act in the first place."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Fortite developer, Epic, has more resources to respond to measures like the OSA than smaller devs. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Epic</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Live-service games will likely feel the brunt of legislation, due to their heavy use of online communication. And already it's proving difficult to launch and maintain live-service games in the current climate, especially as a handful of big names dominate the genre.</p>
<p>Kowert believes this new legislation will have a positive impact on the genre. "It will require greater investment and prioritisation in their trust and safety efforts, which in the end is a win-win for everyone," says Kowert. "Research has consistently shown that players do not want to spend time in social spaces that are characterised by disruptive or exploitative behaviour. Making them safer by design, and integrating more robust trust and safety features, will not only create a better player experience but a safer online experience for everyone."</p>
<p>Still, Osborn notes the barrier for entry for developers has now been raised, and therefore favours "established big players over new market entrants".</p>
<p>"This means that if you want to enter the market with anything that's live-service and brings users together, you have to think about designing games with no meaningful chat functionality at all, limiting interactions to pre-programmed button based inputs, or embed something like Discord's social SDK into your game to shift the compliance burden elsewhere," he says.</p>
<p>"And if you're thinking about doing anything user-generated content related or with rich media sharing - like video or images - you're going to have to think even harder about what you need to do to comply."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>OFCOM has been charged with enforcing the new measures. | <span>Image credit: <cite>OFCOM</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Perhaps the biggest question of all is, just how enforceable is the Online Safety Act? And will users simply find workarounds for new safety features? After all, underage children have long played adult games without parental supervision.</p>
<p>"This is the big question and a valid one," says Kowert. "While it's true that kids often find ways to bypass age restrictions, this act is still a step in the right direction. It's certainly more effective than an outright ban, which not only fails to stop access but also removes any opportunity for regulation or safeguards. At least with a structured framework like this, there's room for oversight, education, and harm reduction. It's not a perfect solution, but it's far better than leaving players completely unprotected."</p>
<p>Pontin notes that age restrictions won't have as much of a bearing considering they don't take into account the functions that bring a game under the Online Safety Act - it's specifically focused on online communication, which not all games have regardless of rating.</p>
<p>"All in all, the OSA is very enforceable when it comes to the actions that providers are expected to take," says Pontin. "In a clear signal of how seriously they intend to take their role, Ofcom has already started an enforcement programme on aspects of the OSA and is engaging with a number of games companies - we are not flying under the radar as a sector and companies cannot assume that they will be overlooked. Ofcom has a lot of tools for enforcement, including requiring ISPs to block sites in extreme cases, and penalties can be high."</p>
<p>Osborn concludes Ofcom has a "serious challenge" ahead of it, as it's essentially "regulating the whole internet" and it's "practically impossible for it to stay on top of everything online."</p>
<p>"But generally, the point of laws like this is not to catch every infraction," he continues. "Instead, it gives regulators tools to tackle harmful stuff when it hits the biggest platforms (i.e. lots of people can be exposed to it), to tackle the most obviously harmful stuff when it pops up (e.g. Ofcom pursuing forums that promote self-harm and suicide), or address consumer complaints when they see something that the law doesn't allow."</p>
<p>This, he believes, is a "mixed picture" for games and the lack of attention paid to the industry during the passage of the bill highlights a perceived lack of expertise from Ofcom. In all, Osborn describes the Act as "disappointing".</p>
<p>"The Act has really good intentions, but it's been bounced into a place where it is bafflingly large, confusing and ultimately strengthens services it was meant to contain," he says. "That's not what anyone who is interested in online safety wants, and I hope the act is amended in the years ahead."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/invincible-vs">Invincible Vs</a> has had its sixth character revealed ahead of a public demo at Evo early in August.
</p>
<p>Battle Beast, a big furry lion man with a big mace, has a shiny new gameplay trailer. Released on official Invincible Vs social media platforms, the trailer shows a handful of combos, special moves, and his super finish smashing apart in a downpour of viscera. Lovely stuff.
</p>
<p>Invincible Vs - a 3v3 tag fighter based on the popular comic book series and Amazon animated show - was first shown off to the public <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-showcase-2025-round-up-everything-announced">at June's Xbox Games Showcase</a>. Since then, we've had a few peaks at the game's development via little vlogs from developer Quarter Up, a game formed of former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killer-instinct">Killer Instinct</a> 2013 devs alongside new talent.</p>

<p>The game, while far from a full release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/invincible-vs-has-all-the-right-fighting-foundations-preview">has the potential to be a bit of a big deal</a>. Invincible Vs has a lot of talent working on it behind the scenes, it's an adaptation of a popular current IP, and it's a tag fighter of all things! 
</p>
<p>Those going to Vegas next month will be able to try it out themselves, including us! Let us know what you think of the game's initial six characters down below, as well as who you'd like to see added to the cast.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/invincible-vs-reveals-fan-favourite-character-ahead-of-public-demo]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Have you been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, and want to have both more company than the solo mode and less of a crowd than the three-player co-op? Well, you’ll be glad to hear that a patch is coming next week to add a two player mode on 30th July.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Two Player Mode Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eWqBTAYa8h4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Duo Expeditions will be added to Elden Ring Nightreign in patch 1.02, and update that will also bring quality-of-life UI improvements, such as having more Relics filtering options. Full patch notes will doubtless arrive alongside the update.</p>
<p>While good, Elden Ring Nightreign has not gathered the universal acclaim of its predecessor and currently sits on a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-nightreign/">77 on Metacritic</a>, though that didn’t stop millions of eager FromSoftware fans diving in as soon as possible. We gave the game a solid<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/"> 7/10 in our review,</a> with Jason saying, “Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun multiplayer offshoot, but it also doesn’t come close to the dizzying heights we’re used to seeing from FromSoftware. It’s an interesting experiment, and I am glad it exists despite my mixed feelings, but it’s a shallow happiness when I expect far more profound experiences from this company.”</p>

<p>On social media, we spotted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1m8z5ya/did_anyone_else_know_this/?share_id=aSVBH1olEymD2Q9gTScEH&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">thread from the donkeykong subreddit</a> being shared which revealed to us that, if you die in DK's latest adventure — whether it be to an enemy, in the lava, or by taking too much damage in any of the standard layer levels (not the challenges) — DK's corpse will be left waiting in a mound of gold.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>If you return to the statue and break it, you'll get back some of the gold you lost when you died — not all 500 of it, but a little bit. That's very similar to retrieving your souls from the enemy that slayed you or from the ground where you died in Dark Souls.</p>

<p>Look, we know that comparing <em>anything</em> to From Software's seminal action RPG series is walking a fine tightrope — especially when it's something so starkly different, or when it's just describing difficulty.</p>
<p>But in this case, we think the comparison is pretty fair. And honestly, it's just really cool to find your golden DK statue and pose with it.</p>
<p>Surf's up?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Game Studios has <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1948756850171662413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered has registered over 9 million players since its launch on April 22. The developer shared the news with a brief message and a picture of the iconic 'adoring fan', a Wood Elf commoner who becomes the player character's "groupie" once they have become the new Grand Champion in the Arena. The adoring fan's hair has been styled into a nine for the occasion.</p>



<p><em>To everyone who emerged as a hero of Kvatch, mastered Arch-Mage, rose to Grand Champion, banished the Blackwood Company, gallivanted as the Gray Fox, and listened to the Night.</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you for sharing in our worlds. ❤️</em></p>



<p>Oblivion Remastered immediately garnered the attention of Elder Scrolls fans, <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-breaks-4-million-players-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breaking the four million player milestone in just two days of its release</a>. Of course, the fact that it is available on Game Pass across Xbox Series S|X and PC undoubtedly helped a great deal.</p>



<p>Even so, game industry analytics firm Newzoo <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the game delivered 'outstanding revenue performance' and became a benchmark for future remasters. Circana had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certified</a> that Oblivion Remastered was the best-selling game of April 2025 in the United States across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, all this success was not enough to prevent Virtuos, the developer behind the remaster, from <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-developer-virtuos-confirms-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cutting nearly 280 employees</a> across its European and Asian offices. It is unclear how these layoffs will impact the game's future support. The game has notoriously inherited the original title's performance issues while roaming the open world, specifically the near-constant hitching. While Update 1.2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-patch-1-2-30-fps-rtx-5080-native-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought some improvements</a>, there's still a lot of room for further fixes in this regard. A much improved performance would certainly make exploration even better in a game that is all about that type of gameplay experience, like most titles in the Elder Scrolls franchise. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>The past few years have made the future of video games feel a little bleak. Endless layoffs. The ongoing disruption of creative roles by immediately embracing AI at all costs. Exploding budgets and unpredictable sales. </em></p><p><em>What probably wasn't on your—or our—bingo card, though, was the role credit card companies might play in the process. And yet, the pressure applied to Steam and itch.io has it's put the commercial viability of all kinds of important games, now and in the future, in serious doubt.</em></p><p><em>We talked extensively about this topic on the latest Remap Radio, but that was recorded before all the itch.io stuff went down. Naturally, we haven't been able to shake the topic from our heads in a variety of ways.</em></p><p><em>In this case, it's Rob and Patrick looking at the topic from a much broader lens, about the role media plays in the development of identity, of the conversations parents are afraid to have with their children, and what a "dangerous" internet even is in a world of artificial boogeymen.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Ages ago I was in this creative writing class. Intro-level so the talent levels were all over the map and some of the stories people contributed were clearly more exercises in journaling or therapy than writing. It led to some awkward moments, but the one that I think about a lot is this story a particularly untalented student contributed.</p><p>It was a gothic, hallucinatory story of child abuse described ineptly in lurid detail. It was deeply unpleasant to read and also incredibly stupid (the angel Michael showed up at the end and read a PSA about child abuse). But the point of a creative writing class to is to give and receive feedback so we all went around the room discussing this story. Nobody was being a dick, everyone was kind of uncomfortable, but was trying gently to talk about why it wasn’t good and things that could have made it better. Finally the professor, who was a delightful and sensitive man, said, “This story is just incredibly heightened but does not embrace any of the fantastical elements it feels like it’s reaching for. It’s unrealistic and confusing in what it portrays. It could be toned down or turned up, but it’s just not really convincing or compelling as it is.”</p><p>Our poor author had been getting quieter and angrier throughout the session but now she snapped. “Unrealistic? No convincing? It’s funny you say that, because I lived through stuff like this.”</p><p>Patrick, you could have heard a pin drop. Nobody really knew what to say. If she was being accurate then we’d wrung something out of her that it didn’t feel like we had any business knowing… but I can’t overstate how bad and weird the story was. The story wasn’t sexual but the attempts at portraying the violence were undeniably clumsily erotic, so now everyone mostly just wanted to move on and pretend the last twenty minutes had not happened.</p><p>I remembered it, though, both because it was an incredibly embarrassing conversation for all concerned, but it was also really instructive about the degree to which <em>fantasies are not wishes</em>. To this day I have no idea what exactly that girl had gone through, but telling<em> that </em>story in <em>that </em>way did something for her. I try and bear this in mind when it comes to all manner of adult or erotic content that’s out there. Sometimes the act of creating and consuming that material serves some kind of therapeutic purpose, sometimes it’s just a way of touching some kind of forbidden darkness, and sometimes it’s just the titillation of the forbidden. But as with all creative work, the notion that depiction or exploration equates to endorsement or enthusiasm is incredibly wrong-headed. Fundamentally, the inner experiences of feelings of the people on either side of that transaction, creation or consumption, are unknowable to me but I don’t like making assumptions and tend to adopt a “not my business if no one is being harmed” approach to all kinds of stuff I find unpleasant or just alien.</p><p>I think most people tend to draw a similar line. Few people <em>want </em>to think of themselves as busybodies. But we run into problems when we try and define “harm”. Right now games platforms are being besieged by payment processors who are cracking down on content they have decided they find objectionable, either out of their own inclination or because they are being pressured by activist groups. Notionally, the interest being served here is keeping inappropriate material out of the hands of children who can be harmed by being exposed to it, or out of the hands of people who can be made <em>more likely </em>to harm others if they consume and enjoy such material.</p><p>I don’t think those concerns are entirely without merit. Consumption of a lot of porn seems like it could and does stoke some fairly warped views around sexuality and relationships. But is porn doing that <em>to </em>someone or is the kind of person who compulsively watches hours and hours of porn servicing views that have already become warped and unhealthy in some way? Is this a problem that is solved by censorship and, more importantly, is the <em>fucking credit card company </em>the organization that should be making those rulings?</p><p>I think that’s pretty patently not the case but I also have to admit that it’s very easy for me to retreat to a kind of lazy libertarian perspective on this stuff because I don’t have kids and mostly think the interests and rights of parents are a smokescreen used to lend a high-mindedness to attempts at patriarchal control. I do wonder, though, would I be more concerned about the propagation of creepy, misogynistic or perverted content if I had kids who were in danger of stumbling across it or coming of age among peers who have completely unfettered access to all kinds of disturbing stuff?</p><p>These moral crusades are often launched on behalf of children and parents, and it’s very easy for me to roll my eyes and dismiss all their points but I am curious where you are with some of this stuff? Do you have dreads around this type of content as well?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@ltoinel?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Ludovic Toinel</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Light topic this week, huh? We’re going to London and Paris next week, and in telling a neighbor about this, they handed me a bunch of spare tourist material from an old trip they went on. You know, maps, an English-to-French hand dictionary, etc. It’s the kind of stuff you handle on a phone these days, but it was kind of them, so I took it home, figuring my oldest would get a kick out of it. She started to page through the dictionary, and the first thing she shouted out loud to the room was “Can I make love to you?”</p><p>I gave her a quizzical look, unsure what to do. She gave me an <em>equally</em> quizzical look, likely informed by my unexpected pause. Without skipping a beat, she shrugged her shoulders and flipped to the next page.</p><p>The topic of “Can I make love to you?” has, thankfully, not come up since.</p><p>This is a longer way of saying: I don’t know. It’s not a problem I have to deal with and I’m happy to not have an answer about it because it doesn’t have easy answers and I’ll deal with it when I have no choice.</p><p>The answer I tell myself is that I will raise young people with the tools to guide them through. I cannot be there to help them cross the street every time. At some point, you have to trust they’ll look both ways. The same responsibility for looking left and right falls to parents teaching their children to navigate the internet. I do not intend to install network sniffers to monitor the browsing activity of my kids, once they are of the age where you should begin handing responsibility of their life and decisions over to them, not you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">You ever wake up and think it'll be a normal day only to discover that literally everything you thought you knew about reality is wrong? That's what happened to <em>me</em> today when I woke up, sat down to work, and then read a post stating that Mario and Peach are apparently "good friends" as opposed to, I dunno, anything else I might have thought they were to one another.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>"Princess Peach and Mario are good friends and help each other out whenever they can."</p><p>Via: Nintendo Today app. <a href="https://t.co/IsyQqe2KLz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IsyQqe2KLz</a></p></div>— Kābī (@KirPinkFury) <a href="https://twitter.com/KirPinkFury/status/1948141191440286122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This aggravating discovery comes from the Nintendo Today app. The post that originally included this information is now gone due to the app's regularly updating, but has since been preserved in several spots including by <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1948141191440286122" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter user @KirPinkFury</a>, who originally surfaced it online. The post, which was a profile on Princess Peach, included the sentence, "Princess Peach and Mario are good friends and help each other out whenever they can." Good friends, you say? What about all those times they definitely smooched?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look," you might say, "they could be good friends and in a relationship. It's important to be friends with the person you love also." Sure, you're correct. But who's describing a relationship like that? I don't go around referring to my husband as my "good friend". That would probably confuse several people, including him! The only conclusion I can come to here is that Nintendo is trying to distance Mario and Peach from the previous very, very, very direct ways in which it indicated they were, at minimum, romantically interested.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo admittedly has been deeply inconsistent about this over the years. Peach has been referred to as Mario's "special someone," they've been shown on multiple occasions to have some level of romantic interest in one another. Nintendo's Yoshiaki Koizumi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190822105931/https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/06/17/marios-developers-on-hat-capture-and-peachs-love-for-mario.aspx?amp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has directly said in an interview</a> before that Mario "carries a torch" for Peach. Nintendo celebrated them as a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/434371505024409600" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">romantic couple, pink hearts and all</a>, for Valentine's Day at least once. And Mario even tried to propose to her at the end of Super Mario Odyssey. Though she refused at the time, she had also just gone through a wild ordeal with Bowser where he tried to kidnap her and force her into marrying <em>him. </em>If I had just been kidnapped into an attempted forced marriage and then rescued and my boyfriend tried to propose to me the second I was rescued, I'd probably tell him to take a hike too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But whatever! I guess they're just friends or something. Just like Link and Zelda, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tears-of-the-kingdom-hints-that-link-and-zelda-are-finally-in-a-relationship">two characters who live together and definitely sleep in the same bed</a>. Next they're going to try and tell me there's nothing going on between all those people in Fire Emblem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone who's wanted to run through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> with just their trusted duos partner is getting their wish. FromSoftware <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWqBTAYa8h4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed today</a> that a two-player Duo Expeditions mode will arrive in Elden Ring Nightreign Patch 1.02.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch will arrive on July 30, allowing just two Nightfarers to embark on expeditions to strike down the Nightlords together. Before now, the only options were to either head out on a solo expedition or team up with two others for a trio.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Duos has been a hotly requested feature, as it there seems to be a solid contingent of players who'd like to play with just one other person. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players">Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki previously said</a> the two-player mode was something that was "overlooked" during development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the wake of Elden Ring Nightreign's launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-duo-expeditions-on-the-way-fromsoftware-confirms-as-sales-jump-to-35-million">FromSoftware committed to adding Duo Expeditions</a> as a mode. And now, several weeks later, the option is finally ready. I imagine this should be a nice option for playing with your pals and loved ones, without the need to add a random third to the mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 1.02 also brings a few other updates in the quality-of-life department, including more filtering options for your Relic pool. Considering players probably have a hefty amount of Relics at this point (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-player-discovers-theres-a-maximum-number-of-relics-you-can-store">hopefully not too many</a>), the added sorting options should be nice too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The eager duos and everyone else queuing up will have some tough fights ahead of them too, as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-will-start-rolling-out-more-enhanced-bosses-at-the-end-of-july">next Everdark cycle spins up at the end of July</a>. Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast, and the Fissure in the Fog are all set to receive their enhanced Everdark Sovereign fights starting July 31. Solos, duos, and trios alike should have a good time learning these bouts, if the past few Everdark Sovereigns are any indication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's good to see this particular playstyle finally get accomodated, and considering it's been a little under two months since Nightreign launched, it didn't take that long either. It's certainly been intriguing to watch FromSoftware work on a live service-oriented game like Elden Ring Nightreign, and considering <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-will-get-dlc-bosses-and-characters-according-to-steam-page-slip-up">the potential for DLC down the road</a>, I'm betting there's still more to see in the Lands Between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-finally-gets-its-two-player-duos-mode-on-july-30]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Crytek was founded in 1999 by three Turkish-German brothers, Cevat, Avni, and Faruk Yerli. The brothers have come together to bring a limited-series documentary about everything Crytek, with the first part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxnHi6SltHk&amp;t" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already online</a>. For the first time, fans will be able to see previously unseen footage, explore early concept art, and delve deeper into the stories that made the studio what it was.</p><p>The documentary starts with the story of the brothers getting a black box PC from their father, which they said was for "studying," but they knew what they wanted to do with their lives. They also knew what they didn't want.</p><p>"We cannot be a typical German game company, because German game companies, usually used to, back then, make strategy games, RPG games very complicated to play," said Avni. "So our idea was to offer an experience, which is open-world sandbox experiences, semi-sandbox experiences, where you can also see the environment, walk around, experience everything. And that was completely new."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxnHi6SltHk" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HxnHi6SltHk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Initially based in Coburg, Germany, the studio aimed to push the boundaries of real-time 3D graphics in video games. Their early tech demos, such as X-Isle, caught the attention of Nvidia and led to a publishing deal with Ubisoft for their first major game, Far Cry, released in 2004.</p><p>The first part mostly covers the development of Crysis and how they wanted to take what they learned from Far Cry and expand on that, pushing the limits on graphics at the time.</p><p>"In Far Cry, the art department created a natural environment as they have imagined it. Like they built the jungle out of their head, so to say. And in Crysis, we mimicked nature as closely as possible. I think that made a massive difference. Even though in some areas, the technology wasn't so different," said Crysis 3D artist, Marcel Schaika.</p><p>"The way we built the environment, the way we used the technology, like really specifically trying to mimic, how nature behaves, how leaves look like when the sun shines through them how the ocean looks like, how the water refracts, and so on," Schaika continued. "The artists working together with the engineers to really try to create a virtual environment that looks just like the references that we have gathered. I think that mindset made Crysis stand out so much in comparison as well."</p><p>Part one is only 20 minutes long, and it's unclear how many parts of the documentary will be released.</p><p>In other Crytek news, the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crytek-announces-significant-layoffs-as-crysis-4-is-put-on-hold/1100-6529419/" data-ref-id="1100-6529419">underwent layoffs</a> earlier this year, resulting in a new Crysis sequel being put on hold.</p>

		<p>Hello User and welcome to your new Internet experience. Before you embark on this amazing journey please scan your face, a government issued ID, your birth certificate and provide payment details. Do not worry, all of this personal information will be completely safe. There has never been a breach of personal data in the history of the Internet, and your identity will not be compromised.</p>
<p>What can we show you today, User? I see that you have selected content labelled as “not safe for work”. Do you have all of the required ID and face scans to validate your age? Yes, we know you provided it earlier, but think of the Internet like a vast shopping centre where every cashier will need to check your information. Don’t worry, it is all legitimate and safe, a process managed by global partners. It should be no problem for you to let everyone know what kind of things you are into.</p>
<div id="attachment_462166"><p id="caption-attachment-462166">We might be due another UK-themed Not Tonight –&nbsp;Image credit: PanicBarn,<br>No More Robots</p></div>
<p>Excellent, your ID all checks out, User. However, I am sorry to say that you cannot access the content you requested. Yes, you have the funds to purchase this legitimate content, but your payment processor has deemed the topics contained within this media unacceptable and has requested it be removed from sale. User, you do not need to know why a corporation that is not even based in your geographic area can make this decision for you. It is for your own good. There is plenty of other content you can view instead across the excellent world wide web.</p>
<p>When we say world wide web, we mean to say websites and services that are permitted by your Internet Service Provider and government legislation. Gone are the days where you would have to endlessly click on different websites with their own content and ideas. Today, we have made your Internet experience much more convenient, directing you to the same few websites to meet all of your content and shopping needs. You won’t need to worry about visiting those smaller sites ever again, when we can provide you with the latest information on a more curated selection of platforms. You can see everyone’s creativity and permitted ideas in one place!</p>

<p>We appreciate everyone on the Internet, but some content is just better for you. Do not worry too much about things being produced by smaller creators, or historically marginalised groups, we will give you so much approved content that you will come to appreciate ignoring them. Most importantly, your children will also be kept completely safe from interacting with undesirable content and ideas.</p>
<p>So again, User, welcome to the Internet. A place of freedom*, creativity*, learning*, and connection*.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>KRAFTON, the publisher that has more recently been in the news due to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">messy back-and-forth</a> with the co-founders of Unknown Worlds, who allege that <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">KRAFTON delayed Subnautica 2 to avoid paying a $250 million bonus</a> to the Unknown Worlds team, is back in the news for a different reason today, a studio acquisition. Eleventh Hour Games, the team behind Last Epoch, has just been acquired by KRAFTON.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/last-epoch-qa-on-runemaster-class-1-0-launch-and-advantages-over-diablo-iv/">Eleventh Hour Games</a> (EHG) was founded back in 2017, with chief executive officer Judd Cobler going to Reddit to find people with game development experience to make what would become Last Epoch. A 2018 Kickstarter raised enough funds to get the studio going, and on April 30, 2019, it launched into Early Access on Steam. It didn't hit its <a href="https://wccftech.com/last-epoch-shows-off-unique-trade-system-ahead-of-1-0-launch/">1.0 launch</a> until just last year, February 21, 2024, and according to a <a href="https://press.krafton.com/KRAFTON-Acquires-Eleventh-Hour-Games-Creators-of-Last-Epoch">press release</a> for its acquisition by KRAFTON, Last Epoch has sold 3 million copies since last February.</p>



<p>"<em>Through this acquisition, KRAFTON aims to secure a competitive franchise IP in the Action RPG genre and further strengthen its position in the global market," </em>writes KRAFTON. "<em>The deal provides EHG with the resources and infrastructure to better serve its community, ensuring that Last Epoch</em> <em>continues to evolve and meet the expectations of its growing player base. The acquisition will also enable EHG to scale development across console platforms and expand seasonal content pipelines, setting the stage for long-term franchise development. KRAFTON will support EHG’s live service roadmap, team expansion, and international publishing, while allowing the studio to retain full leadership and creative autonomy</em>."</p>



<p>KRAFTON's head of corporate development, Maria Park, added that the publisher is "<em>thrilled to welcome Eleventh Hour Games into the KRAFTON family,"</em> and that EHG's "<em>rise from a grassroots studio to a globally renowned ARPG developer is nothing short of remarkable."</em> Park also claims that this acquisition "<em>reaffirms our unwavering passion for great games and the teams that build them. We will always stand behind developers who put players first,"</em> which is difficult to see as anything but a snide shot towards the Subnautica 2 co-founders. </p>



<p>On the other side of the aisle, for Eleventh Hour Games, Cobler adds that this acquisition is "<em>a dream come true</em>" for the studio, and that KRAFTON's "<em>deep-rooted passion for ARPGs aligns perfectly with our mission."</em> </p>



<p>"<em>With KRAFTON's support, EHG is poised to elevate the </em><em>Last Epoch</em> franchise to even greater heights. As a studio built from players of the genre, we couldn’t be more excited for its future."</p>



<p>Due to the ongoing legal battle between KRAFTON and Unknown Worlds, it's difficult to take any of these statements at face value when we see how that relationship has eroded in the last four years. Unknown Worlds co-founder Charlie Cleveland also said that Unknown Worlds and KRAFTON were "<em>aligned</em>" in their goals when <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">KRAFTON's acquisition of Unknown Worlds was announced</a>. But, according to Cleveland and the rest of the co-founders, KRAFTON's attitude towards the studio turned on a dime within the last year. </p>



<p>Hopefully, today's statements remain true for Eleventh Hour Games and KRAFTON in the future.</p>

Instead of launching on August 22, the standalone spin-off will now release on September 19.</p><p>In a letter to fans, Techland explains that, after evaluating the generally positive preview impressions, it has decided to delay the game to address certain criticisms and add additional polish.</p><p>“We understand that this may be disappointing, but our experience has shown how important the first impression is,” Techland states in a press release. “With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscenes and player animations further as well as adding last little details.”</p><p>Techland promises to keep fans in the loop with regular updates, and Dying Light: The Beast will still be playable at Gamescom next month.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0GCr2P9510"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0GCr2P9510" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Dying Light: The Beast began as an expansion for Dying Light 2 Stay Human that was fleshed out into a standalone title.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Hot off the release of The Alters, 11 Bit Studios has announced the long-awaited console release date for its difficult city-builder survival simulation title, Frostpunk 2. The game took home the award for Best Sim/Strategy Game at The Game Awards 2024, and now it will be made available for a wider audience this September.</p><p>Frostpunk 2 puts you in the shoes of "The Steward," the leader of New London in a wintry apocalypse set 30 years after the first title, which <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/frostpunk/b/pc/archive/2018/04/23/frostpunk-review-a-frigid-unrelenting-survival-success.aspx">earned an 8.75 out of 10</a> from <em>Game Informer </em>when it was released in 2018. Throughout the campaign, players must manage a much larger city and its resources and people, making near-impossible decisions along the way to ensure the populace's survival.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffDlQ5RsF4s"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffDlQ5RsF4s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>11 Bit claims to have implemented many lessons from its console port of the first Frostpunk, which arrived in 2019, a year and a half after the PC version launched. The circular interface has been fine-tuned to allow for the intricate keyboard controls to translate even better on gamepad. Players will be able to use controller bumpers to cycle between districts and access a dynamic radial menu for actions involving resource piles. For those on PC who would like to use gamepad controls, the PC version will receive a free update adding this control scheme as an option.</p><p>"Initially, we tried to carry over as many interface solutions as possible," production coordinator Igor Skibinski said in a press release. "But the two games differ so much in terms of gameplay that we had to adapt and rework those systems over time. Still, our main focus was to make interaction with the game feel seamless – so players never have to think about how to play while they're playing. Our ambition is to once again prove that even complex strategy games can feel intuitive and satisfying on consoles."</p><p>Additionally, 11 Bit Studios partnered with Skybound Games to create two premium physical editions to accompany the digital release. The Icebreaker Edition includes the full game on disc, a pop-up diorama of New London, a digital novella called <em>Warm Flesh</em>, and a digital artbook that chronicles the creation of Frostpunk 2's world. The Whiteout Edition includes all of the Icebreaker Edition content, plus a multi-layered shadow box with integrated LED lighting, a Deluxe Edition upgrade that grants access to three upcoming DLC releases, a metal-and-enamel keychain, two New London art postcards, Frostpunk-themed stickers, and one of two possible embroidered faction patches. The Icebreaker Edition will be $50, while the Whiteout Edition retails for $100.</p><p>Frostpunk 2 arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) on September 18. Although&nbsp;<em>Game Informer&nbsp;</em>was shut down during the time when we would have otherwise reviewed it, we came away from a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2024/05/27/breaking-the-ice">2024 hands-on session with very positive impressions</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/25/frostpunk-2-arrives-on-consoles-in-september]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new Plants vs Zombies game is reportedly seeing some movement behind the scene, with a potential release date coming up this year. Plants vs Zombies Reloaded (or Replanted, if the report is to be believed), is said to be a remake of the original game, which may be sprouting up this October.
</p>
<p>This information comes <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-version-revisitee-de-plants-vs-zombies-en-approche-on-vous-revele-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-60272">courtesy of Dealabs</a>, a website known for its history of leaks that have largely proven correct. 
</p>
<p>According to the publication, Plants vs Zombies Replanted will launch on 23rd October. Dealabs claims the game will be revealed within the month, and sell for €19.99 across PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Plants vs Zombies 'Reloaded' was previously registered as a trademark in Brazil, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1902169093538521453?">as spotted by Gematsu in March</a>, but according to Dealabs the developers at PopCap want to dub it something a bit more in-line with what the series is about. Thus: Replanted. 
</p>
<p>Plants vs Zombies has proven exceptionally popular over the years. The original game was an instant classic, winning over huge numbers of people with its quirky take on the tower defence genre. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/plants-vs-zombies-review">In the original 2009 Eurogamer review</a> (good times), Christian Donlan stated the game was: "An effortlessly streamlined take on tower defence games, enemies march across the screen from right to left, sticking to polite rows, and it's up to the player to place the various weapons required to slow their progress and finish them off."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/plants-vs-zombies-reloaded-release-date-rumoured-for-october-launch]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hmmm, we've heard this one before</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Super Mario RPG Kissing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4fe6194595fe8/super-mario-rpg-kissing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's official, folks — Mario and Peach are <em>not</em> in a relationship. Nintendo said it, so it <em>must</em> be true.</p>
<p>A few days ago, on the Nintendo Today! App, the Big N dropped this major bombshell on the world, revealing that the Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom and the Italian plumber are simply "good friends". We missed the initial post, but thankfully, <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1948141191440286122">KirPinkFury</a> has us covered.</p>
<p>So, wait, is this despite the fact Peach has kissed Mario multiple times and baked multiple cakes for him? We know both of these acts <em>are</em> platonic (cheek kissing, baking), but... okay.</p>

<p>This all sounds a little familiar, right? Another darling Nintendo couple, Zelda and Link, are frequently under the microscope from fans. Are they in a relationship? Aren't they?</p>
<p>Zelda's voice actor, Patricia Summerset, once said "I know that [Link and Zelda] are in a relationship with each other" in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/patricia-summersett-interview-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">TheGamer</a> as part of a wider conversation about enjoying the ambiguity of their relationship, before putting out a <a href="https://x.com/Summersett_/status/1660696953712197635">statement a few days later saying</a> that her words do "not imply" that the duo are in love.</p>
<p>Really, though, all of this is up to fan interpretation. If Mario and Peach want some privacy, that's great. Nintendo can insist the pair aren't a couple — and maybe that's the case. To be fair, Peach <em>did</em> turn down Mario in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Next thing Nintendo will be telling us is that Donkey Kong doesn't love bananas.</p>
<p><em>Let us know in the comments whether you believe Nintendo is telling the truth.</em><em><br></em></p></section>
