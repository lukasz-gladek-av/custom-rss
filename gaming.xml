            <p>
2K Games is poised to reveal the next game in one of its "biggest and most beloved" franchises, with the grand unveiling set to happen in June.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the big reveal is scheduled for Friday, 7th June, and will take place during Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">big Summer Game Fest live event</a>.
</p>
<p>
News of 2K's impending reveal came via <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest/status/1791201250521825718">Summer Game Fest's official social media account</a>, but details remain vague. It offered no hints as to what might be coming, leaving everyone to speculate what, exactly, that "biggest and most beloved" franchises could be.

</div>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>
BioShock is an obvious candidate, given 2K <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-in-development-at-new-2k-studio-cloud-chamber">confirmed a new series entry was in development</a> all the way back in 2019. Little has been revealed about the project since then, but a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshocks-setting-and-time-period-detailed-in-new-report">report in 2021</a> claimed the title - which is being developed by new studio Cloud Chamber - would be set in an Antarctic city sometime during the 1960s.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, it's possible 2K Games' big reveal will be a new Mafia title - Mafia 3 developer Hangar 13 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-3-developer-confirms-new-mafia-development">confirmed it was working on one</a> back in August 2022.  As with BioShock, little is known about this latest Mafia project beyond reports it'll be a prequel to the existing trilogy. However, a 2024 reveal might be a little premature given it was still "a few years away" when it was announced in 2022.
</p>
<p>
So what else? It's always possible Gearbox - which 2K parent company Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">acquired from Embracer</a> earlier this year - will have something to show. References to Borderlands 4 and Tiny Tina's Wonderland 2 both surfaced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-and-tiny-tinas-wonderland-2-have-popped-up-on-a-linkedin-profile">on a former Gearbox technical director's LinkedIn profile</a> late last year, even though neither has been formally confirmed.
</p>
<p>
A Borderlands announcement would arguably make the most sense, however, seeing as 2K and Gearbox will almost certainly want to push something out to coincide with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-first-look-shows-red-haired-cate-blanchett-staring-into-a-manhole">Borderlands movie</a>, which is currently due to hit cinemas in August this year. Thankfully, it won't be long until 2K puts all this specualtion to rest, given 7th June is just three weeks away.
</p>
<p>
News of an impending 2K Games reveal arrives alongside word Take-Two and Rockstar are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">gearing up to launch Grand Theft Auto 6 in "fall" next year</a>. Take-Two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-laying-off-550-people-weeks-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-to-do-so">recently laid of 550 employees</a> and cancelled multiple in-development projects - reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-reportedly-shut-down-by-take-two">shutting down Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games and OlliOlli World developer Roll7</a> in the process - as part of a major restructuring programme.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Earlier this month, Take-Two announced a cost reduction plan that included project cancellations, the layoffs of 5% of its workforce, and other spending cuts. Amid this announcement came<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> reports based on internal documentation</a> that seemed to confirm Take-Two was closing OlliOlli World developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games.</p><p>But when I asked Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick in a call today why these closures happened, he told me, "We didn't shutter those studios":</p><blockquote>We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear. And we are always looking at our release schedule across all of our studios to make sure that it makes sense. So we are being very judicious because we are in the middle of a cost reduction program that we've already concluded and are now fully rolling out. We've announced that we're saving $165 million in existing and future costs, but we haven't shuttered anything.</blockquote><p>The reports, which came both from a WARN Act notice <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-confirms-kerbal-space-program-2-is-safe-despite-seattle-layoffs#close-modal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out by Game Developer</a> and internal documentation by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, seemed pretty definitive, so this was a surprising response. I followed up by asking Zelnick if he was denying the reports, at which point a PR representative for the company stepped in with the following:</p><blockquote>What we've said is, in the 8-K filing that we put out we talked about the cost reduction plan is approximately 5% reduction in headcount worldwide, but we did not give a label-by-label breakdown of what that looks like.</blockquote><p>I tried one more time, asking if the studios existed or not. PR reiterated that "We have not provided any additional color beyond what I just said."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We just tend to leave those announcements to the label, so we're not trying to be cute or difficult today.</p></div><p>If you're wondering what to make of all this, you're in good company. The WARN Act notice for Intercept Games in Seattle specified a "closure" as the reason for the layoffs of 70 people, which is roughly the entire total of all the employees there. It does seem possible Take-Two has somehow folded both of these studios into Private Division, given that the label will be taking up maintenance of Kerbal Space Program 2 going forward. I asked Zelnick if we should take these reports as a sign that Private Division itself is in some kind of trouble:</p><blockquote>I don't think so. I think, as I said, we're reviewing all of the projects company-wide, and sometimes we do have to make hard choices. We just tend to leave those announcements to the label, we don't tend to talk about them, so we're not trying to be cute or difficult today. It's just that we don't tend to bring those discussions into these meetings.</blockquote><p>In a follow-up email, Take-Two PR clarified that the "entire organization" contributed to cost-saving efforts, and that Private Division was still planning on supporting games such as Moon Studio's No Rest for the Wicked, and upcoming games Tales of the Shire and an unrevealed Gamefreak project the publisher announced last year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>On our last few calls, Zelnick had told me that the company was in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-publisher-is-in-growth-mode-in-wake-of-gta-6-announcement">"growth-mode"</a> and, as recently as February, that it had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-they-have-no-current-plans-for-layoffs-amid-cost-reduction-program">"no current plans"</a> for layoffs. He's spoken before about the state of the industry post-pandemic, noting that other companies undergoing layoffs had gotten "a little fat and happy during the pandemic" and had overspent as a result. But now, he's admitting that Take-Two is, at least to some degree, in that some boat:</p><blockquote>We were very fortunate during the pandemic, we did really well as did many of our competitors. But I said, when asked during the pandemic, that we expected post-pandemic demand to be below that of the pandemic demand, but above pre-pandemic demand, and that's exactly what did happen. That said, I think we did get out over our skis a little bit, and I think we were overly ambitious in terms of building a fixed overhead. We have this three-part strategy to be the most creative, the most innovative, the most efficient company in the business, and I'm not sure we were delivering fully on the promise of efficiency.</blockquote><blockquote>The hardest thing I do as a chief executive is part ways with friends and colleagues, and that's always the last choice we make. We always try to find efficiencies elsewhere, through vendors, the way we structure, through operations. At times, though, it's unavoidable, and this is one of those moments. So we are reducing our headcount by about 5%. It doesn't feel good to do it, but it is our obligation to be a really efficient business, and the good news is we do feel like we're structured really well going forward and we have the right amount of operating leverage, so as we bring this new pipeline to bear, we will generate the results that reflect that.</blockquote><p>As for Intercept Games and Roll7, the prognosis still doesn't seem great. What's even stranger is that this isn't the first time Take-Two has done something like this to a Kerbal Space Program developer in particular. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/star-theory-reportedly-shutters-after-take-two-takes-over-kerbal-space-program-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back in 2020</a>, a studio called Star Theory was making Kerbal Space Program 2 before Private Division took the game away from them. While some employees were moved to Intercept Games, the rest were left adrift to desperately pitch new projects to save the studio...only to have the COVID-19 pandemic cut off their pitching opportunities and lead to the studio's closure. 2K Marin was similarly closed quietly, without Take-Two formally acknowledging the change.</p><p>Today, Take-Two Interactive reported full year net revenue of $5.35 billion, and a net loss of $3.7 billion. A significant portion of the reported loss is connected to impairment charges and business reorganization charges related to the company's cost-reduction programs, leading to operating expenses that were up 69% year-over-year. Take-Two also announced it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive">expects to release Grand Theft Auto 6 in the fall of 2025</a>, while Grand Theft Auto 5 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-surpasses-200-million-units-sold">surpassed 200 million units sold life to date</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-early-access-review.873558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gray-zone-warfare-early-access-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>It’s safe to say that Gray Zone Warfare isn’t trying to be an accessible extraction shooter like Call of Duty Warzone’s DMZ mode, but rather one for the hardcore realism set who want to feel the thrill of high-stakes victory and the agony of bleeding out after getting shot in the leg as you try to limp toward the chopper. Not everyone wants to fuss with deciding between 7.32 parabellum vs full metal jacket rounds, or dealing with the fact that 5.56x59mm rounds don’t fit in a magazine for 5.56x72mm. But for those who do, it serves that audience fairly well in its early access state – at least, when it isn’t crashing, failing to register clear hits, or making you and your friends wait in line for your ride home. </p><p>You and your four-person squad undertake very basic missions into hostile territory, completing tasks, clearing AI enemies, and gathering gear or quest items to take back with you. Dying on the battlefield means any equipment on you is lost, as you respawn empty handed back at camp, which does a great job making every death feel consequential. It is often possible to find your corpse and retrieve your lost gear, but you run the risk of others scavenging your goods, or dying on the retrieval attempt, and having your body despawn, which is effective at reinforcing an exciting sense of tension. That loop of deploy, fight, and extract is engaging thanks to challenging combat, and the irresistible pull of new and better equipment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Gray Zone Warfare Early Access Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The battlefield and equipment strongly resemble the Vietnam war era, and in keeping with that setting, surviving out there is appropriately tough. Enemies, be they AI combatants or humans from opposing factions, are observant and accurate enough to pump rounds into you with lethal efficiency if you give them the chance. The sense of danger is palpable and exciting. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The sense of danger is palpable and exciting.&nbsp;</p></div><p>They are also durable, capable of shrugging off a surprising amount of gun shots and stab wounds. Some of that can be attributed to Gray Zone Warfare’s ambitious realistic damage system. There are no “hit points” per se; instead, bodies attempt to simulate the actual effects of wounds. You won’t be able to instantly take down a bad guy by shooting them in their limbs or much of their torso, but shots to the right part of the chest or head can do the job. It elevates the importance of very accurate shooting in a way that I really like: it’s more challenging and more rewarding when you lock into a John-Wick like Zen state and decimate your adversaries with deadly precision. If it catches on, this could forever end the “LOL I killed you by shooting your foot” phenomenon of video game shooters.</p><p>However, when you’re on the receiving end it’s a great example of where simulation and fun are often at odds. Sure, you can often shrug off incoming non-lethal damage and fight a bit longer. But those wounds still exist, and eventually bleeding out after a firefight you “won” is pretty common. There are field medical options like bandages, splints, and medicines, but even if you successfully keep the looming specter of death at bay, your wounded warrior is extremely compromised and a lot harder to enjoy. It’s frustrating and anticlimactic to gear up with a squad for a deep incursion into enemy territory, only to have to limp back to extraction after the first time bullets fly because you took a few unfortunate hits. If I wanted to suffer the consequences of my sloppy mistakes in battle, I’d enlist.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If I wanted to suffer the consequences of my sloppy mistakes in battle, I’d enlist.</p></div><p>But of course, the most frustrating times are the too frequent occasions when the damage system just doesn’t work because hit registration is unreliable. Shots that appear to be on the mark do no damage whatsoever. </p><h2>Tickets to the Gun Show</h2><p>Not every bullet is realistic, but the weapons sure are – to a fault, sometimes. Take one of your starting guns, for example: the M4 rifle. While it’s hard to find a military shooter that doesn’t use the M4A1 carbine, often with a few choices of optional accessories, GZW drills down to its individual parts to an impressive degree. Want to trade in the better handling of your short barrel for the great accuracy of a longer one? Sure. Interested in that scope? Better grab the mount first, because it won’t just clip onto the weapon’s frame by itself. It’s impressive that you can buy and swap in over a dozen parts to essentially build your own M4 from scratch, transforming it from a compact and lightweight gun for close-up fighting into something longer with powerful optics to use as a versatile sniper rifle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s fascinating how in-depth it is… and what an absolute pain in the ass it can be to figure out if you aren’t already a walking encyclopedia of gun parts. You can either just guess and check which parts fit together through trial and error, or jump online and learn about how it all assembles in real life. Being dense isn’t necessarily a bad thing – it’s actually one of the things I really like about GZW – but the lack of any sort of tooltips or tutorialization stands out as a big miss because it turns away people who would be interested to learn about how these guns work if it would bother to teach us. Even if you know the broad strokes, such as how hollow point rounds are a better choice for unarmored enemies because of the size of wounds they create, figuring out how to use them is way too cumbersome. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s fascinating how in-depth it is… and what an absolute pain in the ass it can be to figure out.</p></div><p>But assuming you can get over that hump, once you are geared up it’s time to head out into the field. The options here are pretty limited in the current early access version, however. You can either run around the open-world map getting into fights and gathering loot off of fallen enemies, or work through a list of tasks handed out by vendors in your camp who generally send you out into the world to find or kill something. They do a good job pushing you to interesting areas, like new towns or enemy hideouts, and the loot that you’re rewarded with at the end is often excellent. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><p><h3>Justin's favorite military shooters</h3></p></div><p>This issue with tasks comes primarily from the shared-world nature of GZW. With multiple squads all spread around the map shooting at anything that moves, it is all too common for targets to be dead before you arrive, so you have to twiddle your thumbs until the enemies respawn. That can take around 15 minutes, and hiding in a corner somewhere waiting, hoping no other squads come through in that time to take the kill, isn’t much fun. There are also frequently objectives that’re literally locked behind doors, and the keys to open them are painfully infrequent random drops from enemies. Each key only works in one specific lock, and it’s a common enough problem that players have built coordinated key exchanges. It’s testament to what I’ve found to be a very helpful and supporting player base, but it’s ultimately a community driven Band-Aid for an unnecessary self-inflicted wound.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The map is really effective at using geography as an almost natural level-select tool.</p></div><p>At least you’ll have some sights to take in while you’re waiting around, because GZW is already a very good looking game. It’s genuinely impressive how lush and full the more than 40 square kilometers of jungles, towns, and rice are on this vaguely Southeast Asian island. Dense foliage reaches far and wide and character models look great, as does the equipment, whether it’s the lovingly recreated weapons or the ‘90s-style fannypack you “liberated” from its former owner. It would be easy for that much landmass to feel empty, particularly with the lack of drivable vehicles, but here it’s really well laid out: There’s enough space between fights to take a  breather, but it’s dense enough that action is never far away. Towns near starting areas are crawling with lightly armored AI enemies, but the troops you encounter become more dangerous the farther you push. Finally, there’s a bigger focus on PvP in the zones where the player factions intersect. The map is really effective at using geography as an almost natural level-select tool, and I appreciate the sense that I was in control of what sort of challenge I was in the mood to take on. </p><p>But, unsurprisingly for an early access game, it doesn’t run well right now. I had squadmates with solid PCs that would struggle with low framerates much of the time. Even my beefy RTX 3090 dips down into the 20 frames per second range when moving quickly through the jungle, which is not great when accuracy matters so much. Similarly, you need to be prepared for crashes to desktop, items disappearing from your inventory, and character models missing their heads (without having been shot there yet), to name a few issues my squad and I encountered. At this point you have to be willing to chalk up some frustrating losses that don’t have anything to do with errors you make on the battlefield. To their credit, the development team has continued to release fixes at a pretty regular cadence, but it’s impossible to know how long it’ll take to get Gray Zone out of this danger zone. </p><p>One of the areas in need of a fix is the faction system, particularly because you can only have one character on your account. When you start it up you select one of three private military contractors to represent, which is a permanent but fairly meaningless decision because they all have the same missions, gear, and vendors to pick from. There are two issues with this, and the first is that it’s a missed opportunity to create more distinct identities between groups (hopefully one that’ll be corrected). Instead, the only functional difference is which edge of the map your base of operations will occupy. But the larger issue with the faction system is you can only form squads with people in the same company as you, so if you want to play with friends you either need to all decide in advance which team to represent, or someone is going to have to delete their character entirely and start from scratch in the correct faction. Losing all your money, weapons, and task progress just to play with friends is tragically bitter pill to swallow.</p><p>As you explore farther and farther around the region you unlock various landing zones, which are critically important given how big the area is and how long walking back to base can take. The good news is that calling in a chopper to ferry you to or from a mission is easily done from the map, and the few minutes it usually takes to wait for extraction can be tense and exciting. The bad news is that our military contractors cheaped out when it came to buying birds, because each faction only has four at their disposal. “Request denied” is an aggravatingly frequent thing to hear when you are trying to hitch a ride, and it’s completely out of your control whether other teams are ahead of you in line. Worse, the helicopters aren’t immediately free once they finish a dropoff – you need to wait for them to fly off the map before they can come back and get you. It’s another unnecessary obstacle to fun, and an all too common frustrating waste of time. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Gray Zone Warfare’s early access version has some excellent ideas for a highly realistic take on an extraction shooter, but most of them come with a caveat or two at this point. Yes, the map is huge, lush, and full of enemies to shoot at, but you will need to be prepared to wait far too long for rides to and from objectives. The damage system is realistic and immersive, but it shoots itself in the foot with unreliable hit registration, and playing wounded is a lot less fun. The detailed weapons are painstakingly true to life, with lots of great customization options, but if you don’t already subscribe to Soldier of Fortune magazine it’s going to be tough to make great use of it. The enthusiasm and ambition behind this game is palpable, even if it is currently rough, buggy, and too often unreliable. But like a greasy burger at a roadside dive, its charm isn’t in craftsmanship, it’s in the earnestness. While its flaws are a bit too numerous to list, much less completely overlook, it can hit the spot just right if you have the right sort of hunger.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.</p>

<p>Publisher Take-Two released its <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e357ad06-0762-4e80-b80c-e3869252fdfe">2024 year-end financial report</a> today (thanks, <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-narrowed-to-fall-2025-but-theres-still-no-pc-launch-date-confirmed/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com">PC Gamer</a></em>), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s 2025 releases, posted below.</p>

</article><p>Regarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/04/grand-theft-auto-vi-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-release-confirmed-for-2025-no-mention-of">yet to be mentioned.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-surpasses-100-million-views-breaks-record-for-most">100 million views in only 24 hours</a>, breaking a YouTube record.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="198" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The M16 was one of the worst weapons in <em>MW2</em>, and nothing changed in <em>MW3</em> to make the assault rifle worth using either. However, a new aftermarket part finally vaults the M16 into meta conversations. </p> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true">Players unlock the JAK Patriot conversion kit by completing all Season 3 <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-and-warzone-season-3-week-7-weekly-challenges-and-how-to-complete-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Week 7 challenges</a>, transforming the M16 from a three-round burst into a fully automatic weapon. By sacrificing damage and suffering a small loss in accuracy, the M16 garners more attention with fully automatic capabilities. The time-to-kill potential of 299ms is above average for the class, and the M16 can kill enemies in five shots up to 40 meters, which is impressive. </p>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">However, the TTK suffers a massive drop-off after that distance, so players shouldn’t try to use this weapon in anything longer than a mid-range gunfight. With that being said, here is the best set of attachments to use. </p> <h2 id="h-best-m16-jak-patriot-loadout-in-mw3" data-injectable="false">Best M16 JAK Patriot loadout in <em>MW3</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Komodo Heavy </li> <li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>FTAC SP-10 Angled Grip </li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>JAK Glassless Optic </li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Sakin ZX Grip </li> <li><strong>Conversion Kit: </strong>JAK Patriot </li> </ul> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">The M16 with the<strong> JAK Patriot </strong>equipped suffers from a hard recoil that is sharp to the left and straight up. So, our loadout focuses on improving horizontal recoil to mitigate that issue. The Komodo Heavy Barrel, FTAC SP-10 Angled Grip, and <strong>Sakin ZX Grip</strong> all improve a combination of horizontal and vertical recoil, gun kick, or firing aim stability. </p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Even with this set of attachments, the M16’s recoil will be noticeable. Thankfully, it’s a predictable pattern, so players should have no issue pulling down on the right stick and mowing down enemies easily. Other ARs might still be better on paper, but it’s refreshing to finally have an M16 worth using after two years of irrelevance.</p>

<p data-characters="284" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>World of Warcraft Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em> is a new time-limited event. It’s running now until August 19. If you’re interested in checking it out, you can play free up to level 20. Then, all you need is to have an active<em> WoW </em>subscription. No extra expansions are required.</p> <h2 id="h-how-do-i-create-a-new-timerunning-character" data-injectable="false">How do I create a new Timerunning character?</h2> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">On the character select screen, click the <em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria </em>button in the upper left. You can also select “Create New Character” and select a Timerunning character. From there, create any character you would like (server restrictions still apply). Once you enter the world, you’ll have a short questline to go through to introduce you to the new mechanics of Timerunning.</p>

Speak to Eternus up ahead and begin your questline. She’ll have you defeat an easy enemy real quick to collect some Temporal Threads. She’ll task you with speaking to Moratari nearby to learn more. As you might expect, you’ll have a few combat assignments to get through. Once you finish those, she’ll have you speak to Horos to purchase a Chronobadge. This vendor also sells a lot of mounts and toys that you won’t be able to afford any time soon. Now, speak to Momentus to forge your artifact. Once you turn in that quest, you’ll have a new Cloak of Infinite Potential.</p>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">She will task you with finding another Infinite Reaver to kill and collect some thread off of. Afterward, she sends you to face the big boss of this area. A nasty time elemental named Eratus is causing problems nearby, so go crush that real quick. Don’t worry if you see an army of Infinite Reavers spawn around him, Eternus will take care of those. Turn in the quests and prepare to teleport to your new adventure in Pandaria!</p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">As a reminder, your characters are locked to the continent until the event ends in August. You won’t have access to the Auction House, either. So go out there and level up your cloak, get crazy new abilities, and enjoy this wild new mode.</p>

But that time’s over. Rockstar announced that it would reveal the game’s first trailer on Tuesday, December 5th, 2023, at 6AM PT / 9AM ET. Unfortunately, an early leak prompted the company to release the trailer more than half a day earlier than planned, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">revealing <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will bring the series back to Vice City</a>, and it showed off a new protagonist, Lucia.</p><p>Though Rockstar Games has kept mum on what to expect from the next installment in the series, we do have a bit of an idea of what the game looks like thanks to a hacker leaking 90 videos’ worth of material. In 2022, Arion Kurtaj — a member of the Lapsus$ hacker ring — leaked the videos, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23842746/lapsus-member-uber-rockstar-games-hack">a London jury found him responsible for the act</a>.</p><p>There have also been unconfirmed reports of another, more recent <em>GTA VI</em> leak in the days before the trailer’s world premiere, showing off a bit of the game’s map <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-leaks-may-have-just-come-from-a-rockstar-employees-son">that allegedly came from a Rockstar employee’s kid</a>. </p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-b0136be1-e7eb-4dce-85eb-51270f3ed427"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">Grand Theft Auto VI is launching in fall 2025</a></h2><p>In Take-Two’s <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reports-results-fourth-0">Q4 2024 earnings report</a>, the company stated when gamers can expect the next entry in the <em>GTA</em> series.

According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, morale at the company has improved significantly since then, and the development of <em>GTA VI</em> is being managed in such a way so as to minimize the crunch that employees experienced during the development of previous titles. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/27/23280496/gta6-gta-vi-miami-female-protagonist-2024-release-date-development-crunch">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-7b1dc320-39f1-483c-8e76-000ecaa0e348"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22917783/rocstar-games-gta6-active-development-gta5-ps5-xbox-series-x-patch">Rockstar finally confirms it’s working on the next Grand Theft Auto</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><div><figcaption><em>GTA5’s Michael De Santa.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Rockstar Games</cite></p></div></figure></div><p>A new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series is in active development, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak73k92o47ko75/grand-theft-auto-community-update">Rockstar Games has confirmed</a>. “We are pleased to confirm that active development for the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series is well underway,” the company wrote in a post on its website. In the more immediate future, <em>GTAV</em> and <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> will release on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S on March 15th.</p><p>The popularity — and profitability — of <em>GTAV</em>’s online component has meant that there’s been an unusually long wait for a sequel.

In contrast, <em>GTAV</em> released a little over five years after 2008’s <em>GTAIV</em>. “With the unprecedented longevity of <em>GTAV</em>, we know many of you have been asking us about a new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series,” Rockstar Games writes. “With every new project we embark on, our goal is always to significantly move beyond what we have previously delivered.” </p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22917783/rocstar-games-gta6-active-development-gta5-ps5-xbox-series-x-patch">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li></ul></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="TOqiXl"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24085152/hulu-shogun-episode-1-review-fx"><em>Shōgun</em></a><em> </em>is an early contender for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24078257/best-tv-2024-shows-series">2024’s best TV show</a>. The series, which debuted in February, is smart, complicated, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24138469/shogun-finale-review-war-toranaga-explained-episode">tremendously well made</a>, beautifully acted, and the most watched FX series ever, according to a press release from the network. All of which makes Thursday’s announcement that the show is coming back for more season pretty unsurprising. The only question that remains is what exactly those seasons are going to be about. </p>
<p id="rnYFPP">According to FX’s announcement, the series is coming back for two additional seasons. Development on the new seasons will begin soon, with work taking place between FX and the estate of original <em>Shōgun </em>author, James Clavell. The upcoming seasons will also bring back many of the key talents behind season 1, including co-creators, showrunners, executive producers, and writers, Justin Marks and Rachel Kondo, as well as executive producer Michaela Clavell, and producer and series star Hiroyuki Sanada, who played <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24091458/shogun-episode-3-review-toranaga-actor-hiroyuki-sanada">Lord Yoshii Toranaga in season 1</a>.</p>
<p id="3bfqQz"><em>Shōgun’</em>s first season is an adaptation of James Clavell’s novel of the same name, which was originally released in 1975. The show’s first season adapts Clavell’s entire (very long) novel, which leaves the question of what exactly it will cover in its next two seasons up for debate. </p>

<p id="wF58Et">One possible option for the show could be looking to Clavell’s other work for inspiration. While <em>Shōgun </em>is unquestionably the most popular of the books, Clavell actually wrote three more novels in his Asian Saga, with <em>Shōgun </em>being the first chronologically. He also wrote <em>Tai-Pan</em>, a book about two traders venturing into Hong Kong in the 1840s after the First Opium War, <em>Gai-Jin</em>, a sequel to <em>Tai-Pan</em> set 20 years later and mostly in Japan, and <em>Noble House</em>, which is set back in Hong Kong in 1963. </p>
<p id="6QV9cD">This variety of novels could provide a solid basis for several seasons, each taking place in a distinct time and place. However, this would bring with it plenty of other problems including issues of cultural accuracy. Both <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24132460/shogun-episode-9-crimson-sky-review-mariko-why-death">Marks and Kondo have been very vocal about the accuracy of <em>Shōgun </em>being extremely important to them</a>, frequently rewriting scenes to better reflect cultural Japanese attitudes of the time. To suddenly transplant the series to an entirely new country, with an entirely new culture and different customs would be a massive undertaking, and surely change the show significantly. Although that’s not to say it couldn’t be done. </p>
<p id="s8HH7k">Perhaps even more compelling though is the presence of Sanada. With the legendary Japanese actor returning to the show, and his towering performance as Toranaga being a standout aspect of the series’ first season, it seems more likely that Marks, Kondo, and the rest of the production would opt to keep the story in Japan and create a series that’s a more direct follow up to <em>Shōgun</em>’s story. Thankfully, this period of Japanese history has no shortage of fascinating and complex topics for the show to cover. </p>

<p id="FPt0U3">While Clavell’s original novel changes the names of famous Japanese historical figures, it is closely based on the country’s real history, which means we too can look to history to see what could be next for the show. Toranaga is based on Tokugawa Ieyasu, a real Japanese daimyo and the first shōgun of the mighty Tokugawa shogunate which ruled the country from 1603 until 1868.</p>
<p id="GWaHJM">The first season ends with Toranaga on the verge of capturing Osaka Castle, a real thing Ieyasu did (although slightly earlier than 1600). So, if the timeline of Japanese history is what the show plans to follow, then the next season would likely be about the fallout of Toranaga’s decision to openly grab power. In real life, Ieyasu met with quite a bit of resistance in the form of a rival daimyo named Ishida Mitsunari who would go on to lead an army in opposition to Ieyasu, throwing Japan into a civil war. </p>
<p id="q9ysSx">We’ll stop the story there at the risk of revealing several potentially significant plot points, but needless to say a civil war would give future seasons of <em>Shōgun </em>plenty of ground for great television. </p>
<p id="PeZCV3">Of course, we won’t know for sure what exactly these upcoming seasons of <em>Shōgun </em>will be based on until FX makes an official announcement, but we know we’ll be watching no matter what.</p>

<p>I’ll be honest: I’ve yet to beat Borderlands 3. I picked it up on sale, relatively cheap, alongside much of the DLC. But it’s one of those games that will sit in my backlog, likely for another year or so, before I gain any traction. A co-op partner might help. But for now, I have my sights set on the Borderlands 4 release date. Why play an old backlog game when there’s something shiny and new on the way?!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-borderlands-4-release-date">What is the Borderlands 4 Release Date?</h2>



<p>At this time, we don’t know the official Borderlands 4 release date. In fact, the only concrete thing we know about the upcoming game is that publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox Interactive intend to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-borderlands-4-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal the fourth mainline entry</a> during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/">Summer Game Fest</a>. That’ll happen on June 7!</p>



<p>According to Randy Pitchford earlier this year, the title has spent the past few years in “active development.” Therefore, it’s likely that we’ll see a reveal and announcement trailer, perhaps a release date, and likely the pre-order details for Borderlands 4 this summer.</p>



<p>Bookmark this page because the moment we have a release date, we’ll update you!</p>

<h2 id="h-what-systems-will-borderlands-4-launch-on">What Systems Will Borderlands 4 Launch On?</h2>



<p>As the last generation of consoles—PlayStation 4 and Xbox One—continue to wind down and come to a close, we’ll see far fewer big releases launch on the old systems. As such, we fully expect Borderlands 4 to be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Anything else, however, is unlikely.</p>

<p data-characters="383" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Ever since the highly-anticipated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/grand-theft-auto-vis-trailer-perfectly-captures-my-hometowns-essence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>GTA&nbsp;6&nbsp;</em>trailer</a> debuted, fans have been waiting for another one. The first teaser left us with many questions, particularly about the two characters who were the focus of the reveal. Here’s a rundown of what we know so far about&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>&nbsp;trailer 2, including potential release dates and storyline speculations.</p> <h2 id="h-when-will-gta-6-trailer-2-release" data-injectable="false">When will GTA 6 trailer 2 release?</h2> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false">Right now, <em>GTA 6</em>&nbsp;trailer 2 <strong>doesn’t have an official release date</strong>. However, based on the release patterns of previous debuts, some rumors are circulating.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">It was believed that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gta-publisher-take-two-is-laying-off-five-percent-of-staff-a-few-months-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-for-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two</a> would announce a new trailer for <em>GTA 6</em> during their May 2024 conference call. Unfortunately, no trailer was released, but we did get some insight into a more concrete release date. According to the report results, <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will debut in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rockstar-narrows-window-for-grand-theft-auto-6-launch-to-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall of 2025</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">Despite not getting a <em>GTA 6 </em>trailer 2 during the conference, we can still try to get an idea for a release from its predecessor. If we look at <em>GTA 5</em>, we can see that the two main trailers debuted a year apart. Therefore, a second trailer for <em>GTA VI</em> might not come until December 2024. It may be released at an earlier date, but given Rockstar Games’ track record, it will likely come out in the latter half of the year. </p>
 <h2 id="h-gta-6-trailer-predictions" data-injectable="false">GTA 6 trailer predictions</h2> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">If we take a closer look at the first&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gta-6-could-be-the-most-important-thing-to-ever-release-analyst-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>&nbsp;</em>trailer, we can see that a second one could take us in many different directions. It could provide more insight into the two characters we’ve seen so far, Lucia and her partner (rumored to be named Jason). Given that Lucia was the primary focus of the first trailer, it’s possible that the second phase will shine the spotlight on her partner.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="516" data-current-count="816" data-injectable="true"><em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>trailer 2 will likely delve deeper into the game’s narrative, which appears to draw inspiration from the infamous Bonnie and Clyde. The initial teaser showed Lucia and her partner in possession of a large sum of money, with the police hot on a suspect’s trail. If&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>&nbsp;follows the formula of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-open-world-games-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its predecessor</a>, heists will likely play a significant role in the storyline. We might also get a glimpse of the game’s side characters and their dynamic in the upcoming trailer.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="590" data-current-count="590" data-injectable="true">In addition to the characters and narrative, more locations are expected to be revealed, taking us back to the Miami-inspired Vice City. This setting, known for its vibrant nightlife, beautiful beaches, and mobster escapades, has been a fan favorite since its first appearance in the series. The initial snippet already gave fans a sneak peek at a ton of visuals, and it’s shaping up to be an incredibly eccentric area to explore. Leaks have suggested the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</em>map will be absolutely massive, giving players the free range to wreak even more havoc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false"><em>GTA 6’s</em>&nbsp;gameplay details remain a tantalizing mystery, so the second trailer may&nbsp;not fully&nbsp;reveal this information.&nbsp;It will likely continue with cinematics, but one can’t help but wonder about the actual gameplay.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="false">An official release date could also be possible with the next drop, as the game is currently only slated for&nbsp;a Fall 2025 window.&nbsp;Again, this is wishful thinking, but it’s not entirely impractical.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="201" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Apex Legends Global Series might replace the Dropship with a point-of-interest (POI) draft in Split 2, and pro players can’t reach a consensus on how to feel about the new potential feature. </p> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">During a scrimmage with his <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/imperialhal-leaves-tsm-marking-the-end-of-an-era-in-apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new teammates</a> Zero and Genburten, Imperialhal claimed, “ALGS has just forced us to play on a random draft POI system in a competitive lobby, probably the worst change ever made in Apex history.” The pro player added that the rest of the league was against the change, but that didn’t make an impact. </p> <p data-characters="587" data-current-count="933" data-injectable="true">In March, ALGS commissioner John Nelson first proposed the idea in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveApex/comments/1bq7bl8/algs_split_2_drop_spot_changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter </a>to pro players. As things stand now, ALGS teams reach a general understanding through scrims and prior communication about where other trios land from the Dropship. However, there are some instances where teams will land at the same location, and the ALGS commissioner believes “those situations are to the detriment of both teams,” because the outcome gets decided by random factors such as who gets better loot in a short span of time. Some pro players are against the change, but other see its benefits. </p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">But with the draft system, one team will spawn at each of the possible 29 landing locations. According to Nelson’s leaked memo, all teams will get to select towards the front, in the middle, and at the end of the draft for the first nine days of regular seasons of matches. After that, draft order will be decided by performance, with better performing teams picking where they land first. </p> <figure data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Respawn Entertainment </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="231" data-injectable="false">ALGS pro-Gnaske <a href="https://x.com/Gnaske_Lone/status/1790893406798971007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued</a> that the “new POI draft system is amazing on paper, but a massive flaw is that the POIs are so unbalanced, and because of the unbalance, it’s going to create a massive luck factor in the game.” </p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">Some POIs have more loot than others, hurting teams based on where they select in the draft. And since the order is determined by performance, this might put poorly performing teams in a hole they can’t get out of. In saying that, there are some competitive community members for the change. </p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">“I can’t be the only person that thinks this POI draft system for comp Apex will be a good thing in the long run and the best IGL’s/Teams will still be the best. We have seen how poor zone selection can be just at this recent LAN, this makes the playing field more fair all around,” FaZe Snipedown <a href="https://x.com/Snip3down/status/1791163746313789508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>. </p> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="false">ALGS Split 2 starts in June. Pro players will have the ultimate say on if the feature gets added, but the vote could be a close one based on conflicting opinions. </p>

Rockstar Games and publisher Take-Two Interactive have narrowed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s release window from the previously announced "2025" to "fall" of next year.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two shared the news during its Q4 2024 earnings report, saying it was "highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience".
</p>
<p>
"Our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase", it added, noting it expects to see "tremendous growth" in net bookings over the next three years.

<p>
When Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">unveiled its first trailer for GTA6</a> last December, it only confirmed a "2025" release window for the game. However, reports later claimed it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-may-slip-to-2026-as-development-has-reportedly-fallen-behind">initially been targeting a "spring" 2025 launch</a> but that an autumn (Q3) release was looking more realistic. There were also suggestions it could slip into 2026 as a "fallback plan".
</p>
<p>
Assuming Grand Theft Auto 6 makes its newly announced "fall" 2025 release window as expected, it'll be arriving almost exactly 12 years after the launch of Grand Theft Auto 5. That game went on to sell an astonishing 200m copies, so Take-Two is undoubtedly right to be bullish about its expectations for "tremendous growth" over the next few years.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6 is set to feature dual protagonists - a Bonnie and Clyde-style couple who embark on a life of crime - and marks the return of the series' Miami-inspired Vice City.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158506/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-date-fall-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="0mTart"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>will be released in the fall of 2025, according to publisher Take-Two Interactive. The release window — however vague — is a narrowing of what Take-Two Interactive had previously shared <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952805/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leaks-release-date-trailer">when it put <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> simply within the 2025 calendar year</a>. The fall 2025 release window makes sense, placing the much-anticipated game right before the holidays.</p>
<p id="3rQZDE">“We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase,” <a href="https://taketwointeractivesoftwareinc.gcs-web.com/node/30361/html#ttwo4q24earningsrelease.htm">Take-Two Interactive said in its most recent earnings report</a>. “Looking ahead, we believe that our Company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027.”</p>
<p id="HVl2iX">Of course, there’s always the chance for a delay. Rockstar Games is infamous for delaying its games to ensure a serious level of polish; <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> was publicly <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/22/15677376/red-dead-redemption-2-delay-release-date">delayed</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/1/16959884/red-dead-redemption-2-release-date-delayed-october-2018">three times</a>, while <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/1/31/3936872/gta-5-release-date"><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> had a major delay in 2013</a>. Take-Two Interactive’s willingness to publicly narrow the release window as part of its fiscal report could signal confidence in Rockstar’s ability to meet that date.</p>
<p id="rUnqcv"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952805/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leaks-release-date-trailer"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>was officially revealed</a> on Dec. 4, a day earlier than expected <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1731813331244085531">after its reveal trailer leaked online</a>. The game is set in Vice City, Grand Theft Auto’s Miami — a location the game centered on with 2002’s <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City </em>and 2006 prequel <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories</em>. Those games were set in the 1980s, but Rockstar Games has set <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> in the modern day, centering on a Bonnie and Clyde-esque duo in Jason and Lucia, the latter of which is the series’ first playable female protagonist.</p>
<p id="dSuNLN"><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> is still a hit, too, with Take-Two Interactive reporting 5 million copies sold within its last financial quarter, totaling 200 million games sold since its release.</p>
<p id="UYqSzS">Take-Two Interactive also reported it expects to reach $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion in net bookings in fiscal year 2025. Ahead of the filing, in April, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-layoffs-canceled-games-1235973835/">Take-Two Interactive laid off 5%</a> of its staff, or about 600 workers. (Despite the layoffs, Take-Two Interactive said it has expanded its staff.) It also canceled several projects — none of which were “core franchises” — but it still has 40 games in its pipeline throughout fiscal year 2027, Take-Two Interactive president Karl Slatoff said during the earnings conference call.</p>

Then, I got a notification for a post from the account, got excited, and was immediately disappointed to see the post was just a retweet of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/paramountplus/status/1791196928086098418?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/paramountplus/status/1791196928086098418?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paramount+ account</a></span> breaking down Easter eggs from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404"><em>Knuckles </em>show</a></span> now streaming on the service.</p><p>Several responses to the post are fans begging for the <em>Sonic 3 </em>trailer and mentioning they also fell victim to the same notification I did.

<p>The Borderlands franchise enjoys a long and, occasionally, bumpy history. Each iteration features lovable characters, cringeworthy dialogue, and frantic gunplay that keeps us coming back for more when paired with the extensive loot system. But we’re eager for a new release. When is the Borderlands 4 reveal?!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-gearbox-reveal-borderlands-4">When Will Gearbox Reveal Borderlands 4?</h2>



<p>It’s reported that publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox Software intend to show off Borderlands 4 at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> on June 7. Supposedly, the upcoming first-person shooter has spent the past few years in development. In March 2021, Randy Pitchford claimed they’re working on “the big one.” Obviously, this could mean a different franchise altogether or a completely new IP, but it’s most likely Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>To think 2K Games would ignore or abandon Borderlands would be foolish. The last release, Borderlands 3, generated a staggering $1 billion in sales. It’s a cash cow at this point, no matter how much people hate Claptrap.</p>



<p>Plus, the upcoming live-action film is set to sweep theaters, which will only boost the hype for the fourth mainline entry!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-tiny-tina-s-wonderlands-2-and-borderlands-4-potentially-leaked">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-2-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands 2 (And Borderlands 4) Potentially Leaked</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-will-claptrap-star-in-borderlands-4">Will Claptrap Star in Borderlands 4?</h2>



<p>Whenever I speak to anyone about Borderlands, they have one of two opinions regarding Claptrap. They either hate the incessant chatterbox, or they love his one-liners and jokes. It’s rarely in between. As such, I’m left questioning whether Borderlands 4 will feature Claptrap.</p>



<p>Is there a clear-cut answer right now? Unfortunately, no. We know so little about Borderlands 4, though I wouldn’t be surprised if Claptrap stars in the reveal trailer in June. Even if it’s just a cameo, I doubt they’d do away with their franchise mascot so easily.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arena-breakout-devs-have-banned-2124-accounts-%E2%80%98for-ten-years%E2%80%99.873471/</guid>

<p>In a recent update regarding Arena Breakout Infinite’s anti-cheat mechanics, MoreFun Studios – a subsidiary of Tencent – revealed how much work it has already put into keeping the extraction shooter’s ecosystem safe. Despite still being in a beta phase, there are plenty of people running around with cheats in Arena Breakout Infinite – for whatever reason. </p>



<p>MoreFun insists it’s on the case and is tightening up anti-cheat measures ahead of the inevitable early access release of the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-random-number">Random Number</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/ArenaBreakoutPC/status/1791202969138212998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Twitter</a>, MoreFun Studios revealed that it has banned <strong>exactly </strong>2124 accounts for <strong>ten years</strong> for various infringements. Here’s the full breakdown of the impact MoreFun’s anti-cheat team has had on malicious operators attempting to spoil the fun:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the past week, our Anti-Cheat team detected and combated over 10 memory-related cheats, 2 VT cheats, and over 10 DMA cheats, and in total <strong>2124</strong> accounts have been banned for ten years.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Additionally, MoreFun confirmed that all accounts banned during the beta will ‘also be checked repeatedly’, whatever that means. Moving forward, Arena Breakout Infinite will employ a realtime banning policy, with any suspicious accounts having their data analysed – but players have been reporting false bans taking place. It hasn’t been confirmed to what extent player reports are being vetted by automated systems that might need tweaking, but that could be the core issue.</p>

<p>It has been announced that 2K Games will reveal the next iteration of its ‘biggest and most beloved’ franchise on June 7 at Summer Game Fest.</p>



<p>Presumably, the announcement will not be related to the publisher’s annual releases like WWE or NBA. Instead, it’s strongly believed that the game could be related to the Borderlands series.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Gearbox had already announced that Borderlands 4 was in “active development”, which has been in development for a number of years. In March 2021, Randy Pitchford said that they [Gearbox] is working on ‘the big one’ when it comes to the Boderlands series. This suggests that the game has been in development for at least three years now.</p>



<p>Apart from Borderlands, other franchises that fit this category could be Mafia or Bioshock.</p>



<p>As of 2023, Take-Two reported that Borderlands 3, its last mainline Borderlands title, has sold over 18 million copies and generated well over $1 billion in revenue.</p>



<p>In addition to Borderlands games, the series will also be having its own ‘cinematic universe’, which will kickstart with the Borderlands movie scheduled to release on August 9, 2024.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes.873453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=review-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="329" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are two things that <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-made-me-break-out-the-pad-and-pencil-and-i-dig-it-for-that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a></em> brings to the table that I think make it a puzzle game worth anyone’s time. First, its stunning visuals are reminiscent of the most stylish games ever made, like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-killer7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killer7</a></em>. Second, its puzzles grip you and will have you working, inside and out of the game, to solve them. </p> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>‘ story revolves around the Hotel Letztes Jahr. The protagonist arrives there after receiving an invitation, and that’s all the information you’re given. From this incredibly vague start, you must figure out why you’re here by solving contextual puzzles that allow you to explore more and more of the hotel, while an overarching story eerily seeps out of the walls to fill in the gaps. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true"><strong><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> (<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch</a> [Reviewed], <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2008920/Lorelei_and_the_Laser_Eyes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>)<br>Developer: Simogo<br>Publisher: Annapurna Interactive<br>Released: May 16, 2024<br>MSRP: $24.99/£19.99</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">I didn’t click with <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> from the start. It took me a few hours to understand what was required of me, and then, after entering a twisted maze, I suddenly got it. I say this because I don’t think this game is for everyone in the same way as I’d say <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a></em> is. It’s deliberately obtuse, requires a lot of input, and has clues that you could completely miss for hours at a time. </p>
 <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="180" data-injectable="false">However, if you’re looking for a puzzle game that will have you scribbling in notebooks and has a slow-burn story you won’t fully understand until the end, this is it. </p> <figure data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">As you’ve probably worked out by now, the bulk of <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is puzzle-solving. In fact, your very first action, opening the front gate, is a puzzle. You’re always given a clue and directed to the information you need in red. This is why the game’s visuals are so impactful, because everything else is monochrome, giving you an almost supernatural ability to pick out clues where they appear. </p>
 <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">It’s this style choice that I think enables <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> to be a great puzzle box game. It would be too overwhelming if the environments were richly detailed with colors. But the monochrome color scheme and quiet, almost non-existent soundtrack help you focus in and identify solutions. As someone for which colors on a page can make a book illegible, the visual style helped me grasp the game. But I still struggled at the start. </p>
 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">Back to that front gate. Once you receive your clue, it’s not a simple case of using it to unlock the gate. Instead, there are puzzles within this puzzle. You’ll need to decipher the clue from a letter, use it to unlock a door, then a panel, and then, you’ll need to solve one final puzzle that opens the gate for you. </p> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">This felt maddening when I was first getting to grips with the game. It’s as if you’re given a clue for one puzzle and then sent off to do another one until you forget about the first and get lost. That’s not the case, though. <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is designed so that every story beat and revelation plays into a new sequence of puzzles within puzzles. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">As you approach the hotel, you’ll feel like you’ve got a handle on these early puzzles and can manage to get inside and explore. But that’s when the game really opens up, dishing out lots of information that won’t make sense until much later. If you’re paying attention, you might even see where some of the puzzles are going early on and have half a chance of getting through two or three before you get stuck again. </p>
 <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">Eventually, as I mentioned, everything clicks. You realize how the game frontloads information so you can refer back to it later to solve the dozens of puzzles it throws your way. A collection of images and letters gives you the basic information you need for certain codes and pathways, but you’ll often need to manipulate the information to get your answers.</p> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true">For example, those images might have numbers you need to add together or type out in a specific order based on environmental cues. Letters and documents provide codes, but they’re wrapped up in further history or discoverable information, like a Russian nesting doll of clues.</p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Your notebook will come in handy because there’s information you need to reference while looking at objects in some puzzles. Some even had me looking up real-world information for solutions. It preys on your real-world knowledge in subtle ways like this, and it feels fantastic because it adds to the undertone of dread and cosmic horror that slowly rises as you open more doors and uncover more of the truth.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">This all sounds like a lot, and it can be, but <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> has beautifully simple controls and great systems that make solving its complex puzzles so much more enjoyable. Your protagonist has a photographic memory, so you can reference any document you’ve seen anywhere you need to. It’s simple to explain, and negates any unnecessary complications other games might throw at you to pad out their playtime. </p>
 <p data-characters="655" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">Aside from movement, all you can do is interact with objects or open the menu. The menu allows you to access items you’ve picked up and that photographic memory. Otherwise, you’ll be interacting with keypads, pictures, and everything else possible in the game. I can’t overstate enough how simple this is, and yet its simplicity still feels complicated because of the puzzles you’re solving and the information you’re referencing. All the gymnastics are in your head, though, because you’ve got to hold numbers, sums, images, and the hotel’s layout in your mind to the point where it becomes mentally exhausting. </p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">It feels a lot like playing an ARG or one of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-grown-up-board-games-for-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Exit</em> board games</a>. You’ve got so much information to go through and pull together for a puzzle, but <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is more simplistic because of its wonderfully simple UI, controls, and focus on a story you’re led through by listening and watching, not by being told by a tutorial. </p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="721" data-injectable="true">That might seem crazy, and it feels crazy while you’re playing. But, like I said, at some point, it just clicks. You no longer see a letter and red lines. You see the start of a puzzle and the basis for solving it. You start to enjoy them and look for more information in every room. That’s when <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> decides to genre jump a little. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">Without spoiling these changes too much, the game is pocketed with puzzles that are almost minigames that change your perspective, the genre, and even the tone. They feel fun and free compared to the base game’s almost horror-like darkness in the hotel, and help keep up the pace when you might be flagging.</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="438" data-injectable="true"> <p><strong>Flashing lights warning</strong>: If you’re sold on <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes,</em> then you should absolutely go and play it. I want to warn all potential players that flashlight lights begin to take over the screen at some point in the story. They’re not regular, but they are persistent, and there’s no way to turn them off in the settings. If that sounds like it could be an issue for you, it might be worth avoiding the game.</p> </blockquote>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">The twisted maze, where I fell in love with <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, is just one great example of these minigames. You’re told to reach the middle, but it’s never quite so simple in a puzzle game like this. Even when I gave up, the game threw yet another puzzle at me linked to my actions in the maze, and that’s when I really understood the game’s flow and where I fit into its world. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="802" data-injectable="true"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is an intense puzzle box game that draws you in deeper the more of its mysteries you unravel. Yes, it can be frustrating, but the satisfaction you feel for completing each puzzle is heightened because it asks so much more of you as a player. The story that seems unimportant at first quickly becomes an engrossing and stylistic mystery thriller that will keep you guessing until the end, staying up for just one more hour in the hopes of seeing the next twist or big reveal. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/is-wanderer-good-in-genshin-impact-tips-for-how-to-play-wanderer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-wanderer-good-in-genshin-impact-tips-for-how-to-play-wanderer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="322" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Wanderer is a decently strong character who excels in open world combat, but has struggled to make an impact on the meta. As an Anemo hypercarry, Wanderer is hampered by his lack of access to amplifying or additive reactions. As a driver, he competes with Sucrose and Heizou, both of whom are <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-4-star-dps-characters-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4-stars</a> and easier to obtain.</p> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">In terms of raw strength, Wanderer is strong enough to clear the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-teams-and-strategies-for-spiral-abyss-floor-12-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spiral Abyss</a>, as long as you have the right <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-faruzan-good-in-genshin-impact-pros-and-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team</a> to support him. If you just like his playstyle or character, then you’ll probably be satisfied enough with his performance. If you only care about big numbers, though, Wanderer is probably not for you.</p> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">The open world is where Wanderer shines the most. His damage is reliant on his Skill, not his Burst, so he doesn’t need to have a constant source of Energy. On top of this, Wanderer can literally fly, bypassing many open world obstacles and puzzles. If you spend a lot of time traversing the vast landscapes of Teyvat, Wanderer is one of the best characters to have in your roster.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-is-wanderer-a-dps" data-injectable="false">Is Wanderer a DPS?</h2> <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><strong>Yes, Wanderer is an on-field Anemo DPS.</strong> He deals damage by staying on field using his Skill and enhanced Normal Attacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false">As an on-fielder, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-wanderer-scaramouche-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wanderer</a> is best suited to the <strong>hypercarry </strong>role, where he deals the majority of his team’s damage with less emphasis on reactions. In a hypercarry team, Wanderer’s teammates should focus on supporting him with buffs, healing, or shields.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">However, as an Anemo Catalyst user, Wanderer has the flexibility to be a <strong>driver</strong> for off-field DPS characters. His Normal Attacks can easily drive other characters’ effects that trigger with Normal Attacks, like Xingqiu’s Rain Swords or Beidou’s lightning. He can also trigger Swirl to activate the 4pc Viridescent Venerer effect. This makes Wanderer effective in Electro-Charged teams with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xingqiu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xingqiu</a>/<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yelan-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yelan</a>. You can even experiment with other off-field DPS characters like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xiangling-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xiangling</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-wanderer-s-best-combos" data-injectable="false">Wanderer’s best combos</h2> <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">To start Wanderer’s combo, <strong>always cast his Skill first.</strong> This lets Wanderer fly up into the air and empowers his Normal and Charged Attacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Once your Wanderer is in the air, his overall best combo is to use <strong>two Normal Attacks followed by a Charged Attack (N2C) </strong>until the blue bar next to him runs out. Optionally, you can use his Burst when the blue bar is just about to run out to end his combo. After finishing his combo, swap to your next character to begin your rotation again.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true">There are scenarios where you may want to use a different combo. In multi-target situations where you want Wanderer to hit in a larger AoE, you can spam Charged Attacks with no Normals in between. If you have weapon or team buffs that empower Normal Attacks but not Charged Attacks, you may choose to only spam Normal Attacks.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-are-wanderer-constellations-worth-pulling" data-injectable="false">Are Wanderer Constellations worth pulling?</h3> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true"><strong>No, Wanderer’s Constellations are generally not worth pulling.</strong> His Constellations increase his own damage in various ways, but his damage at C0 is usually sufficient for most scenarios. Unless you are determined to maximize Wanderer’s damage in the Spiral Abyss, Constellations are unnecessary. If you <em>do</em> decide to pull for Constellations, I recommend stopping at C1 or C2.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">Wanderer’s Constellation 1 increases his attack speed during his combo. Though most attack speed buffs in <em>Genshin Impact</em> only affect Normal Attacks, Wanderer’s C1 also speeds up his Charged Attacks. This allows for a few more attacks during Wanderer’s combo before he drops to the ground.</p> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">Wanderer’s Constellation 2 buffs his Burst damage significantly when used at the end of his combo. Though Bursting is optional at C0, C2 encourages Wanderer to Burst every rotation. Having C2 does mean you will want to build some Energy Recharge, though, and forgo using 4pc Shimenawa’s Reminiscence. The actual DPS increase from this Constellation will depend on whether you need to adjust your build to account for his Energy needs.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-is-wanderer-s-weapon-worth-pulling" data-injectable="false">Is Wanderer’s weapon worth pulling?</h3> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true"><strong>No, I don’t recommend pulling for Wanderer’s signature weapon.</strong> His signature weapon, Tulaytullah’s Remembrance, does result in the highest damage for Wanderer. However, he has many competitive weapon options available to him.</p>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">Many of the 5-star Catalysts are useful to Wanderer, including Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds, Cashflow Supervision, and Skyward Atlas. My personal recommendation, if you have it, is <strong>Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds.</strong> Wanderer’s extended field time means he makes use of its stacking buffs, and the movement speed bonus allows him to zoom incredibly quickly through the sky.</p> <figure data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">As for 4-star options, I recommend <strong>The Widsith.</strong> The Widsith can perform almost as well as Tulaytullah’s Remembrance, but it’s a bit inconsistent. Its buffs are random, and they only have about 50% uptime with normal rotations.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">If you don’t have The Widsith, try Flowing Purity. It requires a healer and doesn’t work with Bennett, but it can be crafted for free using billets.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="377" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the best ways to increase your power level in <em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em> is by slotting gems into your gear. Most gear has a slot available, though the type of slot depends on the type of gear. When swapping out gems, don’t forget to use the unique gem removal ability <strong>Extract Gem</strong> you have. If you just slot a gem ontop of another gem, it destroys the original. </p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Now, you might think that this requires Jewelcrafting. However, there are no Primary and Secondary professions in <em>WoW Remix</em>. All characters will will have these abilities. All players also gain access to a swirling vortex that you can use to scrap unwanted gear. This turns the items into the Bronze currency.</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="809" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Armor Type</strong></td><td><strong>Slot Type</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Helmet</td><td>Meta Gem – Grants powerful ability</td></tr><tr><td>Boots</td><td>Cogwheel Gem – Grants you a movement or utility ability from another class</td></tr><tr><td>Shoulder, Wrists, Gloves, Belt (Up to 3 each)</td><td>Tinker Gem – Grants passive abilities</td></tr><tr><td>Chest, Legs, Necklace, Rings, Trinkets (Up to 3 each)</td><td>Prismatic Gems – Grant stat buffs</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">As a special note about the Prismatic gems: when you collect 3 of a Prismatic gem, you can combine them to the next rank. <strong>Remember your Extract Gem ability when swapping gems out.</strong></p> <p data-characters="65" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">The gems you can get vary, and we’ve compiled a list below.</p>  <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">These give you powerful abilities, but you only have room for one in your armor.

<p data-characters="127" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Amid concerns around when <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>could hit shelves, Rockstar Games reassured fans with an official release window. </p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">During a Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/c189ec33-cb0d-44a0-8d20-2d3352836999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investor earnings call </a>discussing future releases, Rockstar Games confirmed that <em>GTA 6</em> will launch in the <strong>fall of 2025</strong>.</p> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true">In December 2023, Rockstar Gave fans a first look at the upcoming title in an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-drops-early-with-a-2025-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement trailer</a> with a 2025 release date. However, in March, Kotaku <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-development-2026-delay-rockstar-office-release-1851359831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that the title could be delayed to 2026 as development was allegedly falling behind. Those concerns were exacerbated when Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-28/-grand-theft-auto-maker-tells-staff-to-return-to-office-five-days-a-week?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcwOTE1NzEzMiwiZXhwIjoxNzA5NzYxOTMyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTOUw1VTdUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.-RX5iw3WvXNoXh3WzdLx7HQS8izbfVBETAOBRJGUrV8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly asked employees</a> to return to the office for five days a week, signaling something might have gone wrong in the development process. </p>
 <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="168" data-injectable="false">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, who broke the story, acknowledged those concerns and <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1762959172155433256?t=1Z3asCq7v7p7H2SGu4RcwQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> “employees are not thrilled” with Rockstar’s decision. </p> <figure data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">Even in light of those hiccups, the recent earnings call should help extinguish any concerns about a potential delay. However, we still only have one trailer to go on for any concrete information about the title. So besides a setting and a first-look at the protagonists, we still have much to learn about <em>GTA 6 </em>before the reported Fall 2025 release date.</p>
