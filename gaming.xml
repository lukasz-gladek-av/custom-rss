            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Soulslike action RPG&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has only been out for a handful of hours, but it's already soared past every other game on Steam to snag the platform's highest-ever 24-hour player count peak.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam's own charts</a>,&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has already reached a 24-hour peak of 1,903,342 players, which is, of course, also its all-time peak. That's a handy victory over&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, which is now in second place with a measly 1,368,431.</p>
<p>Developer GameScience's game still has a ways to go if it wants to claim the all-time player peak crown, though. That accolade is currently held by Krafton's&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, which has&nbsp;an impressive all-time player peak count of&nbsp; 3,257,248.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-steam-charts-flask.jpg?itok=DmnAvqbe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-steam-charts-flask.jpg?itok=fiNQKjTB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is already proving phenomenally popular.</figcaption></figure><p>It goes without saying that this makes&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>the most successful single-player game of all time on Steam, at least by the metric of highest 24-hour player count.</p>
<p>Other games with a single-player slant, like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>&nbsp;</em>(953,426 all-time peak) and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>&nbsp;</em>(1,054,388 all-time peak), can't hold a candle to&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s numbers, and since the game has only been out for a few hours, its total is only likely to climb as time goes on.</p>
<p>So, where is all of this interest coming from? Well, according <a href="https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to GameDiscoverCo's Simon Carless</a>,&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s player base is predominantly Chinese, with 88.1% of the game's Steam players hailing from China. The next-highest total is the US with 3%, followed by Hong Kong with 1.6%.</p>
<p>Given the fact that&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>is based on a classical Chinese novel, that split makes a certain degree of sense, but it's also still pretty early in the day for a lot of Americans, so many from the US won't have had the chance to play the game yet.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, it's a single-player action RPG developed by Chinese studio GameScience, and it's the company's first game.</p>
<p>Based loosely on the Chinese novel&nbsp;<em>Journey to the West</em>, the game sees a young monkey warrior journeying across a mythical land to recover six artifacts left behind by legendary monkey king Sun Wukong after a fateful battle with the Celestial Court.</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The game is also set to arrive on Xbox Series X|S at some point in the future.

Wilson's 99 makes her the highest-rated WNBA player in NBA 2K history, and on par with the greats in the mens' league--NBA 2K only rarely hands out 99 ratings and often launches without a single player rated 99, as happened <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nba-2k24-player-ratings-the-12-best-players-revealed/2900-4831/" data-ref-id="2900-4831">last year</a>.</p><p>The WNBA's top five rookies have also been announced with some impressive OVRs.

            <p>The creator of the now-defunct Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 mod, H2M, has opened up about what happened when Activision slapped the mod with a cease and desist, admitting, "the past couple of days have not gone to plan".</p>
<p>Although the mod - which upgraded Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer mode - was announced over a year ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-mod-h2m-shuts-down-after-cease-and-desist-demand">the cease and desist arrived the day before the mod was scheduled to be released</a> last week, forcing the project to "shut down [...] immediately and permanently".</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, unhappy Modern Warfare 2 fans jumped onto the Steam page to express <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055689836/recommended/1962660/">their dismay</a>.</p>
<p>In the brief video embedded above, Watchful Wolf talked about the fallout following the decision to cancel the mod, as well as "share the reasoning" they believe Activision had for blocking it.</p>
<p>"Essentially, because of the popularity H2M was gaining - and how close it is to Black Ops 6 releasing and kinda the marketing and the beta and stuff for that - they did not want H2M interfering with possible sales of Black Ops 6," Watchful Wolf said, stressing that this was just how they interpreted the cease and desist letter rather than the formal legal position of Activision.</p>
<p>"So, with that said, for people who suggested 'you should have just made it on BO3' or something like that because they allow mod support… well, I don't think any project, no matter where it was, [would have been permitted] if it garnered such popularity so close to a new game releasing.</p>
<p>"They would have shut it down anyways, I think."</p>
<p>Watchful Wolf says they have now "quit modding Call of Duty", but "would be down" to make zombie maps or little mods here and there on BO3.</p>
<p>Wolf also quietly slipped in confirmation that the mod team was now "going to make our own game", too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-might-have-seen-its-last-200gb-install-size-as-activision-announces-optimisation-plans">Activision is set to roll out over the course of several updates</a> ahead of Black Ops 6's October launch, promising to introduce a streamlined interface, direct access to games, more control over downloads, and expanded texture streaming technology to reduce file sizes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> launches for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">certain tiers of Game Pass</a> on 25th October.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Our <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth: Wukong</a> review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.</p>
<p>All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc". </p><!--more-->
<p>The Google Doc in question is apparently from a representative of Chinese publisher Hero Games, one of developer Game Science's largest external investors, who have also partnered through investment with Kuro Games Studio, creators of Wuthering Waves. It was shared on Bluesky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/exserv.bsky.social">French journalist Benoit Reinier</a> over the weekend and subsequently written up by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/18/the-black-myth-wukong-no-feminist-propaganda-no-covid-19-discussion-email-is-real/">Forbes</a> and <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/black-myth-wukong-streamers-feminist-propaganda">VideoGames SI</a>. IGN have also now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-marketing-team-offers-content-creators-a-steam-key-but-bans-feminist-propaganda-and-all-talk-of-covid">verified it</a>, citing an anonymous source. I've asked Game Science for a comment on the matter, but I haven't had anything back. </p>
<p>The email outlines various "Do's and Don'ts" for people streaming or making other types of content about Black Myth: Wukong. Under "Do's", we find only "enjoy the game!" Under "Don'ts", we find the below:</p>
<blockquote> <p>• Do NOT insult other influencers or players.</p>
<p> • Do NOT use any offensive language/humor.</p>
<p> • Do NOT include politics, violence, nudity, feminist propaganda, fetishization, and other content that instigates negative discourse.</p>
<p> • Do NOT use trigger words such as 'quarantine' or 'isolation' or 'COVID-19'.</p>
<p>• Do NOT discuss content related to China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cautionary note against "feminist propaganda" is a reminder that Game Science have yet to respond to allegations of pervasive sexist behaviour from November last year. In a lengthy report for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">IGN</a>, Rebekah Valentine and Khee Hoon Chan described "a studio plagued by claims of sexism", linking this to misogyny elsewhere in the Chinese games industry and on the government-firewalled Chinese internet. The developers have raised the drawbridge in response: when Edders attended a preview event earlier this year, they refused to say anything on the subject in advance. </p>
<p>The request not to focus on Covid, meanwhile, seems to reflect the Chinese government's track record for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cnkednnp400o">censoring discussion of the disease and preventative measures</a>.</p>
<p>I know little about the internal workings of Chinese game publishing or the Chinese gaming community, but yesterday Lu-Hai Liang published an interesting editorial for <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/Black-Myth-Wukong-release-could-redefine-China-s-gaming-industry">Nikkei</a> in which he explores Black Myth: Wukong's importance to the regional games industry and to Chinese players. It's a prestigious, "triple-A" release from a country that, in Liang's analysis, lacks a track record for "premium" single player offerings due to government regulation of consoles, and is associated overseas with free-to-play gacha mechanics like those found in Genshin Impact - to say nothing of sinophobic reactions to the international investments of Chinese publishers like Tencent. </p>
<p>In Liang's view, Wukong's evident quality and global popularity have made it attractive to Chinese nationalists, and this has at times mushroomed into jingoistic dog-piling of the game's critics - especially in the wake of IGN's report into sexism at Game Science. "There is an edge to the online response and the attachment Chinese players feel for Black Myth: Wukong can tip into nationalistic pride," Liang writes. </p>
<p>I'll let you know if I hear anything back from the developers. In the meantime, Hero Games have just announced CrisisX, the tale of a devastating infestation in a quiet US coastal town. It'll be on show at Gamescom this week - I wonder if they'll ask booth attendees to avoid mentioning quarantines in their coverage.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/HERO-GAMES-ANNOUNCES-CRISISX">a press release about CrisisX</a>, Hero Games's CEO Daniel Wu also describes the company's ambition to expand their publishing operations into western markets. "We are deeply invested in the global markets, and with CrisisX, we aim to take Hero Games to the next level," he wrote. "We feel that now is the time to introduce ourselves and our products to a wider audience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> has given us our best look yet at its upcoming animated series, Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft.</p>
<p>The show is scheduled to make its debut on the streaming service this autumn, and features the vocal talents of the MCU's Hayley Atwell as Lara Croft. It's all set to take place after the events of the Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy, which comprised Tomb Raider (2013), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>.</p>

<p>"Following the events of the Survivor Trilogy, Lara Croft (voiced by Hayley Atwell) has abandoned her friends to embark on increasingly more perilous solo adventures," reads the official blurb. "But she must return home when a dangerous and powerful Chinese artefact is stolen from Croft Manor by a thief with an uncanny personal connection."</p>
<p>As you would expect from a Tomb Raider anything, the upcoming show will see Lara travelling to many exotic locales, and - of course - heading into some strange and forgotten tombs. Here, Lara will be "forced to confront her true self, and decide just what kind of hero she wants to become", the show teases.</p>
<p>Along with Atwell, Earl Baylon is reprising his role as Jonah from the Survivor trilogy of games. And, while I can't say 100 percent right now, I do believe that's Lara meeting up with Alex's computer wiz sister Kaz in the trailer (which you can see above). Kaz is the first confirmed gay character within the Tomb Raider series, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rhianna-pratchetts-stories-from-the-tomb-raider-reboot">introduced in the Tomb Raider comics by Rhianna Pratchett</a>. </p>

		<p>In 2010, Enslaved Odyssey to the West made its entrance onto the gaming scene. It wasn’t the most challenging game out there, nor did it bring with it a defining gameplay mechanic, but Enslaved had something that made it stand out: the heart showcased by its characters and engaging story. Just like the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/black-myth-wukong-review/">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, it takes inspiration from Chinese tale Journey to the West, and it’s a story that explores the themes of fear, loss, cooperation, and the changing nature of relationships, which is made all the better as central characters Monkey, Trip, and Pigsy interact with each other so well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enslaved - PS3 / X360 - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NmfAORuigW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Revisiting Enslaved Odyssey to the West 14 years after its release, and the last time I played it, made me consider whether I’d been seeing the game through rose-tinted glasses. If we really want to be reductive, Enslaved Odyssey to the West is an escort mission spread out over eight hours. At the start of the game, Monkey and Trip, who do not know each other, escape from a slaver’s airship, crashing down into the ruins of our civilisation. The name of Enslaved comes from the very literal enslaving of Monkey by Trip. While Monkey is out cold, Trip crowns him with a slaver headpiece, which allows her to give him commands. It also links the two, so if Trip dies, Monkey dies. Trip is out in the real wider world for the first time, and in her first interaction with Monkey, she saw a musclebound man chasing and shouting at her.</p>


<p>Trip doesn’t enslave Monkey to use him as a tool, but to guarantee her own safety as she finds herself in the company of a man who could quite easily cause her serious harm. She doesn’t know his intentions, and this is the only way she feels that she can be safe. Of course, Monkey is unhappy with the situation but soon accepts his fate and works with Trip to get her home. The story doesn’t follow a typical master and slave theme though. In most situations, Monkey is in charge and takes control, often having to order Trip around to move to places or carry out tasks. There are times Trip makes requests, but they are given as general instructions and not orders.</p>
<p>Despite, the name and the situation, both Monkey and Trip learn that the only way they can survive the world is through cooperation and partnership. The fall of our civilisation is not outright explained, as it happened a couple of hundred years ago, and neither of the two main characters are sure. What we can surmise from all of the mechs running around is that these robots were used in war and either turned on humans or were programmed to turn on them, which led to the majority of humanity being killed while some survivors created smaller enclaves or roamed alone, trying to survive in a world where danger lurked.</p>


<p>It is these dangers that the two navigate, Monkey through combat and Trip through her technical knowledge. She is the one Monkey relies on to operate controls and cause distractions, as well as upgrade his gear, while she relies on Monkey to keep her safe from the mechs that attack. They both later come to rely on Pigsy, who enjoyably looks like a pig and acts like a pig as well, to help them. Pigsy has his own goals but is happy to lend his services, though not without almost getting Monkey killed on purpose and hitting on Trip, who at this point has just found her father dead. Pigsy is portrayed as unlikeable, but at the end of the game he makes a big sacrifice for the others. In his standalone DLC, again Pigsy comes across as an idiot and braggart, but enjoys some character growth as he learns that he had what he needed by his side all that time.</p>
<p>Returning to the combat, and it is very basic compared to the games that have followed in the last 14 years. Enemies attack in small groups, with Monkey wielding a staff that can stun and destroy enemies through melee attacks, or firing plasma. There are a few enemy types and most are easy to take down, and the majority of the boss fights, while entertaining and set in interesting arenas, are quite repetitive as well. Even navigation is straightforward, with climbing points literally glowing and really not possible to miss at all taking away any challenge of finding your way. The camera is janky too at times, moving so focus on enemies is lost, letting them disappear off screen and attack from range. Yet, none of this takes away from the game’s charm. The world and the characters are in some way relatable, each going through their own development and growth. Monkey from a gruff loner to someone who stands up and fights for those by his side, Trip from a scared, lost, and unsure person to having more confidence in her abilities to be able to survive the world.</p>

<p>The final showdown at Pyramid also poses an ethical question: what is the nature of real life? We find that those who have been captured have not been enslaved but placed in a simulation to live lives from the old world, instead of having to survive in the harsh reality of its ruins. Monkey glimpses this world and calls it beautiful, but Trip destroys it all before asking if what she has done is right? We will never know as there is no sequel coming, but a big part of it would have been the fallout from Pyramid’s destruction. You suddenly have hundreds of people yanked from a reality where they had families and friends, and shoved back into the harsh fallen world. This could lead to mass mental trauma and PTSD as people grieve those they have lost, and may no longer be capable of surviving. However, it can also be argued that these people were enslaved to an idea that no longer existed and needed to be pulled out so they could build a new world.</p>
<p>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is still worth a playthrough now, both for those who played it way back, and for those who have never experienced it. You will come away from the game having enjoyed yourself and a bit let down that plans for a sequel were cancelled.</p>

            <p>Our unlucky planet in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wasteland-waste-disposal">Wasteland Waste Disposal</a> has suffered not just one apocalypse but all of them. Turns out the "megapocalypse" was an unhealthy combination of "every worst-case apocalyptic scenario imaginable". Luckily, in this upcoming sandbox adventure, you have a giant metal fortress that walks above the pools of toxic sludge on huge spidery legs and chomps up all the trash you bring it. If you are not intrigued by that, perhaps the little janitor with a sci-fi vacuum cleaner (or the feel-good music reminiscent of Adventure Time songs) will convince you. </p>

<p>It looks like your mobile metal fortress will be a big focus, as you upgrade it with new gear and pop bits of scaffolding on the exterior to make room for smelting pots and roof gardens. But acid rain and radioactive storms may weather the hull, according to developers Kluk Digital. The other major thing you'll be doing is lowering yourself to the earth's banjaxed surface on a big elevator and doing a lot of environmental cleanup. We see our hero driving in a little digger and a forklift, for example, steadily tidying up a small city neighbourhood. There will also be creatures to collect and farm, with helpful or harmful habits. "Not all organisms are created equally useful," say the game's creators.</p>
<p>Cleaning games have a power over me. The red muck of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/viscera-cleanup-detail">Viscera Cleanup Detail</a> is a gag stretched out like a yellow rubber glove, until it becomes a kind of compelling chore. Its down-to-earth equivalent, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>, fills me with a healthy fear because I know if I start playing it I will never stop. But my favourite game about recycling is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, which sees you lasering metal and glass in zero gravity, surrounded by giant disposal machinery that will slurp you up just as quickly as it swallows old passenger seats. </p>
<p>All these games fill you with a compulsion to turn goo to gleam, or gnarl to neatness. And seeing the timelapse of the bouffant beautifier in Wasteland Waste Disposal as they scurry around hoovering up leaves, twigs and mud to turn an urban ruin into habitable space is very much activating my "tidy up" glands. The developers want to create a "small open world" partly inspired by The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a>, they say, which is a nice mash-up of influences. Many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/search?q=open+world+#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=open%20world%20&amp;gsc.page=1">open world games</a> can afford to be more compact. Looking at you, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>.</p>
<p>There's no release yet but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2946140/Wasteland_Waste_disposal/">wishlist it on Steam</a>, if you're the detoxifying type.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> - Game Science's action RPG rooted in Chinese mythology - has had an impressive debut on Steam, surpassing record concurrent player numbers for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>. In just a few short hours, it has already become the most played single-player title of all time on Steam.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Black Myth: Wukong is currently the fourth most played game of all time on Valve's platform, with only Counter-Strike 2, Palworld and PUBG: Battlegrounds ahead of it in terms of peak concurrent players.</p>

<p>Since its release, the game has recorded a concurrent player peak of 1,443,570. By comparison, Cyberpunk 2077's all-time concurrent player peak is sitting at 1,054,388. Elden Ring's concurrent all-time peak, meanwhile, is 953,426. </p>
<p>As for how China-specific interest in Black Myth: Wukong is, GameDiscoverCo founder Simon Carless notes very. In a post on social media platform X, Carless shared a chart revealing an estimated 88 percent of the game's players on Steam are from China. </p> <div>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong has not been without controversy, though. Prior to its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-resurfaces-misogynistic-comments-from-developer">posts from Game Science CEO Féng Jì</a> including sexualised and misogynistic language were reported. More recently, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">IGN</a> also reported further on the studio's history with sexism.</p>
<p>Then, just this weekend, images of a leaked document sent to influencers surfaced online, requesting they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-studio-requests-influencers-not-include-feminist-propaganda-or-covid-19-references-in-coverage">do not include "politics", "feminist propaganda", or references to Covid-19</a> in their Black Myth: Wukong coverage.</p>

<p>We recently awarded Black Myth: Wukong three out of five stars.</p>

Razer was the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194977/razer-snap-tap-mode-huntsman-v3-pro-wooting-rappy-snappy">first keyboard maker to add</a> a Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions (SOCD) feature to its range of Huntsman V3 Pro keyboards last month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204422/wooting-razer-snap-tap-socd-beta-feature">followed shortly by Wooting</a>. Using Snap Tap as Razer calls it or Wooting’s Snappy Tappy will now get you kicked from <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> games.</p><p>“Recently, some hardware features have blurred the line between manual input and automation, so we’ve decided to draw a clear line on what is or isn’t acceptable in Counter-Strike,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F730%2Fview%2F6500469346429600836">says Valve</a>. “We are no longer going to allow automation (via scripting or hardware) that circumvent these core skills and, moving forward, (and initially—exclusively on Valve Official Servers) players suspected of automating multiple player actions from a single game input may be kicked from their match.”</p><div><figcaption><em>You’ll get kicked from a Counter-Strike 2 game if you use Razer or Wooting’s new SOCD keyboard features.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>I’ve tested using SOCD in <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> this morning and can confirm you get removed from a game on Valve’s official servers, but there’s no account ban. Valve is banning the use of these keyboard features, but it doesn’t appear to be ready to ban accounts for using them right now.</p><p>Razer and Wooting’s SOCD features both let players automate switching strafe directions without having to learn the skill. Normally, to switch strafe directions in a first-person shooter, you have to fully release one key before pressing the other. If both are pressed, they cancel each other, and you stand there for a moment until you release one of the keys. SOCD means you don’t need to release a key and you can&nbsp;rapidly tap the A or D key to counter-strafe with little to no effort.</p><p>Some professional <em>Counter-Strike 2 </em>players had called for SOCD to be banned, much like how null binds that prevent you from pressing two opposing directions have been banned in tournaments for years.</p><p>Wooting reluctantly added a beta version of SOCD to its range of keyboards after Razer introduced the feature on its own hardware. “We are glad Valve has taken a stance against Snap Tap,” says Wooting in a <a href="https://x.com/WootingKB/status/1825799396459515913">post on X</a> today. “Don’t use Snappy Tappy (SOCD) or Rappy Snappy in CS2 any more as it will result in a kick.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-player-count-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><strong>UPDATE 9:00am ET: </strong>It took just a few more hours, but Black Myth: Wukong has become the third-most played game in Steam history. As of 9am ET, the game has 2.075 million concurrent players, just behind Palworld’s peak of 2.101 million. It could be assumed that the game will surpass that number in short order.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>ORIGINAL:</strong> Black Myth: Wukong is out today and it’s already storming up the charts. On Steam, the game has skyrocketed to a peak concurrent player count of almost 1.5 million players, which is coming remarkably close to threatening the spot held by Counter-Strike 2 (formerly CSGO), with a record of 1.8 million concurrent users.</p>



<p>This Chinese blockbuster of a title has been widely regarded as one of the most highly anticipated releases of 2024 for quite some time. In recent days, we’ve seen plenty of leaked content that showcased just how impressive this Tencent-backed action RPG is, and now that it’s here, the numbers are backing up the hype.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-wukong-rising">Wukong Rising</h2>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong comes from Game Science, a studio headquartered in Shenzhen. Inspired by <em>Journey to the West</em>, Black Myth puts players in control of the ‘Destined One’, bound to a journey that’ll see them explore a vast world while fighting some of the most gargantuan, impressive bosses we’ve seen in recent years.</p>



<p>As a result of a solid pre-launch marketing campaign, Black Myth: Wukong’s status started gathering pace with reckless abandon in the last couple of weeks. It has been released to an overwhelmingly positive reception worldwide, and on Steam especially, the player count is soaring.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2358720/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1.42 million peak concurrent players</a> are neck-deep in Black Myth, exploring all that this stellar title has to offer.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean all is going swimmingly in the world of Game Science, though. Most recently, the studio was lambasted for issuing ‘influencer guidelines’ that warned users against the promotion of feminism or the discussion of almost anything related to China on stream.</p>



<p>Will Black Myth: Wukong top the all-time high held by Counter-Strike?</p>
