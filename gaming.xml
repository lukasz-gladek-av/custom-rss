            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and this one is all about fire, so if you're a fan of flamethrowers and incendiary weapons, you're in luck.</p>
<p>In some ways, the Freedom's Flame Warbond, which lands on August 8th, is the polar opposite (hem, hem) of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-polar-patriots-warbond">Polar Patriots Warbond</a>, although this one's packing significantly more weaponry themed around its title.</p>
<p>First up, you're getting two new primary weapons. The SG-451 Cookout, which is likely named after Ray Bradbury's iconic&nbsp;<em>Fahrenheit 451&nbsp;</em>(or perhaps the temperature to which the title refers), is a "pump action shotgun that unleashes a burst of incendiary phosphorus pellets". Sounds like fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond-flamethrower.jpg?itok=RVqijWHu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond-flamethrower.jpg?itok=xPw5BJGX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond is perfect for fans of fire.</figcaption></figure><p>The second new primary weapon is a literal flamethrower. The FLAM-66 Torcher works in a similar way to&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s existing flamethrowers, so make sure that you're not near your squadmates when you start blasting (or, alternatively, make sure you are if you're looking to lose some friends).</p>
<p>Lest you think that's the only flamethrower you're getting, think again. The Freedom's Flame Warbond also brings the P-72 Crisper secondary weapon, described as a "flamethrower that fits in your pocket". It's essentially a pistol that shoots fire. Finally, my childhood dreams have come true!</p>
<p>A new Booster gives you the chance to set fire to the battlefield when you land, which is ideal for clearing out hordes of enemies (but perhaps not ideal if you're planning to land next to your squadmates). You'll also find new armor sets that grant resistance to fire, though, so perhaps you could recommend your squadmates wear that armor.</p>

<p>There's plenty more coming in the Freedom's Flame Warbond too, so make sure to read <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4339865428697564653" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full list of additions</a> if you're planning to drop some Super Credits on this one next week.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Freedom's Flame Warbond lands on August 8th. The game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/553850/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy">read our review of it right here</a>.</p>

The series often nonsensically released the year <em>before</em> the games took place, sometimes <em>eight months</em> before the games started, which always seemed like the weirdest marketing decision imaginable.

<p>According to a new report <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Eurogamer</a>, fans are missing a Mario &amp; Sonic tie-in game for the 2024 Olympics after the International Olympics Committee ended its partnership with Nintendo and Sega.</p>



<p>Eurogamer reported that series veteran Lee Cocker directly reached out to them. Cocker claims that the IOC “wanted to look at other partners and NFTs and esports.” </p>



<p>They added that the IOC aimed to bring it “back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money.” The new report says the IOC simply allowed the licensing deal with Nintendo and Sega to “lapse in 2020.”</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Mario &amp; Sonic are a staple of the Olympic Games, as the series released tie-in titles for well over a decade. </p>



<p>The most recent game celebrated the Tokyo 2020 games, which included both new and classic sports. It did launch to mixed reviews, and still has a 6.9 user score on Metacritic. However, it was a kind of tradition, and many fans are disappointed by 2024’s departure.</p>



<p>Last week, the IOC <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-officially-becomes-a-part-of-the-olympics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially announced</a> that eSports has become part of the Olympics, though it will exclude first-person shooters.</p>



<p>Super Mario fans can still look forward to Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-luigi-brothership-announced-for-november-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming in November 2024</a>, and Super Mario Party Jamboree in October. </p>



<p>Most recently, Sonic fans learned that Sonic the Hedgehog veteran Takashi Iizuka showed interest in developing an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rpg-sega-takashi-iizuka/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPG for the franchise</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skibidi-toilet-movie-dmca-garrys-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Michael Bay's company Invisible Narratives has issued a DMCA claim against physics sandbox&nbsp;<em>Garry's Mod</em>, alleging the appropriation of assets from YouTube series&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet</em>.</p>
<p>The claim relates to certain&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;</em>characters, including three Titan character models and one of the titular Skibidi Toilets (which are essentially human heads that protrude from toilet bowls).</p>
<p><em>Garry's Mod&nbsp;</em>creator Garry Newman posted the DMCA claim he received in the Discord server for his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/garrys-mod-successor-sbox-enters-open-beta-next-week">upcoming game-slash-platform&nbsp;<em>S&amp;box</em></a>, and the claim, along with a message sent to Newman by Invisible Narratives, was subsequently spotted by YouTuber T9 and <a href="https://x.com/Thafnine/status/1818055148817760348" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shared on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skibidi-toilet-dmca-garrys-mod-camera.jpg?itok=f-CDId9h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skibidi-toilet-dmca-garrys-mod-camera.jpg?itok=yU_HKDeX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Things are getting ugly in&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet</em>&nbsp;land.</figcaption></figure><p>At first, T9 suggested that it was&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;</em>creator DaFuq!?Boom! who issued the DMCA takedown, but the YouTuber quickly reneged on that allegation, citing <a href="https://x.com/Thafnine/status/1818112776403132615" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message from DaFuq!?Boom! himself</a>&nbsp;in which the creator disavows any involvement with the DMCA.</p>
<p>We've also independently verified that Newman's message, as well as the message sent by DaFuq!?Boom!, are legitimate, so unless the DMCA claim is an elaborate fake, it looks like this is a genuine claim being made by Invisible Narratives.</p>
<p>The claim itself alleges that&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet</em>'s assets are "all registered copyrights that are unique and representative of our brand", and that revenue is being generated by "unauthorized&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;</em><em>Garry's Mod&nbsp;</em>games" despite the fact that there is "absolutely no licensed Steam, Valve, [or]&nbsp;<em>Garry's Mod&nbsp;</em>content related to&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet</em>".</p>
<p>If you're across&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet</em>,&nbsp;<em>Garry's Mod</em>, or both, you'll likely know just how wrong-headed this claim is. Plenty of&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet</em>'s assets, including some of the assets at the center of this DMCA claim, are taken from Valve games like&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em>, so Invisible Narratives arguably don't really have any right to claim said assets as their own.</p>
<p>The claim presumably derives from the fact that Invisible Narratives <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/skibidi-toilet-michael-bay-movie-adam-goodman-1236077245/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">secured the rights</a> to a&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;</em>movie recently, which is likely the reason behind the company's lawyers apparently looking for opportunities to hunt down&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;</em>"imitators", as it were.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skibidi-toilet-dmca-garrys-mod-assets.jpg?itok=M3BTeqT9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skibidi-toilet-dmca-garrys-mod-assets.jpg?itok=iIVbroWd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skibidi Toilet</em>'s assets aren't really DMCA-able, but here we are.</figcaption></figure><p>As T9 points out, it's entirely possible that the DMCA claim is nothing but corporate trolling. It could also just be an attempt to stake a claim by lawyers who aren't familiar with either&nbsp;<em>Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Garry's Mod</em>, but it's not a great look either way.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Invisible Narratives, as well as Newman's company Facepunch and DaFuq!?Boom!, for comment, and will update this story as soon as we hear anything back.</p>

I loved it so much, I put it on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/techraptor-robert-scarpinito-top-games-2023">my personal top 10 games of 2023</a>, the year I also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ragnarock-review-psvr2">played&nbsp;<em>Ragnarock</em>&nbsp;on the PlayStation VR 2</a>.</p>
<p>Back then, I thought the Steam Deck was the perfect instrument to experience <em>Spin Rhythm XD</em>. The track pads feel like an intuitive, one-to-one interaction with the gameplay. It just works, and spinning the wheel feels so satisfying.</p>
<p>Well, on July 9, Super Spin Digital proved me wrong when it released the VR update for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spin-rhythm-xd"><em>Spin Rhythm XD</em></a>.</p>

<h2>Step Into the Rhythm Dimension</h2>
<p>In <em>Spin Rhythm XD</em>, you spin a two-colored wheel to match the notes that come down the note highway. In VR, you simply tap on the wheel to hit notes, and once you’re highlighting it, you’re able to spin it. Tapping outside the wheel hits the beats, denoted by the green lines.</p>
<p>These motions give it a unique mix of feeling like drumming and DJing, which feels very ODESZA. It took me a bit of time to get used to, but once I felt comfortable with the controls, it was much easier to slip into a flow state.</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain, but at a certain point, my level of understanding the VR controls and my ability to read the music matched up, and I was able to “feel” the music. Hitting the notes and beats, sliding the wheel side to side along a melody—it all became second nature, in a way.</p>

<p>And much like with the Steam Deck’s track pad, spinning the wheel proves to be the most satisfying part of the game, even more so in VR. Using my whole arm to “spin” the deck left and right with no regard for the safety of others is viscerally gratifying.</p>
<p>Nailing a hard song in <em>Spin Rhythm XD</em> feels almost euphoric. It can be tiring, sometimes with only adrenaline pulling me through, but it’s an all-encompassing musical experience, fueled especially by the immersion of virtual reality.</p>
<p>EDM makes up a majority of the game’s track list, and a big part of the culture is arguably visuals. Lasers, motion graphics, visualizers, choreographed LEDs—all this and more are standard fare at these shows.</p>

<p><em>Spin Rhythm XD</em> carries that torch well, accompanying every song with unique visuals, often matching the vibe. Teminite’s “Ghost Ship” has you approach a giant skull and crossbones at the end of the note highway, while other songs have neon ships pass you by.</p>
<p>Everything behind the note highway reacts to the music, but it’s never enough to be distracting. Instead, it complements the overall experience, putting you in a whole new dimension of music. Pair that with a flow state and you’re golden.</p>

<p>Overall, if you aren’t a fan of electronic music, you won’t find a lot to love here. There’s a lot of house, dubstep, and synthwave here, though there’s the occasional chillhop or jazzy track to find too. If you’re looking for rock or metal though, you’re pretty out of luck.</p>
<p>A lot of the tracks come from Candian record label Monstercat, though that did leave me wanting a little more out of the track list. Overall, I found songs I really liked, but after noticing how many Monstercat artists were here, I did wish for stuff from other artists, too, like ARMNHMR, Sullivan King, or Blanke.</p>

<h2>When It Gets a Little Too XD</h2>
<p>There are five levels of difficulty, with the last one, XD, feeling like a huge leap. I’m usually the type to jump into the highest difficulty of rhythm games like <em>Cytus</em>, <em>Voez</em>, and <em>DJMax Respect</em>. But even now, some harder Expert-level songs give me some trouble.</p>
<p>I’ve spent more than 14 hours in <em>Spin Rhythm XD</em> between the PC and PS5 releases, and I still feel like I’m scratching the surface on how high the skill ceiling is, especially in VR. XD-level songs move fast, and it’ll take hours of more practice for me to get it.</p>

<p>Granted, moving your whole hand takes more effort than, say, flicking a stick, especially when higher difficulties demand frantic, fast movements. Sometimes, I do wonder just how possible the highest difficulty is in VR.</p>
<p>Luckily, <em>Spin Rhythm XD</em> offers multiple ways to play the game, even letting you plug in a MIDI controller for maximum DJ immersion. That player choice is one of the game’s biggest strengths. There are so many ways to play the game, including using the touchpad or gyro controls on the PS5’s DualSense controller. Keyboard or mouse are viable options, too.</p>

<p>It’s a fairly accessible rhythm game with a very high skill ceiling, and watching people full-combo songs on XD difficulty is almost hypnotic. But if you’re not a sweaty rhythmhead, it’s still a ton of fun on a difficulty that challenges you just enough.</p>
<p>Adding onto that, the PC version has access to SpinShare, a modding community with all sorts of fan-made tracks that can be loaded into the game. Combine that with the free VR update and you’ve got a new rhythm game juggernaut on the scene.</p>

<h2><em>Spin Rhythm XD</em>&nbsp;VR Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Spin Rhythm XD</em>, especially with its new VR update, easily stands as one of the most satisfying rhythm games on the market today. It’s a new spin on the note highway system that’s popular in the genre, with a lot to offer for electronic music fans.</p>
<p>There’s a pretty big difficulty spike between Expert and XD, but that also feels like a moot point. As long as you’re playing on a level that comfortably pushes you, you’re bound to have fun—and maybe even enter a flow state.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Spin Rhythm XD</strong>&nbsp;was reviewed on a PlayStation VR 2 with a code provided by the publisher over the course of 14 hours of gameplay (including previous time with the PC version). All screenshots were taken during the process of the review.</em></p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Spin Rhythm XD is an innovative take on rhythm games, with the VR version feeling somewhere between drumming and DJing. With a plethora of control options, immersive visuals, and intuitive controls, it’s an electrifying way to feel your music—as long as mostly electronic music is your jam.

Expect this one to attract buyers with cash on the hip!</p><p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Fezandipiti offers a superb blend of offense and defense, making it invaluable in any dark deck. Start stacking Energy on this Pokémon as soon as it hits the Bench, bringing it in to clear out any hush HP active Pokémon with Switch or sacrificing energy for retreating. Make sure to have some Energy Retrievals on hand, just in case!</p><h3><strong>Pecharunt - Illustration Rare</strong></h3><p><strong>Stats:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Type:</strong> Dark</li><li><strong>HP:</strong> 80</li><li><strong>Attacks:</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Ability</strong>: <strong>Toxic Subjugation</strong>: As long as this Pokémon is in the Active Spot, put 5 more damage counters on your opponent's Poisoned Pokémon during Pokémon Checkup.</li><li>[D][C] <strong>Poison Chain</strong> (10 damage) Your opponent's Active Pokémon is now Poisoned.

When in play, this Pokémon can cause 7 damage counters per Pokémon checkup, so there is no doubt this card will be seen in players' decks quickly.</p><p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Pecharunt is a fantastic Poisoner and can slow an opponent's game from the Bench. Ideally, you should use another Pokémon to poison opponents and then use Pecharunt's ability to enhance the poison. Using it alongside Garbador's "Poisonous Puddle" ability from Rebel Clash would be a fantastic combination from a player's Bench, allowing an active Pokémon to clean up!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/pokemon-tcg-shrouded-fable-preview-2-1722334096650.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet—Shrouded Fable - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><h3><strong>Pecharunt EX</strong></h3><p><strong>Stats:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Type:</strong> Psychic</li><li><strong>HP:</strong> 190</li><li><strong>Attacks:</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Ability: Controlling Chains:</strong> Once during your turn, you may switch 1 of your Benched [D] Pokémon, except any Pecharunt ex, with your Active Pokémon.

It's also extremely playable, so it's likely to be in high demand!</p><p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Using Pecharunt EX alongside any Loyal Three EX is a winning combination and allows for switching of Dark types once a turn with no retreat cost. In our opinion, this can really slow down opponents, saving Pecharunt EX when you are low on Prize Cards to devastate an opponent's active Pokémon.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where to Preorder Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet—Shrouded Fable</h2></p><p>Shrouded Fable is busting out all of the usual box sets and booster bundles, this time centered around the Loyal Three of Kitakami, Okidogi, Munkidori and Fezandipiti. </p><p>They'll all be getting EX cards alongside the malicious Pecharunt, looking to shove its cursed Moochi treats into the face of any human or Pokémon it can.

I also love the bizarre yet efficient ways of nature, like how all clown fishes are born male, with the most dominant turning female after a fight. All of it is beautiful.

The power of the IP was also an important factor, given that over the decade, more than a million people have bought </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Reus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. That was something we could build on.</span></p><p>Images via Firesquid.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Why did you choose to have the game play out in a 2D sidescrolling perspective? What benefits and drawbacks did this perspective have on how you could design the game and gameplay?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was less of an idea and more of a premise, really! It creates a unique screenshot that is immediately intuitive. However, there are actually many drawbacks. Technically, it's quite a feat to make that round planet so malleable and natural as it is. The direct cost is already high. It also has huge secondary costs because you set a hard limit to what you can realistically do with the gameplay. You only have a small strip of land where gameplay is done. It's a bit like somebody giving you a gorgeous chessboard with a high fantasy theme, then sawing off all but the last two rows and telling you, "Now make an immersive high fantasy game". And no matter how good of a job we do, the abstraction of space itself limits the game a lot, which makes me even prouder of the result.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into designing the gods and their abilities in the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is, oddly enough, more of a production issue. The giants tie all the elements together, representing a biome as well as the placement of specific types of nature. So, when designing a giant and its abilities, I'm 100% constrained by what we can make. I don't think we got even 50% out of the potential from the giants simply because we didn't manage the interactivity space where those abilities would fall. For example, The Rock giant would love to have an earthquake ability. But what for? There is no war. There are no enemies. And the biome building surely doesn't need another layer of multipliers and buffs. The same could be said about all human-giant interactions. We see this as the biggest missed opportunity, one we wish to rectify.</span></p><p>Images via Firesquid.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you design the visuals for the varied gods? What feelings did you want to evoke with the look of these creatures?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We had some constraints, but honestly, they just needed to look cool and harmonized. At first, we did not want them to look too much like animals, but then we got a giant crab, frog, and monkey. They also couldn't be too human—but then we have a bearded ice guy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a fantastic garden, and I like it for its richness.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into creating connections between the various things the gods could do and create and into developing synergies that could lead humanity in all sorts of directions?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Too many! The hard part was where to draw the line. You can't model the world; you have to pick your abstractions. In the end, we laser-focused on having fun, synergetic gameplay and let the humans react to it as a secondary. In a way, we didn't have a choice: many aspects of humans interacting with nature or each other were just not coming together quickly and we had to abandon them.</span></p><p>Images via Firesquid.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>When your god changes a part of the world, the visuals smoothly show the transition between its old state and the new one. How did you design these visual transitions so that players could watch the land change in such a striking way?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We knew this was important from the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Reus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so we put a good amount of effort into keeping this intact. It was some iterative work, but we had good constraints to work from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you design systems that would lead humanity down different paths depending on how the gods shaped their world? How did this kind of narrative weave into the player's choices in what animals and terrain to populate the world with?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Actually, chatGTP was quite useful here! We were looking for nature-human relationships, and polling Google or Wikipedia is a lot of work. So, we asked AI to give us examples: what are plants, animals, or minerals used by humans throughout history to gain prosperity? Then we only needed to fact check, instead of finding an obscure blog list somewhere to draw inspiration from. In the end, it was very welcome help; it allowed us to scale up the number of natural elements to almost 300 pieces! Then, we could just pick examples of human inventions or turning points.</span></p><p>Images via Firesquid.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What paths did you want to create for humanity? What thoughts went into creating the various ways humanity can change over the course of the game (becoming spacefarers, starting cults, etc)?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here, we were obviously limited by our capabilities because we had ideas to spare. We went with a few more visually explosive ones like the ones you mentioned, but we also needed some more basic ones. Who knows what we might add in the future?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What ideas went into the various planets players could start off with? How did you design worlds that would create interesting challenges and benefits for the player and their choice of god?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was actually the hardest part to get right in the end. We had so many constraints: the villages, the biomes, the giants... getting them all to work together smoothly retroactively was a lot of work. We also faced our limitations with what we could do, too, especially with the cities and the giants. The key was to keep it simple. Some players have noticed that the giants don't take up much of the design space, and they're right. In the end, it fell off a little because of the other limitations we had. Although we have some plans moving forward! The game is doing well, and we're looking forward to expand on the universe.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>UK developer Playground Games has opened a third office to work on the Fable reboot. The studio revealed as much on its dedicated <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/playground-games/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn page</a>:</p>
<p><em>Playground Games was established in 2010, bringing together some of the most experienced and talented developers from the UK industry, with the vision to create genre-defining titles for a global audience.

<p>The two previous offices are located on Portland Street (St. Albans House) and Newbold Terrace (Rossmore House). No details have been shared on the third office as of yet. According to the <a href="https://playground-games.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>, there are currently 32 open positions across all departments for the Fable team:</p>

<p>It would seem a lot for a game that's scheduled to launch in less than a year and a half, although, of course, it is possible at least some of those job openings have already been filled, and the website simply needs to catch up.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-then-review-soulcrushingly-beautiful</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-then-review-soulcrushingly-beautiful.940248/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-then-review-soulcrushingly-beautiful<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Until Then</em> is Polychroma Games's entry ticket to the limelight. The Filipino studio has created narrative games since 2018, but with <em>Until Then</em>’s release, they finally have struck gold.</p>
<p>This game is one of the few video games that spoke directly to my soul. It unearthed emotions that I thought I'd already moved on from. I couldn't be more wrong.</p>
<p>The game's story&nbsp;follows a high school student, Mark, who lives in a world affected by an almost world-ending disaster called “The Ruling.” Throughout his journey, he encounters different people and makes difficult choices as he tries to make sense of the world around him.</p>
<h2>Reading Between the Lines</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/inline-images/late-night-texting-in-until-then.jpg?itok=acYJcB_b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/inline-images/late-night-texting-in-until-then.jpg?itok=jXd0--A1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Their group's banter fills me with life</figcaption></figure><p>Just like other narrative adventures, there’s not much in terms of gameplay in <em>Until Then</em>. You’re mostly going to move around and talk to the people around you. At times, there will be minigames that would keep the players more engaged compared to just hitting the space bar and reading texts.</p>
<p>However, some of these minigames can be tedious at times, particularly the rhythm game parts, which I will explain further down the line.</p>
<h2>Proudly Filipino</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/inline-images/fishball-vendor-in-until-then.jpg?itok=SFq17YrM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/inline-images/fishball-vendor-in-until-then.jpg?itok=WadmTY-e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Street Food Vendors are all over the place in the Philippines</figcaption></figure><p><em>Until Then</em>'s setting is my home country, the Philippines. The developers have paid close attention to this detail as they've used an alphabet Filipinos used before the Spanish colonization, called the Baybayin. Graffiti and vandalism also use the native language which are nice touches.</p>
<p>Some of the banners and shops seen in the game&nbsp;are also direct references to real-life stores and banners that we see here daily. Attention to detail like this can be a make-or-break games that have a focus on narrative as a single article that feels out of place can break immersion. Even the main menu sound effects, where someone is shouting “Taho!” at the top of their lungs, are nice touches as these are the exact sounds people in the Philippines hear when they wake up in the morning. Especially, if they’re located in an urban area.</p>
<p>Most of the minigames in this game are also Filipino-influenced. For example, there's a minigame about skewering fish balls from a street food vendor which is a thing that we do quite a lot when we want to eat something really quick. The fairs and the minigames associated with them also transport me back to when I was a kid and always went to one with my parents. These minigames are properly implemented and don't seem intrusive.</p>
<p>While the setting is undoubtedly Filipino, some parts of it have been changed due to one of <em>Until Then</em>’s central events, The Ruling, morphing much of the landscape outside the main area where the game&nbsp;takes place.</p>
<h2>An Emotional Masterpiece</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/inline-images/everything-shines-until-then.jpg?itok=gtR2Q8O5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/inline-images/everything-shines-until-then.jpg?itok=82uMGM9V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>She's shining</figcaption></figure><p>The most important part of a narrative adventure game is the story it tells, and I’m happy to say that <em>Until Then</em> is a masterpiece in this regard.</p>
<p>The feelings of regret, love, and loss are strong here,&nbsp;and how the game navigates around these themes is masterful. Coincidentally, these were emotions that I thought I had already moved on from. The way Mark deals with his emotions and the situations he’s put into, despite just being a high school student, left me in shambles at times.</p>
<p>Face-to-face dialogue isn’t the only way characters interact in <em>Until Then</em>. In fact, the first piece of character interaction in the game comes from a text message. Not just that, there’s also a social media site that closely resembles Facebook that is fully interactable.</p>
<p>You can comment on some posts, like them, and share them. You can even click on articles and read them. I found this fascinating as it makes the game feel much more alive as you see characters–even those that you don’t interact with–have their own lives separate from the story. They’re all just chilling and doing their own thing.</p>
<p>Polychroma Games has also achieved something I haven’t seen much with games that have similar graphics: convey emotions. Most pixel-art games usually let the dialogue handle the emotional part of a scene. However, <em>Until Then</em> managed to find ways to convey a character’s emotions using just a few pixels. This is evident in scenes where characters are seen tearing up and a few light blue pixels can be seen under their eyes.</p>
<p>However, <em>Until Then</em> is not without its faults. If you’re familiar with how <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/nier-automata-review-robots-in-love">NieR: Automata</a></em> handles its storytelling, then you probably have an idea of the kind of problem the game is suffering.</p>
<h2>Not As Smooth</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/inline-images/rhythm-minigame-in-until-then.jpg?itok=5nq8j2tc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/inline-images/rhythm-minigame-in-until-then.jpg?itok=YtKq-DfX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Still surprised when this first popped up</figcaption></figure><p>As I mentioned earlier, this game needs to be played a couple more times after the first one to get to the true ending. However, as you go through it the second time, it suffers from pacing issues.</p>
<p>Just like <em>NieR: Automata</em>’s second playthrough, much of <em>Until Then</em>’s second playthrough is similar to its first playthrough. There are some minor differences to keep the players engaged, but the overall story progression remains the same.</p>
<p>At times, I found the second playthrough boring as there was not much new, and things wouldn't make sense until the latter half of it. This is a huge step away from the first playthrough which left me a crying mess. However, it’s still worth going through for the&nbsp;true ending.</p>
<p>Another part of <em>Until Then</em> that I wasn’t too happy about is the rhythm game sections. Towards the latter part of the first playthrough, you will encounter rhythm game sections where you have to press the arrow keys to the beat. I know that music is a huge part of the game, with Mark being intent on becoming a pianist, but there are a few times I found the rhythm game sections pretty tedious due to the randomness of their appearance.</p>
<p>I still remember the first time I encountered it at the latter parts of the first playthrough and was bewildered by how abrupt it was. During the first part of the second playthrough, you’ll also encounter a random rhythm game section that’s pretty similar to <em>Rhythm Heaven</em>. Which just seemed completely out of nowhere. While I do appreciate that they’re highlighting Filipino culture with the latter minigame, I think the developers&nbsp;could’ve done a better job of easing the player into it.</p>
<h2>A life-changing experience</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/inline-images/nicole-crying-in-until-then.jpg?itok=swIDmv2R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/inline-images/nicole-crying-in-until-then.jpg?itok=mViaJMhw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is literally me after I finished playing <em>Until Then</em></figcaption></figure><p>While it suffers a little in pacing and the rhythm game sections, it doesn’t dull the wonderful story <em>Until Then</em> is trying to tell. The game’s top-notch graphics and story left me smiling and even crying in its strongest moments.</p>
<p><em>Until Then</em> is a game for the masses, but it also has its target audience. As someone in that specific set of player base, I can proudly say that it&nbsp;has destroyed me emotionally. But at the end of it all, it has also taught me how to forgive myself.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Until Then</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by Polychroma Games over the course of 24 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Until Then doesn't shy away from its Filipino references and it delivers a masterpiece of a narrative. While there are problems with pacing and some minigames, Until Then's cast of lovable characters makes it memorable. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/30/new-helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond-burns-bright-on-august-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog post</a> today, PlayStation confirmed the details and release date for the Freedom’s Flame Warbond, coming to Helldivers 2 on August 8, 2024.</p>



<p>Freedom’s Flame will add “fresh emotes, capes, and skins,” as well as a variety of new equipment. That includes a SG-451 Cookout pump action shotgun, the FLAM-66 Torcher flamethrower, and P-72 Crisper. </p>



<p>Players can also find the new I-09 Heatseeker and I-102 Draconaught armor. These introduce the new inflammable passive that gives “75% damage resistance to fire.”</p>



<p>The official announcement closely follows Sony’s own accidental leak for the Warbond. However, the leak did not feature the specific details unveiled today. Fans also got a look at the new Warbond in action with a cinematic teaser.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The most recent Helldivers 2 Warbond was Viper Commandos, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-is-coming-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released in June 2024</a>. </p>



<p>Alongside that announcement, developer Arrowhead Game Studios also revealed plans to slow down the pace of Warbond releases. </p>



<p>The devs explained they expect to release Warbonds that are more polished. Just a couple of weeks ago, Arrowhead pushed a hotfix that finally helped with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-receives-hotfix-for-infinite-drop-in-glitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the infinite drop-in glitch</a>.</p>



<p>The new Freedom’s Flame Warbond will join Helldivers 2 just days after the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-escalation-of-freedom-update-coming-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escalation of Freedom update</a>. The update will arrive August 6, 2024, introducing new enemies, objectives, difficulty level, and more.</p>

<p>In a new PlayStation email advertising the PS Plus service, fans reported that PlayStation teased Secret Agent Clank among July’s PS Plus Premium lineup. </p>



<p>A couple of weeks ago, PlayStation officially announced the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-reveals-full-ps-plus-lineup-for-july-2024-confirming-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS Plus lineup for July 2024</a>. The new email includes titles from that announcement, such as Remnant 2 and Crisis Core – Final Fantasy VII – Reunion.</p>



<p>Later in the email, it also teases that premium subscribers can enjoy “Summoner, Secret Agent Clank, and Jeanne d’arc.” This appears to be an accidental reveal. </p>



<p>However, at this time, PlayStation did not officially confirm Secret Agent Clank is coming to PS Plus. One user on X, realradec, <a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1818137894210490392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted an image</a> of the PlayStation email they reportedly received.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The PlayStation Premium Plus lineup for July 2024 does include Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters. It released with the same three titles mentioned in PlayStation’s new email. So, it may simply be a typo. </p>



<p>However, many fans speculate that Secret Agent Clank would be a sensible addition following Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters. With August quickly approaching, PlayStation may also be looking to future titles already.</p>



<p>Secret Agent Clank originally launched in 2008 for the PlayStation Portable, and it later got a PlayStation 2 port. It remains a beloved title in the series for some fans, and it would help round out those available on PlayStation Plus.</p>

                <p>Squid Shock, the studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bo-path-of-the-teal-lotus/" data-ref-id="5000-589116">Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus</a>, has said that updates for the game's console versions may be delayed due to the sudden closure of its publisher, Humble Games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-game-publisher-humble-games-reportedly-lays-off-all-staff/1100-6525236/" data-ref-id="1100-6525236">earlier this month</a>.</p><p>The studio relied on Humble for post-launch support, and now needs to find another way to do so. "We are now in a difficult situation when it comes to updating the console ports, as both porting and QA support was tied into our deal Humble," Squid Shock said in a <a href="https://x.com/SquidShock/status/1817973044826226968" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>"We are actively pursuing all available avenues to allow us to roll out updates to console versions, but we regret to say this may take some time to put in place," the studio continued. The development team will continue to work on updates for the PC version and assured that they will come to the console versions in the future.</p><p>Some studios that have recently had their games published by Humble are facing similar situations. Last week, Coral Island developer Stairway Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/humble-games-layoffs-leave-developer-unable-to-update-its-game-or-release-it-on-switch/1100-6525328/" data-ref-id="1100-6525328">responded</a> console backers of the game, as they were upset with the lack of news regarding a Switch version. Due to Humble Games' shutdown, the developer said that it was uncertain about Coral Island's future on consoles, and offered Switch backers the option to change to a Steam copy.</p><p>Last week, Humble Games abruptly closed, laying off around 36 employees. While Humble said that it was "restructuring," those impacted disagreed, saying that its parent company, Ziff Davis, was trying to save face. According to one <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1815878717249319244" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">anonymous now former-employee</a>, Ziff Davis and Humble will no longer participate in launching any games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-images-spotted-in-existing-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Eagle-eyed players have spotted images of Subnautica 2 in the current game, and the moderators on Reddit have confirmed that these images are indeed from the sequel. The new images were found in a time capsule in Subnautica.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subnautica</a> subreddit (via <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/subnautica-2-screenshots-are-appearing-in-the-original-game/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=subnautica-2-screenshots-are-appearing-in-the-original-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Destructoid</a>), a user had posted an image that intrigued the entire community. The image was of a time capsule from Subnautica, which described, “Hey, um, found this on my way to the rocket. Is this thing new? Never seen it before! :O #PEEPERSRULE. Many players started speculating that these images could be from a new game before a moderator confirmed their suspicions.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the comments section, one of the moderators stated that these images are authentic and that there “may or may not be others to find.” In the same thread, the moderator also confirmed that these time capsules have been discovered in Subnautica 1 and are screenshots for the upcoming game, Subnautica 2. Additionally, the moderator clarified that no new creatures were coming to the original game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three images have been spotted so far, all related to one new creature arriving in Subnautica 2. These images showcase the fins, body, and half of the creature’s head separately, with all different body parts following a similar colour pattern.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The screenshots are exciting for the fans eagerly waiting for Subnautica 2’s release, but we still do not have a concrete release date from Unknown World Entertainment. Hopefully, an announcement will arrive soon. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding Subnautica 2, the developers have clarified<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-developer-clarifies-the-games-multiplayer-and-games-as-a-service-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the game’s multiplayer and games as a service (GaaS) model</a>. In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-devs-update-bugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout: London Devs have promised</a> a fix for the mod’s most significant issues. What are your views on the Subnautica 2 images? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-patch-113-out-now-heres-what-it-does<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> developer FromSoftware has released update 1.13 for the game following a period of server maintenance across all platforms.</p><p>This second post-<a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> patch, live now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S, follows early July’s 1.12.3 update, which tweaked the Golden Hippopotamus fight, among other things.</p><p>Publisher Bandia Namco released the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.13 patch notes</a>, and there are a few changes worth highlighting. For example, fans are getting excited about this quality-of-life change:</p><p>"Changed the default selection of the OK / CANCEL prompt that shows up when using the 'Spectral Steed Whistle' while the spectral steed is dead. The default selection position is now OK."</p><p>However, localisation staff removed from the credits are still yet to be added in. The patch notes say:</p><p>"In update 1.12, an error was included in the credits of the game. This issue will be corrected in the next update."</p><p>Elden Ring is one of the biggest video games of recent years, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-reaches-25-million-units-sold-ahead-of-shadow-of-the-erdtree">selling an incredible 25 million copies</a>. The Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is a hit, too, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/those-tough-elden-ring-dlc-requirements-didnt-stop-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-it-sold-an-incredible-5-million-in-just-3-days">selling five million in just three days despite tough requirements</a>.</p><p>IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree review</a> returned a 10/10. We said: "Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions. It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2>Elden Ring update 1.13 patch

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-games-new-megapicker-launcher-currently-gives-you-drawful-2-free<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
There's now an easier way to buy and play Jackbox mini-games, via the brand's new Megapicker launcher, available on Steam.
</p>
<p>
To celebrate, Jackbox is currently offering discounts on its range of mini-games and - for the next 30 days - the fan-favourite Drawful 2 to keep for free. 
</p>
<p>
The Megapicker, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-finally-adding-megapicker-for-seamless-minigame-swapping-across-packs">first announced last month</a>, is designed to act as a central hub for Jackbox mini-games, eliminating the need to rifle through each of its party packs for the game you're after. (This is handy, as I frequently forget which pack some mini-games were released within!)
</p>
<p>
If you already have Jackbox collections in your Steam library, their respective mini-games will unlock in the Megapicker. 
</p>
<p>
The Megapicker is free to download - and you can grab it via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2828500/The_Jackbox_Megapicker/">Steam</a> here. 
</p>
<p>
Next up from Jackbox? After years of its mini-games being used by players for terrible, awful, booze-driven drama, the brand is set to launch a deliberately adults-only offering: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-is-getting-risque-with-adults-only-naughty-pack">the Jackbox Naughty Pack</a>. The mind boggles as to what this will contain.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/conscript-review-glorious-set-of-stairs-we-make<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Concealed in a lot of anti-war messages is this “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” nature. There’s not a lot of genuine empathy for the characters involved for a lot of it, even if they do harbor genuine regret at the actions brought forth by the powers that be from the beginning. Still, it’s always a place to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/spec-ops-line-10-years-later">showcase the damage done to its soldiers</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/conscript"><em>CONSCRIPT </em></a>is no exception.</p>
<p><em>CONSCRIPT </em>is the debut title from Catchweight Studio and the brainchild of solo developer Jordan Mochi. Based in Australia, Mochi has been working on <em>CONSCRIPT </em>since 2017 and has personally been a highlight of my Twitter timeline the entire time. Sitting alongside other games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/signalis"><em>SIGNALIS</em></a>, <em>Resident Evil</em>, and the old-school <em>Metal Gear</em> games as inspirations, it’s been a long time coming, but we’re out of the trenches now.</p>
<p>You play as André, a French soldier during World War I who is stationed in Verdun. Your brother, Pierre, is fighting alongside you, known to the fritz above as they continue their assault in the French countryside. During a tumultuous assault on several forts occupied by the French Poilu, Pierre goes missing during a raid, and you must find him before the Germans do.</p>

<p>You may be surprised to learn that <em>CONSCRIPT</em>’s penning as a psychological horror game all comes from reality. There are no ghosts, no supernatural element attached whatsoever, just the pure cold realities of war. A noble effort, especially as you walk out of your bombed-out tent for the first time and see what war truly means.</p>
<p>Continuous machine gun fire in the distance. A thin haze covering anything with a wispy overcoat, and screams that call out for help, for mother, or for God. As first impressions go, <em>CONSCRIPT </em>is right up there with the best of them for immediately setting a tone, that being “war is hell”, and sets you up for what should be the fight of your life.</p>
<p>Combat can be rugged, bone-shredding, and otherwise brutal as you attempt to get to grips with it. Everything has a hearty kick, and the ranged weapons all sound and feel like they’re doing damage. There’s a quirk to some weapons like the revolver or rifle where you’ll have to cock it back after each shot, which only makes your timings all the more crucial.</p>

<p>In practice, it falls apart, however. There’s not a lot of grace or nuance to any of it, you’ll mostly be kiting several enemies around a square set and popping off shots whenever you can, which isn’t really in the spirit of things. The enemy AI also has no other play than “run forward and swing”, which is probably why it tends to cheat half the time you’re in combat.</p>
<p>When you’re facing enemies who actually have ranged weaponry, survival instinct says to dodge, or hide behind cover. Your combat roll can get things done in the heat of the moment, but for some reason, the level geometry - even when it’s clearly above André’s head - is penetrable for the German soldiers. It’s a deal-breaker when you’re looking to just breathe and focus on the next play, and the flammenwerfer soldiers can do it too!</p>
<p>It’s entirely plausible to avoid combat entirely, thanks to some fairly basic stealth mechanics introduced early on. Enemies have a wind-up timer for noticing you in plain sight, and you can do one-hit takedowns of most enemies if you hit them from behind without noticing. Actually navigating some of the areas later in the game with this mindset, however? Forget about it, due to the previously mentioned level geometry being a flat-out stinking lie, and the game hosting some absolutely godawful map design.</p>

<p>Some may call it intricate, but in its essence, it is obtuse to the point of sheer derision. Occasionally, André will pen maps as he explores the game world, but only occasionally will he decide to actually mark down blockades that otherwise wouldn’t appear on the map. This is something that is forgotten pretty quickly however, as the game will present you a map that has dead ends, but actually has rubble, fire, or barbed wire preventing you from continuing further.</p>
<p>So you start to completely ignore what the world offers, as it soon becomes clear that <em>CONSCRIPT </em>isn’t remotely interested in playing fair. Early on, there’s a rat mechanic introduced similar to how it works in <em>Dishonored</em>. If you kill an enemy and don’t take the proper precautions of burning their body afterwards, rats will spawn in, feast on the carcass, and become a new threat.</p>
<p>While they tend to be fairly negligible since dealing with them is a complete faff, it turns out they’re part of a bigger issue. Say that German soldiers have respawned in an area where you’ve already wiped them out, and rats have spawned in before the soldiers arrived. What might be considered a smart move - letting the rats deal with the soldiers or vice versa - is instead nullified by virtue of… I don’t know, the rats are also German, I guess?</p>

<p>So that’s two hazards in cahoots with each other, acting as a punishment for the player for overlooking their mechanics. If you place barbed wire in certain spots, it can stop the soldiers from respawning, and throwing a grenade into tiny cubby holes in the trenches can stop rats from feasting on corpses killed by André. It’s a good game of inventory management it presents and is indeed one of the few mechanics that aren’t immediately overused or immersion-breaking.</p>
<p>It’s hard pretending you’re the last line of defense between a German invasion and French liberation when the trenches you’re stuck in seem to be an offshoot of the Spencer Mansion. Survival horror can be as indebted to Resident Evil as much as it wants, but when <em>CONSCRIPT </em>invites the same arbitrary “3 keys for 1 door” blockade several times in a playthrough, I realize I am not in Verdun trying to save my brother and comrades; I am in an escape room playing for a Personal Best.</p>
<h2><em>CONSCRIPT </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>
<p>I cannot stress enough how much I wanted to like <em>CONSCRIPT</em>. The world is begging for survival horror with undertones like this, and while it certainly tries, mere words cannot explain how badly it misses the mark. It’s a constant cheat in its gameplay, its horror elements are downplayed to the point of mockery, and the story lacks anyone or anything that warrants sympathy.</p>
<p>If this is a love letter to survival horror, it’s a Dear John.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Remarkably dull and unremarkably poignant, CONSCRIPT’s gameplay isn’t fun, its horror isn’t scary or impactful, and its story isn’t worth repeating. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p>The Global Head for LoL Esports at Riot Games, Naz Aletaha, has announced her departure through a new post on X (formerly Twitter). After working for Riot Games for around 12 and a half years, Naz Aletaha is ready to begin the next chapter in her career.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through a post titled “A Grateful Farewell,” Naz Aletaha announced her departure from Riot. Aletaha stated that the decision wasn’t easy, given the many accomplishments during her tenure, but it was time for Aletaha to explore new horizons. Aletaha also talks about the early days. He said LoL esports was a “bold dream amid a sea of scepticism,” Now they have managed to fill arenas, break records, and build one of the most significant esports communities.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.strafe.com/news/read/global-head-of-lol-esports-leaves-riot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Strafe</a>, Aletaha was hired by Riot in 2012 as a Senior Manager in Business Development before she took over the position of the Global Head for LoL esports in 2021. Prior to her journey with Riot, Aletaha was employed by Activision, another big name in the business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During her time as the Global Esports head for LoL, they accomplished some massive feats. Still, the most significant was bringing a peak viewership of over 6.4 million viewers to the League of Legends 2023 world championship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before her departure, Aletaha announced that she was taking a break through the Riot sabbatical program, stating that she would be out for a few months and return to close out the 14th season. However, before we could see that happen, Aletaha announced her exit from the company. It will be interesting to see where her journey takes her next.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus - the gorgeous 2.5D platformer with Metroidvania elements based on Japanese folklore - released earlier this month across PC and consoles. However, due to its partnership with Humble Games, developer Squid Shock says it has faced a number of unexpected stumbling blocks since release, notably with its console ports.</p>
<p>In a recent post shared on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1614440/Bo_Path_of_the_Teal_Lotus/">Steam</a>, Squid Shock acknowledged the "unexpected changes" within Humble Games, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">layoffs were confirmed at the indie publisher</a>, and said it was still unsure what was happening next.</p>
<p>"This news caught us off guard, and we are still working to understand the full implications," the Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus team wrote on 25th July.</p>

</figure>
<p>At this time, the studio said while Squid Shock is a separate entity to Humble Games, and it remains committed to both Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus and its community, the changes at the publisher could result in delays for updates, particularly on consoles.</p>
<p>"This is mainly due to issues with storefront accessibility, which we're actively working to resolve as quickly as possible," Squid Shock said last week.</p>
<p>In a further post on social media platform X shared last night, the developer called the recent layoffs a "critical blow" to Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus' post-launch support. It then elaborated further on updates for console versions of the game.</p>
<p>"We are now in a difficult situation when it comes to updating the console ports, as both Porting and QA Support was tied into our deal with Humble," it wrote. "We are actively pursuing all available avenues to allow us to roll out updates to console versions, but we regret to say this may take some time to put in place."</p>
<p>Squid Shock said it "will get this resolved", and will continue to work on updates for the PC version of Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus. "We want to assure you that these updates and fixes will come to consoles in the future," the team wrote.</p>
<p>In a subsequent reply to one commenter, who said they were refraining from purchasing the game on PS5 due to past issues with 7 Days to Die, Squid Shock said this was a different situation.</p>
<p>"We will get backend access. They just haven't done the transfer yet," it affirmed.</p> <div>

<p>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is not the only game to suffer from collateral damage following the layoffs at Humble. Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/coral-island-developer-blames-humble-games-layoffs-for-leaving-switch-port-in-a-place-of-uncertainty">Coral Island developer Stairway Games</a> blamed the recent layoffs for leaving console versions of its game "in a place of uncertainty". Switch backers are now being offered a key change to Steam, effective immediately.</p>
<p>As for Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, I was rather enamoured with it when I gave the demo a go earlier this year. You can read more in my Wishlisted feature: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bo-path-of-the-teal-lotus-demo-reminded-me-of-the-sanctity-of-tea">Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus' demo reminded me of the sanctity of tea</a>.</p>

            <p>
The International Olympics Committee walked away from its partnership with Nintendo and Sega for the long-running Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games series in order to explore deals with new partners, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a> and esports, Eurogamer understands.
</p>
<p>
As the real-life Olympics gets underway in Paris, there's been discussion online of there being no new Mario &amp; Sonic tie-in for this summer's Games, for the first time in almost two decades. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking with Eurogamer, a veteran behind the series has now said the decision to end the popular Mario &amp; Sonic franchise rested with the IOC, which chose not to renew its licensing deal with Nintendo and Sega, and allowed it to lapse in 2020.

<p>
"They wanted to look at other partners and NFTs and esports," <a href="https://leecocker.com/">Lee Cocker</a>, who worked on almost every entry in the series, told Eurogamer. "Basically the IOC wanted to bring [it] back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money."
</p>
<p>
Cocker previously worked at ISM Ltd, a sports marketing and digital media firm responsible for managing the Olympic Games license in the world of video games. 
</p>
<p>
Over the past 20 years, six Mario &amp; Sonic Olympic Games titles have launched, beginning in 2007. Subsequent entries tied into London 2012, Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020, as well as the Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver 2010 and Sochi 2014.
</p>
<p>
The Mario &amp; Sonic Olympics series has been hugely successful, though latter entries suffered somewhat from the same sports recurring. 
</p>
<p>
With Nintendo and Sega's mascots ditched, the IOC has gone elsewhere. It's not been well promoted, but this year's Paris 2024 Games do have an official video game tie-in: Olympics Go! Paris 2024, a free-to-play smartphone-focused effort from San Franciso and Seoul-based company nWay, which previously developed several Power Rangers games. 
</p>
<p>
There's a PC version of Olympics Go! too, released via the Epic Games Store, though screenshots show the same touch controls and basic visuals of its smartphone versions. You can compete in 12 Olympic Sports, such as archery, gymnastics, 100m athletics, swimming and golf.

<p>Recently, one of the prominent Valorant esports players, Sentinels player Tyson ‘TenZ’ Ngo, took to Twitch to express his deep disappointment in Riot. He grilled Riot for using lower-end PCs during their premier competitions like VCT, stating that if he can afford it, surely Riot can too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/tenz-calls-out-riot-for-using-old-pcs-for-major-vct-events-2842435/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> during a recent Twitch livestream, TenZ spoke about not understanding Riot’s perspective on investing in lower-end PCs for their competitions. TenZ compares the situation with his days as a Counter-Strike pro, where their PCs were outfitted with the best CPUs and GPUs and came with a monitor with the highest refresh rate.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SEN TenZ Cooked RIOT For Providing Bad PC For VCT's Biggest Event" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOUFefmEClE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The former CS Pro expands, stating that Riot, on the other hand, features some “off-brand” monitors that are “2 generations behind”. He understands that purchasing a bunch of high-end PCs costs a lot, “but if I can fund that from my bank account right now, then sure as hell, Riot can do it”, said the Sentinels player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>TenZ speaks about how this has been a complaint against Riot for so many events, and they have yet to make any moves to remedy the situation. At the same time, he is “almost certain” that Riot uses the same PCs for Valorant and LoL esports competitions, and the company might be “trying to min/max the cost” by using the same hardware for both games. However, he added, “League can run on a potato,” but Valorant is different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>TenZ also commented on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOUFefmEClE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube clip</a> of his opinion, stating that his complaints aren’t an “excuse” and that he has a “big enough platform” to voice his opinion as a competitor, which is not just for him but all the players participating at these events. He feels the best players should use the best gear; “that’s just a fact”. Also, he added, “Riot makes so much money from this game, and it feels like they put the bare minimum back towards the esports scene”.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A new update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> has been released, bringing multiple balance adjustments and boosting Spirit Ashes.</p>
<p>Update 1.13 is now available for all platforms. However, localisation staff removed from the credits are still yet to be added in.</p>
<p>As previously reported by Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-removes-latin-american-translation-staff-from-credits">some Latin American translation staff were removed from the credits with the release of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a>, differing from the base game.</p>

<p>An apology was issued on the game's X account, noting their names would be added in an upcoming patch.</p>
<p>However, that's still to be rectified. "In update 1.12, an error was included in the credits of the game," reads the patch notes. "This issue will be corrected in the next update."</p>

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We have found that some translators are missing in the end credits of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a>.</p><p>Their names will be added as soon as possible in an upcoming patch.</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience.</p><p>We would like to express our gratitude and respect to everyone involved in this project.</p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1814224284207755591?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>The biggest change in the patch is to the Spirit Ashes. The notes include a long list of the summons, which will now no longer stagger as easily, while some also have increased attack power.</p>
<p>Further, summoned spirits will have increased attack power and damage negation when at Revered Spirit Ash Blessing level five and over - all except the Mimic Tear.</p>
<p>There are also balance adjustments specifically for PvP, as well as more general balance changes impacting a large number of weapons, skills, spells, and incantations from the DLC.</p>
<p>You can see the full list of changes in the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-113">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Modders have been busy altering the game too, including a mod to allow players to summon bosses as Spirit Ashes - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-mod-lets-you-summon-bosses-for-aid">Divine Beast Dancing Lion and even Messmer the Impaler</a>.</p>

            <p>As the first Something Of Mana game to come out in 15 years, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/visions-of-mana">Visions Of Mana</a> is bound to be exciting some of you out there. Well, funnel all that anticipation into your mouse-clicking finger, because developers Square Enix have just put up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/">a playable demo of the bright JRPG</a> on Steam. I'm not sure how much the demo offers, as we're only told it includes "a section of the story, battles and exploration." But that's better than nothing, and with a full month before release, you have plenty of time to scope it out.</p>

<p>Playing the demo will also get you some flashy weapons when it comes time to play the full game, say Square Enix in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2490990/view/4360131627020109908">an accompanying post</a>. The Gladius, Falx, and Horn Lance will unlock at certain points in its full release, provided you have the data from the demo on your PC. However, actual progress from the demo won't carry over to the full game, we're told. This is the one thing that stops me playing demos - the gnawing fear that I will have to repeat something I have already done. An absolutely bone-shattering debilitation to have when one is a games journalist. Never mind.</p>
<p>In Visions Of Mana you play as Val, a young lad from the local "Fire Village", as he travels to the Tree of Mana with his Val pals, exploring "semi-open" environments and donking enemy monsters in party-based real-time combat. So far it looks very colourful and cheery, if a little conventional. It's still one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-75-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2024">75 most anticipated games of the year</a>. Our Jeremy has fond Mana-ly memories, for example, and is interested to see what Squeenix do with the first original game in the series since 2007 (we're not counting all the remakes). He's excited that Flammie, the Falcor-inspired mascot of the series, seems to be a party member in this entry. You can see the fluffy little dragon guy fighting alongside our heroes in the trailers.</p>
<p>The full game is due out August 29th. We may have more thoughts on it then. You should always check back when we have more thoughts. You have no idea how many thoughts we all have here. Listen, just keep us open in a tab for the rest of the month and hit refresh every day. The thoughts never cease. </p>

            <p>In Cleanfall you essentially play a Roomba that is trying to reverse the apocalypse because the apocalypse is <em>messy</em>. A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.</p><!--more-->

<p>"You are a small, unassuming cleaning bot that desires nothing more than a neat and tidy home," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2769780/CleanFall/">the Steam page</a>. "But ever since the planet was dragged closer to the sun by a monomaniacal tech nerd, dust and death swirl across the surface, making for a very messy situation. If your house will ever be clean again, you need to fix the world. A clean world means a clean house. So, fix the world. Simple." Pretty sure this is how Genghis Khan got started.</p>
<p>Cleanfall takes the form of a 2D platformer roguelite with a surprising tower defence element. As the aforesaid cleaning bot, which you can upgrade into an extremely jaded robo-maid, you'll burrow through each biome in search of resources, items and hidden friendly or at least, non-hostile characters. You'll study the habits of organisms which look like spiders, tadpoles and octopods dosed up on Compound V. And you'll build hellish dangling labyrinths of "alchemic" turrets, ranging from mortars to drone hubs. Going by the trailer above, the action nears bullet hell intensity when there's a full complement of rancid kaiju spermatozoa involved.</p>
<p>I haven't had a chance to play, but there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3130820/CleanFall_Demo/">a demo on Steam</a>, and initial user reactions suggest that this is worth a pop. The full game is out in 2025. The obvious comparisons, which I will now crudely weld into a revolting headline, are Spelunky and Terraria with a touch of Carrion and Noita. </p>
