			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds comes on consoles with some evident technical issues, and it seems like even on PlayStation 5 Pro, the game's performance and image quality are disappointing, with bad PSSR implementation to boot.</p>
<p>French outlet <a href="https://www.gamersyde.com/news_gsy_preview_monster_hunter_wilds_sur_ps5_pro-23907_fr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamerSyde</a> recently posted an early analysis of the PlayStation 5 Pro version of the game, highlighting how the game on the premium Sony hardware still forces players to choose between different display modes and how Resolution mode still targets 30 FPS without any option to disable ray tracing for additional performance without providing a true 4K experience, as this mode uses PSSR to upscale a native resolution of 3072 x 1728p to 4K. Even with the additional raw power offered by the PlayStation 5 Pro, Resolution mode still cannot keep a steady 30 FPS, with frequent drops that the outlet thinks are caused by incorrect frame pacing.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Balanced and Performance modes on PlayStation 5 Pro are also quite disappointing. The former targets a slightly lower resolution than Resolution mode, 2496 x 1404p, with again no option to disable ray tracing, which makes the framerate jump way too much, resulting in a far from optimal experience even on a VRR display and uneven image quality. Performance mode, on the other hand, manages to hit its 60 FPS target, but at a huge cost in terms of image quality, as PSSR struggles to upscale to 4K resolution properly from the mode's 1080p resolution, delivering unstable image quality, especially in areas with a lot of vegetation, bad texture quality and more. As such, it definitely looks like the game is a few patches away from delivering a solid experience on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>It is a shame that Monster Hunter Wilds doesn't seem to run well on <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-720p-ps5-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any format</a>, as the game is a more than worthy new entry in the series thanks to its new combat mechanics and a more streamlined experience that makes it easier than ever to remain on the field going from hunt to hunt without having to return to base camp too often.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-delta-force-platforms%E2%80%94black-hawk-down-playstation-xbox-and-pc-status-explained.1118103/</guid>

<p>Delta Force is back with a full-scale release in 2025. Its platforms are the big topic of conversation with eager gun-toting, first-person shooter enthusiasts eager to satisfy their trigger finger.</p>



<p>Developer Team Jade has been working hard to ensure 2025’s Delta Force is up to the task. It’s part of the less-heralded shooter series but demands the same respect. The title has been through rigorous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-into-the-delta-force-hawk-ops-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alpha</a> and beta testing. It was finally released on January 20 to acclaim—with many fans loving the shooter’s tough and gritty feel.</p>



<p>Delta Force is officially out, but we’re here to let you know which platforms it’s on.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-on-pc-can-you-play-black-hawk-down">Is Delta Force on PC? Can You Play Black Hawk Down?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to go loud. Credit to Team Jade</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Delta Force is available to buy on PC through Steam and the Epic Games Store. You can play the free-to-play Black Hawk Down Campaign.</strong></p>



<p>All of the early testing for <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force</a> was conducted through PC. It’s only fitting the full release arrived on PC too. It seems likely any content—at the very least—is coming to PC before anywhere else.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force Black Hawk Down Campaign</a> is the perfect example of this.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-on-playstation-can-you-play-black-hawk-down">Is Delta Force on PlayStation? Can You Play Black Hawk Down?</h2>



<p><strong>Delta Force is coming to PlayStation at some point in the future, unfortunately, it’s not available to play on either PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 for the time being—which means no Black Hawk Down Campaign for now.</strong></p>



<p>The first quarter of 2025 is when Delta Force was supposed to be released on PlayStation. However, complications have arisen in the game’s development, causing the developer to delay the console launch.</p>



<p>A new release period hasn’t been confirmed as yet. One of the Team Jade staff declared in a <a href="https://x.com/ZeeUltra_/status/1892589196952359064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a> that “input fairness” on console was one of the key factors in the postponement. It remains to be seen how much longer PlayStation users need to wait for an update on a Delta Force platform update.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-on-xbox-can-you-play-black-hawk-down">Is Delta Force on Xbox? Can You Play Black Hawk Down?</h2>



<p><strong>Like PlayStation, a Delta Force Xbox release is assured, but development constraints have forced its release date—and subsequently Black Hawk Down Campaign content—to be postponed.</strong></p>



<p>It’s an identical situation for Xbox users. The issue relating to inputs and aiming equally applies to Xbox as it’s also a console issue—breaking things down as simply as I can. Keep checking back to this guide as we will update once we hear when Delta Force is finally coming to Xbox consoles.</p>



<hr>



<p>Does Delta Force have the pedigree to compete with other military shooters such as Call of Duty or the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Battlefield</a> game? Are you downloading it for consoles on day one when the time comes? Let us know.</p>



<p>The game has undergone significant changes for sure. Not only is it no longer called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-name-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hawk Ops</a>, but its Black Hawk Down Campaign means business—even if it is considered “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Too difficult</a>.”</p>

Bloober said Konami will continue as both the publisher and rights holder of the mystery game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno:</p><blockquote>Konami, a legendary name in the gaming industry, sought a partner who could breathe new life into one of its most iconic franchises — Silent Hill. Bloober Team was selected for their expertise in horror and atmospheric storytelling, and in 2021, both companies signed a partnership agreement. In October 2022, during the official Silent Hill Transmission livestream, it was announced that Bloober Team was working on a remake of Silent Hill 2, widely regarded as one of the best psychological horror games in history. </blockquote><blockquote>The success of the remake proved that Bloober Team had perfectly captured the atmosphere and depth of the original while introducing crucial innovations. The game was well-received by players, earning an 86/100 rating on Metacritic and an 88/100 on OpenCritic, along with numerous awards, including Game of the Year 2024 from IGN Japan and Best Horror Game of the Year from the IGN Community Awards.</blockquote><blockquote>The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project. The deal aligns with Bloober Team’s strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework. </blockquote><blockquote>Our collaboration with Konami has been incredibly fruitful, and the success of Silent Hill 2 speaks for itself. By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 2 remake went on sale on PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam on October 8, 2024 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-console-exclusive-to-ps5-for-1-year"><u>there’s no word on an Xbox Series X and S version</u></a> yet), and just a few days later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week"><u>had sold one million copies</u></a>.

            <p>Activision is continuing to tease the return of Tony Hawk and the Pro Skater series.</p>
<p>A new social media post from the official game account reads: "Loading... new parks. 3/4/25".</p>
<p>The date matches a countdown on the <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/">game's website</a>, but it's the "new parks" reference that has fans speculating. Does this mean a brand new game is on the way? Is it an expansion to the existing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a> remake? Or is a remake combining <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> and 4 on the way? The latter would certainly match the date.</p>

<p>The social post also includes an image of Tony Hawk, and another with skaters Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Tony Hawk, Rodney Mullen, and Eric Koston.</p>
<p>Notably, all of these skaters appeared in both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4.</p>

<p>The news follows other hints from Activision last week. Along with the website countdown, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-announcement-teased-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-latest-map">tease for a new Tony Hawk game was included in Call of Duty</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, a remastered version of Black Ops 2's skatepark-themed multiplayer map, Grind, was added in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s Season 02 Reloaded update.</p>
<p>And along with the skatepark theme is a TV screen showing the date 03.04.25. This refers to the 4th March, in US date styling.</p>
<p>Before that, professional skateboarder <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">Tyshawn Jones let slip he's included in a forthcoming, unannounced Tony Hawk game</a>.</p>
<p>In short, it's only six days until we find out exactly what Activision is teasing. What are you hoping for?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Bloober Team, the development studio behind the excellent Silent Hill 2 remake, confirmed its collaboration with Konami will continue with a new game that is currently in development.</p>
<p>In a new message shared on its<a href="https://blooberteam.prowly.com/383560-bloober-team-and-konami-continue-their-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> official website</a>, the Polish development team confirmed they are continuing their partnership with Konami, announcing the signing of a new agreement for a joint project. This new project is based on an unspecified Konami IP. Like with the Silent Hill 2 remake, Konami will once again be the new game's publisher and rights holder.</p>
<p>While neither the Silent Hill 2 remake developer nor Konami has added any hint as to which IP the new project will be based on, as Bloober Team is known to be a horror games developer, there's a very good chance the Polish studio will be working on the series again. While a remake of the iconic first entry in the series would be quite welcome by many, myself included, it would also be interesting to see what Bloober would do with the franchise if given the freedom to develop a new entry in the series.</p>
<p>No matter what Bloober Team will do, the studio has proved it has what it takes to create an extremely compelling horror experience with the Silent Hill 2 remake.

            <p>
Sorcerous cardgame <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> and slot machine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/luck-be-a-landlord">Luck Be A Landlord</a> have been reclassified as fit for people aged 12 years and over by the Pan European Games Information board, after they were initially slapped with an 18 rating for "glamorising... the simulation of gambling".</p>
<p>PEGI have made the change following a successful appeal against the 18 rating by Balatro's European publisher Sold Out and Luck Be A Landlord's Switch publisher Fangamer. They're also going to develop "a more granular set of classification criteria" for games that reference gambling, to distinguish jingling parodies of rentier capitalism from the one arm bandits found in actual casinos.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
To catch you up, Balatro was pulled from certain digital stores in March last year after it was recategorised as an 18+ game. In a <a href="https://x.com/PlaystackGames/status/1763614758043795909">statement</a>, the publishers attributed this to an unspecified rating's board "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'". In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1bdtmlg/ama_i_am_localthunk_developer_and_artist_for/">comments on Reddit</a> shortly after, the game's developer Localthunk confirmed that the ratings board in question was PEGI. "I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some grey area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is," he wrote. "I think the one thing I am most disappointed by is the fact that other games with actual gambling mechanics aren't rated the same way because of their appearance/theme."</p>
<p>Luck Be A Landlord, meanwhile, was <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/googles-inconsistent-app-store-stance-on-gambling-comes-under-fire/">banned from Google Play in 13 countries</a> in August 2023 after the game was found to be in violation of the platform's policies about gambling. In January this year, Google <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-luck-landlord-google-play-store-gambling-mobile-1851731303">threatened to ban the game globally</a> unless developers TrampolineTales updated its listing to specify that it "contains gambling".
</p>
<p>
All of which may seem ridiculous if you've played either game. To draw some basic distinctions, Balatro features poker cards and poker-style mechanics, but does not involve the waging of real money, and is fundamentally a deckbuilding roguelike featuring Tarot cards and bizarre Joker modifiers. Luck Be A Landlord, meanwhile, uses a slot machine format for the purposes of satire, and again doesn't involve the waging of real money.</p>
<p>I can, however, see the case for being suspicious of either game, both because there are superficial correspondences with casino machines and so forth, and because video game reward and randomisation systems at large have a certain kinship with gambling. Games like EA's football trading card sim Ultimate Team thrive on microtransaction and lootbox mechanics that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/meet-the-men-hiding-their-fifa-ultimate-team-addiction-from-their-families">may lead to addiction</a>, but you don't have to be pouring in hard cash to get hooked.
</p>
<p>
PEGI now <a href="https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12">agree</a> with the criticism of each game's 18 rating. Regarding Balatro, the complaints board have "concluded that, although the game explains the various hands of poker, the roguelike deck-building game contained mitigating fantastical elements that warranted a PEGI 12 rating." As for Luck Be A Landlord, they've similarly reasoned that "although the game features a slot machine mechanic, there were no specific transferable gambling skills and the game can therefore be rated PEGI 12."
</p>
<p>
They're also planning to revise their rating system a little to make finer distinctions between, say, games that depict poker and games in which you actually play poker for cash rewards. "The PEGI system continuously evolves in line with cultural expectations and the guidance of independent experts who support our assessment process," the statement continues. "PEGI strives to apply ratings criteria fairly, consistently, and transparently to ensure that audiences understand the type of content that is present in games.
</p>
<p>
"At this moment, any teaching or glamorisation of simulated gambling automatically leads to a PEGI 18 rating," it goes on. "On the basis of these appeals, the PEGI Experts Group will develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes and the simulation, teaching and glamorisation of gambling in different age categories, which will now include 12 but also keep 18 as an age category for games that simulate gambling typically played in casinos and betting halls."
</p>
<p>
I like that Balatro and Luck Be A Landlord are no longer being filed alongside the sweaty fruit machines that line the toilet queue at Weatherspoons. That said, I am naturally a little wary of the possibility that PEGI might compromise too much with companies who attempt to split hairs between "simulation, teaching and glamorisation". As Nic put it in Slack just now, it's easy to imagine less scrupulous publishers "trying to ludonarrative the fuck out of their lootboxes" and piling on "mitigating" elements so as to get their gambling experiences into the hands of kiddies. I'm interested to read a breakdown of PEGI's new criteria, once they've finalised it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/tron-catalyst-gets-a-june-release-date-and-a-new-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tron: Catalyst, the new game from Bithell Games, publisher Big Fan and Disney, has a release date, this digital world thriller coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch and PC on 17th June 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="TRON: Catalyst - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDRwx2qK-74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer gave us a closer look at Exo, the game’s protagonist, who’s found herself with the cursed gift of being able to perceive the glitch that is affecting the Arq Grid, letting her loop time back around on itself, and lending her unique abilities in combat. Glitches will allow you the ability to roll back time, rewinding events and using time loops that only you can see to uncover secret areas and shortcuts, as well as manipulate the factions in the game’s story.</p>
<p>It’s a Bithell game, so you know that one of the strengths is going to be the narrative – the studio previously explored the setting with the well-received Tron: Identity visual novel – though they’re getting back to creating something a bit more action-oriented. There’s various factions looking to hunt Exo down, such as the Peacekeepers and the malevolent prgram Conn, both of which are hot on Exo’s heels throughout.</p>

<p>And it wouldn’t be a Tron game without a bit of Light Cycle action, would it? The demo shows off some Light Cycle exploration in the city of Vertical Slice.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2977620/Squirreled_Away/">demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squirreled-away">Squirreled Away</a>, and for some reason it keeps wanting me to play it as some kinda 2024-as-heck <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> crafting game. At this, I make several rapid sniffing-like movements, then scarper adeptly yet dismissively up the nearest tree. It’s just far more fun to treat this as a casual squirrel sim, or, at the very least, a platformer where you occasionally need to steal some strawberries.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Look, I’ve played enough <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> to appreciate the pleasures of hewing a home together from Mother Gaia’s offcuts. But Squirreled Away’s scavenging and building don’t really do anything to explore beyond familiar stick-to-plank-to-hut tropes, even with the briefly amusing sight of your fluffy protagonist lugging a tiny rock axe on his back. It’s not like you’re crafting to survive anything, either: there are no elements to endure and the only consequence of letting your stamina run out is an inability to swing your tools. No enemies to be scared of either, unless you’re that American cop who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZPplp7wGso">magdumped an acorn</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, I recommend using what the demo gives you for gathering purposes – a roamable forest, freeform climbing abilities, zero fall damage – to engage in a spot of chilled-out tree rat parkour. Now <em>this</em> is a good time. There’s a perfectly judged stickiness to how you latch on to bark and branches, and many of the latter look like they were placed specifically for daring cross-canopy leaps. Screenshots for the full game present the tantalising possibility of eventually gaining a dinky hang glider, which might be the one thing in all of existence that could get me back to crafting. You will believe a squirrel can fly.</p>
<p>Down on the ground, the capacity for hijinks is diminished, though I did a smile at my expectedly terrible attempts to strum a guitar, and at how readily I could destroy camping equipment in pursuit of rare golden nuts. Squirreled Away definitely leans further towards cosiness than chaos – it’s not exactly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel With a Gun</a>, with or without the gun – but it also has a mischievous side that’s at least passingly fun to explore. When, again, you’re not filling a recipe checklist of twigs and pebbles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> will follow up its hugely successful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake with a new joint project with Konami.</p>
<p>The project will be a "new game based on Konami's IP" - the specifics are unknown, but considering Bloober's horror pedigree and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">Silent Hill 2 success</a>, a new game in that franchise seems like a safe bet.</p>
<p>"Our collaboration with Konami has been incredibly fruitful, and the success of Silent Hill 2 speaks for itself," said Piotr Babieno, CEO of Bloober Team. "By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right."</p>

<p>Reads a press release on the news: "The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project. The deal aligns with Bloober Team's strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework."</p>
<p>Konami's IP includes the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, Castlevania, eFootball, Bomberman, and Suikoden, though Silent Hill does seem the most likely candidate for Bloober.</p>
<p>The Polish studio's next game has already been announced, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-bloober-is-following-silent-hill-2-with-its-first-original-survival-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn being the company's first original survival horror game</a>.</p>
<p>"We are super happy for the [Silent Hill] team, for the accomplishments, and I do believe that they paved the path for us," Cronos co-director Wojciech Piejko told Eurogamer. "They dramatically changed the reception of our company on the internet from 'Bloober should not touch Silent Hill' to 'new great game from Bloober!'</p>
<p>"I'm super thankful for them and I know it wasn't easy to survive all these critics on the internet. You always have to remember there are people behind every game. It doesn't make your work easier. So kudos for [the team], because they made the impossible possible with making Silent Hill."</p>
<p>Konami announced a number of Silent Hill games back in 2022, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">Silent Hill f</a> perhaps the most anticipated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Digital Sun dropped a new trailer and a new announcement for Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault last night, showing off more of the game, and confirming that it will launch day one into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> when it arrives for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | A New Journey Unfolds" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slC6c8E40-A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Moonlighter 2, players will once again step into Will’s shoes to explore, collect treasure, and run a shop to make some money selling his finds. Will will be joined by companions to rebuild the village of Tresna, along with his shop, to make it a thriving place again. Where is Tresna, though? Well, it’s where Will and his companions have found themselves trapped in a dimension far from home. The ultimate goal of the game is to find a way to get back.</p>
<p>Moonlighter 2 builds on the same two-sided game design of the original, managing and curating a shop during the day and then adventuring at night. It jumps beyond the original game with a new full 3D isometric look, with the new trailer showing both the new hometown and shop that you’ll need to keep stocked with sellable goodies.</p>
<p>There’s an exapnded arsenal of weapons and gear to use when adventuring, as well as a fresh batch of biomes to battle through and enemies to overcome.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">Moonlighter review</a> from back in 2018 – it’s been that long?! – Jason said, “Moonlighter is an incredibly enjoyable jaunt through some interesting ideas and some fun fights. While the combat gets a little easy as you progress, the fun of watching money pour in as you play is immensely satisfying. It would be nice if there was more reason to play after completion as is normally the case with roguelites, but equally having an actual conclusion is a breath of fresh air for the genre. It is a lot of fun and one that will keep you entertained for a fair while if you want to sink your time into it.”</p>

<p>As you can see, the lady in red has returned. The snarky sister will be released April 3rd (or March 31st for those who buy the whole season pass in advance). She's the first character of the fighting game's season 2 DLC, with another three biff-buddies to follow - one in summer, another in autumn, and the final fisticuffer in winter. Two new stages are also due to be added in this DLC. </p>
<p>Anna is a long-running Tekken fighter characterised by a love for bazookas and a hatred of her sister and fellow Iron Fist contender Nina. She likes espresso, red wine, and the mouse Jerry from Tom And Jerry cartoons. I'm not making this up for a gag. It is what the <a href="https://tekken.fandom.com/wiki/Anna_Williams">always-entertaining Tekken wiki</a> says about her. I don't play as this character, or her sister Nina, so I'm not fully clued in about her high-heel headstomps and gut-blasting gunshots, or her various somersaults and scissorkicks, but the trailer shows a lot of familiar-looking launchers, feints, and open-handed chops. I like her new hairdo.</p>
<p>Tekken 8 has been out for a year now, and Bandai Namco are boasting that they've sold three million copies. That's three million people who want to beat you up - you must have really annoyed them. I thought this instalment was pretty good when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">battered my opponents and never ever lost in our review</a>. Although I was disappointed none of my favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-7">Tekken 7</a> characters were available at launch. One year on we still haven't seen signs of bull-fighting Spanish reprobate Miguel or tearful shin-cracker Josie. I'm not confident the latter will return, but I hold onto hope for my other favourite, Lei Wulong. In Tekken 7 the kung fu cop was released relatively early as DLC goes. I'd love to see him this year too. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> publisher Ubisoft has responded to the leak of story details and gameplay footage from its upcoming samurai stabathon, a month ahead of the game's release date.
</p>
<p>
This past weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/careful-of-spoilers-assassins-some-fans-are-playing-assassins-creed-shadows-early">photos posted online showed several fans now had access to early physical copies of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, while others claimed to have briefly been able to download a digital version of the game from the PlayStation Store.
</p>
<p>
Chunks of gameplay footage are now easily findable online, even as Ubisoft battles to remove the videos. Other fans have posted summaries of their time with the game so far, including story spoilers. And there's still weeks to go until Assassin's Creed Shadows' 20th March launch date.

<p>
"We are aware players have accessed Assassin's Creed Shadows ahead of its official release," Ubisoft said in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ixdc8d/a_message_from_the_assassins_creed_community_team/">message from the Assassin's Creed community team, posted to reddit</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"The development team is still working on patches to prepare the experience for launch and any footage shared online does not represent the final quality of the game."
</p>
<p>
Physical copies of the game were likely manufactured weeks if not months ago, while Ubisoft will continue to issue patches up to and beyond the game's street date in March. That said, fans report not seeing too many issues with the game so far.
</p>
<p>
"Leaks are unfortunate and can diminish the excitement for players," Ubisoft's statement continues. "We kindly ask you not to spoil the experience for others. Thank you to our community for already taking steps to protect everyone from spoilers.
</p>
<p>
"Stay in the shadows, avoid the spoilers, and keep an eye on our channel for more official surprises in the coming weeks!  20th March will be here soon!"
</p>
<p>
It's been a long wait for Assassin's Creed fans, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">repeated delays from the game's original launch date</a> late last year. Shadows is the first new Assassin's Creed game since 2023's Mirage, which was originally planned as an expansion for 2020's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game's launch comes amidst a pivotal few months for Ubisoft, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">the company looks poised to be sold or taken private</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch">the threat of further layoffs loom</a>.
</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Katharine Castle recently reported back after playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">six hours of Assassin's Creed Shadows, calling it the biggest shake-up of the series in years</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>DC boss James Gunn has confirmed he's in talks with both Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop new games in the DC Universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/james-gunns-new-plan-to-unify-dc-universe-includes-labelling-non-canon-games-as-dc-elseworlds">Gunn laid out his plans for the DC Universe back in 2023</a>, which would combine films, TV series and video games into a singular canon universe - much like Marvel has done.</p>
<p>Now, in a recent DC Studios event attended by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/new-dc-games-netherrealm-rocksteady-batman-arkham-injustice-3/">ComicBook</a>, Gunn and his co-CEO Peter Safran confirmed they're in close talks with the two Warner Bros game studios.</p>

<p>"We work incredibly closely with JB Perrette who runs that division," said Safran. "It's really the first time it's ever been this way at Warner Bros. James and I sit with the guys that run the studios under JB whether it's NetherRealm or Rocksteady. We sit with them and we talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in."</p>
<p>Added Gunn: "We see designs for the projects in their very earliest stages. We talk about those, we talk about what the story might be and we'll say 'Well, maybe you want to go this way because we're planning on maybe doing something with <em>this </em>character'."</p>
<p>There are no details yet on what these games will be, or which characters they'll focus on, with Gunn stating it will be a "couple years" from now when we finally see for ourselves.</p>
<p>Later this year DC will release its new film incarnation of Superman, so could we finally see a decent game adaptation in the future to follow up? There will also be The Batman Part 2 in 2027, while in 2026 there are film plans for Supergirl and Clayface. Could these hint towards game plans?</p>
<p>NetherRealm most recently released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, with the last in its DC fighting series <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/injustice-2">Injustice 2</a> released back in 2017. Rocksteady, meanwhile, released the ill-fated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> last year.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">Rocksteady is "looking to return to Batman for a single-player game"</a>, though it's "years away" from release.</p>
<p>Of course, there's also the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-games-reportedly-still-years-away-from-release-if-it-ever-launches-at-all">Wonder Woman game already in development from Monolith</a>, though it remains years away from release.</p>
<p>In further DC news, further crossovers with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is planned, as the company is discussing with Epic which characters to focus on. Again, the likes of Superman and Supergirl would make sense with the forthcoming films.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be the first time DC characters have appeared in Fortnite, as various heroes and villains have been available as skins in the past. However, this stopped once Warner Bros' crossover fighting game Multiversus launched.</p>
<p>It appears Warner Bros has U-turned on this decision following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-director-in-deep-mourning-following-last-weeks-shutdown-news">shutdown of Multiversus</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/idxbox-fanfest-reveals-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-date-lies-of-p-overture-trailer-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Yesterday, during the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8FrLCDS3hY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ID@Xbox FanFest Showcase, </a>which was held in partnership with IGN, Microsoft unveiled several news tidbits from third-party developers.</span></p>
<p>Arguably, the most important was the announcement of the release date for Revenge of the Savage Planet. This is the sequel to Journey to 2020's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journey to the Savage Planet</a>, which earned a positive reception, including an <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10 score here on Wccftech</a> from Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Anybody pining for more Metroid Prime needs to put Journey to the Savage Planet at the top of their list. The game has a few rough edges and its sense of humor might not be to all tastes, but it captures that inviting, adventuresome Metroid spirit better than anything I’ve played in a while. This Savage Planet will pull you into its orbit if you give it half a chanc</em>e.</p>
<p>However, getting a sequel going wasn't easy at all for the developers. Typhoon Studios was acquired by Google shortly prior to the game's release, but in early 2021, following Google's divestiture from its Stadia initiative, the studio was shut down alongside others. Later that year, former members of Typhoon, including Game Director and Writer Alex Hutchinson, established a new developer called Raccoon Logic and were able to secure the rights from Google to produce a sequel. Revenge of the Savage Planet launches on May 8 for Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC, and will be included with Game Pass on day one.</p>

<p>Another big news story from the ID@Xbox FanFest Showcase was the new trailer for Lies of P: Overture, the highly anticipated DLC for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acclaimed Soulslike game</a>. In this expansion, players encounter a mysterious artifact that transports them back to Krat in its final days of grandeur. In the shadow of an impending tragedy, their mission is to explore the past and uncover its dark secrets, haunted by surprises, loss, and vengeance. The developer says the choices made will ripple through the past and present in the world of Lies of P, revealing hidden truths and leaving lasting consequences. Lies of P: Overture <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will launch this Summer</a>.</p>

<p>The ID@Xbox FanFest Showcase also included several other announcements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balatro has dropped on Game Pass</li>
<li>Tron: Catalyst, in development at Bithell Games, launches on June 17</li>
<li>Jump Ship, an intriguing sci-fi first-person cooperative game that mixes spaceship combat and on-foot sections, will debut this Summer on early access (including Xbox Game Preview)</li>
<li>Descenders Next launches on April 9 and will be on Game Pass</li>
<li>The coop action roguelike 33 Immortals, inspired by MMO raids, launches on March 18</li>
<li>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault will be on Game Pass when it debuts later this year</li>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-fallout-game-ending-different-tim-cain/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-creator-reveals-his-original-plan-for-the-first-game%E2%80%99s-ending.1118037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/first-fallout-game-ending-different-tim-cain/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Tim Cain, one of the leading creative minds who fleshed out the Fallout franchise from the first game, recently revealed his original pitch for the ending of the 1997 title. At the end of the first Fallout game, the player will receive one of two sequences, depending on how they played their game.</p>



<p>One sees them return to Vault 13 after a string of successful missions before being permanently ejected by the Vault’s overseer (admittedly for good reasons). The second is the ‘bad’ ending that sees the player character becoming part of the Master’s mutant army, being dipped in FEV and turned into something grotesque.</p>



<p>Tim Cain uncovered a third proposal that’s much more light-hearted.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sunshine-lollipops-and-rainbows">Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows</h2>



<p>Fallout isn’t a peppy, upbeat series with positive themes and jovial sequences. It’s a dark, morbid, and miserable representation of a world beyond an apocalypse, torn apart by nuclear fire and twisted by mutation.</p>



<p>It therefore comes as no surprise to learn that Tim Cain’s pitch for the first game’s ending was shot down after being proposed.</p>







<p>In a recent video, the industry veteran explained how he wanted Fallout 1 to end:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I had pushed for Fallout ending with a party.</p>



<p>You’d come back to Vault 13, you’ve gotten the Water Chip, you’ve taken care of the mutant army and the Master, and everybody has a big party for you. There’s cake and balloons.</p>



<p>That got rejected.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full video, which showcases Cain talking about all his proposals over the years that have been pushed away. The Fallout bit is first up in the pecking order:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="My Ideas That Got Rejected" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UZJ-1AS4UKA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>After the dreary events of Fallout’s story, it might have seemed a little bizarre to end with a party, but the canonical ending is something much more depressing entirely. No matter what you do to save the people of Vault 13, you can’t be trusted to stay in there as a dweller because of the example you’ll set for younger residents of the Vault.</p>



<p>If you can leave and explore the devastated wasteland, why can’t they?</p>



<p>Tim has made his peace with it, but it’s always interesting to know what might have been. Years later, Tim’s vision unfolded in a way. Fallout 3 opens with a birthday party sequence with – you guessed it – <strong>cake and balloons</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/618616/logitech-powerplay-2-wireless-mousepad-charger-price-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/powerplay-2-logitech-made-its-magic-mousepad-cheaper-instead-of-better.1118031/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/618616/logitech-powerplay-2-wireless-mousepad-charger-price-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve never reviewed a perfect product, but Logitech’s Powerplay Wireless Charging System comes close. For over three years and counting, I’ve never even had to <em>think</em> about charging my wireless mouse. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23005435/magic-mouse-apple-logitech-powerplay">It’s so dead simple, it feels like magic</a>, and it’s a shame that most people probably can’t afford it at $120.</p><p>The good news: Logitech is releasing <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fpowerplay2" rel="sponsored">a new $100 version in March</a>, called the Powerplay 2, and it’s just as easy to set up. Plug in mousepad, snap a magnetic “Charging Coin” into the base of your mouse, then put mouse on mousepad to continuously charge.</p><p>The bad news: It’s only $20 cheaper, yet it feels like Logitech made its mousepad more than $20 cheaper to hit that goal.</p><p>The mousepad does come with improvements. Logitech boasts it has a 15 percent wider charging area and is thinner at just 3.5mm, and that’s what I see with my review unit. Now, as long as the entirety of my G502 Lightspeed mouse is resting within any corner of the mousepad, the charging indicator lights up, which wasn’t quite true of the original. My calipers do read 3.5mm when I’m measuring the charging base and its thin fabric mousing surface together.</p><p>But my calipers also show the charging base is exactly the same 2.7mm thickness as before, and the old mousepad wasn’t all that much thicker: just 4.3mm in total before vs. 3.5mm in total now, a difference I do not feel. And do you leave your mouse all the way at the corners of your mousepad? Again, I’ve spent over three years charging this mouse on the old mousepad without even thinking about it. I never bother to reposition my mouse on my old Powerplay to make sure it’s charging; I just drop it when I’m done using it, and I’ve never once run out of charge.</p><p>What do we lose with the Powerplay 2? First, while Logitech has ditched the old micro-USB cable, we’re <em>not</em> getting USB-C. Instead, Logitech’s opted for a <em>fixed</em> cable, so I can’t as easily take the mousepad off my desk on days I need more space there.</p><p>The big one: there’s no more wireless mouse receiver built into the Powerplay 2, a feature I found handy with the original. Now, my mouse requires two full-size USB ports instead of one because I still have to leave the mouse’s dongle plugged into my PC, too. I can’t leave the dongle stowed in the mouse for grab-and-go travel, and I can’t leave it in my laptop and switch between laptop and desktop anymore by turning the mouse on and off and yanking the Powerplay’s plug.</p><p>There’s also no more programmable RGB light inside the Logitech G logo. I don’t terribly miss that, since I don’t sync up gamer lights. But the dull black Logitech G feels cheaper; before, the RGB was at least a nice reassuring reminder that my mousepad was properly receiving USB power and ready for action.</p><p>And, while I do like the new thinner mousepad that comes with the Powerplay 2, which looks like it might not delaminate from its backing as easily as the original (it’s the one piece of my Powerplay that has deteriorated over the past three years), the original Powerplay came with two mousepads (one hard, one cloth) in the box. Now, you get the one.</p><p>(Also, just as FYI, the new Powerplay 2 charging coin doesn’t seem to work with the original pad and vice versa. You can’t mix and match those parts.)</p><p>I tried hard to get Logitech to show me more benefits, because the original’s one of my favorite products. Perhaps this one’s so much easier for Logitech to produce that it’ll offer some great discounts, or sell amazing bundles after launch? Or perhaps that 15 percent larger charging area will come in handy for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194631/logitech-g309-gaming-mouse-powerplay">possible additional supercapacitor mice</a> that’d react worse than battery mice if they aren’t getting reliably fed, though the current supercap G309 seems to work fine with the original Powerplay in my early tests.</p><p>Logitech wouldn’t comment on future supercap products, wouldn’t hint at sales, and wouldn’t promise its own bundles — though Logitech does “anticipate retailers will be offering bundles shortly after launch,” according to Logitech senior global marketing manager Andrew Siminoff.</p><p>The original Powerplay is no longer in stock at major retailers, so I expect it will soon fetch a premium price on eBay. But the Powerplay 2 still seems like a good product that achieves the core goal. Fingers crossed that come Black Friday, we’ll be able to buy a combo pack with it and Logitech’s cheapest compatible mouse — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194631/logitech-g309-gaming-mouse-powerplay">that G309</a> — for under $100 in total.</p><p>The Powerplay 2 should be available on Amazon <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us" rel="sponsored">and Logitech’s site</a> on March 11th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-fallout-crossover-make-me-play-indie-game/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-fallout-crossover-make-me-play-indie-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Balatro is one of those games that passed me by. Not because it’s bad, but because I have no idea how to play card games. It was a couple of months ago that it was revealed that Balatro had sold a whopping 3.5 million copies, which is a stellar performance for a game pieced together by a solo developer.</p>



<p>Recently, it was announced that Balatro will be landing on the Game Pass subscription service. To usher in this addition to the library of games, the ‘Friends of Jimbo (Pack 4)’ reveal was dropped, showcasing a series of cosmetic collaborations including Assassin’s Creed, Slay the Princess, and most importantly, <strong>Fallout.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-time-to-learn">Time to Learn</h2>



<p>If you know me, you’ll know I’m dizzy for the Fallout franchise. I’m a die-hard fan with thousands of hours invested across the series. When I first played Fallout 3 in 2008, it introduced me to a veritable feast of post-apocalyptic potential that became a burning adoration for the genre and setting.</p>



<p>Balatro, on the other hand, never took my fancy. It was released just over a year ago to an overwhelmingly positive reception, but I never saw the attraction simply because I know flat-nothing about card games.</p>



<p>To herald the arrival of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-game-pass-friends-of-jimbo-pack-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro on the Game Pass</a> service, a trailer was released showcasing the Friends of Jimbo (Pack 4) DLC, a cosmetic crossover featuring iconic imagery from some of the biggest and boldest franchises ever made.</p>



<p>To cut a long story short, there’s a cosmetic card upgrade featuring Fallout’s Vault Boy character, which you can see in the below trailer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Balatro - Friends of Jimbo (Pack 4) | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0G24sFdbXws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>And just like that, my curiosity is piqued and I have some connection to the chart-topping indie game that has won stacks of awards.</p>



<p>It helps that I’m also a huge Assassin’s Creed fan, and having Ezio Auditore on a card face has me eager to secure the pack and find out what all the fuss is about.</p>



<p>Recently, Balatro’s solo developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-luck-be-a-landlord-win-pegi-ratings-appeals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won a PEGI ratings appeal</a>, months after the game was classified as a game for adults because of the ‘promotion of gambling’. The developer, LocalThunk, also teased the impending ‘1.1’ update for the game, which is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-balatro-update-details-intentionally-being-kept-under-wraps/">being kept under wraps</a> until it’s the right time to reveal what’s coming.</p>



<p>Do you rate Balatro as one of the best indie games to emerge in years? In 2024, it was the Insider Gaming community’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/">Indie Game of the Year</a>.</p>

<p>It has just been revealed that Tekken 8 has already sold three million copies, passing the milestone inside a one-year window. The successful fighting title is also getting a new DLC fighter in the form of Anna Williams, a classic character who has been a stalwart figure in the franchise since the original Tekken in 1994.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco released an exhilarating gameplay trailer to showcase the imminent arrival of Anna Williams, who will join the game on March 31 for pass owners and April 3 for everyone else.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-blast-from-the-past">Blast From The Past</h2>



<p>It hasn’t been all that long since Anna Williams was last in a Tekken title. She surfaced in Tekken 7 as a DLC character and was in the starting line-up in Tekken 6. Her impending release in Tekken 8 was heralded by a three-minute gameplay trailer published recently by Bandai Namco:</p>

<p>Anna Williams will appear at the end of March wielding her trusty rocket launcher, but in a switch-up to her moveset, she’ll be wielding that bazooka as a melee weapon as well as a ranged accessory.</p>



<p>The trailer above showcases a classic clash between Anna and Nina Williams. These sisters have been an iconic duo for years, but Nina has arguably enjoyed a little more time in the limelight. In 2005, she headlined a game on PlayStation 2 named Death by Degrees. </p>



<p>If you could complete the game, you’d unlock Anna as a playable skin, which represents her assuming the role of second fiddle.</p>



<p>Despite never being a Tekken fan, I somehow managed to find and play Death by Degrees when it came out twenty years ago, and for some reason, it has stuck with me all this time.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Anna Williams arrive in Tekken 8 in just a few weeks? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bossa-games-more-layoffs-industry-turmoil/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In January 2024, Bossa Games (formerly known as Bossa Studios) laid off ‘around one-third’ of all employees, citing a ‘perfect storm of circumstances’. Recently, it was revealed that further layoffs have hit the company, with Bossa Games’ CEO stressing that the industry is in a place of turmoil.</p>



<p>These layoffs represent the second round of redundancies to strike Bossa Games since the company revealed Lost Skies, an innovative open-world title that’s a far cry from the games the company is used to producing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-is-not-a-phase">‘This is Not a Phase’</h2>



<p>Henrique Olifiers, the CEO of Bossa Games, posted a lengthy statement on LinkedIn highlighting the state of the wider industry. It’s his opinion that the tens of thousands of workers laid off over the last two years don’t represent ‘a phase’ but ‘a fundamental transformation’ of the business at large.</p>



<p>The co-founder of the company <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAoO_OkB-VfPR7dhiZ-PZ-9sf_EfWliEy1k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve had to make the painful decision to scale back, focusing on the late-stage production of Lost Skies and its upcoming launch, ensuring the game is successfully released and evolved for its players for the foreseeable future. Once Lost Skies is established and enjoying live operations, we’ll reshape into small teams working independently on novel game ideas brought to the players as early as possible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It wasn’t mentioned how many people were impacted by this round of redundancies, as Olifiers’ statement only mentions letting go of ‘extremely talented and treasured colleagues’.</p>



<p>This has already been a terrible year for the industry when it comes to layoffs and studio closures. Recently, it was suggested that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-studio-closures-dozen-claim/">NetEase is preparing to divest</a> overseas studios, which could result in several offices closing entirely. That news came days after the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-laid-off-as-netease-guts-entire-team/">laid off a North American team</a> formerly working on Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Bossa Games is best known for Surgeon Simulator and the quirky title, I Am Bread. The reveal of Lost Skies came out of left field, as it’s like nothing that the studio has worked on before, but gamers were enamoured by the exciting trailer and have been looking forward to the title since.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/activision-forced-gen-ai-call-of-duty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-has-been-forced-to-admit-it-uses-ai-to-generate-assets-in-call-of-duty.1118001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/activision-forced-gen-ai-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty players have accused Activision’s studios of using generative AI to produce in-game assets, namely calling cards, stickers, and some skins for at least a few months. For instance, a festive-themed calling card showing a ‘zombified’ Santa Claus bore clear traces of gen-AI usage – the character in question had too many fingers.</p>



<p>Now, the proof is in the open, and it’s all thanks to a recent Steam policy update that requires developers to clarify when generative AI has been used in the production of <strong>any </strong>game on the storefront. </p>



<hr>







<p>In a recent update to Steam’s policies, developers must disclose the use of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-players-want-to-filter-out-games-that-use-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any generative AI</a> in a sub-section listed under any game’s core description. This comes as a result of new rules published by the United States Copyright Office, which has decreed that any AI-gen content cannot be classified under copyright laws.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933620/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page for Black Ops 6</a>, it’s written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Call of Duty is one of the most ambitious development efforts in modern gaming, with Activision’s studios boasting thousands of developers working concurrently across multiple projects. It rankled with <strong>many fans </strong>that these teams would need to ‘resort to’ using generative AI to produce in-game assets.</p>



<p>In most cases, the content produced has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-modern-warfare-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">branded ‘AI slop’</a> by followers of the legendary FPS franchise.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time Activision has leaned on AI to support the Call of Duty series, though. In 2023, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-anti-toxicity-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI and ML-based tools</a> would be used to moderate in-game voice and text chat. This news wasn’t taken as harshly as the revelation that the team is using gen-AI to supplement the work of artists, though.</p>



<p>What’s the worst gen-AI asset you’ve seen created in Call of Duty? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

In case you’re wondering, he also told us that Nvidia was not aware of these issues before it launched these GPUs.</p><p>Here’s the company’s full amended statement:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D, RTX 5080, and 5070 Ti GPUs which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement.

        <p>Plug being pulled in May.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Just weeks after laying off the "majority" of its staff, developer Phoenix Labs has announced it's shutting down its free-to-play Monster Hunter-style action game, Dauntless.
</p>
<p>
Dauntless' fast-paced take on the Monster Hunter formula received a warm reception when it launched into PC early access in May 2018, but it struggled to maintain that early momentum following a wider launch a year on. And its journey is now officially near its end.
</p>
<p>
Announcing Dauntless' closure in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayDauntless/status/1894090939267702888">terse message on social media</a>, Phoenix Labs wrote, "Dauntless is shutting down on May 29, 2025. Dauntless will receive no additional content or updates. Dauntless will no longer be available to play on and after May 29th, 2025 at 11.45pm PST. Thanks to all for being a part of the Dauntless journey."

<p>
Confirmation of Dauntless' demise follows several rounds of layoffs at Phoenix Labs, which was acquired by crypto company Forte in 2023. Last May, the studio announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fae-farm-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-staff-and-cancels-projects-in-significant-restructure">cancelling all projects other than Dauntless and Fae Farm</a> and laying off staff - a move believed to have impacted 140 employees - in order to "pave a path for a strong future". Then came the news last month that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dauntless-and-fae-farm-studio-phoenix-labs-lays-off-majority-of-employees">a "majority" of employees would lose their jobs</a> in another round of cuts - which the studio blamed on "unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations".
</p>
<p>
At the time, it said it would discuss the future of Dauntless and Fae Farm "in the coming weeks". And while Dauntless' fate is now sealed, Phoenix Labs hasn't yet shared its plans for Fae Farm.

The $99.99 alarm clock is now readily available from third-party retailers in the US, starting with <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/z73qyjwthc940">Best Buy</a>. You can also buy it directly from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo</a> without a subscription, with the only caveat being that you must sign in with a Nintendo account.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->100</span></p><div><p>The Alarmo takes dozens of characters and scenes from classic Nintendo franchises and places them in a charming alarm clock that’s designed to help you sleep and wake. It uses motion sensors to detect whether you’re still in bed and gets more aggressive the longer you sleep in.</p></div></div><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">announced its alarm clock in October</a> while we patiently awaited (any) news regarding the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which is set to launch later this year. Although the Alarmo is certainly not as exciting as a new console, it is unapologetically Nintendo, with a cartoonish look that calls to mind a vintage alarm clock — albeit with a few modern features.</p><p>Nintendo’s bright red alarm clock features an illuminated button on top and a rounded face that houses an LCD display. The 2.8-inch panel shows the time/date and will attempt to wake you each morning with scenes and sounds from several iconic franchises. It makes room for visits from beloved characters like Link and Mario, as well as pikmin. There are currently 35 scenes across five franchises available, and Nintendo says you’ll be able to download more in the future. An integrated motion sensor can detect whether you’ve moved, too, and each scene will get progressively more aggressive based on whether you’re knocked out cold or making an effort to get out of bed (it goes silent once you’re up).</p><p>Button mode enables a more traditional alarm clock experience by allowing you to start and stop alarms or access the settings by tapping and twisting the button on top. The Alarmo can also automatically initiate sleep sounds once you’ve jumped into bed for the night, provide basic insights into your sleeping habits, and even sound hourly chimes to help you keep track of time throughout the day. Individually, these features don’t always work as well as those on a dedicated alarm clock or sound machine, but most of those aren’t nearly as cute.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
