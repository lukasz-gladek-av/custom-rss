<figure data-uuid="45e366b1f66d0"><a title="Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45e366b1f66d0/super-mario-bros-2-the-lost-levels.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've <em>all</em> heard of Minus World, right? A glitched world in the original 1985 release in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>, it was accessible via World 1-2 and is an infinitely-looping underwater level, similarly designed to World 7-2. It's one of the most legendary glitches in gaming history.</p>
<p>And, it turns out, its direct sequel <em>also</em> has its own Minus World. It's just taken almost 40 years to discover it, and speedrunner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq4ee6V3TiA">Kosmic</a> is the one who discovered it (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/super-mario-bros-the-lost-levels-minus-world-levels-found-four-decades-later/">Nintendo Everything</a>!).</p>
<p>In both the Japanese and English releases <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_the_lost_levels">Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</a> (the actual Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan, available officially in the West via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_all-stars">All-Stars</a> bundle on the SNES), various glitched worlds are available, either changing the names, looping screens, or changing enemy behaviour.</p>
<p>However, it's that All-Stars collection where a Minus World is really tucked away, and it's incredibly complex to pull off. You have to first progress through some increasingly-glitched versions of levels; the idea is Kosmic is trying to get past B-8, but reaching B-7 the first time, he realised it was impossible to beat.</p>
<p>Saving, quitting, and reloading brought him back to a completely different level layout, but it allowed him to get past those impassable glitches and roadblocks. A glitched warp pipe (with part of a coin above it) in B-9 brought Kosmic back to World 1-1, but this didn't deter him.</p>

<p>Continuing to progress through glitched worlds until he reaches World B-D and, eventually, various glitched menu options. It's a lot easier to watch than read us explain it, so make sure you watch Kosmic's new video above to see just how <em>wild</em> some of these glitches get.</p>
<p>So, why did this take so long? Kosmic mentions that difficulty is probably the main reason, but he also believes that, because this glitch requires you to make much more progress in-game, and wasn't played by as many people, there's just lower interest in general.</p>
<p>Well, we're glad that someone was willing to dig deep into the glitch worlds of The Lost Levels, and it's a pretty amazing discovery after nearly 40 years.</p>

<figure data-uuid="24d4066719a76"><a title="&quot;OpenAI Is Trying To Get Sued&quot; - Nintendo IP Floods Sora 2 Video Generation App 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/24d4066719a76/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: OpenAI / Sora 2</em></figcaption></figure><p>OpenAI recently released its dedicated Sora App, which is being pitched as a rival to TikTok and Instagram, with the key difference being that all the videos are generated via the <a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-2/">Sora 2 video generation model.</a></p>
<p>As is the case with many of these Generative AI tools, Sora 2 has been trained on millions of hours of human-made footage which already exists online, almost always without permission – and that includes copyrighted material created by the likes of Sega, Nintendo and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Sora 2 has only been available for a day or so, and most social network feeds are already flooded with videos generated using the tool, many of which blatantly steal intellectual property, including Nintendo's.</p>
<p>This fact hasn't been lost on the many people on social media.</p>




<p>It's not just Nintendo's IP which is being infringed here; <strong>Sonic</strong> appears in many Sora 2-generated videos, too.</p>

<p>OpenAI has previously stated that it has adopted an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-new-sora-video-generator-require-copyright-holders-opt-out-wsj-reports-2025-09-29/">'opt-out' policy regarding IP</a> – that means IP owners need to contact OpenAI to have their IP removed from the Sora 2 training database. Critics argue that it's basically the equivalent of robbing a bank and only returning the money when you're told it's not yours.</p>

<p>It's not just the world of video games which is being replicated here without permission; anime and movies are also being reproduced, thanks to the fact that advanced video models like this are <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/midjourney-copyright">betraying their training data with more accuracy</a> than ever before.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the notoriously litigious Nintendo will take this lying down, but many AI sceptics are predicting legal action from multiple IP owners in response to Sora 2's flood of cloned material. Last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/nintendo-is-reportedly-targeting-ai-generated-mario-pictures">takedowns were filed</a> against AI-generated images featuring Mario and other Nintendo characters.</p>
<p>Generative AI is a hot topic in the world of video games these days, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">with a recent report claiming that over half of Japanese developers are using AI in some form</a>. Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/dont-worry-nintendo-likely-wont-utilise-generative-ai-in-its-game-development">maintained</a> that it won't be making use of the controversial technology, at least for the time being.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-zaum-union</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/za-um-workers-form-uks-first-official-gaming-union.1314640/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Workers at&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>studio ZA/UM have unionized in the form of the newly-created Workers' Alliance, becoming the first officially-recognized UK gaming union into the bargain.</p>

<p>As reported by the folks at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the ZA/UM Workers' Alliance will legally represent only a portion of the studio's overall workforce, since it only applies to the UK arm of a company that also has offices in Portugal and Finland.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, marketing manager Poppy Ingham says the union was set up in order to give employees "a seat at the table in the big management meetings". She says ZA/UM workers "like being here" and "want to continue being here", and she wants the studio to be "a collaborative project between the workers and management".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-zaum-uk-union-cuno.jpg?itok=mXP00FAu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-zaum-uk-union-cuno.jpg?itok=pYHZ5Aoj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZA/UM's only game so far is anarchic RPG&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the new union only represents UK employees at the moment, Ingham says meetings are "completely open" to employees from other ZA/UM branches, and that those employees can "feed in" on the Workers' Alliance's activities.</p>

<p>According to Ingham, ZA/UM management has agreed to negotiate and consult with Workers' Alliance on issues that "ensure the general safety and care of employees", including pay rates, holiday time, and working hours.</p>

<p>The formation of the union at ZA/UM follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellation of a project at the studio</a> back in early 2024, which was itself accompanied by a round of layoffs. Ingham says it's these layoffs, "unfortunate" though they were, that "spurred [the remaining workers] on" to create Workers' Alliance.</p>

<p>ZA/UM has been racked with controversy since key figures Robert Kurvitz and Aleksander Rostov <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ousted-disco-elysium-devs-claim-fraud-studio-says-they-were-fired-over-misconduct/1100-6509090/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">departed the studio</a> in 2022, with both claiming their departures were a result of being forced out by unscrupulous investors.</p>




<p>Since then, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">number</a> of key&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">personnel</a> have announced their own spiritual successors to the critically-acclaimed RPG.</p>

<p>Additionally, ZA/UM itself has also unveiled&nbsp;<em>Zero Parades - For Dead Spies&nbsp;</em>(which was probably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">formerly known as <em>Project C4</em></a>), a game that looks very much to be in the same realm as&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>

            <p>Fortnite developers Epic Games have confirmed they'll be redeploying the 'Peaceful Hips' emote added to the battle royale as part of a crossover with superhero show Peacemaker, but with some modifications. This follows the dance being pulled from the game earlier this week, due to Epic's concerns about "creative intentions" in the aftermath of a big plot twist in the TV show.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is your spoiler warning if you don't want to know about <a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/peacemaker-twist-earth-x-prejudice">the Peacemaker twist in question</a>. Right, so one of the show's recent episodes sees protagonist Chris Smith, that's Peacemaker, discover that an alternate dimension he's been visiting is actually Earth-X, a version of Earth that exists in an alternate timeline which saw the Nazis win World War 2. Thus, America's a fascist state, right down to the flag having a big swastika on it. Cue a controversy, as some poses in the dance of Fortnite's 'Peaceful Hips' emote could suddenly be viewed as potentially resembling the shape of a swastika.</p>
<p>So, Epic <a href="https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-fortnite-nazi-emote-season-2-spoilers-2000629842">opted to disable the emote</a> while they talked to Warner Bros. in order to investigate the "creative intentions" of the emote. The result was Warner Bros saying they didn't intend the dance to have any Nazi connotations.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’ve worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros.

<p>"We’ve worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current Peacemaker storyline," a fresh tweet from Epic reads. "To avoid any confusion, we’re modifying the Emote choreography in next week’s update. If they prefer, players can return the Emote without using a ticket."</p><p>It seems bizarre, given that the collaboration is so recent, that Epic wouldn't have been given some kind of heads-up about this potentially controversial twist in Peacemaker's latest season. While Warner Bros might not have anticipated that the twist would lead to such an issue for the game publisher, it's a definite failure in communication. We'll see if the situation leads to any changes in how Epic handles collaborations down the road.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Technically, you can use your standard office monitor for gaming, but is it the same as a dedicated screen that’s built to chase enemies with exceptional refresh rates and near-instant response time? Not really.</p>
<p>You need gear that keeps up, and right now, you can upgrade without paying the full price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">Amazon has dropped the Samsung 24-Inch Odyssey G3 (G30D) to just $110, which is a massive 45% off.</a> You’re saving $90 on a display that’s going to make you feel like you’re in the middle of the action, but the discount ends soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mind-Boggling Refresh Rate, Stunning Screen</h2>
<p>Lags and blurs are frustrating. You can’t just sit and wait for your screen to catch up while your opponent gets away. Odyssey G3 packs an impressive 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time for ultra-fast visuals that give an in-game advantage. Jumping on an enemy squad the moment you spot them, or slipping away from a close fight, becomes much easier.</p>
<p>Bid farewell to image tearing and mid-action interruptions, too, because AMD Radeon FreeSync makes sure your monitor and graphics card stay in sync – always in real time. There’s Black Equalizer to brighten dark areas in the game, and Virtual Aim Point to line up shots more precisely. Basically, whether you’re checking dark corners for bad guys or going for the clutch shot, this monitor keeps up. Even better, blue light is actively minimized to keep your eyes comfortable, and reduced screen flicker makes it easier to fight the demons for longer.</p>



<p>As for the screen itself, you’re getting a decent 24-inch FHD display that pushes stunning, vibrant visuals. The 3-sided borderless design offers maximum space to play, and will also come in handy when you run a dual-monitor setup. The monitor’s height can be fully adjusted, and you can tilt, swivel, or pivot it to match your ideal setup. Port-wise, you’ll find a Power port, Headphone IN, HDMI IN, and a DisplayPort IN around the back.</p>
<p>If you’ve been playing on your standard monitor or laptop and want to upgrade to something more powerful, the Samsung 24-Inch Odyssey G3 (G30D) is an excellent option to consider. It gets you an exceptional display with an even better refresh rate and response time, which are sure to take your gaming experience up a notch. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">The monitor usually retails for $200, but this deal brings it down to $110, which is a much more affordable price point.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Starbreeze has canceled Project Baxter, its co-op Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, laid off a significant portion of its development team, and announced plans to double down on its Payday franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-announces-dungeons-dragons-co-op-multiplayer-game">Project Baxter was announced in December 2023</a> as an Unreal Engine 5 D&amp;D game that would “carry the signature Starbreeze cornerstones of co-operative multiplayer, lifetime commitment through a Games as a Service-model, community engagement and a larger than life experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The plan then was to launch Project Baxter on all major platforms in 2026 with crossplay. But news has been scarce, with a social media post showing off a single in-engine image in September 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In November last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-players-react-to-developer-starbreeze-saying-it-will-make-a-significantly-lower-level-of-investment-in-year-2-content">Starbreeze said it was still hiring for Project Baxter</a>, with work on the game continuing “at full speed.” “Internally, we have weekly playtests of Baxter, and active discussions with a number of industry-leading players regarding potential collaborations around Baxter's development and launch,” the studio said at the time. As of November 2024, Starbreeze had 191 total employees, most of which were based at its head office in Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The decision to cancel Project Baxter has cost the Swedish company SEK 255 million (approx. $27.2 million) in a write-down of development costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CEO Adolf Kristjansson called it a “difficult but necessary decision,” but failed to mention any particular issues with the development of Project Baxter that might have factored in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential,” Kristjansson said in a prepared statement. “By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze’s position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Part” of the Baxter team will be redeployed across Starbreeze’s projects, mostly within Payday, but around 44 full-time employees across staff and contractors will lose their jobs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are doubling down on what our players love – and what we do best – owning the heisting genre,” Kristjansson continued. “Payday is more than a game — it’s a genre we created and continue to lead. By redeploying talent and capital, we can bring innovation to heisting gameplay faster, while also laying the foundation for the future expansion of the genre.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Starbreeze said Payday has had more than 50 million players worldwide and generated close to SEK 4 billion (approx. $427 million) in lifetime gross revenue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With increased focus and resources, Starbreeze will accelerate its roadmap, delivering more frequent updates, new content drops, and continuous live-engagement,” the company said. “The discontinuation of Baxter, combined with an increased focus on the Payday franchise, will enable Starbreeze to become cash-flow positive in 2026.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kristjansson added: “I want to sincerely thank the Baxter team for their passion and creativity, and express appreciation to Wizards of the Coast for their support. Though we have made the decision to not continue forward with this project, we are proud of what was achieved in Baxter, and those contributions will carry forward into Payday and the future of Starbreeze. By concentrating our efforts on Payday we give Starbreeze and all our employees the best chance to succeed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what does the future hold for Starbreeze? The 12-year-old Payday 2 still has significantly more players than Payday 3 on Steam, but the developer insisted Payday 3 “is being developed into a scalable live-engagement platform to engage millions of players worldwide.” The Payday 3 team will grow to about 50 employees before the end of the year “and continue to grow in line with increased player engagement.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Starbreeze said it has new heist games in the works, too, including spinoffs and narrative-driven projects, and plans to expand Payday into new platforms. Meanwhile, it’s offering its services as a work-for-hire studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>Starbreeze has canceled its upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, which was in the works under the working title Project Baxter. The developer said its board of directors and management opted to cancel the project after a "strategic review" found that resources would be better deployed on its successful Payday franchise instead.</p><p>Starbreeze is taking an impairment charge of about SEK 255 million ($27.2 million) as a result of Project Baxter's cancellation.</p><p>"This was a difficult but necessary decision," Starbreeze CEO Adolf Kristjansson said. "Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze's position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders."</p><h2><strong>Layoffs</strong></h2><p>Some developers who were working on Project Baxter are now shifting to other teams at Starbreeze, including the Payday unit. Others are being let go. "Where internal opportunities are limited, Starbreeze will provide active support for affected employees to transition to new roles across the industry," the company said, adding that about 44 developers, including full-time employees and contractors, are losing their jobs as part of this move.</p><p>Kristjansson went on to say that Starbreeze is "doubling down" on the heisting genre, including Payday and "the future expansion of the genre."</p><p>The cancellation of Project Baxter, layoffs, and further focus on Payday and the heist genre overall, will help Starbreeze become "cash-flow positive in 2026," the company said.</p><p>"I want to sincerely thank the Baxter team for their passion and creativity, and express appreciation to Wizards of the Coast for their support," Kristjansson said. "Though we have made the decision to not continue forward with this project, we are proud of what was achieved in Baxter, and those contributions will carry forward into Payday and the future of Starbreeze. By concentrating our efforts on Payday we give Starbreeze and all our employees the best chance to succeed."</p><h2><strong>What's next for Starbreeze</strong></h2><p>Starbreeze also outlined some of what's to come in the future, including the aforementioned doubling down on Payday. The latest entry in the series, Payday 3, is nowhere near as successful as Payday 2, at least on Steam and in terms of concurrent players. However, Starbreeze said today that it continues to deploy updates and improvements to Payday 3 to help t become a "scalable live-engagement platform to engage millions of players worldwide."</p><p>"The franchise will evolve into a modern live-engagement game through ongoing technology upgrades, expansion and refinement of the player experience, and enhanced engagement models designed to be both fair and sustainable," Starbreeze said.</p><p>For Payday 3, Starbreeze said the team working on the game will grow to about 50 people before the end of 2025 and will scale from there in line with player engagement, if it comes.</p><p>Payday 2 continues to get new updates and improvements as well, and the game recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-launches-a-subscription-service-that-gets-you-lots-of-dlc-for-5-month/1100-6534993/" data-ref-id="1100-6534993">added a subscription offering to get all the DLC for a monthly charge. </a></p><h2><strong>"New games and experiences" are coming</strong></h2><p>Starbreeze said the Payday franchise has reached more than 50 million people to date and has generated almost SEK 4 billion ($427.3 million) in lifetime gross revenue.</p><p>Given the immense success of Payday, Starbreeze said today that it is working on "new games and experiences that broaden the heisting genre beyond Starbreeze's core projects." These will include spin-offs, narrative-driven projects, and "franchise expansion" to new platforms. Finally, Starbreeze said in its memo to investors that Starbreeze will continue to take on work-for-hire jobs to help supplement the company's revenue.</p><p>"This strategy is about execution and growth--with greater quality and predictability," Kristjansso said. "Our goal is to keep Payday evolving as a modern live-engagement game, and to open new ways for players to experience the heisting genre through heisting experiences and special operations. By focusing on delivering lasting value to players, we strengthen the foundation that drives sustainable growth for Starbreeze."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Discounty is a cosy Supermarket simulator in the vein of Stardew Valley. You’ll be ordering products, stocking shelves, and then selling them to the various townsfolk of Blomkest in an effort to expand your business. Unfortunately along with that comes dealing with inattentive local government, shady local businesses, and backstabbing journalists as it seems something in this town is rotten. And all you wanted to do was run a supermarket.</p>
<p><iframe title="Discounty | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbNGAedv08M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You arrive in the town of Blomkest to take over and reinvigorate your Aunt’s business, the local Discounty supermarket, where “everything’s always on sale!” As you wander through the town, you stroll past the bank, town hall, a bar, all the usual places you might expect, but there’s also abandoned buildings dotted around and a memorial museum that is no longer maintained since the council cut funding. Then you’re shown to the trailer where you live for the whole game – no house upgrades here – and told to ignore the mysterious shed behind it that emanates strange noises.</p>


<p>As you get stuck into managing the supermarket, you’ll be ordering stuff, putting it on display, and then manning the cash registers. You don’t set the prices yourself, instead hammering them into a calculator based on the price in your big book of products. It’s pretty enjoyable at first. There’s a zen-like calmness to it when you don’t have too many customers, but when you do, you to have to rush around refilling shelves whilst also serving them and cleaning the floor, which is hectic and results in frustrated customers. I quickly decided to have multiple shelves with the same item at a time so I didn’t have to rush around so much. With a bit of mental maths, you can speed up manning the till as well, saving yourself from the angry faces from impatient customers.</p>


<p>But there’s a litany of things that get in the way of this. Most products are bought form a computer and then quickly delivered by a guy called Guy, which is perfect. You do also need to arrange trade deals with local businesses for access to their products, though, which means running around town every time you want to restock their products, upgrade the trade deal, or ask them something. Stocking your shelves is the limited to grabbing things from the store room in groups of five. Only need to display two toilet rolls? For some reason have to pick up five and put three back, adding unnecessary time and fiddliness.</p>
<p>As customers shuffle around once you open at 9AM, they leave scuff marks on the floor, but you can only clean two scuffs at a time with soap before needing to take the bucket back. Then one of the customers who got everything they were shopping for and, if anything, you managed to serve quicker than the others leaves with an angry face for no discernible reason – nothing you can do about that. At the end of the day, 5PM, you close the shop and sit through the unskippable summary of sales, which is doubly redundant as you need to manually keep track of stock, and because you served everyone yourself. The only information I really need on this page is how much money I made and it doesn’t need to be listed per product, one at a time, whilst I wait for it to finish.</p>

<p>The shop doesn’t open on Saturday, so you might as well skip the day and get through to Monday, where you’ll have to replace all the posters around town, because they’re removed every weekend for no good reason. Oh, but you’ve probably forgotten to print them and the only printer in town, which is in the town hall, takes eight in-game hours to print a single one.</p>
<p>I quickly lost my enjoyment of Discounty because of all these elements. Management games can be cosy, but not when constantly putting frustrations in my path. I was enjoying completing small challenges to unlock more products, add more pockets to my outfit, get an improved scanner, and the actual act of selling was fun, but restocking while serving customers is&nbsp;next to impossible when there’s a lot of customers without angering them all. Every time one of the issues above shows itself again – which is pretty much every day for some of them – my enjoyment diminishes.</p>
<p>The overarching storyline seemed like it might be a plus at first as well, but something isn’t quite right. Sometimes plot threads are just left unresolved. You start out in a trailer and that seems like a signal for “you’ll be able to upgrade to a house at some point,” and the abandoned house you find shortly afterwards reinforces this, but in the end it just doesn’t happen. Then there’s the townsfolk, who are the most infuriating and obnoxious group of NPCs I’ve ever encountered. Everyone is gossiping, myself included, but one character admonished me for apparently starting a conversation with gossip about her own son – all I did was press to interact! Elmer in the town hall has be constantly hounded to do things he’s supposed to, such as removing a tree that is cutting off the only access to nearby farms, or fixing a broken staircase.</p>

<p>All of this involves sprinting across Blomkest on top of your other outings to restock your trade deal products that only restock on specific days. It’s infuriating. I just wanted to run a supermarket, not deal with red tape, incompetent government officials, unpleasant people, and getting loans. Even your Aunt in the game says “I didn’t catch you slacking, did I?” as she enters the store you moved into town to revitalise for her. Everyone just seems so unpleasant, and the “small town drama” promised by the game’s marketing just means whe the worst person you know would describe as “spilling tea”, as they spread rumours and bad mouth people behind their backs.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, I’ve been playing on a Switch, and my experience hasn’t been great. There’s no crashing or anything, but anytime you’re outside of a small building the frame rate tanks noticeably. It’s a very nice looking game as far as pixel art goes, with plenty of nice looking visual effects depending on what time of day it is, but the frame rate is consistently terrible when outside. There’s also some small oversights in behaviours, such as once when a staircase was blocked off for way longer than it was supposed to, but I saw Barbara, my fishy sticks supplier and uses the stairs in her commute, walk straight through it without so much as a pause.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159339/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has spent the past few decades going from strength to strength with Mario Kart, so it’s not hard to see why companies holding other recognisable IP have wanted to take a crack at the kart-racer formula to see if they can pull a following of their own. While plenty of copycats have popped up over the years, one that’s made the most sense has been the Sonic franchise, as high-octane speed is kind of the titular character’s whole appeal.</p>
<p>Sonic hasn’t always had the most enjoyable outings in the racing world, but he’s also had some that have gotten awfully close to matching Nintendo’s golden goose. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> is one such entry, combining thrilling action and controls with an interesting multiverse gimmick to make for a worthwhile and enjoyable experience. It’s just a shame that the base Switch really struggles to run it well.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159322/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay in Sonic Racing: Crossworlds is roughly par for the course with what you’d expect for a kart racer, as you drift, boost, and trick your way to victory across a series of three-lap, four-race cups that incorporate mind-bending courses and locales.</p>
<p>Effectively drifting corners, timing your boosts, and seizing on shortcuts are all part of a hard-fought victory, while occasional item drops add an X factor that can both give you the edge you need to win first place or torpedo a lead that you’d been holding onto. Overall, the items feel well balanced, and they help to keep things interesting as their influence constantly changes up the formation of a race.</p>
<p>Tracks primarily consist of a mixture of original courses and reimagined versions of classic Sonic courses from across the main series, such as Radical Highway from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2</a> or Water Palace from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/sonic_rush">Sonic Rush</a>. Overall, course design is extremely strong, with multiple routes adding to the replayability and strategy, while the constant jumping between land, sea, and air portions keeps things feeling fresh and fast-paced. Everyone will naturally have their favourites, but it’s tough to argue against the overall quality of these tracks. There’s really not a bad one in the bunch.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159338/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Most importantly, the central ‘Crossworlds’ gimmick makes the courses feel dynamic in a way that most other kart racers struggle to replicate. Upon nearing the end of the first lap, the competitor currently in the lead will be given a choice between two <em>alternative</em> courses you will then traverse for the duration of lap two. So, you can begin a race in Seaside Hill, then jump to Mystic Jungle for a lap before returning to Seaside Hill to finish things up. Given that any stage can appear at the end of lap one, each contest feels fresh and exciting given that consecutive races starting on the same course can have radically different routes to the finish line.</p>
<p>If you want to mix things up beyond the base Grand Prix mode, there’s also a Race Park mode. Here, you participate in a variety of side challenges that task you with alternative goals beyond simply being the first to cross the finish line. One such challenge is a team-based mode in which you’re given points for how many times you can tap a teammate with your vehicle throughout the race, while another is centred on hitting as many foes with weapons as possible. Though Race Park doesn’t radically shift away from the core concept of racing, it helps to mix up the gameplay a bit and gives you some nice extrinsic rewards for doing so, such as new part unlocks.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159335/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Though there’s plenty of strategy that goes into charting a racing line and knowing when to time boosts and item drops, much of a victory can hinge on decisions made before you even get on the track. There’s an extensive selection of parts you can swap out with any given kart that affect stats like acceleration and weight that help give you the edge in a race, depending on your chosen loadout.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the Gadget system gives you a variety of passive power-ups that can stack the deck in your favour, such as increasing the frequency of specific items or reducing the time it takes for mid-air trick animations to play out. I really appreciated the customisability here, as it not only allows you to tailor loadouts to specific playstyles, but consistently rewards you and reinforces continued play.</p>
<p>Naturally, a big part of the experience here is found in playing the online multiplayer, and I’m happy to report that it‘s just as crazy and thrilling as couch multiplayer, even if it’s a bit different not having someone next to you to talk smack with.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159320/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In my experience, there were no dropped connections or notable slowdowns, and lobbies were (obviously) full in seconds. To add a bit more to chase beyond the raw fun of a race with real people, there’s also a progressive ranking system that awards points based on your race performance.</p>
<p>Visually, this racer is a little bit of a mixed bag, combining high spectacle and brilliant effects with overall low performance that notably hampers the moment-to-moment gameplay. On one hand, the courses themselves are absolutely gorgeous, and the constant twists in the track design and explosions from various items being fired make the screen a veritable feast of energy and verve. On the other, the base Switch hardware just isn’t up to the task of running this all very well.</p>
<p>At <em>best</em>, this game is running at 30fps, which is already feels barely passable for a high-intensity racer like this. But the rapid-fire action frequently sends the frame rate into the low 20s to high teens. Add just one other player for splitscreen action, and the frame rates sink even lower. Performance feels roughly the same between docked and handheld modes. Combine this with the generally low and grainy resolution (especially when viewed on a Switch 2 screen in handheld mode), and this is comfortably the <em>worst</em> way to play this otherwise enjoyable game.</p>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159327/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s far from an unplayable mess, but take one look at footage of how this looks and plays on stronger hardware, and — however predictable it is — it’s tough not to feel like the Switch port is a notably inferior product.</p>
<p>And whether this Switch 1 version is improved when running on Switch 2 is a bit of a toss-up. On the base Switch, you trade S2's faster loading times and somewhat better frame rate for a better visual experience, with the game's low resolution being less noticeable on the 720p handheld screen.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds is a genuinely excellent game, but the Switch version is just 'alright'. The dynamic track designs, high replayability, and thrilling visuals all combine to make for a game that — judged purely on that content — stands as a strong competitor to the dominant Mario Kart series.</p>
<p>But the poor visual quality and resolution present in the Switch version drag down the overall experience and make it feel like a much more mediocre experience. I'd still give this port a light recommendation; it’s a fair choice if Switch is the <em>only</em> platform available to you, and ultimately justifies the price of admission. Otherwise, I’d suggest waiting to see how the upcoming Switch 2 version pans out, or picking it up now on another platform.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Kingdom Come Deliverance remaster or upgraded version is rumored to be in the works for an early 2026 release, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>The rumor originates from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bertik11/">bertik11</a>, who shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksAndRumors/comments/1nuoprk/warhorse_studio_upcoming_upgrade_and_fantasy_game/">Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a> that the first entry in the series by Warhorse Studios will get an upgrade early next year, between January and April. The user added that the studio is not working on a new Lord of the Rings game as rumored, but is still working on their own fantasy game.</p>



<p>While a rumor coming from an unspecified source should be taken with a massive grain of salt, bertik11 proved reliable regarding Kingdom Come Deliverance series rumors. Last year, the user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1erxl3d/kingdom_come_deliverance_2_is_coming_in_2025/">revealed that Kingdom Come Deliverance II would be delayed to 2025</a> before the official announcement was made and that the game's Gamescom booth would have a medieval village design, which turned out to be the case, so there's a good chance they indeed have access to insider information.</p>



<p>Although Kingdom Come Deliverance was a solid role-playing game when it launched back in 2018, a remaster would improve the experience considerably if it addressed some of its most critical issues. Quality-of-life improvements, in particular, would make it a much more accessible game, improving its steep learning curve and interface to make it easier for those who only played its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">excellent sequel</a> to get into the game and experience the beginning of Henry of Skalitz's story for themselves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Payday&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze has canceled&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>, its in-development live-service&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game, and a number of employees are being laid off across the studio as well.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">first announced back in December 2023</a>, has been shut down so that the studio can deploy its resources to "accelerate the growth" of its "flagship&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise".</p>

<p>The cancellation will cost Starbreeze around SEK 255 million (roughly $27.2 million) in "non-cash impairment" form, and it'll also result in the laying off of around 44 employees. Both decisions will, according to Starbreeze, allow the studio to become "cash-flow positive" next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starbreeze-payday-focus-layoffs-project-baxter.jpg?itok=_fFjrSfj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starbreeze-payday-focus-layoffs-project-baxter.jpg?itok=1g5K_QqN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Starbreeze's live-service&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>&nbsp;game&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>&nbsp;is no more.</figcaption></figure><p>It's all part of a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-presents-updated-strategy-doubles-down-on-payday-and-expanding-the-heisting-genre/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">corporate refocusing</a> on Starbreeze's part, with the studio looking to leverage its&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise and "the heisting genre" as a whole much more in the future.</p>

<p>According to Starbreeze, the new strategy will revolve around "deepening player engagement, broadening platform reach, and diversifying revenue streams", and it'll include expanding&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>"across platforms and experiences".</p>

<p>As part of this new strategy, Starbreeze says it will create "new games and experiences that broaden the heisting genre" beyond the studio's "core projects". These will include "spin-offs, narrative-driven projects, and franchise expansion to new platforms".</p>

<p>Another pillar of the developer's new strategy is work-for-hire operations, through which Starbreeze will complete work on projects for other publishers and studios. That work could well cross over with&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>in future, as well, such as in the case of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-starbreeze-layoffs-baxter-canceled.jpg?itok=GDPBlpeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-starbreeze-layoffs-baxter-canceled.jpg?itok=wEtxbbRp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Starbreeze wants to refocus its business around&nbsp;<em>Payday</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>News of Starbreeze's strategy shift comes just days after the company was widely pilloried for the introduction of a&nbsp;<em>Payday 2&nbsp;</em>DLC subscription, which itself was introduced following a price hike for a one-off purchase of all currently-available DLC for the game.</p>

<p>Starbreeze, however, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-dropped-the-ball-starbreeze-admits-it-botched-payday-2-subscription-rollout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> that the price increase was unrelated to the introduction of the subscription model, although commercial exec Gustav Nisser admitted the studio "dropped the ball" with regards to the subscription's rollout.</p>

<p>The shift to a focus on<i>&nbsp;Payday&nbsp;</i>also follows a pretty dismal couple of years for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>, the latest game in the series, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3" rel="nofollow">plummeting sales</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-game-director-steps-down" rel="nofollow">departing executives</a>&nbsp;not exactly contributing to an optimistic overall outlook for the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn recently released native Steam Deck build delivers significant performance improvements over the original Proton Windows build, according to a new comparison video.</p>



<p>As showcased in a new comparison video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard</a>, the new build of the survival-horror game developed by Bloober Team runs much better than the original Proton Windows build in nearly every comparison.</p>



<p>While hitting a steady 60 FPS is something the Steam Deck obviously can't do, even with a native build, the performance improvement it brings makes the game often run above 30 FPS, even in demanding areas like the Apartment Complex, where the system struggles to even hit 30 FPS with the Proton Windows build.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Cronos The New Dawn: NEW Steam Deck Native Build Performance Vs Proton Windows Version" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2k1FFgbBofc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While any game benefits greatly from a 60 frames per second framerate and higher, with its slower-paced survival-horror experience, Cronos: The New Dawn is more than enjoyable even at 30 FPS, as it relies mostly on atmosphere to deliver one of the finest games released by Bloober Team. You can learn more about it by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">checking out my review.</a></p>



<p>The release of native Steam Deck builds is a relatively recent happening, but one that is extremely welcome to extend the life of the system which essentially started the PC handheld craze of the past couple of years. <span>Besides the Cronos: The New Dawn build, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/">B</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/" target="_blank">aldur's Gate 3 native Steam Deck build is also now available for download</a>, introducing performance improvements in the city of Baldur's Gate in Act 3, one of the most demanding areas in the game.</span></p>

			<p>Following Pocketpair's announcement that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/palword-launch-2026-pocketpair-polishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would launch version 1.0 of Palworld in 2026</a>, industry veteran Yoshiki Okamoto, who has worked for a long time as a designer at CAPCOM on series like Resident Evil, Street Fighter, Mega Man, Dino Crisis, and more, shared his opinion on the situation with Nintendo's Pokémon in a video message <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIhdKKNRnI0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on his personal YouTube channel</a>.</p>



<p><em>I personally believe Palworld crossed a line that should not be crossed, and I don't want the world to become a place where this kind of thing is acceptable. I don't want it to be like, it's okay because it sold well, or because it was fun, or because it has good reviews. If a settlement is reached with Nintendo, then I think Palworld will become a game that is officially fine to play. However, it is currently a game that's being sued, so it’s unacceptable. By playing the game, you are supporting it, so please do not buy it.</em></p>



<p>However, Okamoto's opinion was met with a mixed reception. Several fans pointed out that some of the games he worked on also featured very similar elements to games that were released before. </p>



<p>As a reminder, Nintendo notoriously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued the developer in September 2024</a>, alleging infringement of patent rights, and recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-says-game-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-palworld-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued in court</a> that game mods do not count as 'prior art'. The ongoing lawsuit forced Pocketpair to <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make some changes to the game</a>, such as removing the ability to summon Pals with spheres, earlier this year.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Pocketpair announced a farming sim spin-off (<a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-palfarm-farming-game-spin-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld: Palfarm</a>) just eleven days after Nintendo unveiled its own cozy farming game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-pokopia-pokemon-spin-off-cozy-farming-game-nintendo-switch-2-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, currently in development at Koei Tecmo for a planned 2026 release on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <p>Starbreeze has cancelled its Dungeons and Dragons project to focus on its flagship Payday franchise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">Codenamed Project Baxter</a>, it was revealed back in 2023 and was aiming for a 2026 release. Few details were available, but it was planned to have "the signature Starbreeze game cornerstones of co-operative multiplayer, lifetime commitment through a Games as a Service-model, community engagement and a larger than life experience".</p>
<p>However, following a "strategic review", development has been discontinued as the board of directors and management have "concluded that resources are best deployed to accelerate the growth of" the Payday series.</p>

<p>As a result, the studio will incur a non-cash impairment of around SEK 255m (around £20m).</p>
<p>"This was a difficult but necessary decision," said Adolf Kristjansson, CEO of Starbreeze, in a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/">press release</a>.</p>
<p>"Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze's position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders."</p><p>The studio stated "part of the Baxter team will be redeployed across Starbreeze's projects, most prominently within Payday" and where "internal opportunities are limited, Starbreeze will provide active support for affected employees to transition to new roles across the industry". It estimates there will be a reduction in headcount of around 44 full-time employees and contractors.</p>
<p>Starbreeze boasted the Payday games have engaged over 50 million players globally, generating almost SEK 4bn in lifetime gross revenue.</p>
<p>"We are doubling down on what our players love - and what we do best - owning the heisting genre," said Kristjansson. "Payday is more than a game - it's a genre we created and continue to lead. By redeploying talent and capital, we can bring innovation to heisting gameplay faster, while also laying the foundation for the future expansion of the genre."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starbreeze-acquires-publishing-rights-to-troubled-payday-3-says-move-will-accelerate-development-roadmap">Starbreeze acquired the publishing rights to its Payday 3 game</a> from Plaion, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-likens-launch-to-being-a-rock-band-when-the-whole-stage-collapses-and-everyone-leaves">launched disastrously</a> in 2023. The acquisition would enable the studio to "significantly accelerate [its] content development roadmap, and pursue broader strategic opportunities for the Payday franchise as a whole," said board member Thomas Lindgren at the time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After years of successful collaborations with different video game franchises, Sony has struck a deal with Hasbro’s Wizards of the Coast directly, selling their best-known characters directly into Magic the Gathering.</p>
<p>Launching on 27th October, seven direct-to-consumer products will arrive in a limited print run as part of the PlayStation Secret Lair Superdrop. These are:</p>


<ul>
<li>Secret Lair x The Last of Us Part I</li>
<li>Secret Lair x The Last of Us Part II</li>
<li>Secret Lair x God of War: Greek</li>
<li>Secret Lair x God of War: Norse</li>
<li>Secret Lair x Uncharted</li>
<li>Secret Lair x Horizon: Into the Forbidden West</li>
<li>Secret Lair x Ghost of Tsushima</li>
</ul>
<p>Each ‘Secret Lair’ is a set list of usually five or six defined cards, and will feature the characters and lore of the associated franchise. While the full card lists are yet to be announced, you can be sure we will cover each of them as we know more, ahead of each one launching.</p>
<p>The first drop, featuring God of War’s Kratos and his son Atreus, goes on sale on October 27th at 5pm UK time (9am Pacific Time).</p>


<p>You need to beware generally sell out within an hour, so if you’re a fan, make sure you sign up for alerts at secretlair.wizards.com.</p>
<p>Hasbro’s best-selling cash cow, MTG —&nbsp;which made a whopping 82% of their operating profits last year — has just come off <a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/why-magic-is-how-it-is-in-2025-and-why-everything-changed">a record-breaking quarter for profits</a>, thanks to<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/final-fantasys-crossover-conundrum-why-nobody-can-preorder-magic-cards/"> the Square Enix collaboration</a>, at 95%.</p>
<p>‘Universes Beyond’, the subsection of Magic with direct tie-ins to real-world franchises, has been crucial to Hasbro’s bottom line, featuring the likes of Doctor Who, Cloud Strife and SpongeBob Squarepants (rather than original characters like ‘Magic’s Pikachu’ Loot, or his carers Jace and Vraska), widening the appeal of the game to new fandoms.</p>
<p>The summer’s MTG x Final Fantasy release was an unprecedented success, with its employees noting that they simply couldn’t print the product fast enough. This lead to the scenes earlier this year where Collector Booster boxes were selling for $1k apiece.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Secret Lair Superdrop is significantly smaller in scale than MTG x Final Fantasy was, which contained several hundred unique cards. Instead, this is seven sets of defined cards, which will sell for a significantly lower price — $39.99 for the regular versions or $49.99 for the foil (shiny) versions (or the equivalent amount in your local currency).</p>
<p>And unlike MTG x Final Fantasy, which could be bought from your local Waterstones, these Secret Lair drops can only be bought from WotC directly, as part of a very limited print run… before hitting the secondary market at a massively inflated price.</p>
<p>While the more recent Spider-Man collaboration with Disney’s Marvel has yet to appear in financial reports, community sentiment seems to be that it has not sold as well. Indeed, resale prices for individual cards are, on the whole, significantly lower than their Final Fantasy counterparts.</p>
<p>We will bring you more information on each of these secret lairs, and whether the cards within them are any good, as soon as we know more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is closing another Final Fantasy 11 server to new players because it's proven too popular.</p>
<p>Back in July, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/23-years-after-its-release-final-fantasy-11s-biggest-server-is-closed-to-new-players-due-to-popularity">popular Asura server was closed</a>, meaning new players would be unable to join. Producer and director Yoji Fujito said at the time the overpopulation "has led to a series of unexpected issues that have managed to affect the quality of that experience somewhat."</p>
<p>As a result, players have instead moved to the next popular server, Bahamut, which has now met a similar fate.</p>

<p>"Bahamut has consistently had the second most concurrent users out of all Worlds and has been close behind Asura in terms of total character population, leading many new adventurers to begin their journeys there," said Fujito in a <a href="http://www.playonline.com/pcd/topics/ff11us/detail/22742/detail.html">new statement</a>.</p>
<p>"While we are pleased to see these Worlds bustling with activity, having too many concurrent users can overwhelm server processes on that World, which affects server responsiveness and increases the likelihood of other related issues."</p>
<p>From 9th October, players will no longer be able to transfer characters to Bahamut, nor will they be able to create new characters. The Vana'diel Adventurer Recruitment Programme will also be suspended for the server.</p>
<p>Fujito added Asura remains closed as the server load remains unchanged despite a slight decrease in player population.</p>
<p>All of this is occurring 23 years after the MMORPG first launched.</p>
<p>So why are so many players returning or joining Final Fantasy 11? There were discount campaigns earlier in the year that have contributed, but it's also due to a crossover with MMORPG follow-up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, which has seen a decline in players following its less popular Dawntrail expansion.</p>
<p>As for Final Fantasy 14, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-and-final-fantasy-14-are-collaborating">Monster Hunter Wilds collaboration is on the way</a>, which will add new mounts and a new battle scenario.</p>

However, not happy with the stunning attention to detail, dinky little game carts, and interchangeable screens that the vanilla Lego GB is rocking, one master builder has decided to bring hers to life.</p>
<p>In what's got to be some sort of record for a mod turnaround, Australian Game Boy modder and self-taught circuit-board designer <a href="https://nataliethenerd.com/">Natalie the Nerd</a> has got her Lego handheld playing real GB games via real carts with nary a Raspberry Pi or other modern doodah in sight.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6zuilxo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Indeed, this is the real deal, with Natalie explaining to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/790093/lego-game-boy-natalie-the-nerd">The Verge</a> that she put together a bespoke Game Boy circuit board with actual chips, and all that other stuff that goes inside these things. Magic and that.</p>

<p>Working with the "smallest screen kit on the market", the main target in this build was to get a circuit board inside the set that was smaller than the dimensions of the set itself, which she has achieved, albeit by removing one or two bricks.</p>
<p>The Game Boy's buttons, which aren't yet finished, will be set onto a bespoke PCB and, with the whole thing already wired for USB power, she says she'll release the circuit-board designs once she's done with the build, ensuring that everything can indeed be awesome for us all. Hooray!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.nataliethenerd.com/i-turned-the-lego-game-boy-into-a-working-game-boy-part-1/">Natalie goes into much more detail about the planning and build process on her blog</a> - we highly recommend you give it a read!</p>
<p>Now, you'll have to excuse us, we're off to build our own set. It won't play games, though, so Natalie has sort of ruined it now. Do any of you folks know how to build circuit boards?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/d-d-co-op-game-project-baxter-is-canceled-by-starbreeze-to-refocus-on-payday-franchise.1314538/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Project Baxter, the D&amp;D based cooperative game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in December 2023</a> by Starbreeze, has been canceled by the Swedish game developer. The news was <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-presents-updated-strategy-doubles-down-on-payday-and-expanding-the-heisting-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared this morning by Starbreeze</a>, which is 'refocusing' on its owned IP, PAYDAY, according to CEO Adolf Kristjansson:</p>



<p><em>I want to sincerely thank the Baxter team for their passion and creativity, and express appreciation to Wizards of the Coast for their support. Though we have made the decision to not continue forward with this project, we are proud of what was achieved in Baxter, and those contributions will carry forward into PAYDAY and the future of Starbreeze. By concentrating our efforts on PAYDAY, we give Starbreeze and all our employees the best chance to succeed.</em></p>



<p>Project Baxter was slated to launch in 2026, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-is-still-in-pre-production-yet-starbreeze-says-its-on-track-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still in the pre-production phase in February 2024</a>, which made us skeptical at the time. The decision to discontinue this D&amp;D game might have been a mix of problems with the project and the desire to fix the PAYDAY franchise, which has suffered due to the poor reception of the third installment and, more recently, due to the controversy surrounding the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PAYDAY 2 subscription</a> and the simultaneous (<a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-admits-mistake-payday-2-subscription-infamous-collection-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now reverted</a>) price increase of the Infamous Collection DLC bundle. This cancellation comes with a write-off of a $27 million investment for the game and the decision to fire around 44 employees between internal developers and external contractors.</p>



<p>Perhaps at some point, we'll get a glimpse of footage of Project Baxter to see what could have been.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-open-world-dd-rpg-from-hidden-path-shown-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It happened in June</a>&nbsp;with the canceled D&amp;D open-world RPG that was in development at Hidden Path.</p>



<p>As a Dungeons and Dragons fan, I hope no more games attached to the franchise get canceled. There's still a healthy lineup on the way, between Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked (out in 2025), a new game from Invoke (the studio behind Dark Alliance), and an action/adventure game in development at Giant Skull. Last month, the president of Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-wizards-of-the-coast-head-wants-new-dd-mmorpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confided that he'd love to see a new D&amp;D MMORPG</a>, though he also suggested it won't be happening any time soon, if at all.</p>

            <p>I’d almost missed that that Motorslice now has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2830030/MOTORSLICE/">Steam demo</a> out, despite enticing gifs of its Brutalist wallrunning and slicey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-rising-revengeance">Metal Gear Rising</a>-tinged chainsword combat repeatedly finding their way into my Bluesky feed for months. I’m liking it so far, though don’t let its swingbars and trundling excavator enemies trick you into thinking this is some light platformer jaunt.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It is, in fact, quite tricky. Motorslice drops hints of wackiness – its name is derived from the practice of slamming your weapon into a wall and being yanked along by its cycling, biting teeth – and yet traversing the concrete megastructure requires care, even patience. P, your waifu-bait freerunner, has strong hands and lead feet, so there’s a weightiness to movement that’s easy to underestimate, especially on the transition between moves. I hit the dirt multiple times by wrongly expecting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a>-tier sharpness when pinging across walls.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>I'm using official screenshots because mine all came out motion-blurred to bits. Settings slider for the full game maybe hopefully please? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Top Hat Studios Inc.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's not sluggish, mind. It’s just a matter of getting a feel for P’s pace, after which it becomes much more satisfying to chain together hops, runs, and slides into smooth, almost rhythmic sequences of hazard-dodging. Once you’ve got a handle on it, the sense of exertion becomes an outright strength, especially during the demo’s climax: scaling a titanic, malevolent dump truck, its constant rumbling only heightening the peril of making a slip. Like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, if the Colossi were the kind of industrial machinery you’re not supposed to operate after having a paracetamol.</p><p>Fighting the lesser construction 'bots is also harder than it looks, albeit in a much quicker, punchier way. While a chainsaw stroke bisects them in a single hit, you’re just as fragile yourself, and the enemy diggers are both faster and more numerous than your anime tomboy. Non-boss battles are, thus, all about getting in quick and striking first, chopped actuators forming heaps in the sand before your blade finishes revving down. Brief yet bright flashes of near-instinctive action, to counterbalance the more considered parkour.</p>
<p>No release date on this one, but I’m glad there’s seemingly more to Motorslice than <a href="https://x.com/RegularStudio_/status/1869053388518006963">parryposting</a>. Here’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2830030/MOTORSLICE/">link to the demo</a> again.</p>

<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 is a truly amazing piece of hardware"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="fd25317d921e6"><a title="FF7 Tifa" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd25317d921e6/ff7-tifa.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's no secret at this point that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> looks pretty incredible on the Switch 2. We know through the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> that the console can handle some pretty graphically intensive ports, but this one really seems to go above and beyond.</p>
<p>According to director Naoki Hamaguchi via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-says-the-key-to-a-good-looking-switch-2-port-is-not-compromising-on-lighting/">Automaton</a>, making sure the lighting from the original remake was retained on Switch 2 was crucial to making the game look great. Instead, processing load from other areas were reduced to get the game running at a stable 30fps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I believe lighting is the crucial factor in terms of graphics quality and expression in this day and age."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to express gratitude that the team has become a model-case for delivering a high-end game on the Switch 2, before delivering some wisdom that other developers would do well to take on board for their own ports in the coming years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In our experience, if you just use the hardware properly, you’ll be able to deliver games at the quality players expect. All in all, my honest opinion is that Nintendo Switch 2 is a truly amazing piece of hardware.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's only a few months to go until Final Fantasy VII Remake launches on the Switch 2 on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>. We honestly can't wait to see exactly how the game holds up on Nintendo's new hardware, and we're thrilled that Rebirth and the untitled third entry will also be following suit in the months and years to come.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-producer-says-game%E2%80%99s-reception-was-unexpectedly-positive-but-future-games-won%E2%80%99t-necessarily-follow-this-formula.1314502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It appears that even the developers of Silent Hill f did not anticipate such a positive reaction from critics and fans. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/NhEFMQmxm1g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking on an IGN Japan livestream during Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, producer Motoi Okamoto said:</p>



<p><em>I'm grateful that it was rated higher than I'd expected. I think you'll understand if you play it, but since it's a game with a lot of challenges, I thought there might be some pros and cons, but it's been very well received, and it has a Metascore of 86, the same as the Silent Hill 2 remake. Well, I was really surprised.</em></p>



<p>That doesn't necessarily mean future installments will follow the Silent Hill f formula, though:</p>



<p><em>We'll be putting out something different, with a different flavor. We want to explore all sorts of different aspects of game design and story.</em></p>



<p>Later, Okamoto clarified his statement <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1972230163380535537" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a tweet published on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>As I said in the interview, not all future Silent Hill games will have the same gameplay as f, but rather I want the series to always be challenging in a good way, so that players can enjoy a different flavor of gameplay with each installment.</em></p>



<p><em>Of course, there are some things that will remain the same, the most important of which is the quality of the story. I am convinced that a psychological story is essential to what makes Silent Hill unique, and I will continue to focus on that point and release future titles with confidence.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>



<p><em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em></p>
