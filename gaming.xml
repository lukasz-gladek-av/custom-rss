            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced a partnership with Nvidia to introduce new companions called "Co-Playable Characters" to Krafton's games, and yes, they're powered by generative AI, because of course they are.</p>

<p>In a press release, the two companies say that Co-Playable Characters, or CPCs, are "powered by on-device Small Language Models" and that they have the potential to "interact with players in deeper ways than traditional NPCs".</p>

<p>This is because CPCs are apparently "equipped with the ability to understand and cooperate with users"; according to Krafton and Nvidia, CPCs will "understand and respond to game situations in a human-like manner", although given what I've seen of the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>player base, I'm not sure I want that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-krafton-ai-characters-door.jpg?itok=kLSKyQC2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-krafton-ai-characters-door.jpg?itok=_B5Ll4Eq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton will soon introduce AI-powered companions to&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>itself that's getting these AI-powered characters, either. According to the press release, Krafton intends to introduce CPCs "across its gaming portfolio", so you can expect to see these characters in&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>spinoffs too, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow">upcoming life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em></a>.</p>

<p>Only&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>are mentioned, so we don't know if Krafton is also planning to introduce CPCs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">the likes of&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2</em></a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op" rel="nofollow"><em>Subnautica 2</em></a>, but I can't possibly imagine how having an AI inanely yammering away to me while I'm rhythmically smashing goons to pieces could help.</p>

<p>Krafton CEO Changhan Kim says that Nvidia's AI technology, which will power CPCs, is "poised to redefine the future of gaming", while Nvidia developer relations VP Keita Iida says Krafton's CPCs will bring "new, unique experiences" to games. Hmm.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krafton-ai-characters-inzoi.jpg?itok=CB6fpefb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krafton-ai-characters-inzoi.jpg?itok=pCzDb0ww 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>will also include AI-powered "Co-Playable Characters".</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton might be wholeheartedly embracing AI - and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-working-hard-on-using-ai-to-make-npc-and-worlds-more-alive-reactive-and" rel="nofollow">far from the only company</a> in gaming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="nofollow">to be doing so</a> - but the technology isn't impressing everyone.</p>

<p>Last month, for instance,&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>creator Ken Levine <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai" rel="nofollow">said he wasn't "overly impressed"</a> by generative AI, suggesting that while it could certainly perform mundane tasks related to coding and other technical aspects of game development, it wasn't suitable to be used for creative purposes.</p>

<p>Similarly, gaming giant Nintendo declared last year that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">currently has no plans</a> to use generative AI to develop its games, citing issues with intellectual property rights infringement as well as a desire to deliver "value that is unique to [Nintendo]".</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-legion-go-s-official-499-buys-the-first-authorized-third-party-steamos-handheld.1076154/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lenovo is trying an experiment. In May, it will officially become the very first company outside of Valve to ship a handheld gaming PC with the Steam Deck’s wonderfully pick-up-and-play SteamOS instead of Microsoft Windows. And at $499, it’ll be a true Steam Deck rival, joining it as one of the lower-priced PC handhelds you can buy.</p><p>That handheld will be the 1.6-pound Lenovo Legion Go S, a new and improved version of the company’s eight-inch handheld that ditches the Nintendo Switch-like detachable gamepads and kickstand for a lighter and more traditional design, with a sculpted grip that felt supremely comfortable in my hands. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</p><div><figcaption><em>Our Legion Go S gallery, including size comparisons to the Steam Deck.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>It’ll also be one of the few handhelds on the market to offer a 120Hz variable refresh rate screen — a highly desirable feature that lets low-power handheld gameplay feel smooth, even if it’s not generating lots of frames. That screen will be lower in resolution at 1920 x 1200, too, and feature a <em>hopefully</em> power-sipping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">new AMD Ryzen Z2 Go chip</a>. (It’s a Lenovo-exclusive chip, by the way.)</p><p>In other words, it might address every major complaint I had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">in my Legion Go review</a>, while additionally adding fun configurable RGB lighting around the joysticks, a slightly larger 55Wh battery, a pair of levers to reduce the throw of the triggers, and a less obtrusive touchpad, too, while retaining the dual USB 4 ports.</p><p>But Lenovo isn’t going all in on SteamOS. Not only will it hedge its bets by shipping a Windows version of the Legion Go S as well but it’ll also ship with Windows <em>this month</em> — four months ahead of the SteamOS models. The Windows model is white:</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><div><figcaption><em>Our Lenovo Legion Go S Windows gallery, including this comparison shot with the original Legion Go.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto</cite></p></div></div><p>It’s not like the SteamOS model is ready now anyhow. Valve codesigners Lawrence Yang and Pierre-Loup Griffais tell me they’ve only been working with Lenovo for a couple of months, and the integration isn’t quite done. The new touchpad, gyroscope, and both RGB lighting and TDP configuration options are among the things on their to-do list. </p><p>But the Windows version shipping in January will cost $729.99, with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. In May, the true experiment will begin when gamers can pick between a $499.99 SteamOS version with 16GB / 512GB, a $599.99 Windows version with 16GB / 1TB, or the Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> at $399 and $549, respectively. </p><p>And it does sound like there will be one important reason to pick the Steam Deck over the Legion Go S and vice versa, because AMD’s Z2 Go is a different chip. While the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">Z2 Go announced yesterday sheds cores and GPU generations</a> to be slightly more akin to the Steam Deck’s semi-custom Aerith and / or Sephiroth parts, we noted that it targets higher power levels, and Legion Go product manager Alex Zhu confirms to me that the Legion Go S is aimed at 20-watt performance, 30-watt, maybe even 40-watt configurable performance, which will likely offer higher performance (and lower battery life) than the 15-watt-and-below Steam Deck’s chip. </p><p>Zhu says Lenovo is targeting between two and 2.5 hours of battery life in demanding heavy games — which lines up with the basic math of dividing a 55 watt-hour battery by 20 watts, assuming the rest of the system doesn’t eat up a lot more. Versions with AMD’s existing Z1 Extreme chip will also be available in some markets. All Legion Go S can fit full-length M.2 2280 solid state drives.</p><p>BTW, Valve isn’t keeping key Steam Deck features like precompiled shaders to itself, or anything else, for that matter. Yang and Griffais say it will be one SteamOS, and the Legion Go S and any future SteamOS devices will get the same updates as the Deck, minus hardware-specific tweaks.</p><p>Valve tells me Lenovo is currently its only partner for a SteamOS device — there are no other third-party SteamOS devices currently in the works. But Griffais hints that Valve is close to publicly releasing a new beta of its SteamOS that <em>just might possibly</em> start working on other handhelds as well. (Valve previously confirmed to us that it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">building toward some level of support for the Asus ROG Ally</a> in SteamOS as well.)</p><p>And it’s vaguely possible that SteamOS beta could arrive before the SteamOS Legion Go S — Valve says it’s slated to ship sometime after March. </p><p>But the real dream is to pull a PC handheld out of a box and have it just work, the way a Nintendo Switch works, not to shoehorn an operating system on it afterward, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">no matter how good the result</a>. That’s why Lenovo is working with Valve: Zhu agrees that SteamOS has the best out-of-box experience. But, he says, Windows offers a whole ecosystem of gaming and productivity that the company believes its customers still want.</p><p>Zhu agrees that SteamOS is an experiment for Lenovo and says it’ll look at the feedback and momentum before making its next move. Speaking of what’s next, Lenovo is also building a larger Legion Go 2 with detachable controllers and an 8.8-inch OLED screen, and it brought prototypes of that unit to CES:</p><div><figcaption><em>The new Legion Go 2 prototype, with a smaller kickstand and more sculpted grips.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Zhu tells me Lenovo doesn’t have “any specific plans” to put SteamOS on the larger Legion Go, just Windows — but perhaps it depends on what customers buy in May.</p><p>Meanwhile, Valve is still looking ahead to a future version of its own Steam Deck, saying that partnering with companies like Lenovo hasn’t reduced the desire to build its own. But AMD’s Z2 isn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">the “leap” that Valve’s been waiting for</a>, Griffais tells <em>The Verge. </em>There won’t be a Z2 Steam Deck. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The seven-episode season will cover only part of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s story, as HBO plans to split the events of the 2020 sequel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">across multiple seasons</a></span>. Based on this trailer, it seems like the live-action adaptation might be playing a little loose with the structure of the game, or maybe this one-minute video is pulling from scenes we might not see until season three. Right now we can only speculate, so that’s what we’re here to do. Here are a few things we noticed in <em>The Last of Us </em>season two’s third trailer. <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> spoilers ahead!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c0fcb0d6fa09148506cf6148256ab3d1" data-recommend-id="image://c0fcb0d6fa09148506cf6148256ab3d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abby looks down a dark hallway with a concerned expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Abby looks down a dark hallway with a concerned expression." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0fcb0d6fa09148506cf6148256ab3d1" data-recommend-id="image://c0fcb0d6fa09148506cf6148256ab3d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abby looks down a dark hallway with a concerned expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The very first scene in the trailer shows <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-show-abby-actor-kaitlyn-dever-1851152428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-show-abby-actor-kaitlyn-dever-1851152428">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a></span>. To anyone who hasn’t played the games and doesn’t know who Abby is, she’s the co-protagonist of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, though developer Naughty Dog kept her mostly a secret until the game launched in 2020. We see Abby walking down a dark hallway with a loaded pistol in hand. We get a brief glimpse of her Firefly tags hanging around her neck as a siren blares through the halls.</p><p>If you did play <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, you know this is Abby looking for her father in the aftermath of Joel’s escape, in the same hospital where Joel went on a killing spree at the end of season one. HBO’s marketing doesn’t seem to be playing coy with Abby’s Firefly ties like Naughty Dog did in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, so we’ll see if it actually tries to maintain the game’s twists and turns.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fd45770271a13c1a46cfd1890166114b" data-recommend-id="image://fd45770271a13c1a46cfd1890166114b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isaac looks up at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isaac looks up at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd45770271a13c1a46cfd1890166114b" data-recommend-id="image://fd45770271a13c1a46cfd1890166114b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isaac looks up at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s not a lot of plot to glean from the action montage that follows this scene of Abby. We see more of the infected attack on the Jackson stronghold that is new to the show, what appears to be a Seraphite cultist picking up a sickle that I’m sure they’ll use for cutting grass and not people, a quick shot of Jeffrey Wright <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-show-jeffrey-wright-isaac-actor-1851499647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-show-jeffrey-wright-isaac-actor-1851499647">reprising his role as WLF leader Isaac</a></span>, a Seraphite member set on fire, and an infected person crawling toward someone like they’re stalking prey.

Because of <em>events</em>, Dina accompanies Ellie on her revenge quest to Seattle, and we see the pair running from, presumably, infected in the city. However, we also see the two slow dancing and looking lovingly into each other’s eyes. Fans will know this scene as taking place at a dance in Jackson and as one of the first moments Naughty Dog released to the public <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">way back in 2018</a></span>. Chronologically, this happens just before the bulk of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> but isn’t shown to the player until near the end. The sequel is flashback-heavy, and this sequence is one of the last ones the player sees after Ellie returns home from Seattle where most of the game takes place, so if this scene is going to be in season two, it’s another implication that the show is tweaking the sequence of events. The first season was a pretty faithful retelling of the original game’s story (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-bill-frank-gay-nick-offerman-bartlett-1850035741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-bill-frank-gay-nick-offerman-bartlett-1850035741">with a few exceptions</a></span>), so I expected the second season to follow suit. Across all three trailers, there haven’t been that many scenes that don’t seem lifted straight from&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s events beyond <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-joel-catherine-o-hara-1851612956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-joel-catherine-o-hara-1851612956">Joel’s apparent therapy sessions</a></span>, but it seems like it might be playing with the structure a bit. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b0a58dfa97ba26aba4baee352e2437f" data-recommend-id="image://0b0a58dfa97ba26aba4baee352e2437f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie points a gun at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie points a gun at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b0a58dfa97ba26aba4baee352e2437f" data-recommend-id="image://0b0a58dfa97ba26aba4baee352e2437f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie points a gun at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A lot of this trailer is re-used footage from the last two. We again see Joel crying in therapy, Ellie screaming out on what looks like a hospital bed, and the Infected attacking Jackson. Given that I was just giving the show shit for seemingly spoiling Abby’s identity in a trailer, I can commend the restraint.

                <p dir="ltr">Razer has shown off a long list of new hardware and apps at CES 2025, and one of the coolest is the new PC Remote Play feature coming to its free Razer Nexus mobile app. As the name implies, the new feature lets users stream gameplay directly from their PC to various mobile devices, including Android phones, iOS devices, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Edge-WiFi-Gaming-Tablet-Console-Class/dp/B0CKM287V2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer's Edge gaming tablet</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Razer's press release, the PC Remote Play feature is a free update for the Nexus App. You can scroll through a list of all the supported games installed on your PC and launch and play them directly in the Nexus app while on the go. Razer claims the feature will allow for "full graphical fidelity" while streaming, and it uses Razer Sensa HD Haptics to add rumble and other tactile feedback while playing. Razer is demoing the PC Remote Play feature at its booth for CES attendees, and the beta is expected to roll out to the Razer Nexus app soon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4423677-razerremoteplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423677" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4423677-razerremoteplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423677"></a><figcaption>Razer PC Remote Play on Kishi Ultra</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4423677-razerremoteplay.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, it's worth upgrading your mobile cloud gaming setup with the Razer Kishi Ultra controller to take advantage of the new PC streaming feature.

The device works with select Android phones, tablets, and Apple devices with a USB-C port, including the iPhone 15, iPhone 16, and iPad Mini a17 Pro. While the Kishi Ultra offers the most feature support, you'll be able to use the feature with other Razer mobile controllers, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0B16NGTCT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kishi V2</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0CCWN3Q1G?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">V2 Pro</a>.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Along with this new PC game streaming feature, Razer also announced a batch of new PC gaming hardware and accessories launching in 2025.

                <p>With CES 2025 in full swing, one of the more intriguing exhibits at the trade show is a proof-of-concept entertainment experience from Sony. The PlayStation company is currently showing off what a future gaming room could look and smell like, as it's demoing what is essentially the closest thing possible to a Star Trek holodeck.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT9kFiI14as" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eT9kFiI14as" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to Sony, the Future Immersive Entertainment Concept combines Crystal LED panels, audio, haptics, scent, and atmospherics with a PlayStation game like The Last of Us to create an interactive experience. You could compare this to a 4D version of Duck Hunt but with people horribly mutated by a fictional cordyceps fungus instead of mallards, and we don't even want to know what rotting mushroom-monsters smell like in a world bereft of personal hygiene products.</p><p>Visually, it's a convincing step into that bleak world thanks to the realistic graphics. This isn't the first time that Sony has revealed conceptual gaming hardware, as back in May 2024, the company showed off a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-idea-for-a-future-playstation-controller-looks-like-it-came-straight-out-of-minority-report/1100-6523664/" data-ref-id="1100-6523664">high-tech PlayStation controller</a> in a promotional video, teasing a radical departure from the standard DualSense device.</p><p>In other The Last of Us news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-gets-an-april-2025-release-window-in-new-trailer/1100-6528664/" data-ref-id="1100-6528664">a new teaser trailer for the second season</a> of the HBO live-action adaptation of the game has debuted this week, and has also confirmed a release window of April 2025 for the show. Developer Naughty Dog has also hinted at continuing the game series with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">The Last of Us Part 3</a> and the studio is currently working on a sci-fi adventure called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-the-next-very-different-naughty-dog-game/1100-6528421/" data-ref-id="1100-6528421">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p>

One analyst has now said the game is so momentous that it could "reshape the gaming industry," similar to how 2013's Grand Theft Auto 5 made a massive mark.</p><p>"While the market landscape has evolved, Rockstar's legacy of delivering groundbreaking experiences ensures that GTA 6 will leave a lasting mark," Newzoo analyst Emmanuel Rosier told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/switch-2-finally-gta-6-to-dominate-ai-in-game-dev-again-analysts-predictions-for-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>. Rosier went on to say that GTA 5 benefited from launching into a mature market for PS3 and Xbox 360. GTA 6, meanwhile, is set to launch relatively earlier into the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S lifecycles.</p><p>"Rockstar's history of crafting genre-defining titles positions GTA 6 to set new industry standards. Yet, its challenge lies in navigating a gaming world increasingly dominated by live-service titles. How Rockstar adapts the Grand Theft Auto formula to this evolving landscape will not only determine GTA 6's success but may also redefine the future of open-world gaming," Rosier said.</p><div

continue to play GTA Online for older machines while GTA 6 for newer consoles is in the market.</p><p>To be clear, Rockstar Games has not officially announced what may happen to GTA Online when GTA 6 comes out. But given the massive and enduring success of GTA Online, it stands to reason that GTA 6 will feature an online mode of some kind.</p><p>Harding-Rolls went on to say that he expects GTA 6 to be the "largest entertainment release of all time" based on revenue at launch. Recently, DFC Intelligence predicted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">first-year sales of 40 million copies and more than $3 billion in revenue for GTA 6. </a></p><p>DFC also predicted that Rockstar will release new versions of GTA 6 for the next Xbox and PlayStation consoles, in addition to PC, which may help the game continue to sell over time.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-steam-deck-app-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/native-geforce-now-app-coming-to-steam-deck-later-this-year.1076106/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-steam-deck-app-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has announced that it's bringing a native GeForce Now app to Steam Deck devices later this year, allowing you to access the cloud gaming subscription service on your handheld device more easily.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-ces-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing the new app, Nvidia says Steam Deck users can look forward to "up to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with high dynamic range" when connected to an external display.</p>

<p>It's technically already possible to access GeForce Now via your Steam Deck, but you have to use what essentially amounts to a workaround; in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-may-games-list/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">May last year</a>, Nvidia released a custom script that installs Google Chrome onto your Deck, then "adds all the settings needed" for GeForce Now streaming via that browser.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-app-cyberpunk.jpg?itok=Ufr9mfet 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-app-cyberpunk.jpg?itok=Lm9gnORb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The GeForce Now app for Steam Deck will let you stream games at up to 4k and 60fps.</figcaption></figure><p>As Nvidia points out, your Steam Deck will theoretically draw less power if it's streaming a game from the cloud than if it's using its own internals, although I'd imagine Steam Deck users will want to wait for the app to land so they can see that for themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, you will also need a GeForce Now subscription if you want to stream games via this new app, and given that Nvidia is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-monthly-playtime-limit-2025" rel="nofollow">imposing a 100-hour monthly playtime limit</a> across all of its tiers this month, that may not be a particularly enticing prospect for you.</p>

<p>Still, this seems like a pretty neat way to circumvent the Steam Deck's relatively low power, and it might even help you get past things like the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-bans-linux" rel="nofollow"><em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>Steam Deck ban</a>&nbsp;(which is technically a Linux-wide ban), although given that the GeForce Now app will be Steam Deck-native, that seems a touch unlikely.</p>




<p>In any case, you'll be able to check out the native GeForce Now app for Steam Deck when it launches later this year. We don't have a full release date for it yet, so watch this space for more info.</p>

You’re probably familiar with DLSS, Nvidia’s upscaling technology that squeezes even better resolutions at higher framerates out of existing computing resources, but the company is now also touting RTX Neural Shaders which will use machine learning to compress textures and free up even more processing power for other stuff.</p><p>The 5080 and 5090 are both available later this month, while the 5070 and 5070 Ti will ship in February. Here are the prices:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>GeForce RTX 5070 - $550</li><li>GeForce RTX 5070 Ti - $ 750</li><li>GeForce RTX 5080 - $1,000</li><li>GeForce RTX 5090 - $2,000</li></ul></blockquote><p>The big thing to note here is that Nvidia is promising big results even from the low-end budget card. All cards are supposed to be twice as fast on average as their corresponding predecessors, and  Huang even claimed that this year’s $550 RTX 5070 would be as effective in practice as the previous $1,600 RTX 4090, seemingly due to machine learning and other optimizations. </p><p>At the high end, Nvidia showed a graph promising double the performance of the RTX 4090 from the newer (and only $400 more expensive) RTX 5090 across games like <em>Alan Wake 2</em> and <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. The company even showed <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> running at over double the framerate with full raytracing enabled, because one can never have too many frames when navigating Night City’s treacherous underworld. </p><p>But while the 5090 is a power hog, it’s not quite the hulking big boy that it’s predecessor was. The 4090 founder’s edition was a three-slot card that weighed over five pounds. The 5090 will only be two slots, allowing it to fit into more compact PC builds at launch. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s tough trying to follow previous efforts, but the biggest and best games in 2025 offer hope. From stellar AAA behemoths to long-time-coming remakes and remasters, there’s a lot to be excited about. However, we start from the beginning with January 2025’s biggest releases.</p>



<p>2024 continually got better, leaving us to salivate at another jaw-dropping year at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>. Last year is in the rearview mirror, and it’s time to shine the light ahead at what’s to come. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> is lurking somewhere, ready to sweep up every award and penny from our pockets, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is camouflaged and coming for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-remakes-and-remasters-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best remake</a> crown, and there’s an FPS that could spell <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-will-be-on-xbox-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a> for all of us.</p>



<p>I’m already trembling with fear at how expensive this year could be. Let’s start with January 2025, and its biggest games to set the stage for the rest.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-games-coming-in-2025">Best Games Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>Release dates can change—even at the last second—but I feel confident in declaring these to be January’s biggest games. I’ve also provided their release dates for you to mark on your new 2025 calendar.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-january-16">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD — January 16</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The kings of the Kongs. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>January 2025 is a very remaster and port-friendly month. Nevertheless, I never tire of Donkey Kong’s underrated and punishing difficulty. Nintendo is giving Donkey Kong Country Returns HD at least one more port, this time for the Nintendo Switch. With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 rumors</a> growing—and my belief <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/we-desperately-need-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we need a Nintendo Switch 2</a>—this might be the last chance to collect, swing, smash, and bash in Country Returns before it finally makes way for a new entry.</p>



<h3 id="h-dynasty-warriors-origins-january-17">Dynasty Warriors: Origins — January 17</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I’d hate to clear up this mess. Credit to KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD</figcaption></figure>



<p>I couldn’t tell you the first thing about Dynasty Warriors: Origins—or the series. Every time I see one though, I think, “This looks fun.” Origins’ trailers and gameplay reveals boast even more obscene on-screen soldier counts and epic battles. Dynasty Warriors producer and director Tomohiko Sho told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dynasty-warriors-10000-soldiers-tokyo-game-show-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, “The team set themselves the goal of having <strong>10,000 soldiers on screen at a given time</strong>.” Even if it doesn’t quite hit this number, it looks widely impressive nonetheless.</p>



<h3 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-23">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth — January 23</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Every Cloud has a silver lining. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC release date</a> is one to watch. Rebirth may have already been out for nearly a year, but that’s no excuse to miss this masterpiece. It may have underperformed in sales, but I believe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-deserves-more-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth deserved better</a>—in terms of sales and awards—and PC players are getting a superior version of the JRPG. The port features DLSS, Enhanced Textures &amp; Modeling, Improved Lighting, and VRR. Queen’s Blood has never looked so vibrant.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-january-30">Sniper Elite: Resistance — January 30</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Wait for the killcam. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> is a rare, new AAA game in January 2025. Rebellion is back at it again with its sniper-gore-fused third-person shooter. I say gore because I’ve seen enough horrifying killcams from the franchise down the years to make me wince at the thought of them. More mission variety and creativity are promised as you seek to neutralize Germany’s secret Wunderwaffe&nbsp;weapon—and Sniper Elite: Resistance is a day one Game Pass launch.</p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-s-spider-man-2-january-30">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 — January 30</h3>



<figure><figcaption>That’s a big tongue. Credit to Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>One final port rounds off our biggest games of January 2025 list—Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. Spidey and Miles (and Venom) are surfing the web to the realm of computers with this polished port. Like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-marvels-spider-man-2-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Spider-Man 2 PC release</a> boasts improvements and upgrades on the original—<strong>Enhanced ray-tracing options</strong> being the news here.</p>



<hr>



<p>Strike up a conversation in the comments below, and let us know if you intend to pick up any of these releases. Is January 2025 a safe start to the year? Or is it the calm before the storm?</p>

Two of the models announced at CES today are launching immediately: the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keychron.com%2Fproducts%2Flemokey-p1-he-wireless-magnetic-switch-custom-gaming-keyboard">$169 Lemokey P1 HE QMK</a>, and the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keychron.com%2Fproducts%2Fkeychron-q6-he-qmk-wireless-custom-keyboard%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorZKTLdh4434IkhO_9d6dmaNVrvn_6FdcAQkfdGyZkvS1bU4V4n">$229 Keychron Q6 HE QMK</a>, with three additional keyboards set to be released later this year.</p><p>Hall effect switches are notable for providing more customization features and a faster press than traditional mechanical switches, making them a popular choice for gamers. They use magnetic induction sensing on the PCB that detects how far down a key has been pushed — allowing you to decide the exact actuation point or even set different functions that activate depending on how hard you press.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lemokey P1 HE QMK is a 75 percent layout keyboard with 2.4GHz Bluetooth and a 1,000Hz polling rate.

In fact, the Hyper Strummer isn’t compatible with the Switch at all. It only works with the 18-year-old Nintendo Wii, and the older <em>Guitar Hero</em> and <em>Rock Band</em> rhythm game titles released for that console.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRT4DRVR/?tag=theverge02-20">$76.99 Hyper Strummer</a> could have potentially been a cheaper alternative to <em>Fortnite Festival</em>-compatible guitar controllers like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24155728/pdp-riffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller-fortnite-festival-rock-band-stock-availability">PDP’s $129.99 Riffmaster</a>. But it only works with a Wiimote slotted into the back, and is not compatible with modern gaming hardware like the Xbox Series X / S or the PlayStation 5.</p><p>Its design also appears identical to the <em>Guitar Hero</em> controller Hyperkin released in 2009 during the Wii era, which <a href="https://twitter.com/kua1sude/status/1874508660455702574?s=61&amp;t=ka62_HRMDRk57zsnnVROzQ">led to accusations on X</a> that the company was repackaging and selling old stock as a new product.</p><p>Hyperkin responded to the accusations <a href="https://x.com/Hyperkin/status/1874923878964703418">with a statement shared on X</a> explaining why the Hyper Strummer looks so similar to older hardware. “While it is correct that this is the same shell mold of a previous Hyperkin release from 2009, that is all it is. We used the mold to make brand new shells, fitted with new 2024 internal components. This is not old stock, nor is it old guitars that have been sitting in a warehouse.”</p><p>The company says the modernized Hyper Strummer was “developed to meet the demand for an accessible and budget-friendly solution, perfect for retro gamers who want to enter the guitar scene in 2025 at an affordable price.”  Instead of risking buying used hardware online that potentially turns out to be non-functional, devoted <em>Guitar Hero</em> fans who have refused to upgrade their Nintendo Wiis now have another option.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <em>Call of Duty</em> maker, along with Meta and others, is accused of influencing the shooter behind that tragedy through its products. </p><p>As part of its defense and in an effort to get the lawsuit tossed out of court, Activision’s head of creative for <em>Call of Duty</em>, Patrick Kelly, revealed  budgets and sales figures for some of the company’s recent games. The information, rarely made public, includes the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</em> (2015): $450 million in development costs / 43 million copies sold</li><li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> (2019): $640 in development costs / 41 million copies sold</li><li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War </em>(2020): $700 in development costs / 30 million copies sold</li></ul><p>While Activision did not share data for more current games, the snapshot in time suggests a trend of <em>Call of Duty</em> games getting ever more expensive to make despite selling millions fewer copies each year at only $10 more per copy (prices for most new blockbuster games went up to $70 when the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S came out in 2020). The data also points to this year’s <em>Call of Duty</em>, which hasn’t officially been announced yet but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is rumored to be a <em>Black Ops 2 </em>sequel</a></span>, potentially costing $1 billion in development costs alone over the life of the game (marketing costs can reach hundreds of millions more on top of that). </p><p>One way that <em>Call of Duty</em> might still be raking in more money than ever, even if it is still facing declining or stagnating sales, is through its popular crossover skins and battle passes. The post-launch lifecycle of each new game in the multiplayer series is now heavily monetized, with diehard fans spending hundreds more in addition to the base price of the game on special gun decals, emotes, and other cosmetics. </p><p>This month’s <em>Squid Game</em> event has been controversial precisely for that reason, as Activision charges premiums for skins from the hit Netflix show while also finding new things to paywall like premium event battle passes. How all of this pans out in the end-of-year financials is now impossible to know, however. All of that data went into a black box when Microsoft completed its $69 billion acquisition of the publisher back in 2023. </p><p>All we know is that last year’s entry, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-game-pass-xbox-sales-ps5-1851686679&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-game-pass-xbox-sales-ps5-1851686679">had the most players of any <em>Call of Duty </em>launch ever</a></span>. While a temporary boon to Microsoft’s Game Pass service, it’s unclear if the franchise’s towering budgets will be sustainable under a subscription model over the long-term. Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick had famously declined to put the company’s games on subscription services. “I don’t agree with the idea of a multi-game subscription service as a business proposition going forwards,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-ftc-trial-day-4-bobby-kotick-and-jim-ryan-game-pass&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-ftc-trial-day-4-bobby-kotick-and-jim-ryan-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a></span> during an 2023 FTC trial over the merger. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Big video games take a lot of money to make, but the industry is very secretive in exactly how much is spent developing them. However, it looks like we might have some insight on how much money it takes to make and market a Call of Duty game.</p><p>In a court filing reviewed by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, Activision's head Call of Duty creative Patrick Kelly reportedly revealed the total budgets and copies sold for three Call of Duty games. 2015's Black Ops III reportedly took developer Treyarch over three years to make and cost $450 million, with the total number of copies sold being 43 million.</p><p>For 2019's Modern Warfare, developed by Infinity Ward, the total cost of development was reportedly $640 million with 41 million copies sold. The last one is Black Ops Cold War from 2020. Treyarch and Raven Software's joint project reportedly took $700 million to develop and sold 30 million copies.</p><p>The court filing was reportedly filed on December 23 as part of a response to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uvalde-families-file-lawsuit-against-activision-and-meta/1100-6523731/" data-ref-id="1100-6523731">lawsuit filed against Activision Blizzard</a> regarding the Robb Elementary shooting in Uvalde, Texas back in 2022. The Uvalde lawsuit was filed in May 2024 and claimed that Call of Duty played a part in influencing the mass shooter. Kelly reportedly cited those three specific Call of Duty games as they were the ones that the survivors claimed the shooter played.</p><p>The video game industry still remains tight-lipped about development budgets. In 2023, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-and-horizon-forbidden-west-budgets-revealed-by-accident-and-they-werent-cheap/1100-6515551/" data-ref-id="1100-6515551">document surfaced</a> that showed Sony spent $220 million to develop The Last of Us Part 2 and $212 million for Horizon Forbidden West.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> creator Gareth Damian Martin has said their warm-hearted series of sci-fi video games will end with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a>, which releases 31st January. However, Citizen Sleeper as a series of games won't necessarily end there.</p>
<p>The intention, as Martin laid it out to me in a recent interview, is to create a full tabletop role-playing version of the game, and thereby handover future adventures in the series to the TTRPG space that has so inspired it.</p>

<p>Responding to whether that would be it for Citizen Sleeper games after the sequel, Martin replied: "I think it is for video games. I'll leave myself a backdoor somewhere that I can climb through and dig it out the grave again... But no. I think especially the ending - and I hope people feel this when they reach the ending - I really felt like, okay, this is me saying the final word on it. I really like where I'm leaving it. I'm really happy with that.</p><p>"But Citizen Sleeper has meant a lot to a lot of people and so I'm not about to leave that behind," they added. "The next big project for me will be to work on a Citizen Sleeper tabletop game in full, but I need to find the right collaborator and I need to work that out, and I need to do that alongside other stuff. So that's something that will be a more long-term project."</p>
<p>Martin has collaborated on tabletop projects before. Their game <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lonearchivist/iow-tidebreak">In Other Waters was adapted for tabletop via a collaboration by Lone Archivist</a>, and <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/cyclesoftheeye">Citizen Sleeper was adapted into a solo, tarot-based tabletop game</a> with Alfred Valley's help, so there's a strong precedent there.</p>
<p>The video game Martin will make next is actually the game they were pitching to their publisher Fellow Traveller before development on Citizen Sleeper 2 began. It was only the runaway success of Citizen Sleeper 1 - now at one million players and counting - that derailed those plans, turning Martin's head towards add-on content and, eventually, a sequel.</p>
<p>"I was actually already pitching my next game, which was not Citizen Sleeper 2, to my publisher," they said. "That's actually going to be the next game."</p>

<p>Citizen Sleeper 2 arrives to much anticipation on 31st January. Demos have already given us a glimpse of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-goes-even-harder-on-its-rpg-roots-with-its-bold-new-twists-on-its-tabletop-dice-rolls">a game that's quite different from Citizen Sleeper 1</a>, with a much stronger sense of tension in it and more developed, and distinct, role-playing systems. The changes work brilliantly; this could be special.</p><p>The development cycle, however, hasn't been easy. Personal challenges, as well as the pressure of living up to expectations, have made life difficult, I discovered speaking with Martin. Success, as much as we court it, can be hard to deal with.</p>
<p>Look out for my full Citizen Sleeper interview soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-added-to-us-list-of-companies-allegedly-aiding-chinese-military.1076034/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-us-dod-list-chinese-military<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The US Department of Defense has added Chinese gaming giant to a list of companies allegedly aiding the Chinese military, a decision that Tencent itself calls a "mistake".</p>

<p>According to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-adds-tencent-catl-list-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijings-military-2025-01-06/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Tencent was added to the DOD's list alongside battery manufacturer CATL, causing the shares of both companies to drop. Tencent's stocks fell by 7.3%, while CATL's dropped by just 2.8%.</p>

<p>The Reuters report goes on to say that Tencent responded to the DOD's decision by calling it a "mistake" and suggesting that its business would be unaffected by the move. The Chinese gaming giant also suggested it would begin legal proceedings if necessary.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tencent-us-list-chinese-military-epic.jpg?itok=k9rKb54p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tencent-us-list-chinese-military-epic.jpg?itok=00MChtj- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tencent has its fingers in plenty of pies, including&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio Epic Games.</figcaption></figure><p>As Reuters points out, the list, which is officially known as the Section 1260H list, doesn't prohibit Tencent from doing business in the US, so it's unlikely to have any material impact on the company's dealings in the short term.</p>

<p>However, having a presence on the list can sometimes serve as a blow to a company's reputation in the US, which could prevent other companies from wanting to do business with Tencent.</p>

<p>Given just <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">how many pies</a> Tencent has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-techland-majority-stakeholder" rel="nofollow">its fingers in</a> across <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">the gaming industry</a>, it's unlikely that there will be a mass exodus of studios breaking their agreements with the Chinese gaming giant, but this still likely won't come as pleasing news to the company.</p>

<p>As for what Tencent is up to outside of its addition to this list, the studio is busy working with developers both Western and non-Western on a number of different projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tencent-monster-hunter-outlanders.jpg?itok=RZb13lX1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tencent-monster-hunter-outlanders.jpg?itok=6ZHFnuW8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tencent has plenty of projects on the go.</figcaption></figure><p>The gaming giant is currently working with Capcom on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow">mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em></a>, and it's also behind the extremely&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon" rel="nofollow"><em>Horizon</em>-coded&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em></a>, which was unveiled in full back in November.</p>

<p>Tencent is also attracting talent like&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>director Hideaki Itsuno, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">joined subsidiary LightSpeed Studios</a> recently (but not the branch that's currently working on&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile</em>, another Tencent project</a>).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/virtuos-is-working-on-an-unannounced-remake-using-unreal-engine-5.1076022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/virtuos-unannounced-remake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A developer’s LinkedIn profile has revealed that Virtuos is working on an unannounced remake for current generation consoles using Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>First spotted by X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a>, the information comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksii-moskovchenko-17278017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Oleksii Moskovchenko</a>‘s LinkedIn page, who is a Technical Art Director at Virtuos. His description of his current work simply reads, “unannounced UE5 PS5/XSX/PC remake.”</p>



<p>In December 2024, several rumors began to circulate that Virtuos would be developing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-4-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake on Unreal Engine 5</a>, which was further corroborated by leak Extas1s, who said that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-could-be-revealed-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game could be announced at the heavily rumored Xbox Direct</a>, which is believe to take place in January. </p>



<p>While some find it somewhat hard to believe that Virtuos could be developing a fully-fledged remake of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion on Unreal Engine 5, the proof is seemingly starting to stack up. For those out of the loop, a remake or remaster of Oblivion first popped up during the FTC investigation into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which the game expected to release during the fiscal year of 2022 – a date that has obviously been missed.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, we shouldn’t have long to wait to know if the rumors are true if the announcement is set to come during the Xbox Direct, which WindowsCentral’s Jez Corden also <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1876466327583621306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently claimed</a> would be announced very soon. </p>



<p>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion was first released in 2006 and has sold an estimated 9.5 million copies worldwide, according to the market research firm Electronic Entertainment Design and Research. </p>



<p>For those waiting on the highly anticipated Elder Scrolls 6, well, unfortunately, that one is still years away from release.</p>

Let us know down below, and be sure to join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

It’s only a short teaser, clocking in at just under a minute, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any shots, scenes, and characters that are worth taking a closer look at. From a grief-ridden hospital corridor to an anger-harbouring, red-drenched hospital corridor, we’ve got you covered (as well as some other non-corridor-related details).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you missed it, we already did a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-two-game-references-and-new-theories-from-the-trailer">full in-depth breakdown of the first Season Two trailer</a> back in 2024, so you can read more about some of our theories about how the show might deviate from The Last of Us Part 2 game there. And we even had a go at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-predicting-season-2">predicting how this upcoming HBO season will play out</a> if you’re in the mood for pure (educated) guesswork. But stay here if you want to check out the five new details, as well as comparisons between the show and Naughty Dog’s original game that we’ve picked out from the brand-new trailer.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Last of Us Season 2 Cast: Who's New and Coming Back to the HBO Show?</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Abby’s Hospital Corridor</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/1-1736254769934.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the teaser opens we get our first glimpse at the aftermath of The Last of Us’ most pivotal scene. An abandoned hallway, bathed by a flashing red light, is soundtracked by an alarm sound that will no doubt send shivers down the spine of anyone who has played the game. Chronologically, this takes place moments after Joel’s fateful decision to rescue Ellie from the Fireflies at the end of season one. We see a panicked Abby – portrayed here by Kaitlyn Dever – walk down the corridor leading to the operating theater of St Louis’ fictional St Mary’s Hospital. In that room, she’ll find the body of her dad, the surgeon whom Joel murdered to save Ellie. It’s the action that sets the wheel in motion for Part 2’s and (we assume) Season 2’s story of spiraling revenge and violence.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Ellie’s Hospital Corridor</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/2-1736254801696.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of revenge and violence, that is exactly what is taking place in this scene just before the trailer ends, which shows Bella Ramsey’s Ellie bathed in red light in a corridor at Lakehill Seattle Hospital. This is almost certainly a replication of the moment in The Last of Us Part 2 when, having cornered one of Abby’s accomplices, Nora, Ellie proceeds to unleash what can only be described as a ferocious assault on her pleading victim. It’s a real turning point for Ellie in the game’s story as we really see for the first time how unstable she has become, and the uncomfortable lengths she’ll go in search of vengeance. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Sickle Sneak Peek</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/3-1736254830311.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Last of Us Part 2 is consistently incredibly violent, even by its predecessor’s standards, and 20 seconds into the teaser we get our first look at a bladed sickle weapon, which presumably belongs to one of the Seraphites. Also known as Scars, this cult-like faction from the game favors more workman-like weaponry such as hammers, machetes, bows, and, in this case, sickles. This may seem like a really tenuous detail, but this specific tool of destruction (or harvesting if that’s more your speed) plays a key role late in The Last of Us Part 2’s story. In a brutal showdown with a pickaxe-wielding Seraphite heavy, Abby achieves bloody victory with a Sickle, tearing apart the Seraphite’s face in a sequence that’s frequently harrowing. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. A Better Look at Isaac</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/4-1736254874896.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">At the 21 second mark we get a lovely close-up of Jeffrey Wright, who plays Isaac Dixon, the leader of the Washington Liberation Front; a paramilitary organisation that Abby works with.  Following in the footsteps of Season 1 actor Merle Dandridge (who played Marlene), Wright actually reprises his role from the game, where he provided voice and motion-capture for Dixon in The Last of Us Part 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A complicated character consumed by conflict (as many in this story are), Dixon doesn’t get a ton of screen time in the game. Here’s hoping we get a bit more of him in the show, as well as more of that fetching beard and knitwear combo.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. The Last Dance</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/5-1736254930006.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, at 24 seconds in, we get a look at one of the most memorable scenes from across both The Last of Us games – the Jackson dance. Dina, played in the HBO show by Alien Romulus’ Isabela Merced, can be seen embracing Ellie in a scene that will spark their romance. It’s a real warm moment of tenderness amongst the cold hopelessness that the rest of the story projects, which is likely why it endures as such a memorable moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be interesting to see if the chronology of events is being played around with here. In The Last of Us Part Two, the dance occurs right at the end of the story in flashback form, but we already know that Season 2 of the show is not going to reach that far into the timeline. The fact that we’re seeing it here in the trailer suggests that Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin might be tweaking the order we see these scenes, perhaps to help cement the emotional stakes of Ellie’s journey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We won’t have to wait long to see what changes, if any, have been made to The Last of Us Part Two’s story, though, with Season 2 of the show only a few months away now. What are you most excited to see in the upcoming episodes? Let us know in the comments below.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

We see an Akira mirror match with the kind of combat usually reserved for a martial arts movie.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rekindling memories of Sony’s infamous Killzone 2 reveal E3 2005 trailer, this Virtual Fighter video is a concept only, although it is “in-engine.” The animations on display are beyond what we’ve seen from fighting game gameplay in other titles, and the speed and fluidity of the movement is a step beyond normal fighting game gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega, though, made clear that what we’re seeing here should not be considered Virtua Fighter 6 gameplay, stressing: “Please note that this is a concept video created before development began. The actual gameplay and characters may differ from what is shown.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Virtua Fighter fans are excited by the return of the legendary series and the prospect that its visuals may approach the level we’re seeing in this concept video. “If they somehow manage to get the animations to look even remotely close to this in the final game, that'd be insane,” said one fan. “Regardless, I'm excited.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter 6 is in development at Yakuza / Like a Dragon studio Ryo Ga Gotoku and is without a release window or target platforms. Virtua Fighter hasn’t seen a mainline release in years, leaving mini-game appearances in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s Yakuza games and the 2021 release of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown to tide fans over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter, which includes characters such as Akira Yuki, Pai Chan, and Wolf Hawkfield, is on the hardcore end of the fighting game spectrum, with slower-paced gameplay that challenges players to master its mechanics in order to enjoy success. Virtua Fighter 5, which first released in 2006, is considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>CES 2025 is officially underway, and one of the big gaming announcements so far was a partnership between Nvidia and Krafton for AI-powered teammates who can help you in battle in PUBG.</p><p>Nvidia and Krafton created what they are calling CPCs, or co-playable characters. These characters use artificial intelligence to fight alongside you. This feature is called called PUBG Ally, and the CPC is apparently smart enough to play like a human would. You can say something like, "Hey Ally, I'm looking for a level 3 vest and 5.56 ammo." The CPC will then search the map and try to find it for you. The PUBG Ally can also spot enemies and cover you, locate nearby vehicles, and speak back to you with an AI-powered voice. You can see some of the test footage in action below.</p><p>Note that what you're seeing in the video is representative of R&amp;D gameplay. The PUBG Ally feature <a href="https://x.com/PUBG/status/1876554285745606665" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hasn't actually been greenlit yet</a> and may never come to PUBG.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/NVIDIAGameDev/status/1876509202031444011" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Transform solo gameplay into a seamless team experience with PUBG Ally. 🎮<br>KRAFTON and NVIDIA have teamed up to create the world’s first Co-Playable Character (CPC), built with NVIDIA ACE.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2025</a> <a href="https://t.co/jAaibitkgq" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/jAaibitkgq</a></p>  — NVIDIAGameDev (@NVIDIAGameDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGameDev/status/1876509202031444011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Krafton's Sims-like inZOI will also make use of this new CPC feature, though no footage or any other details were revealed as of yet. Naraka: Bladepoint's mobile version will use CPCs as well.</p><p>It appears what was announced here is more of an outline for what could be possible down the road--not something that's ready right now. Krafton CEO CH Kim said this new AI technology will "revolutionize the gaming industry," while Nvidia boss Keita Iida said, "AI is transforming the way games are created and played."</p><p>Plenty of people remain skeptical about how AI could actually shake up video games, in part because AI is nothing new at all in the world of gaming. There are also concerns by many about how further adoption of AI technologies <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">could impact people who make games.</a> Video game actors have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-od-and-physint-were-impacted-by-strike/1100-6528609/" data-ref-id="1100-6528609">on strike since July 2024</a> due in part to concerns about AI.</p>

<p>As is the case with every month, the arrival of these new games means that others will be leaving Game Pass. The following games will leave the service on 15th January:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common' Hood (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Escape Academy (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Exoprimal (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>

<li>Insurgency Sandstorm (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Those Who Remain (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>
