<p>Launching this <strong>Autumn</strong> on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5, we honestly weren't expecting to see this one on the Switch 2, but according to Windows Central's Jez Corden, it's actually currently "under consideration" for Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>Corden took to <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2014463781250777444">social media</a> to confirm, stating that it "isn't 100% definite", but if he's to be believed, it seems that Xbox and Playground Studios are at least looking into the viability of a Switch 2 port.</p><div><figure data-videoid="od1TOBPMAIg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/od1TOBPMAIg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytod1TOBPMAIg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/od1TOBPMAIg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/od1TOBPMAIg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed410fbaxrgvjz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>"Was told Fable for Nintendo Switch 2 isn't 100% definite for now, but under consideration for the future."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fable has, until now, never really left the Xbox ecosystem other than a few releases on PC and Mac. These days, however, Microsoft is shifting its strategy to include multiple console releases for its biggest games. It's already released the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pentiment">Pentiment</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> on Switch, and there are ongoing rumours that <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> might also makes its way to Switch 2.</p>
<p>We'd love to see this come to fruition though. Fable's blend of fantasy action and British humour is excellent, and although the third mainline entry from 2010 was a bit lacklustre, we can't wait to see what the new game can do.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Craft Comes From Artists, Not Software”: Fortnite Dev Fires Back at Director Who Blames Unreal Engine for Lacking Hollywood CGI]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/fortnite-dev-fires-back-pirates-of-the-caribbean-director-blames-unreal-engine-bad-vfx/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The first three <strong>Pirates of the Caribbean</strong> movies were some of the best-looking films of their time, with top-tier visual effects work that remains impressive to this day. For <strong>Gore Verbinski,</strong> the director of all three of those initial films, the visual effects in those three films are still so impressive that it stands above today's Hollywood blockbusters, but according to Verbinski, that's more to do with the tools VFX artists are using now, namely the game engine powering <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/fortnite-everything-we-know-hub/">Fortnite</a></strong> and countless other modern games: <strong>Epic Games'</strong> own <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/with-significant-gpu-and-cpu-performance-improvements-unreal-engine-5-7-is-another-step-in-the-right-direction/">Unreal Engine</a></strong>.</p>



<p>In an interview on <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/11/gore-verbinski-good-luck-have-fun-dont-die/">ButWhyTho.net</a>, Verbinski laid out his beef with Unreal Engine, claiming that the rise in filmmakers using it for modern VFX is making modern films look worse than they did over 20 years ago. For Verbinski, it's all to do with how Unreal Engine handles light, giving modern films a "<em>gaming aesthetic</em>" that he believes pushes them into an "<em>uncanny valley</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I think the simplest answer is you've seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape</em>," Verbinski begins when asked about what, in his mind, qualifies for VFX to be "<em>done right</em>" and how VFX work has changed in the last two decades. "<em>So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects. So you have this sort of gaming aesthetic entering the world of cinema</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I think that's why those Kubrick movies still hold up, because they were shooting miniatures and paintings, and now you've got this different aesthetic. It works with Marvel movies where you kind of know you're in a heightened, unrealistic reality. I think it doesn't work from a strictly photo-real standpoint. I just don't think it takes light in the same way; I don't think it fundamentally reacts to subsurface scattering, and how light hits the skin and reflects in the same way. So that's how you get this uncanny valley when you come to creature animation, a lot of in-betweening is done for speed instead of being done by hand</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SNA-Ezahmok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That's the first part of Verbinski's answer, and it's overall not the spiciest of takes, but its likely what he said next that got a heated reply from <strong>Pat Tubach</strong>, the VFX supervisor at Epic Games, who it so happens worked in Hollywood VFX for years on several blockbuster movies, from The Mummy, to Jurassic Park 3, to the Avengers, and, as luck would have it, all three of the original Pirates of the Caribbean movies, before working at the Fortnite company.</p>



<p>"<em>And then just what's become acceptable from an executive standpoint, where they think no one will care that the ships in the ocean look like they're not on water. In the first Pirates movie, we were actually going out to sea and getting on a boat...<strong>I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing Maya as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards."</strong></em></p>



<p>Suggesting that Unreal is a step backwards from Maya in such a strong way is likely what emboldened Tubach to hit back at Verbinski, who gave this statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-maker-epic-games-hits-back-at-pirates-of-the-caribbean-director-who-blamed-unreal-engine-for-bad-cgi-in-modern-movies">IGN</a>:</p>



<p>"<em>It's inaccurate for anyone in the industry to claim that one tool is to blame for some erroneously perceived issues with the state of VFX and CGI. It's true that there are a lot more people making computer graphics than ever before, and with that scale comes a range of successes and failures - but <strong>aesthetic and craft comes from artists, not software.</strong>"</em></p>



<p>"<em>Unreal Engine is primarily used for pre-visualization, virtual production, and in some cases, final pixels. I can guarantee that the artists working on big blockbuster VFX films like Pirates of the Caribbean 10-15 years ago could only dream about having a tool as powerful as Unreal Engine on their desks to help them get the job done - and I should know - <strong>I was one of them!</strong>"</em></p>



<p>Unreal Engine is not without its faults, <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-7-out-now-with-nanite-foliage-and-megalights-powered-stunning-dynamic-shadow-casting-lights/">but the improvements Epic has put into it over time</a> have genuinely made it look better than ever, and made games look better than ever (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-pc-performance-benchmarks/">even if it doesn't always help a game's performance</a>). Verbinski isn't wrong to point out that people don't necessarily want their movies to look like Fortnite, but neither is Tubach when he points to the fact that you can only get so far by blaming the tool an artist uses.</p>

<p>Arctic Hazard explains the delay <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/norsegame.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">over on Bluesky</a>, but it's a fairly standard explanation; the devs need more time to "further refine and polish the experience" of <em>Norse: Oath of Blood </em>so that it reflects the studio's "passion for the source material".</p><p>Although the game is being delayed, Arctic Hazard and Tripwire are promising new developer diaries in the coming weeks, which will include "behind-the-scenes looks at development, deeper dives into gameplay, and additional updates".</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Norse: Oath of Blood</em>, it's a gritty tactical RPG that emphasizes down-to-earth realism in a way that I suspect <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wartales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe4a9aa9-b171-4bf8-a97d-e538c2805501" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Wartales</em></a><em> </em>fans will appreciate.</p><p>You play as a young Viking called Gunnar (because of course he is), who's out for vengeance after his home is destroyed by the intimidating-sounding Steinarr Far-Spear.

              <p data-start="0" data-end="546">A new year often brings the urge to refresh your surroundings, and home upgrades don’t have to involve expensive furniture or major renovations. Small changes can dramatically shift how a space feels, and lighting sits at the top of that list. The right light can make a room feel warmer, calmer, and far more inviting. That’s exactly where the Govee LED floor lamp comes in, especially now that it’s available at a steep discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5950/">Normally priced at $100, this modern lamp is currently 35% off, dropping the price to just $65 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p data-start="548" data-end="968">The Govee floor lamp takes a sleek, minimalist approach. Its design features a single vertical light bar that tucks neatly into the corner of a room, projecting light outward across the walls. This indirect lighting instantly softens the space and eliminates harsh glare. Thanks to its RGB LED technology, the lamp can glow in virtually any color you can imagine, allowing you to adjust the mood of your room in seconds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5950/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="970" data-end="1368">Many people have grown tired of harsh overhead lighting—myself included. We have a strict, “No Big Light,” policy in my home. Ceiling fixtures and rows of recessed lights can make living spaces feel sterile and overly bright. Lighting placed closer to eye level or below creates a more relaxed environment, perfect for unwinding at the end of the day. The Govee floor lamp excels at this, delivering ambient light that feels intentional and cozy rather than clinical.</p>
<h2>Set the Mood, Any Mood</h2>
<p data-start="1370" data-end="1857">Customization with this lamp is near limitless. It supports multi-color displays and offers 85 built-in scene modes to match different moods and occasions. Warm oranges and yellows work well for quiet evenings with a book or movie, while vibrant color combinations can energize a room for social gatherings. Holiday decorating becomes effortless with themed color options, and music sync mode adds another layer of fun by matching light patterns to the beat of your favorite songs.</p>


<p data-start="1859" data-end="2260">The Govee floor lamp works with Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing you to control brightness, colors, and power with simple voice commands. Scheduling and automation options let you create routines that fit your lifestyle. Lights can turn on as the sun sets, dim automatically late at night, or shift scenes for special events without manual input.</p>
<p data-start="2262" data-end="2462">Setup is refreshingly easy. After assembling the vertical bar, you simply run the light strip through it, plug it in, and you’re ready to go. No complicated tools or technical experience are required.</p>
<p data-start="2464" data-end="2753" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5950/">This one lamp can completely change how a room feels, and at just $65, it’s a no brainer. Give your home the cozy refresh that it needs for 2026.</a></p>

<p>It seems Michael and Dwight will receive new skins in the Fortnite x The Office collaboration. </p>



<p>Fortnite has seemingly been brewing a lot of big collaborations for the coming seasons, with names like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festivals-next-major-collab-may-have-been-found/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pink Pony Club</a>, and so many more being thrown out. However, one collab that everybody has been eagerly waiting to hear more about is the Fortnite x The Office collab, and now more details have been revealed. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-the-office-will-introduce-michael-and-dwight-skins">Fortnite x  The Office Will Introduce Michael and Dwight Skins</h2>



<p>A reliable Fortnite insider, Hypex has revealed which skins will be introduced for The Office collaboration. The first skin will be of Michael Scott (portrayed by Steve Carell), the Regional Manager of the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin. The other skin is of Dwight Schrute (played by Rainn Wilson), who is the Assistant (to the) Regional Manager.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-3-queens-blood-snowboarding-2000662578</link>
            <guid>1414261</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</span></i><span> is known for its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-minigames-remake-trilogy-3-game-2000658234"><span>minigame glut</span></a><span>, but it did have at least </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-mini-games-best-worst-ranked-1851340606"><span>a few bangers</span></a><span> in the mix. One of those was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-queens-blood-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-1851312733"><span>Queen’s Blood</span></a><span>, a card game that you could play with various citizens throughout the world, and it even had its own extensive side story to follow. This was new for </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>–apparently Queen’s Blood hadn’t yet caught on in Midgar, where </span><i><span>Remake </span></i><span>takes place–and it sounds like Square Enix wants to expand upon it in the upcoming third game.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/"><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>, director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed Queen’s Blood will make a return in the as-of-yet-untitled third game, but it will be a little bit different.</span></p> <p><span>“Queen’s Blood is a very popular and beloved minigame, and I believe a lot of people are still wanting something like that,” Hamaguchi told </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span>. “I want to expand on Queen’s Blood so we are enhancing it, and giving you a more powered-up version of it when you see that third installment… Queen’s Blood is still going to be available in the third installment. We just want to expand on it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>What could those enhancements entail? New cards, mechanics, or maybe the board will just be twice as big, allowing for more territory-claiming plays? We probably won’t find out for a while, but Queen’s Blood isn’t the only minigame in the third entry, as it will also signal the return of the original </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>’s snowboarding segment, which Hamaguchi says will be more than “just a simple snowboarding minigame.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000021618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000021618"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000021618">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“I’m afraid I can’t delve too much into the details, but we understand that it’s not going to be just a simple snowboarding minigame. We want to make sure that it’s incorporated into the story to have that sort of connection with the theming of it,” he said.</span></p>

 <p><span>The third </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII </span></i><span>remake is probably still a ways away, but it does seem like the game is coming along and is in a playable state.</span></p> <p><span>“In terms of the third installment, I believe we are coming along very smoothly,” he said. “We have set a schedule for ourselves, and I believe we are tracking on time for the milestones we have set. So I’m really thankful for the development team and I have so much respect for them working on this project. I believe that at this point the game is playable, technically, but we are still trying to polish it so it is at a quality where we can deliver it to our players.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake </span></i><span>just launched </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851"><span>on the Switch 2</span></a><span> and Xbox Series X/S, with </span><i><span>Rebirth </span></i><span>expected to launch on both systems later this year.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-starts-a-streaming-device-clearance-fire-tv-stick-4k-plus-newest-model-hits-its-lowest-price-of-the-year-2000662384</link>
            <guid>1414258</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>No smart TV? No problem. If your screen is working fine otherwise, you don’t have to replace it to enjoy smart features. A Fire TV stick can do the job for considerably less, and you can now pick its latest model for under than $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6848/">Amazon is currently offering the newest Fire TV Stick 4K Plus at a 30% discount, bringing the price down to $35</a>. Use the code FTV4K25 at checkout, and you’ll save another $10, which drops the total to just $25. You’ll also get a one-month free trial to Xbox GamePass with your purchase, which sweetens the offer even more.</p>
<p>Those with an older Fire TV stick lying around can trade it in for 20% off this model, but you might not be able to combine the current discount with that.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6848/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy Setup</h2>
<p>This small, but mighty stick plugs directly into the HDMI input of your TV. Then, connect the USB cable to the Fire TV Stick and the power adapter. Plug the adapter into a wall outlet, and turn your TV on. You can now follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, even if it’s your first time using one.</p>
<p>Once it’s all set and running, you’ll be able to stream more than 1.8 million movies and TV episodes from popular platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Max, and more. Most of these require a monthly fee, but if you’re looking to cut back on those, no sweat. It also gets you instant access to over 400,000 free movies and TV episodes from popular ad-supported streaming apps like Fire TV Channels, Prime Video, Tubi, and Pluto TV. Basically, you’ll never be out of stuff to watch. Maybe start the night with a good horror movie, and then switch to a lighthearted comedy show to wrap things up (and keep nightmares at bay)!</p>
<p>Smart search is made possible with Alexa, which lets you simply use your voice to find movies by actor, plot, and even iconic quotes. For instance, you can say something like “Alexa, show me the latest Jake Gyllenhaal movies”, or “Alexa, show me crime thrillers with unexpected endings”, and your command will be answered in seconds.</p>



<p>The Fire TV Stick 4K Plus is made to help you maximize your TV’s potential. Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support means you can stream content in vibrant 4K Ultra HD, plus enjoy immersive sound with Dolby Atmos audio. There’s WiFi 6 for smoother streaming, which also ensures less interference from other connected devices.</p>
<p>Gamers will appreciate that you can also game with Xbox Game Pass via cloud gaming through the stick. We’re talking playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Hogwarts Legacy, Outer Worlds 2, Ninja Gaiden 4, and hundreds of other titles without a console. And since you also get a month of Xbox GamePass with your purchase, you can jump in at no extra cost.</p>
<p>This version of the stick comes with early access to Alexa+ as well, which is Amazon’s smartest AI assistant yet. The access is available through the end of 2026, and after that, it will be included with Prime. Again, it’s a nice way to try the new features without committing.</p>
<p>We’re not expecting this 50% discount to last long, so it’s best to grab it without wasting time. Just make sure you use the code FTV4K25 at checkout to maximize savings.</p>

              <p>It feels like a rare treat for a Nintendo Direct to take us by surprise, now that the events are routinely being pre-empted by leakers. This latest, just revealed by Nintendo to take place on January 25 at 9 a.m. ET (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-set-for-january-25"><em>Gematsu</em></a>), snuck up on me. It’s a shame it’s just for the&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, rather than meeting our desperate need for Switch 2 game news, but at least it means we’ll get to see Shigeru Miyamoto being all delightfully excited.</p> <p>Yes, January 25&nbsp;<em>is</em> a Sunday, which is a weird choice for a Direct. All right-minded games and film journalists are in bed at 9 a.m. on a Sunday morning, so expect some bleary-eyed coverage of the new footage and details being revealed ahead of the movie’s April 3 release.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join us on Sunday, Jan 25, at 6am PT for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoDirect</a> featuring an exclusive look at The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation.</p> <p>Watch here: <a href="https://t.co/gTC114mMLz">https://t.co/gTC114mMLz</a> <a href="https://t.co/4DOoFU1fFJ">pic.twitter.com/4DOoFU1fFJ</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2014700056855687256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Nintendo says this will feature “an exclusive look at&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>,” but gives no more information than that. So far we’ve seen a&nbsp;<em>very</em> limited amount of the movie, mostly sticking to a single scene of Mario and Luigi’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-trailer-bowser-smug-jerk-2000643462">frustrating conversation</a> with a miniature Bowser in his teeny castle. Aside from the reveal of Rosalina, weirdly little has been shown of a movie that’s due out in just over two months.</p>  <p>The original 2023&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488">may not have been particularly good</a>, but it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-bros-movie-box-office-records-sonic-reviews-1850318954">wildly successful</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-miyamoto-negative-bad-reviews-1850380112">Miyamoto even claimed</a> the negative reviews helped the movie succeed. Nintendo and Illumination are presumably feeling very confident of a similar success for the sequel, which will hopefully make better use of the splendid&nbsp;<em>Mario Galaxy</em> setting than first movie did of its Mushroom Kingdom hodgepodge.</p>

 <p>Following Sunday’s Direct, we can expect promotion for the animated movie to really ramp up, although presumably continuing to try to feature Chris Pratt’s dull-ass voice as little as possible.</p>

Though many games have borrowed elements from Vampire Survivors to great effect, fans of the genre have been waiting for a Survivors developer Poncle's next game. In November of last year, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-is-the-next-game-from-the-vampire-survivors-team" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bd026396-a503-4a65-b4e1-8437f900e8ba" data-entity-substitution="canonical">we learned of Vampire Crawlers</a>, a spin-off title from Poncle that is a deck-building dungeon crawler. Today, we received more information about the anticipated spin-off title.</p><p>Described by Poncle as a "turboturn deckbuilder," Vampire Crawlers attempts to deliver turn-based combat without the trademark waiting. According to the developer, you don't need to pause for animations to complete before executing your next move, as the game stacks and executives your inputs in a way that minimizes downtime. The goal is to turn the often-slow tactical combat that sometimes typifies the genre into a more fast-paced and visually exciting experience. Poncle also shared that players can use gems to customize cards with various effects, ranging from damage multipliers to weapon evolutions.</p><p>You can see Vampire Crawlers in action through the first part of a new video series called "Let's Explore Vampire Crawlers," which will detail new gameplay mechanics with each subsequent episode.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ael4oMaKQM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ael4oMaKQM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Vampire Crawlers arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC, iOS, and Android in 2026.

<p>This will be the second direct for the upcoming Illumination sequel, which is due to arrive in cinemas on 3rd April 2026. Last time, we found out that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reveals-rosalina-bowser-jr-and-more">Bowser Jr. and Rosalina</a> would be part of the cast.</p>
<p>You'll be able to watch to the Direct on either YouTube or Nintendo's website, and it kicks off at the following times:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PST / 7am MST / 8am CST / 9am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CET / 4pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 11pm JST / 10pm AWST / 1am (Mon) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>We've had a couple of clips and teasers since the last Direct, but in a recent interview, the voice Mario (in the movies, at least) Chris Pratt teased that there <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/chris-pratt-supposedly-hints-at-a-couple-more-character-surprises-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">would be more recognisable characters</a> making their appearance in the sequel.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps we'll be seeing them this Sunday? Will Yoshi finally make his long-rumoured appearance?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Vampire Crawlers Demo to Launch in Exactly One Month from Today]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/vampire-crawlers-demo-launch-in-one-month/</link>
            <guid>1414240</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Vampire Crawlers</strong>, the first spin-off of <strong>2022 indie sensation Vampire Survivors</strong>, will soon be available to play thanks to a free demo. Developer <strong>poncle</strong> announced that the demo will be released <strong>on February 23</strong> for <strong>PC </strong>via Steam (during next month's Steam Next Fest) and for <strong>Xbox</strong>. The full game will also be released on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, but there's no info on demos for those platforms.</p>



<p>The announcement comes alongside the first episode of a new video series called “Let’s Explore Vampire Crawlers”. The video series consists of <strong>bite-sized gameplay reveals</strong> in which the developer will share more about the features and gameplay of the upcoming rogue-like deckbuilding game.</p>



<p>In the debut episode, the team dives into the two key pillars of the Vampire Crawlers experience:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Turboturn</strong>: turn-based combat without the wait. In Vampire Crawlers, <strong>you can trigger your next move without having to wait for animations to finish</strong>.

<p>On the heels of Vampire Survivors, which has sold an estimated ten million copies on Valve's platform alone, developer poncle has already convinced over 200K Steam users to wishlist Vampire Crawlers in the short span of two months since the game's announcement. Matching the incredible success of Survivors won't be easy, but the small indie team would likely be happy even with just a fifth of that.</p>

<p>The new map is The Nordic Shore, a five-lane arena with "open sightlines, harsh environmental conditions, and a unique pattern" for players to get to grips with.</p><p>It's joined by a new in-game intro and tutorial to help new players get into <em>Spellcasters Chronicles</em>, as well as in-game text chat for teams, a player reporting system (for such a thing must come alongside text chat), and customization for spellcasters.</p><p>Of course, since there is now customization, there must also be microtransactions, and so this update is also introducing a range of cosmetic packs you can buy, with costs ranging from $8.99 to a slightly alarming $69.99.</p><p>Quantic Dream has also altered the system specs for <em>Spellcasters Chronicles </em>for this beta.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-luke-ross-patreon-2000662571</link>
            <guid>1414222</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The modder who goes by Luke Ross has made full VR mods for some of the biggest blockbuster games around. He’s now decided to take them all offline, at least for now. After reportedly trying and failing to get CD Projekt Red to pay him for a full-conversion VR mod for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, Ross was hit earlier this month <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987">with a DMCA takedown notice</a> from the Polish RPG maker. The modder has now been hit with another DMCA from the publisher of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghostrunner-is-actually-the-fall-s-sharpest-cyberpunk-g-1845917183"><em>Ghostrunner</em></a>, and has decided to suspend his entire Patreon, where access to dozens of other VR mods is locked behind a subscriber paywall, for at least the next month.</p> <p>“In light of the above facts, I’m being forced to take immediate action. I’m making unavailable all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years, so that there will be no ground for further claims,” Ross wrote in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qkavjg/luke_ross_removes_access_to_all_mods/">a reported email to subscribers last night</a> (via <em><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/cyberpunk-vr-modder-luke-ross-patreon-suspended-following-new-dmca-from-ghostruner-devs/">FRVR</a></em>). “And since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I’m making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time.”</p>

 <p>The dramatic move came after Ross reportedly feared losing access to the account entirely after a takedown notice from Ghostrunner publisher 505 Games. “No mention of any terms of service violation this time,” wrote the modder. “Again Patreon automatically complied. I don’t blame them; DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they ‘believe’ their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don’t like—and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process.”</p> <p>Ross’ frustration with the publishers who own the games he’s modding and the power dynamics of modern DMCA threats on the internet is clear throughout the email, but the modder also tries to address criticisms about him charging for the mods in the first place. Central to CDPR’s complaint against the <em>Cyberpunk 2077 VR</em> mod was that Ross was charging players to access it via a subscription. As with a similar VR mod for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the normally pro-mod game maker reiterated that it would be fine with Ross making the creations free and simply allowing users to voluntarily tip instead, as many other modders do.</p>

 <p>“People on the web are thirsty for blood because back in the <em>GTA V</em> and <em>RDR 2</em> era, an article came out stating that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23190201/luke-ross-vr-real-mod-gta-v-elden-ring-horizon-red-dead">I was raising $20,000 a month</a>. Is that ‘reasonable?'” Ross wrote. “Assuming that overall the work I poured into making my software support <em>Cyberpunk</em>, turning it into the ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q02UCNXLJY8" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc">most immersive gaming experience’</a>&nbsp;some people had in their lives, amounted to a few months, say $50,000: is that ‘reasonable’ according to the arbitrary criteria of <em>Cyberpunk</em>‘s publisher? Something tells me it wouldn’t be considered reasonable, despite being a tiny fraction of the many millions they would have to invest for porting <em>CP2077</em> to VR themselves, and despite the fact that the cost was entirely financed by passionate gamers and none of it was incurred by CD Projekt Red.”</p>

 <p>Ross’ thankless crusade hasn’t won over the gaming masses quite yet. He accused users of trying to pirate the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR mod even after it was taken down in order <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">to “punish” him</a>&nbsp;for breaking CDPR’s terms of service. “Wouldn’t making his mod free and accepting optional donations make him bulletproof to all claims?” asked one commenter on the VR subreddit where Ross’ latest email was shared. “Guy wants so bad to make some nice cash out of this, and got so upset that he is not even considering alternative ‘business models,’ he just said fuck it.”</p>

            <guid>1414219</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The UGREEN 7-in-1 Docking Station converts a USB-C connector on your computer or tablet into a multi-connection hub for additional monitors, storage devices, and accessories. Aluminum construction gives this docking station a slender profile that houses 7 connections, 2 HDMI video connections, 2 USB-A data connections, 2 USB-C data connections, and a dedicated input for powering the unit. In addition, you can connect monitors, storage devices, and a charger with a single, compact adapter, eliminating the need to manage multiple adapters/dongles.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/"><span>Visit Amazon and purchase the UGREEN 7-in-1 Docking Station for only $26, down from the regular price of $37, for a 31% savings.&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A docking station to collect all your important tech in one place</h2>
<p><span>With this dock, you can drive two external monitors at resolutions up to 4K (3840×2160) and refresh rates up to 60Hz via its two HDMI ports. You can duplicate your primary screen on the second monitor, or expand your desktop to an additional monitor, freeing up space on the original monitor for other applications.</span></p>
<p><span>The four 10 Gb/s data ports provide the space for connecting your most frequently used peripherals. This dock has two USB-A and two USB-C connectors that support connecting external solid-state drives (SSDs), flash drives, keyboards, mice, etc., at much faster speeds than USB 2.0 ports. As these connectors are designed primarily to transfer data, and not to charge your laptop or to output video, they enable you to move large files and back up your data to external storage devices more rapidly.</span></p>



<p><span>There is a dedicated USB-C Power Delivery port on this dock that lets you keep your laptop charged even when the dock is connected to it. It can accept up to 100W of power from a compatible USB-C charger and pass power to the host cable. So, a single connection to the dock can perform both charging and expansion functions. Only power is transferred through the PD port, allowing the other 10 Gb/s ports to be used for data transfer.</span></p>
<p><span>The aluminum housing of this dock is compact, yet sturdy enough to withstand normal usage without being bulky in your travel case. The small size of the dock, combined with a relatively short host cable, minimizes clutter and prevents adjacent ports on the side of your laptop from being obstructed by the dock. You can either permanently keep this dock on a desk or include it in a travel kit with a charger and HDMI cables. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/">At a sale price of $26, down from its original list price of $37</a>, the UGREEN 7-in-1 docking station is a great solution that provides two 4K-resolution HDMI outputs, high-speed data ports, and power-through charging via a single USB-C connector.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The official Forza Horizon 6 reveal was incredible. It showcased everything Playground Games has been working on for the Japanese-inspired sequel, and if you’re already revving up your car in excitement, it’s time to fill you in on Forza Horizon 6’s Xbox Game Pass status.</p>



<p>Is it safe to say that Forza Horizon 6 is the biggest racing game of 2026? It will take a lot to top it, and with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-forza-horizon-6-gameplay-footage-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay footage revealed</a> so far, it’s hard to argue. Playing it is a must, and with the confusion surrounding Xbox Game Pass in recent times, it’s brought FH6 into the spotlight.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-forza-horizon-6-releasing-on-xbox-game-pass">Is Forza Horizon 6 Releasing On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A speedy success beckons. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6 will officially launch as a day-one Xbox Game Pass offering, meaning you’ll get it for free if you have the correct subscription.</strong></p>



<p>The whole Game Pass price increase controversy in 2025 raised big questions about future launches. These doubts have been dispelled about Forza Horizon 6, though, and you only have to look to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox</a> itself for the answer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Arriving for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, Steam, and day one with Game Pass Ultimate. Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;will be an Xbox Play Anywhere title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Game Pass is more expensive now, but you’ll still be able to have access to certain full-price AAA games. There are still good times and games on the horizon (pun intended).</p>







<h2 id="h-which-version-of-xbox-game-pass-is-needed-to-play-forza-horizon-6">Which Version Of Xbox Game Pass Is Needed To Play Forza Horizon 6?</h2>



<p><strong>You need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to play Forza Horizon 6 for free.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not free, technically, but you understand the concept. It’s better than paying $60, $70, or $80. This does mean you need the most expensive version of the Game Pass model, and here’s how to get it:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724#join" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox website</a>.</li>



<li>Press to Join Game Pass.</li>



<li>An option will appear with three tiers.</li>



<li>You need to click <strong>Select </strong>under the <strong>Ultimate </strong>tier.</li>



<li>Complete your subscription.</li>



<li>Once Forza Horizon 6 debuts, you can download it and play it as part of XGP Ultimate.</li>
</ol>



<p>Knowing that Forza Horizon 6 is coming to Game Pass should make a lot of people happy. If you are a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, look forward to entering the new world of Horizon. Also, head to the Insider Gaming Discord Server and leave a message to say if FH6 is enough to get you to sign up with Game Pass. Conversely, pop a message down to say why it <em>isn’t </em>enough, if it’s the case.</p>

<p>Make sure you know about all <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-ps5-all-consoles-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6 consoles and platforms</a> ahead of launch, and if you’re unsure, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-setting-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which location Forza Horizon 6 is taking the series this time around.</a></p>

<p>It’s the second-straight Nintendo Direct event to specifically be about the movie. The last one took place on November 12, 2025, and gave fans a first look at the new trailer along with introducing Bowser Jr. and Rosalina to the film. </p>



<p>The next Direct is likely to give a new trailer, the reveal of new characters, and, possibly, the stars who voice them. There are rumors and leaks suggesting Yoshi will also be in the movie, but the green dinosaur has yet to be seen on camera.</p>



<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is the sequel to 2023’s Super Mario Bros. Movie. It’s currently scheduled to release in theaters on April 3, 2026. That’s almost three years to the day of the original movie’s release.</p>

A <a href="https://jobs.ea.com/en_US/careers/JobDetail/Production-Director/212271" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job description</a> notes that the role will involve partnering with Mass Effect 5's "creative leadership, studio teams, and internal and external partners to champion the game's vision and ensure its execution at the highest quality bar."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Since 1995, BioWare has been dedicated to creating games defined by rich storytelling, unforgettable characters, and expansive worlds," the job description continues. "Over the years, the studio has earned recognition for developing some of the industry's most critically acclaimed titles. Today, BioWare is building on that legacy with the development of the next Mass Effect game, continuing one of the highest-rated and most celebrated series in video game history."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mass-effect-revealed">BioWare first announced plans to make Mass Effect 5 back in 2020</a> — a date that now feels a lifetime ago — in part to simply reassure fans that it remained committed to the franchise. In reality, though, the company was still busy devoting most of its development efforts into getting Dragon Age: The Veilguard done and out the door. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mass Effect: Next Chapter Game Award Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During this time, BioWare is believed to have had only a small team working on its next Mass Effect game concept, while the bulk of the studio was busy elsewhere. With The Veilguard finally launched in late 2024, Mass Effect 5 became the sole focus of the studio — albeit in its newly-slimmed down form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamble previously confirmed that Mass Effect 5 was being led by a team of fellow Mass Effect veterans who served key roles on the franchise's original three games, including art director Derek Watts, creative director Parrish Ley, senior level designer and Normandy programmer Dusty Everman, and game director Preston Watmaniuk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The leadership team behind Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including its lead writer, senior systems designer, various editors, producer and both its co-directors, Corinne Busche and John Epler, are all no longer at the company following the studio's downsizing, meanwhile.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Consecutive years have seen BioWare release snippets of concept art and other brief teasers for the game, which is expected to be set hundreds of years after the end of the original Mass Effect trilogy and feature at least one returning character. At the same time, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-wont-retread-shepards-story-and-will-be-set-after-the-original-trilogy">pre-production has also begun on Amazon Prime's Mass Effect TV series</a> that will also be set after the events of the trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let's start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-and-bioware-remain-committed-to-next-mass-effect-game-and-yes-romances-will-return">Gamble wrote in a blog post last November</a>. "The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare," Gamble continued today. "But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare has given no indication of when Mass Effect 5 will arrive, though here's hoping 2026 brings a better sense of the company's progress as development ramps up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> ended 2025 as the best-selling game in the U.S., beating its first-person shooter rival <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, which ended down in fifth place. Black Ops 6, which also launched day one on Game Pass, was 2024’s number one best-selling game in the U.S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to sales data from Circana, EA’s Battlefield 6 finished as 2025’s best-selling video game in tracked full game dollar sales. It's the first time a Battlefield game has outsold a Call of Duty game. Meanwhile, Battlefield 6 ranked first on both Xbox and the aggregated PC storefronts for the year while placing second on PlayStation behind only NBA 2K26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 had a massive launch in October 2025, breaking franchise records by selling over 7 million copies in its first three days and becoming the best-selling game of 2025 by revenue. This launch, coupled with the release of the hugely popular extraction shooter, Arc Raiders, put enormous pressure on Black Ops 7, which has disappointed in sales terms. Indeed, Black Ops 7’s fifth place finish is the lowest for a mainline Call of Duty game since Call of Duty: World at War ended up at number six in 2008.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are, however, a number of factors we should take into consideration when analyzing Black Ops 7’s performance. The number one is that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard, has yet to announce any sales number for the game, in the U.S. or globally, so we’re lacking that important data point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do know that Black Ops 7 (November 14) launched after Battlefield 6 (October 10), so had fewer days to count sales for the year. And then there’s the Game Pass factor. As a Microsoft game, Black Ops 7 launched day one on Game Pass, where it has trended high in terms of engagement since release. It is thought that Call of Duty’s day one release on Microsoft’s subscription service impacts sales, at the least on Xbox consoles, and perhaps also on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Black Ops 7 finished the year relatively strong. It was December’s best-selling game across physical and tracked digital spending, Circana said. 2025 marked the seventh consecutive year a Call of Duty game has been December’s best seller, with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate topping the chart in December 2018.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there can be no doubting Black Ops 7’s sales struggle compared to 2024’s Black Ops 6, a fact that's reflected in everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffers-terrible-launch-in-europe-with-63-fewer-copies-sold-than-battlefield-6-but-theres-important-context-to-consider"><u>European sales figures</u></a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games"><u>Activision's own admissions</u></a>. Following the release of Black Ops 7, Activision announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games"><u>significant changes</u></a> to the Call of Duty franchise, including promising never to release back to back games in the same sub-brand (Modern Warfare, Black Ops). Activision released Modern Warfare 2 in 2022, Modern Warfare 3 in 2023, Black Ops 6 in 2024, and Black Ops 7 in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bobby-kotick-claims-activision-call-of-duty-and-consoles-are-doing-so-poorly-it-proves-he-was-right-to-sell-activision-blizzard-to-microsoft-for-69-billion">former Activision boss Bobby Kotick claimed Call of Duty sales were down 60% year-on-year</a> — although he provided no evidence to back up his claim and neither Microsoft nor Activision Blizzard have commented in response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Battlefield 6, it's had struggles of its own since its explosive launch, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1">Season 2 delayed</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community">an apparent loss of moment on Steam</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever your take on the Call of Duty vs Battlefield sales war, Epic’s Fortnite led the year in total active users across both PlayStation and Xbox platforms, according to Circana’s Player</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Engagement Tracker, with over half of all active users of the two ecosystems engaging with Fortnite at least once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox was 2025’s leading publisher in digital at retail spending (including gift cards, code on receipts, etc.) for both December and the 2025 year. Digital at retail spending on Roblox during 2025 increased by 16% compared to 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision is expected to unveil this year’s Call of Duty game in the summer.

            <p>Pokémon developer Game Freak is working with multiple partner companies on its upcoming release, Beast of Reincarnation.</p>
<p>During last night's Xbox Developer Direct, Game Freak gave us all another look at Beast of Reincarnation, which takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan. In Beast of Reincarnation, players take the role of Emma the Sealer, who along with her canine companion Koo will need to confront the source of the world's corruption to save humanity.</p>

<p>Beast of Reincarnation all looks really rather promising, with many noting it was quite different and larger than Game Freak's other games outside of Pokémon. So, did the studio have to increase its numbers for the upcoming release? Well, not exactly. Rather, it has called in the help from a number of outside companies and fellow developers to get things going.</p>
<p>"The team is quite large, as you can imagine, but I will note that it's not all folks internally here at Game Freak," Beast of Reincarnation's game director told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game">IGN</a>.</p>
<p>"We managed to seek out a lot of partner companies to work with us, companies, studios that are able to realise the vision of this game in the way that we wanted to make it, so we're lucky to have a lot of people working on it externally as well."</p><p>A PR further clarified with the publication that Game Freak's internal team working on Beast of Reincarnation is actually "relatively small". However, that team is made up of those in core direction and management roles, and who are leading the project.</p>

            <p>
Following its slam-dunk first season, Amazon's TV adaption of Fallout has, according to reports earlier this year, faced a bit of a sophomore slump in terms of viewership. But despite an apparent dip in popularity, Amazon has now revealed enough people are still tuning into the show that it's officially Prime Video's sixth biggest season of all time.
</p>
<p>
Back <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-streaming-ratings-down">in January</a>, media valuation and data analytics company Nielsen reported that between 15th and 21st December, Fallout's season two premiere and eight earlier season one episodes managed to accumulate a combined 794m viewing minutes. That's a big number, but also well below the 2.9bn viewing minutes season one's eight episodes attracted in its opening week in April 2024. Further raising questions about Fallout's second season success is the fact Amazon - which was quick to talk up some impressive figures first time around - has been keeping quiet about the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
That, though, has now changed. While Amazon is still not talking specific viewership numbers, it's shared some comparative information giving at least some indication of just how well Fallout season two (which is being released weekly unlike season one, and which is yet to air its final two episodes) has so far done. As <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/fallout-season-2-viewership-update-explained-amazon-1236692296/">reported by Deadline</a>, Amazon is calling Fallout's latest instalment the top-performing season on Prime Video since Reacher Season 3, which debuted back in February 2025.
</p>
<p>
It's also being described as Prime Video's sixth biggest season of all time. That, if you're wondering, puts it behind the series' debut season, the first two seasons of Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, and Reacher's second and third seasons. And if we're purely talking Prime Video's most successful <em>returning</em> seasons, Fallout Season 2 comes in at fourth place.

"We are thrilled with the Fallout S2 reception from audiences and critics globally," Peter Friedlander, Amazon MGM Studios' head of global TV, said to Deadline. "After its first four weeks, Fallout S2 already ranks as the sixth most watched season ever on Prime Video and is even higher rated on Rotten Tomatoes than S1. More than half of the season's audience to-date has come from outside the US, and we're excited for even more viewers to discover the show as we continue to release new episodes over the weeks ahead."

Regardless of season two's success, Amazon has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">committed to a third season</a>, with production due to start on 1st May, 2026. And whatever happens beyond that, it's clear the company continues to have confidence in the Fallout property. It's already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-newly-announced-fallout-reality-show-will-plop-competitors-inside-a-vault-to-find-out-just-how-special-they-are">announced a reality show based on the Fallout games</a> that'll see contestants living inside a real-life Vault. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, as it's known, will run for 10 episodes when it eventually airs on Prime Video.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Fabraz and publisher Atari have revealed the <em>Bubsy 4D </em>release date, so if you think everyone's (least?) favorite bobcat deserves one more shot, then it's nearly time to put your money where your mouth is.</p><p>As revealed by Atari <a href="https://x.com/atari/status/2014345190346011105" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on social media</a>, <em>Bubsy 4D </em>will be arriving on PC and consoles on May 22nd, and if, for some reason, you'd like to pre-order the game, you can do so now on your platform of choice.</p><p>It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bubsy-bobcat-makes-his-grand-return-for-some-reason" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="db3d0244-1ad5-4c64-ad19-5f7ed0f148aa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">no secret</a> that <em>Bubsy </em>games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bubsy-woolies-strike-back-review-bubsy-is-still-bad" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef96e2fa-8978-4a24-b83d-f084a4633ecc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">aren't exactly well-received</a> by and large, but Fabraz, whose name you might recognize from 3D platformer <em>Demon Turf </em>and 2D offering <em>Slime-san</em>, is hoping it can change all that.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Could <em>Bubsy 4D </em>finally be the game to turn the franchise around?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This time around, Bubsy is making a return to 3D, which feels like a pretty ballsy move given how things went for the bobcat's last excursion into the third dimension.</p><p>As you'd probably expect (and as is probably necessary given <em>Bubsy</em>'s history), <em>Bubsy 4D </em>is taking a self-aware approach; Bubsy himself is returning to the fold after a long absence, and characters around him frequently question whether he's up to the job.</p><p>The game itself is a fairly straightforward 3D collectathon platformer in which Bubsy must navigate a series of "expansive craft-themed levels" and do battle with vicious BaaBots in order to recover his beloved Golden Fleece.</p><p>You can check out the new release date announcement trailer for <em>Bubsy 4D </em>right here. It gives a sense of what kind of gameplay you can expect if you decide to humor the bobcat one last time.</p>
<p>I've been talking smack about <em>Bubsy </em>for this whole piece, but I won't lie: I'm actually rooting for Fabraz and Atari on this one, because I played the <em>Bubsy 4D </em>demo, and it's...well, it's quite fun. Don't tell anyone I said that.</p><p>In any case, <em>Bubsy 4D </em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3237970/Bubsy_4D/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10016621" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/bubsy-4d/9P82VZJSZWGS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a>, and both Switch 2 and Switch on May 22nd. Stay tuned to find out whether it's actually decent like the demo.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
