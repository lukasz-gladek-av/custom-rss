			<p>Arkadium is an online games platform known for creating casual web browser games such as Mahjong, Bubble Shooters, and Crosswords. They have now launched a publishing service for <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-brings-1440p-resolution-and-120-fps-gameplay-for-pc-users-adds-six-new-games/">browser games</a>.</p>
<p>By doing this, they offer third-party publishing to browser-based developers, following their successful developer program, which opened in April. In addition to the third-party publishing, they have established a new $1 million fund to help developers and provide them with the resources needed to work on their projects.</p>
<p>Alongside this announcement, Arkadium has also announced that they have teamed up with Sony Pictures Entertainment to release an official Who Wants To Be A Billionaire? video game. In addition to the Who Wants To Be A Billionaire video game, they have announced six new titles being released under the new publishing arm.</p>
<p>This includes Categories and Room Escapes by Article 19, Element Blocks and Zoo Boom by Famobi, Multiplayer Chess Online by Foony and Ridella by Dylan Kappor.</p>
<p>Arkadium released a statement alongside this announcement: "Our new Arkadium publishing initiative builds on our 'Arkadium for Developers' program with even more support for game developers to succeed on browser," stated Arkadium's Director of Developer Relations, Dan Butchko.</p>
<p>"This is the next step in our continuing growth as the leader of the browser-based game sector as we build the world's best gaming platform alongside some of the most innovative and passionate game creators."</p>
<p>Browser games are often used by those who don't have access to a full gaming PC or those who are in school and use browser games to avoid doing their work. They are utilized in many situations, and Arkadium's opening up its company to third-party developers is a great sign of things to come for browser games. The firm offers a 75% revenue share model, with game creators all over the globe being allowed to submit their games to the Arkadium for Developers program.</p>
<p>Utilizing the<a href="https://corporate.arkadium.com/newsroom/arkadium-opens-its-vast-distribution-network-to-developers-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Arkadium for Developers</a> program, they hope to release 30 new titles over 2024, using the new initiative well.</p>

            <p>
Remedy Entertainment has released its latest <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-half-year-financial-report-january-june-2024-codename-condor-and-max-payne-12-remake-in-full-production-and-alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-launched/">half-year financial report</a>, detailing progress on some of its most anticipated titles - with its Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake confirmed to have entered full production, while "important" Control 2 features are now in "playable form".
</p>
<p>
Remedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-in-the-works-remedy-confirms">confirmed it was remaking cult-classic slo-mo shooters Max Payne 1 &amp; 2</a> back in 2022 as part of a collaboration with Rockstar, and the studio has sporadically offered updates since then. Last October brought the news the project had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-2-still-in-proof-of-concept-stage-as-max-payne-remake-enters-production-readiness">entered "production readiness"</a>, and things are now a further step closer to release as the game moves to "full production".
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Remedy says the development team "has been working towards developing the game to an early functional state from beginning to end."

<p>
Live-service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-details-control-live-service-multiplayer-spin-off">Control spin-off</a> Condor, now the only multiplayer game in the works at Remedy following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-developer-cancels-premium-co-op-multiplayer-codename-kestrel-despite-early-promise">cancellation of Codename Kestrel</a> earlier this year, has also reached full production, with "multiple maps and different mission types" in development. Remedy adds it's been stepping up its internal and limited external testing "for feature validation and feedback."
</p>
<p>
As for Control 2, the sequel to 2019's acclaimed weird office shooter, that's not at quite such an advanced stage. Right now, it's in "production readiness", and the team is said to have reached an key milestone in "delivering a build of the game showcasing several important features in playable form". Remedy is working towards scaling up production on the project, with "business negotiations" continuing.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in Remedy world, Alan Wake 2 still hasn't sold enough copies to begin generating royalties for Remedy despite launching to significant critical acclaim, but the studio notes it's now "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses". It also highlights "excellent" press reviews and fan feedback for this year's Night Springs expansion, and points toward the physical edition of Alan Wake 2 arriving this October.
</p>
<p>
That coincides with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-expansions-detailed-include-trip-inside-fictional-tv-show">Alan Wake 2's second DLC</a>, The Lake House, which sees players exploring a "mysterious facility situated on the shores of Cauldron Lake set up by an independent government organisation to conduct secret research... until something goes wrong".

But more interestingly, this recently released port adds full mod support to all platforms, letting anyone upload custom maps and mods to be played on Xbox and PlayStation. And uh, people are going wild with this feature, adding famous maps like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/b2Hx8RGxiPI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/b2Hx8RGxiPI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nuts.wad,</a></span> and a ton of IP-infringing mods that might not stick around long. </p><p>On Thursday, after work, I booted up the new<em> Doom + Doom II </em>port on my Xbox Series X and started checking out the mods that people had uploaded. At first, it was just a few things like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/sigil-ii&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/sigil-ii">Romero’s <em>SIGIL 2</em></a></span> and <em>Harmony</em>. Cool stuff, for sure, but nothing <em>too </em>weird. </p><p>But by the end of the night, I found a <em>Super Mario Bros </em>mod, multiple uploads of <em>Hexen</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-2-free-mods-myhouse-download-gzdoom-goty-1850616515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-2-free-mods-myhouse-download-gzdoom-goty-1850616515">the creepy (and recently created) myhouse.wad</a></span>, a few versions of nuts.wad, and even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://archive.org/details/harrisdoom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://archive.org/details/harrisdoom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a controversial map pack created</a></span> by one of the Columbine shooters. Someone has also uploaded a working version of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/NysJBmCVNJw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/NysJBmCVNJw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imp Encounter</a></span>,” aka the <em>Doom </em>map that infamously ends with the Doomguy having sex with an Imp enemy. So that’s now playable on Xbox, which is something I never expected.</p><p>As of Friday morning, all of these mods are still available to play on my Xbox. Just a few minutes ago, I booted up the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/116454-mariodoompk3-vanilla-edition-unofficial-patch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/116454-mariodoompk3-vanilla-edition-unofficial-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Super Mario Bros </em>mod</a></span>, which swaps out enemies, weapons, and sound effects from <em>Doom </em>with stuff from the Nintendo franchise. It’s pretty well-made and has been floating around the web since the early 2000s. </p><p>Another I checked out isn’t as well made and features <em>Simpsons </em>characters replacing demons. I’m not sure Nintendo or Disney will be happy to see either of these mods playable on Xbox or PlayStation. I have to assume that Bethesda is going to sweep through these mods soon and start removing some of this stuff. </p><p>To be clear, I don’t want that to happen. <em>Doom </em>modding has a long history of taking other franchises and characters and cramming them into the classic FPS. Some of the best and most-played mods in history mix and match different IPs in silly ways. It’s a core part of <em>Doom </em>modding. </p><p>But, I also expect Bethesda doesn’t want to upset any other companies or risk a lawsuit, so I doubt these mods survive for long. But hey, if you are quick enough, you can download some and check them out on Xbox or PlayStation and have some fun before the lawyers ruin everything. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-to-expect-the-next-college-football-25-title-updates/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>College Football 25 just received its second title update of the year — the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-gets-first-major-title-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first major one</a>, however — on Thursday, August 8. Of course, that won’t be the last major update to come to the first college football game in 11 years.</p>



<p>While EA Sports hasn’t confirmed when future title updates are coming, we do have an idea thanks to a <a href="https://x.com/trayj08/status/1821684374435217857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twitter post</a> from the Virginia Cavaliers deputy athletics director Tyler Jones.</p>







<p>According to Jones, who spoke with EA about updates to Virginia’s stadium in the game, College Football 25’s third title update is “scheduled 45 days after the original launch”. That would put the release around August 29, just before the start of the real college football season.</p>



<p>He then mentioned the fifth title update, which is scheduled for 90 days after launch. That would put it around October 17 if it remains on schedule.</p>



<p>Based on the timeline Jones gave in his post, College Football 25 should receive five title updates within the first three months. It’s unlikely that any future updates will be as large in scale as August 8th’s, but it’s still nice to know what a tentative schedule is like. Also, there will continue to be various small patches in between the larger title updates as issues arise that need urgent addressing.</p>



<p>College Football 25 is available now for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

Such heroes include Goku, Vegeta, Future Trunks, Piccolo, Krillin, Android 18, and Majin Buu. The will also feature series villains spanning Dragon Ball’s mythos like Cooler from Dragon Ball Z, and Dragon Ball Super’s Zamasu and Vermoud. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— DRAGON BALL PROJECT : Multi (@db_prjmulti) <a href="https://twitter.com/db_prjmulti/status/1821458190728626634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>According to its <a href="https://dbpm.bn-ent.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official website</u></a>, the game will be playable on Google Play, The App Store, and Steam. Along with Dragon Ball Project: Multi’s reveal, the company also announced its regional beta test, which will last from August 20 to September 3. </p><p>Like any MOBA, Dragon Ball Project: Multi will require players to conquer enemy objectives by organizing a well-rounded team comprised of tanks, support, and damage characters. The game will also offer customization options, allowing players to swap skins, entrance, and finisher animations. Because Dragon Ball Project: Ulti is mainly geared toward online matches, players will be required to have an internet connection to play. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>DRAGON BALL PROJECT: Multi - Official Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Dragon Ball fans appear to be in a bit of a renaissance with the imminent return of the Budokai series in Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-is-like-controlling-a-battle-from-the-anime">our preview</a>, we lauded the game for its battles feeling like they were lifted right out of the anime, saying, “Even after just a dozen or so matches against the CPU, it became clear to me that Dragon Ball superfans who are exceptionally good at fighting games – or those who intend to practice a lot with Sparking Zero – are going to find themselves having a great time crushing their competition.” </p><p>Seeing as how we’re roughly nine weeks away from Sparking! Zero’s release on October 11, Dragon Ball Project: Multi has the latent potential to be a refreshing new game for players to test their Z-fighter battle senses.   </p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

But hey, you can also check out the original Star Wars: Battlefront II and the great 2006 RTS Star Wars: Empire at War.</p><h2>Star Wars Collection</h2><ul><li>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</li><li>Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</li><li>Star Wars: Republic Commando</li><li>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</li><li>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II</li><li>Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</li><li>Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</li><li>Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II</li><li>Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith</li><li>Star Wars: Dark Forces</li><li>Star Wars: Empire at War</li><li>Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005)</li><li>Star Wars: Starfighter</li><li>Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes</li></ul><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/lego-new-releases-august-2024-mario-star-wars-marvel-minecraft-batman/2900-5655/">Over 100 Lego Sets Released This Month - Here Are The Biggest Ones</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-18-lego-video-games-for-only-15-marvel-batman-lotr-star-wars-and-more/1100-6525462/">Get 18 Lego Video Games For Only $15 - Marvel, Batman, LOTR, Star Wars, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-world-lego-set-preorder-mario-and-yoshi/1100-6525283/">Super Mario World Lego Set Is Up For Preorder At Target</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/7-new-lego-minecraft-sets-are-available-now-including-the-iconic-crafting-table/1100-6523896/">7 New Lego Minecraft Sets Are Available Now, Including The Iconic Crafting Table</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-lite-bundle-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-only-159-at-walmart/1100-6522718/">Nintendo Switch Lite Bundle With Animal Crossing: New Horizons Is Only $159 At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-back-to-school-sale-2024-ps5-games-playstation-vr-ps5-slim-deals/2900-5638/">PlayStation Back To School Sale: Save Over 50% On PS5 Exclusives, $200 On PSVR 2, And $50 On Consoles</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-drops-to-best-price-yet-alongside-more-great-ps5-game-deals/1100-6525363/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Drops To Best Price Yet Alongside More Great PS5 Game Deals</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Disney might be getting its own dedicated store within Fortnite, and it could be announced very soon.</p><p>A leaked image has surfaced online showing what appears to be a separate store section for Disney and Marvel skins that Fortnite has had thus far. The reason for Disney and Epic for going down this route is unclear, but it's possible that due to the many collaborations between them, perhaps they wanted to make their skins more readily available.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1821930442758733912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1821930442758733912%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">RUMOR: FIRST LOOK AT AN UPCOMING DISNEY ITEM SHOP 🔥<br>This image was sent to <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HYPEX</a> &amp; me earlier today.

Coincidentally, Fortnite is making a big change to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ends-exclusivity-for-future-battle-passes/1100-6525606/" data-ref-id="1100-6525606">battle-pass structure</a>. Starting with the upcoming Chapter 5 Season 4 battle pass, items will not be exclusive to the season they belong to.</p><p>Additionally, Disney pumped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-it-invested-1-5-billion-into-fortnite-and-what-it-hopes-to-achieve/1100-6525584/" data-ref-id="1100-6525584">$1.5 billion into Fortnite back in February</a>, which makes the revelation of a apparently separate store for Disney IP much more interesting.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, it's full steam ahead for the Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-is-remaking-max-payne-1-and-2-for-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6502260/" data-ref-id="1100-6502260">Originally revealed in 2022</a>, the remakes will combine Max Payne and Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne into a single package for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Remedy is working with Rockstar and utilizing the Northlight game engine for the title, which was previously used for Control.</p><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, the Control multiplayer spin-off game called Codename Condor is now seeing "external playtesting for feature validation and feedback." Remedy also points out "multiple maps" and various missions for the title.</p><p dir="ltr">Another multiplayer game that was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-dev-cancels-multiplayer-game-before-it-was-even-announced/1100-6523223/" data-ref-id="1100-6523223">in the works at Remedy codenamed Kestrel was canceled earlier this year</a>.</p>

There's something deeply appealing about this style of game for me as a sort of warm-up to my day (and nice place to check in on and chill out with during the work day), and thus far, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Garden Path</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is scratching that itch well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's much more </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cozy Grove</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> than anything else in cozy sim territory, but with a fairly different tone and much more emphasis on gardening vs. other kinds of crafting. We have the requisite chill questing on behalf of cute characters, lots of checking up on plant life, foraging, fishing (though there is a different minigame afoot for actually catching them) and here, the gardening. But there's one particularly wonderful design decision that caught my eye the second I encountered it: the way the game rewards your progress. Instead of a cute journal or notebook like the aforementioned games, your achievements are marked by stars in the sky.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Garden Path to the stars">The Garden Path to the stars</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first time I brewed a cup of tea at a forest firepit (itself an adorable system that has gameplay value), the camera turned up towards the sky and showed me my first star, awarded for making that first cuppa. Stars are linked in constellations, lending cottagecore vibes that fit well with the game's aesthetic and evoking the best part of camping or spending time outdoors on a summer night: looking up at the cosmos. Other games of its ilk have hinted at the universe above: sky reflections and star fragments, objects with astronomical flair, and so on. But I do very much want to look up and star gaze when I'm in these peaceful worlds, and this gives me the chance to do just that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also evokes a certain brilliant and perhaps forgotten aspect of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario 64</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where earning a star (in a less literal sense) came with a sometimes-vague hint about how to grab another one (or a few others, depending on how you go about the game). </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Garden Path</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> uses the system to hint at other star achievements, in a way that feels satisfying and even a tiny bit mysterious, like a lightly signposted adventure game puzzle.

            <p>Valve looks to be introducing a new filter system to help players sift out user reviews not deemed "helpful."</p>
<p>As spotted by a member of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1emb4ch/valve_is_finally_addressing_bad_reviews_issue/">Steam subreddit</a>, Valve appears to have briefly activated a "helpfulness system" that essentially hid joke or silly reviews from view.</p>

<p>The system has already been deactivated again, so it looks as though the feature is still under review, but a user was able to snap a screenshot whilst the trial (or premature launch) was live.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the "learn more" link apparently took players to a non-existent blog post, adding credence to speculation that this feature is still in development.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to know who will be the arbiter of "helpful", though, as this is currently one of Elden's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/rinjvonscoot/recommended/1245620/">highest-rated reviews</a> with over 400 helpful votes: "Nothing in this game was as brutal as the moment when my son saw me fighting [a boss] and started cheering for [the boss]. 10/10."</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Steam has updated how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-improves-how-demos-appear-and-behave-in-your-library-and-the-steam-store">demos "appear and behave" within the Steam library</a>.</p>
<p>Valve said last month that with "thousands of playable demos launching on Steam every year, and millions of players trying them out, we've noticed some trends in feedback from both developers and players about the process and functionality. We've put together an update based on that feedback".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In Japan, an esports tournament called ‘Sleep Fighter’ has surfaced. It has a bizarre concept attached to it that sees players strap on a sleep monitoring device when they go to bed, and if they don’t get enough sleep, they’re penalised in the tournament. It’s a competition being played on the Street Fighter platform (hence the pun), and it’s being sponsored by SS Pharmaceuticals, which is linking the event with an initiative called the ‘Active Sleep Project’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-not-a-bad-thing">It’s Not A Bad Thing</h2>



<p>Gamers are notorious for not taking the best care of themselves – which is why his tournament isn’t the worst idea in the world.</p>



<p>In a statement, representatives of SS Pharmaceuticals explained why the Active Sleep Project is so important to everyone – not just gamers:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By actively sleeping, you can make the most of each day and live your life to the fullest. In order to bring this ‘active sleep’ to as many people as possible, we are starting the Active Sleep Project to do our best to support those who are taking on the challenge of sleeping.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the week leading up to Sleep Fighter, players will be monitored when they head to bed, and they’ll need to get at least six hours of sleep a night. If they underdeliver, they’ll be docked points when the tournament goes live. It’s a team-based effort, so one poor sleeper could negatively impact their teammates.</p>



<p>The tournament goes live on August 31. In another twist, it was revealed that attendees to the event will need to win a lottery to qualify for a limited spot in the crowd at the Ryogoku KFC Hall in Tokyo.</p>



<p>Would you be able to succeed at this challenge, or do you hate sleeping?</p>

<p>In a new report <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/771/G077171/20240809033/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by 4gamer</a>, new images of Sonic x Shadow Generations tease a modern render of popular antagonist Black Doom and the Sky Sanctuary stage.</p>



<p>The villainous Black Doom first appeared in Shadow the Hedgehog, which released nearly 20 years ago. Fans largely praised the first image of Black Doom’s updated iteration and polished details. </p>



<p>The other two fresh images of Sonic x Shadow Generations include a wide shot of Sonic cruising down a rail in Sky Sanctuary, and speeding across some interior platforms. Longtime Sonic community contributor TailsChannel also posted the new screenshots on X.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Black Doom was leader of the Black Arms, bent on invading Earth and using humanity as livestock. Sonic fans may best recognize Sky Sanctuary as the popular zone from Sonic &amp; Knuckles, an ancient temple floating in the clouds.</p>



<p>Last week, Sega confirmed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-price-and-game-size-disclosed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price and game size</a> for Sonic x Shadow Generations after the store page went live. The Standard Edition will cost $49.99, and its file size will be 13.1 GB. </p>



<p>Sega <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-shadow-generations-revealed-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced</a> Sonic x Shadow Generations during PlayStation’s State of Play from January 2024. It later got a new trailer during Summer Game Fest this year, confirming the release date. </p>



<p>Sonic x Shadow Generations launches on October 25, 2024. It will be available on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox, including last-gen consoles.</p>

What's surprising is that revenue from Grow Solutions (Unity's app monetization division, which houses what used to be IronSource and TapJoy) declined 9 percent year over year to $296 million. In a letter to shareholders, newly-installed CEO Matthew Bromberg cast a positive light on the news, saying the division had seen steady quarter-over-quarter growth, meaning it could make up that gap in the months ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Create Solutions, the main hub for the Unity game engine, did see revenue growth despite the Runtime Fee fracas.
