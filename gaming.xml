You press one button and you take on a series of bosses. It’s a simple premise that developer Midnight Munchies delivers on and then some. With just one button, you might think that the game would get boring quickly or lack depth—but it’s just the opposite. <em>One Btn Bosses</em> is an enthralling game that constantly adds new challenges to master.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196307" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="657" data-playlist="196307,196789,195410" data-current="196307"><div><p>10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21857.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I already explained the premise and it truly doesn’t go much further than that. Each level gives you control of a moving object stuck on a track. The one button you use changes your direction of movement along the track (which can be shaped like a circle, square, a straight line, and more) so as to get out of the way of oncoming attacks from enemies. You also have the ability to attack, but with your singular input already taken by directional control, <em>One Btn Bosses</em> ties attacks to movement speed. The faster you move, the more projectiles you fire back at your opponent; switching directions lowers your speed, after which point it must be built up again. This creates a balancing act in the deceptively simple game. You have to avoid hazards but you also want to make quick work of enemies, which means you have to strategically choose exactly when to shift direction in order to maintain your highest speed as long as possible.</p><p>Staying true to its name, <em>One Btn Bosses</em> never gives you more than a single input, but each level still changes things up thanks to differences in enemy attack patterns. At the start you’ll face enemies who just shoot projectiles back at you, but over time they’ll start launching bombs with large areas of effect, missiles that home in on you, and special bullets that ricochet around a track—and that’s only a few of the tactics you can expect to encounter. It turns what could be a repetitive gameplay loop into a frantic fight for your life. Not long into the game, you’re faced with situations in which the screen is almost entirely filled with attacks you have to avoid with just one button at your disposal. But to give you a fighting chance, <em>One Btn Bosses</em> does offer up alternatives to your basic direction switch.<br></p><p>By collecting GP (Grind Points) after completing levels, you slowly unlock different abilities to equip that change what your button press does. One early skill you acquire can switch out your basic directional movement for a dash that lets you speed through attacks instead of having to turn around to avoid them. But new abilities don’t just alter how you move; they can also change how you attack, replacing your bullets with a laser or allowing you to bounce enemy attacks back. Midnight Munchies boasts that there are over 100 combinations of abilities to try out. However, the game’s levels feel tailored to the basic setup you start with. I spent a lot of time trying other skills, and really liked how the dash felt in certain levels, but I found myself returning to the default abilities often as they felt best suited for every challenge.</p><figure id="" data-id="d8b247ffb63d87073bf24b05ffb6002d" data-recommend-id="image://d8b247ffb63d87073bf24b05ffb6002d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A yellow ship runs along a track and avoids large pink hazards" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A yellow ship runs along a track and avoids large pink hazards" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Midnight Munchies / Outersloth</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d8b247ffb63d87073bf24b05ffb6002d" data-recommend-id="image://d8b247ffb63d87073bf24b05ffb6002d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A yellow ship runs along a track and avoids large pink hazards" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>One Btn Bosses</em> has a short, four-hour campaign that’s mostly an extended tutorial to get you into the game’s headspace. There’s a cute—if basic and unimportant—plot about working your way up the cutthroat corporate ladder, but gameplay is king here. That’s why <em>One Btn Bosses</em>’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-guess-i-actually-like-roguelikes-now-1845131675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-guess-i-actually-like-roguelikes-now-1845131675">roguelike</a></span> mode might be the best thing about it. Once unlocked in the first fifteen minutes or so, you can dive into roguelike levels at any time. As per genre conventions, you run through a series of levels and unlock random skills after each boss to use on the next level. While abilities don’t always seem that useful in the campaign, the roguelike mode makes using and mastering each new skill fun. <em>One Btn Bosses</em> is all about momentum and the roguelike mode perfectly distills that. Yet even when going through the campaign, the game’s tight level design never ceases to amaze.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last week, it was announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-informer-is-shutting-down-after-33-years/1100-6525508/">Game Informer would be closing its doors</a> after 33 years in operation, a decision made by the site's parent company, GameStop. Shortly thereafter, a former staffer used the publication's official Twitter account to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-game-informer-staffer-offers-an-actual-farewell-be-well-play-well/1100-6525532/">offer a "genuine goodbye,"</a> but Game Informer's Twitter account was deleted within minutes of the post. Now, former editor-in-chief Matt Miller has taken to Twitter to share his own official goodbye message with readers and former colleagues alike.</p><p dir="ltr">"33 years is a long time," Miller stated. "When thinking about saying goodbye to Game Informer, I felt that a few days of consideration were warranted to get my thoughts in order. I’m glad I waited. The outpouring of affection, support, and appreciation the team has received in recent days is humbling, it has reminded me how much this long-running magazine has meant to so many."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/MatthewRMiller/status/1821219698886713829" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I've never been big into posting social media, preferring to let our official channels speak for themselves.

"I still love games, and I hope to find a new way to stay connected to them through my work."</p><p dir="ltr">Game Informer first launched in August 1991, and was acquired by GameStop in 2000. According to the publication's displaced staff, employees were informed of GameStop's decision to shut down Game Informer the same day it was announced to the public.

<p dir="ltr">Six characters will make up the playtest's roster: Ahri, Braum, Darius, Ekko, Illaoi, and Yasuo. Each will be unlocked from the start, but Riot says future playtests may require players to unlock additional fighters through missions or with credits. There will be four stages to choose from, as well as a battle pass for players to progress through that includes skins for Ahri and Yasua alongside additional rewards like currency, avatar emotes, stickers, and other customization options. Casual and private matches will be available with cross-play enabled for those playing in the same region. A tutorial, as well as a training mode, will also be playable. This playtest will not include an offline or local play option.</p><p dir="ltr">The Alpha Lab playtest will be the first good look at how 2XKO handles its in-game lobbies, and will see players creating customizable chibi avatars that can be used to run around a virtual arcade filled with 2XKO cabinets, similar to lobby systems seen in games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/street-fighter-6/" data-ref-id="5000-558635">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"We think playing with friends and making new ones is an amazing part of the fighting game experience, so our lobbies are built to bring that vibe to an online space," Riot says.</p><p dir="ltr">None of the progress made towards the Alpha Lab playtest battle pass or currency earned will carry forward to future playtests, of which Riot says there will be more later this year. At the end of the playtest, players will receive a feedback survey the developer is encouraging every participant to fill out.</p><p dir="ltr">"Testing at this stage will give us time to incorporate feedback before launch," Riot says. "Basically, this is your chance to actually shape 2XKO with your notes."</p><p dir="ltr">2XKO is being planned for a 2025 launch, and it's looking to bring some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2xko-looks-to-bring-tag-based-fighting-games-into-a-new-era/1100-6525311/" data-ref-id="1100-6525311">major changes to the tag-based fighter formula</a>, including its support for up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-l-league-of-legends-fighting-game-lets-you-play-2v2-with-four-players/1100-6516321/" data-ref-id="1100-6516321">four players in its 2v2 matches</a>.

Fortunate Star is a new bow with perks that can make it very effective in PvE play, especially if you're using Void or Prismatic builds that take advantage of Void debuffs. Here's everything you need to know about Fortunate Star, from where to get it to what rolls you want to chase.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Fortunate_Star">How To Get Fortunate Star</a></li><li><a href="#Fortunate_Star_God_Rolls">Fortunate Star God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Fortunate_Star_PvE_God_Roll">Fortunate Star PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Fortunate_Star_PvP_God_Roll">Fortunate Star PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Fortunate_Star">How To Get Fortunate Star</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortunate Star is specifically part of the Solstice loot pool, which means you won't get it from playing other activities. The quickest and easiest way to get one is by taking part in Bonfire Bash activities. You'll have a chance to get Fortunate Stars as you complete each run, alongside other Solstice weapons like Compass Rose, Something New, and Crowning Duologue.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also chances to get Fortunate Stars from Solstice packages, which you can earn from completing Solstice and Forge bounties as part of the event and from completing certain Triumphs on the Solstice event card. Generally, though, you're going to get tons of Fortunate Stars from Bonfire Bash, which should make chasing good rolls easy enough.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4346529-20240806172120_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346529" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4346529-20240806172120_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346529"></a><figcaption>Fortunate Star</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4346529-20240806172120_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortunate_Star_God_Rolls">Fortunate Star God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Fortunate_Star_PvE_God_Roll">Fortunate Star PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bowstring</strong>: Polymer Bowstring / Agile Bowstring  <ul><li dir="ltr">Polymer Bowstring: +5 Accuracy, +10 Charge Time, -36 Draw Time</li><li dir="ltr">Agile Bowstring: +15 Handling, +5 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Arrow</strong>: Fiberglass Arrow Shaft / Compact Arrow Shaft  <ul><li dir="ltr">Fiberglass Arrow Shaft: +15 Accuracy, -5 Stability</li><li dir="ltr">Compact Arrows Shaft: +10 Handling, +10 Reload Speed</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Repulsor Brace  <ul><li dir="ltr">Defeating a Void-debuffed target grants an overshield.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Destabilizing Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Final blows cause nearby targets to become Volatile.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Draw Time / Handling</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can get a couple of decent combinations with Fortunate Star, but the most useful one is going to be a Void-centric roll best utilized with Void and Prismatic builds. That means you want Destabilizing Rounds and Repulsor Brace, which give the one-two punch of turning enemies Volatile and then rewarding you with an overshield for killing them. Alongside a Void or Prismatic build that utilizes invisibility or Devour, you can get a lot of awesome synergy from this role.</p><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, a combination like Successful Warmup or Archer's Tempo and Golden Tricorn will speed the Draw Time on Fortunate Star while boosting its damage. Coupled with a focus on Draw Time in the bowstring, arrows, and Masterwork, you can get the bow firing relatively quickly. A better focus might be the Handling stat, though, which you can boost up all the way to 100, making Fortunate Star very smooth to use with other weapons for a more rounded build.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Fortunate_Star_PvP_God_Roll">Fortunate Star PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bowstring</strong>: Polymer Bowstring  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Accuracy, +10 Charge Time, -36 Draw Time</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Arrow</strong>: Fiberglass Arrow Shaft  <ul><li dir="ltr">+15 Accuracy, -5 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Hip-Fire Grip / Archer's Tempo  <ul><li dir="ltr">Hip-Fire Grip: Increases accuracy, stability, and precision-hit targeting when firing from the hip.</li><li dir="ltr">Archer's Tempo: Precision hits decrease Draw Time by 25% for 3 seconds.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Archer's Gambit  <ul><li dir="ltr">Hip-fire precision hits grant a massive draw-speed bonus for a short period of time.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Draw Time</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Fortunate Star is best used in PvE with its Void synergy, but it has some decent PvP rolls as well. Combining Hip-Fire Grip and Archer's Gambit gives you some serious benefits if you can land hits when firing from the hip--you get a boost to accuracy and then a major boost to draw time, allowing you to fire fast and land hits quickly. Alternatively, Archer's Tempo can do the job without requiring you to fire from the hip exclusively, and can be great when paired with Precision Instrument to help you land headshots and win duels.</p><p dir="ltr">Generally, you want to focus on decreasing the draw time of Fortunate Star and increasing its accuracy with your bowstring, arrow, and Masterwork choices, as well, to make this as accurate a weapon as possible that you can fire as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p>
Epic Games has announced it's ditching a long-standing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> promise that Battle Pass items will never be made available to buy at a later date - although it's implementing an 18-month wait period before items can appear in its in-game shop.
</p>
<p>
It's a rule Epic has been accused of breaking before, specifically when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-fans-furious-summer-drift-style-being-sold">released a beachwear version of Fortnite's season 5 poster boy Drift</a> for purchase in 2019 - but the practice of releasing paid variants of previous Battle Pass characters has become commonplace in the years since.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, Epic is ditching the rule entirely so that any item released as part of a Battle Pass in the future can be sold in the Fortnite Shop, provided 18 months have passed since the Battle Pass' release. "This change lets us continue investing in new and exciting Battle Pass rewards" the developer wrote in a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/change-to-item-exclusivity-in-future-fortnite-battle-passes">blog post</a>, "while enabling players down the road to also enjoy the content, including Outfits based on popular licensed characters."

<p>
Epic notes there's "no guarantee" a Battle Pass item will come to the Fortnite Shop following these changes to its exclusivity rules, adding it'll let players know if it releases a future Battle Pass item that'll "never" appear in the shop.
</p>
<p>
An accompanying FAQ confirms the rule changes apply to all Battle Pass items, meaning Outfits, Back Blings, Pickaxes, Emotes, Instruments, Decals, Wraps, Loading Screens, Banner Icons, and more. Bonus Rewards and Quest Rewards, as well as items earned from mid-season Battle Pass quests, will also be eligible to purchase after 18 months - as will any item alt Styles, but the number available may vary each time the item comes to the shop.
</p>
<p>
Epic adds the changes will not impact the pricing of Fortnite's Battle Passes, which will continue to cost 950 V-Bucks and provide the opportunity to earn 1500 V-Bucks by levelling up.
</p>
<p>
In other news, developer Mediatonic's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fall-guys-is-now-in-fortnite">bean-based battle royale Fall Guys now exists within Fortnite</a>, some nine months after the UK studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fall-guys-developer-hit-hard-by-epic-games-layoffs-but-studio-to-remain-open">severely impacted</a> by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-is-reportedly-laying-off-900-employees">job cuts at Epic Games</a> that ultimately affected 830 workers. Epic insists it currently doesn't "have anything to announce" when asked if it plans to move <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>' development solely into Fortnite.

While there’s nothing that particularly makes it stand out from the crowd, the film is enjoyable from start to finish and has decent pacing throughout. Jack Black is also a comedic powerhouse.  Aside from some corny flashback scenes and acting decisions that don’t always land, <em>Borderlands</em> is nothing to complain about but nothing to rejoice over.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Ki11ersix/status/1821185478043037947&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Ki11ersix/status/1821185478043037947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Borderlands </em>content creator Killer Six said</a></span> the movie was “better” than they expected, adding: “The plot is kinda a mess in true <em>Borderlands </em>fashion, but the humor and heart are there. Lots of fan service moments, but ultimately I don’t know if it will resonate. 6.75/10"</p><p>So yeah, it sounds like the <em>Borderlands </em>movie isn’t very good. I’ll be curious to see how it fares at the box office, especially with the big, similar action-comedy movie <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> already in theaters and doing very well. Will <em>Borderlands</em> continue the recent trend of video game adaptions being pretty good and successful, or will it burn out and flop? We’ll know soon enough. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a big part of developer BioWare’s marketing for the upcoming <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, which will <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102">include romantic routes</a></span> for each of its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857">seven companions</a></span>. With romance comes sex scenes, and those are always a pillar of what BioWare fans have come to expect in their love stories.<br></p><p>So with <em>The Veilguard </em>on its way this fall, we figured we’d look back at sex and romance in the <em>Dragon Age </em>series and see who is the best lover in Thedas. We’re ranking each game separately, so we’re starting with 2014’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-the-kotaku-review-1659833205&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-the-kotaku-review-1659833205"><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em></a></span>, which had some of the more elaborate sex scenes BioWare had ever put out at that time. Let’s see which member of the Inquisition knows how to lay down pipe.</p></div></div><div><p>The only reason <em>Inquisition</em>’s elven mage ranks at the bottom of the list of bangin’ is because he doesn’t have a sex scene. In fact, his romantic relationship is the only one that doesn’t reach a, well, climax. Solas breaks things off with the Inquisitor before things get hot and heavy. In the <em>Trespasser </em>DLC, he lays bare (sorry) that he didn’t want things to go that far while still hiding the truth of his nature as the elven trickster god the Dread Wolf. Thanks, I guess? Sorry to the Solasmancers for your decade-long slow burn. Wishing you well in <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>this fall.<br></p></div><div><p>It’s pretty fitting that Josephine’s love scene is one of the more tame ones in <em>Inquisition</em>. She’s meant to be the group’s prim and proper political face, and her romance follows suit. So while it might not be as steamy as the rest of this list, it’s still delightful watching her come to the realization that the Inquisitor harbors feelings for her. The scene’s writing has the cadence of a poem as the Inquisitor and Josephine flirt and wax on about each other, then solidify it with a kiss. The closest Josie gets to a sex scene is a cuddle by the fire that could likely have led to something else. But you get no points for implications around these parts.<br></p></div><div><p>Blackwall, or somebody going by that name, has a romance full of broody angst as he attempts to prevent the Inquisitor from getting too close. But like all will they/won’t they love stories, that makes the eventual culmination of the relationship all the sweeter. When it comes to doing the deed, Blackwall tries to dissuade the Inquisitor once more, telling her there’s no future with him as a Grey Warden, as his time is inherently much more limited than the average person. He’s not worthy of her. She can do so much better. They <em>shouldn’t</em>. But they <em>should</em> and will. Then he climbs on top of her in the biggest, puffiest, awkward coat. Blackwall’s angst is delectable, but he loses points for dipping without any pillow talk.<br></p></div><div><p>I find Sera’s romance scene to be a breath of fresh air compared to the dramatic gravitas and sexy flirtatiousness of others in <em>Inquisition</em>—it’s the one that recognizes sex can be silly and stupid, too. Sera’s sex scene begins with the Inquisitor trying to find a present for her elven lover after gifted gave her. You spend time walking around your base at Skyhold asking for advice on what to give her. Vivienne, ever the ideas woman, will suggest the Inquisitor shave her pubic hair into some crude shape. If you do this and bring her back to your quarters to show her, the Inquisitor tells Sera that she went all around the Inquisition asking for suggestions. The mere idea that the party knows that she and Sera are together is enough to delight her. It’s a surprisingly sweet admission that being known and seen as the Inquisitor’s partner is enough of a gift for her, especially from a character who typically approaches situations with snark and irony-poisoned indifference. The two start going at it, then we see Sera remarking on the pubic hair art the Inquisitor has made for herself. She laughs about it so hard she falls off the bed. It’s great!<br></p></div><div><p>Dorian Pavus’ sex scene can go one of two ways. The Tevinter mage either will slink into his lover’s quarters, say that he’s bored of the chit-chat, and wants to move onto something more “primal.” His sultry voice whispers at the Inquisitor’s ear and asks “how bad” he wants to be. If you choose to indulge, Dorian starts aggressively kissing the Inquisitor and the two go to town. Or, if you choose to slow things down a bit, Dorian is bewildered by this and says they’ve been “chaste” by his standards. It’s clear Dorian’s used to the breakneck pace of a gay man’s sex life in a populated city and unfamiliar with someone wanting to get to know him and be in a relationship. This approach may keep you from having sex at that very moment, but if that’s how you want to roleplay, that’s your prerogative. But I do think reaching the relationship is much better written, acted, and directed as a scene when you choose to have at it. Plus, you get to see his butt that way, and it’s a good one.<br></p></div><div><p>The Cullen romance ticks so many boxes that I almost wish I could explore it myself, but I’m a loyal king to my one true love, Dorian. So instead I just have to admire it from afar. Like Blackwall, Cullen’s romance is full of angst, as you’re trying to fix a broken man. Then you fuck on his office desk, and he knocks all that work shit off and onto the floor. It’s hot, but what’s hotter is what comes after. You fall asleep together and he starts having a nightmare about his tortured past watching all the traumatic things that happened in the <em>Dragon Age </em>series unfold. Then you’re like “oh, I can fix this man,” and your relationship becomes all about helping him overcome his demons. This is an AO3 user’s wet dream. Now if only we could <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shitty-dragon-age-voice-actor-has-me-considering-deleti-1845854728&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shitty-dragon-age-voice-actor-has-me-considering-deleti-1845854728">redub it with a different actor</a></span>.<br></p></div><div><p>One of Seeker Cassandra Pentaghast’s best quirks is her love of poetry and showboaty romantic gestures. So when her sex scene begins with the Inquisitor surprising her in a forest while he’s reading poetry, you know she is about to go from a hardened warrior to twitterpated girl at a moment’s notice. The scene is so saccharine and cheesy but, by god, it fucking works. The way she shoves the Inquisitor as he circles her and turns the pages of his book of ballads as she blushes? How he walks up behind her as she steals the book and reads a passage of her own, the quickness with which they abandon the performance and then just jump each other’s bones on the dirty forest ground, it’s all perfect. The two finish the night stargazing and wondering about the future. You’re free to either lean into or kill the mood from there. But the Inquisitor has game in this scene. Y’all ate that shit up, heterosexuals.<br></p></div><div><p>The Qunari warrior Iron Bull has two major sex scenes in <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, and if we were to rank them separately, they’d both be the top scenes on this list. The first is one where Iron Bull establishes that he doesn’t believe the Inquisitor is ready to “ride the bull.” If you insist you are, he holds your wrists together and pins you against the wall. “Last chance,” he whispers. Then he gives you what you asked for. As he leaves, spymaster Leliana approaches the bedroom to give the Inquisitor some intel before the Iron Bull tells her to let hero “rest” after what transpired. The couple has a follow-up conversation in which you establish the ground rules of your BDSM relationship. He’s dominant, knows what you need, and after leading the Inquisition throughout Thedas, maybe you require someone to tell you what to do from time to time.</p><p>The second, perhaps most important scene in the Iron Bull romance is the one in which Cullen, Josephine, and Cassandra walk one-by-one into the aftermath of one of your trists, remarking at the size of that thang. Good for you, Iron Bull. Maybe don’t <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/olympic-pole-vaulter-breaks-silence-after-his-own-pole-broke-the-internet_n_66b27dcfe4b0b3da47531f05&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/olympic-pole-vaulter-breaks-silence-after-his-own-pole-broke-the-internet_n_66b27dcfe4b0b3da47531f05" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try to do any pole vaulting</a></span> at the Thedas Olympics.</p><hr><p>If you’ve never played a <em>Dragon Age</em> game, <em>Inquisition </em>is probably <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846">the most required reading</a></span> before <em>The Veilguard </em>launches this year. Despite some widely-remembered issues like its open world bloat, I still think it’s probably BioWare’s best story across its history. That shit holds up real well. I might be due for a replay before <em>The Veilguard</em>. I gotta kiss Dorian before I start playing a different hero in the new game this fall.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ferrari has just announced plans to open an esports arena in Abu Dhabi later this month, on August 29. In a post on social media, the team invited esports fans to ‘step into the driver’s seat and brace for a new era in virtual racing’. The Ferrari Esports Arena is a brand-first, and it comes equipped with a whopping <strong>twenty </strong>state-of-the-art driving simulators as well as a range of professional gaming stations.</p>

<h2 id="h-modern-gaming">Modern Gaming</h2>



<p>Ferrari isn’t the first motor brand to engage in the world of esports, and it certainly won’t be the last, but this is a huge investment that’s a sure step in the right direction. With ‘simracing’ and driving-based esports experiencing a boom, Ferrari has capitalised on the growth and built a stunning esports arena in Abu Dhabi. </p>

</div></figure>







<p>In a statement, Faisal Al Nuaimi, the GM at ‘Ferrari World Yas Island’ said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are thrilled to introduce our latest innovation. This state-of-the-art facility is designed to&nbsp;immerse&nbsp;visitors in the exhilarating world of virtual racing like never before. Our goal is to continuously enhance the park’s offerings, catering to diverse preferences and ensuring there is always something new to experience at the world’s leading&nbsp;theme park.</p>



<p>This new attraction emphasises our commitment to strengthening tourism in&nbsp;Abu Dhabi&nbsp;and beyond, aligning with the city’s tourism objectives. Whether you’re a seasoned gamer or a first-time visitor, we strive to deliver an unparalleled mix of technology, realism and thrilling competitions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ferrari World has existed in Abu Dhabi since 2010, and in that time, it has welcomed hundreds of thousands of visitors. It’s home to the fastest roller coaster on the planet, and it sits just a few hours away from where the Esports World Cup is being held in Riyadh. </p>



<p>Esports is coming up in the Middle East, but it’s not a trend that has sat well in the minds of gamers worldwide. It’s going to take time and heavy, ongoing investment, but the governments of the UAE and Saudi Arabia are intent on making the region a spearhead of the competitive gaming market.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Epic Games is <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/change-to-item-exclusivity-in-future-fortnite-battle-passes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">making one of its biggest changes ever</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> next week--the items on the upcoming Chapter 5 Season 4 battle pass will be the first in the game's history that aren't exclusive to the season they belong to. Starting with the upcoming season that begins on August 16, battle-pass cosmetics can be made available for sale in the Fortnite item shop starting 18 months after the end of the season.</p><p>This is a massive change because all previous battle-pass cosmetics have been sold under the pretense that they will never be available. Skins like Darth Vader and Optimus Prime are permanently unobtainable because of this longstanding exclusivity. While those past skins will remain exclusive, new battle-pass items will not be. This change marks a necessary long-term shift in Epic's strategy for Fortnite as it continues to grow into a larger ecosystem. Battle pass exclusivity made sense for a fledgling battle royale, but it makes less sense for a full-blown metaverse.</p><p>In it's announcement about the change, Epic specifically noted licensed characters as a reason for the move. "We want players down the road to enjoy battle-pass content such as Outfits based on popular licensed characters," Epic's statement read.</p><p>So here's the nitty gritty of this. Starting with the Chapter 5 Season 4 battle pass, Epic will have the option to sell battle-pass cosmetics 18 months after the season ends. It doesn't mean it definitely <em>will</em> sell everything in the shop right way or at all, but they'll have the option to do so. They may also declare that certain items in a pass <em>will </em>be exclusive, but they will be clearly labeled as such when that happens.</p><p>Meanwhile, it sounds as though purchasing battle-pass skins in the shop will be expensive--Epic indicates that each style of a skin will have to be purchased separately. But even though this change is being announced now, it'll be nearly two years before we actually see how this works. It's not currently even possible for Fortnite to sell skins the way this announcement describes, so there's some major work to be done.</p><p>While it would be easy to blame to recent item shop anomalies for forcing this change--namely the accidental sale of a battle-pass song last week, and the accidental return of The Paradigm on Tuesday--it could be that this was already a planned change ahead of the new season. Chapter 5 Season 4 has long been rumored to be a new Marvel-focused season, with a pass consisting entirely of Marvel characters--exactly the sort of situation that would warrant this change.</p>

			<p>Today, ATLUS released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53PsLN1z-6A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand-new trailer</a> for Persona 3 Reload, which showcases Metis, the new android companion that will join players in Persona 3 Reload: Episode Aigis -The Answer-. This is the third and final addition to the pre-existing Persona 3 Reload Expansion Pass.</p>
<p>This trailer showcases some of what players can expect to see when interacting with Metis, as the new expansion pass is set to give players 30 new hours of game play to dive into. Along with the generous amount of game play, players can expect to get their hands on new costumes and get to experience new background music.</p>
<p>For more context, Metis claims to be Aigis' sister. She appears before the S.E.E.S members, who are stuck in a March 31st time loop. Once she has met with them, she leads them to the Abyss of Time, which has somehow appeared in the basement of the dormitory. Her unique Persona is Psyche, with a specialization in Ice, Physical and Wind skills.</p>
<p>In this trailer, players are also introduced to the person who breathes life into Metis. This person is Lizzie Freeman who voices characters such as Sparkle in Honkai: Star Rail, Toby in My Time At Portia and Kitra in Unicorn Overlord.</p>
<p>For those excited for the release of Episode Aigis -The Answer-, the release date is officially September 10, 2024. This expansion pass will be available on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>For those who will be playing the game via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, the Expansion Pass will be completely free to you.</p>
<p>The Persona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass is available for purchase at a price of $39.99, which also includes the Persona 5 Royal EX BGM set, the Persona 4 Golden BGM set, the Velvet Costume set and BGM set.</p>
<p>For those looking for something to showcase their love for Persona, GameStop is doing an Aigis edition of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reload</a> for $199.99. This includes the base game, an artbook, the soundtrack, an Aigis statue and the Persona 3 Reload DLC pack.</p>
<p>The trailer for the latest addition to the Persona 3 Reload Expansion Pass is now available on YouTube, with a length of one minute and 11 seconds. She is showcased to have a cutesy and excitable personality who is happy to be able to call Aigis her sister.</p>
<p>The trailer also showcases Metis' powers and abilities during battle, where she can be prompted by Aigis during combat. Her abilities are very colorful and have a lot of flair, where she can shoot off into the sky to make a butterfly.</p>

<p>Free Range Games and North Beach have just announced that 2023’s The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is set to be released on Xbox Series X|S on August 27. It’ll also be dropping on Steam on the same day, giving PC players another angle from which to purchase and enjoy the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-is-no-mine">This Is No Mine…</h2>



<p>Return to Moria was released on PlayStation 5 and PC last year, and within a few weeks, it’ll be available on Xbox Series X|S. That news comes directly from Free Range Games and North Beach today, who confirmed that when it drops, it’ll be with a limited-time discounted price of just $19.99.</p>



<p>Not only that but the arrival of the game on Xbox will go hand-in-hand with a sizeable patch called The Golden Update. This enables full crossplay between all three platforms, plus it grants players access to the game’s sandbox mode and all the content drops that have landed on the game since it was first released.</p>



<p>If you’ve never heard of Return to Moria, you’d potentially be interested to know that it transcends stories already told, pulling players into the ‘Fourth Age’ of Middle-earth, which is set after the core trilogy of movies. In Return to Moria, players are brought to the legendary Dwarven location by ‘Gimli Lockbearer’, who is voiced by John Rhys-Davies. </p>



<p>Despite failing to hit the mark with reviewers, Return to Moria is a solid enough survival game with a focus on resource management and exploration of a relatively large environment.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Sony announced its latest quarterly earnings. One of the things taken away from the report is that PlayStation 5 (PS5) <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-consoles-hit-61-million-units-sold-overall-hardware-sales-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales have fallen a bit</a> compared to the same time last year. And while Sony only sold 2.4 million consoles in Q1 2024, it shouldn’t be something to worry about.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1821215898675638722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mat Piscatella of Circana</a>, with 61 million units moved, the PS5 continues to outsell the PS4 by about 7% for the same time on the market. And that’s with the first few months of the PS5’s life being during the Covid 19 pandemic along with a product shortage.</p>



<p>Personally, I still believe that exclusives will help move consoles. It’s not a console exclusive, but the current-gen only release of College Football 25 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-response-to-college-football-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved more systems</a> in a single day on the Xbox side — specifically the Xbox Series S — than it had since the consoles first launched.</p>



<p>Games like Death Stranding 2 and Marvel’s Wolverine are likely to help move PS5 consoles when they launch. There’s also the eventual release of the PS5 Pro that, despite skepticism, is still <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned for launch</a> in 2024 as of writing.</p>



<p>Aside from PS5 sales, console sales in general remain strong for the current market. The Nintendo Switch, according to Piscatella, is just 1.1m units being the PS2 in lifetime-to-date (LTD) sales. On the Xbox side of things, the Xbox Series systems are on pace with the Xbox 360’s LTD numbers, and that’s the best-selling console in Microsoft’s history.</p>



<p>So, despite the fact that numbers have been lower over the year for general sales, it’s not a doom and gloom scenario for the console market. Things fluctuate like any other product, and you can expect a rebound to happen soon enough.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-informer-closed-layoffs-eulogy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Few video game publications can claim a legacy that spans decades, let alone multiple mediums, including print, to the bitter end. Game Informer lasted a miraculous 33 years, and it likely would have kept on kicking if not for repeated rounds of staff cuts that built to <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an unceremonious closure</a> last week. GameStop, Game Informer’s owner, couldn’t be bothered to give the magazine its flowers, so we’ve decided to <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-closed-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">once again</a> turn Aftermath over to writers who deserve the chance to end an era on their own terms.&nbsp;</p><p>When GameStop shut down Game Informer last week, employees were stunned, forced out on a Friday and unable to say goodbye. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Informer’s website</a> continues to display a terse message about the closure, rendering its archives inaccessible. Some staff tried to bid readers farewell using the official Game Informer Twitter account this week, only for their post to be <a href="https://x.com/seamoosi/status/1820510026609397770" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nuked alongside the entire account</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s an infuriating state of affairs, a slamming shut of the history books so sudden and thunderous that you’d think the people in charge never want them opened again. While <a href="https://twitter.com/MinnMaxShow/status/1819409115606548752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">archival projects</a> are <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/game-informer-gamestop-video-game-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thankfully in the works</a>, there’s still something to be said for a good old-fashioned eulogy. Here, in the words of former staffers, is what Game Informer was:</p><figure><blockquote><p>I haven’t worked at Game Informer for a decade now, but I’m reminded of it and thankful for it every day.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Dan Ryckert, former senior associate editor (2009-2014) and current creative director at Giant Bomb:</p><blockquote><p>I got the text about Game Informer’s abrupt shutdown on Friday morning, and it took me most of the weekend to really process my thoughts on it. It ended exactly the way we always knew it would – a cold, impersonal, and unceremonious pulling of the plug from its incompetent parent company GameStop – but it’s still hard to imagine a games media landscape without Game Informer.</p><p>In 1993, I first subscribed to GI after seeing it on the counter at FuncoLand. I was nine years old and couldn’t possibly imagine the path that decision would set me on. Writing about video games for a living seemed like the wildest concept in the world to me, and it’s all I wanted to do from that point on. These guys seemed to be having so much fun with their jobs, and their passion for video games was evident on every page.</p><p>Most of my major life decisions from that point on were in service of someday working for the magazine. I got a job at FuncoLand as soon as I turned sixteen and was still there when we had to change the storefront sign over to GameStop. Two years later, I convinced GameStop to send an unknown 18 year-old video production student to GI’s headquarters to <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ic3PU-1Tf18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shoot a commercial</a> for the magazine. I offered to do it for free because I just had to meet the staff and confirm that the job was as fun as I imagined it would be. While I was there, they took a picture of me playing <em>Aquaman </em>for the Xbox while I was wearing a shark suit (long story), and thus made my GI debut in the <em>Jade Empire</em> issue.</p><p>My trip confirmed that the job seemed even better than I expected. Their office in Minneapolis was the most incredible space I’d ever seen, from the CRTs and PS2s on every desk to the extensive vault filled with gaming history. As blown away as I was by the game collection and memorabilia, what really stuck out to me was everyone’s obvious love of gaming. This was their job of course, but they talked about games in the same excited way I did with my friends at school.</p><p>After years of writing reviews and hounding Andy McNamara, he called me in the summer of 2009 and offered me a job. I’d be moving to Minneapolis as one of the new editors for Game Informer. I was there for five years but the impact that time has had on me will be felt the rest of my life. I signed my employment paperwork alongside Tim Turi, who would wind up being the best man at my wedding. I got to travel the world, improve as a writer, meet countless games industry folks who I remain friends with today, and find my voice as a media personality on podcasts and videos.</p><p>I look around at the life I love today, and realize none of it would be possible without Game Informer. If Andy hadn’t called me, I wouldn’t have gotten hired at Giant Bomb, wouldn’t have met my wife, and wouldn’t have moved to Minneapolis when my work went remote. I haven’t worked at Game Informer for a decade now, but I’m reminded of it and thankful for it every day.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Ben Hanson, former video producer (2010-2019) and current founder at MinnMax:</p><blockquote><p>Game Informer felt like a miracle. Falling in love with video production in rural Minnesota, I couldn't have imagined that a job existed in Minneapolis that would fly me around the world to interview game developers. When I was hired as the first video producer in 2010, I remember the excited, hushed tones from the editors as they explained that the new<em> Elder Scrolls</em> game was called <em>Skyrim </em>and I'd be flying out to Bethesda in a couple of weeks to record interviews with Todd Howard. Don't blow it.</p><p>There was so much incredible talent that worked their way through Game Informer throughout its history. Attending Summer Game Fest this year, I was blown away by the tendrils throughout the game industry the magazine created. A lot of that came from the Game Informer internship program which had its problems (unpaid), but hopefully it created a positive impact on the game industry by creating a doorway for new talent.</p><p>The magazine felt like an oasis in the game industry, a wonderful office in Minneapolis, Minnesota where we weren't under strict quotas for clicks and views. Leaders like Andy McNamara (and later Andrew Reiner and Matt Miller) shielded us from a rain of bullshit from the GameStop overlords. After a brutal round of layoffs in 2019 I quit to form a community-funded outlet called MinnMax that was free from GameStop's sword of Damocles, but there's a reason we all still talk so much about Game Informer. It radically changed our lives and means the world to us. GameStop was lucky to have it, but they killed it. And now they have... a warehouse somewhere of <a href="https://www.ebay.com/p/1703518193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buck the Bunny plushies</a>? Great job, GameStop. <a href="https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1486867794650087427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keep tweeting, CEO Ryan Cohen</a>. You're doing great.</p><p>I hope we all made the most out of the opportunity given to us at Game Informer, there won't be one like it again.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><blockquote><p>They shut down the magazine, they pulled the cord on the site, but they can never take away all the beautiful moments that every generation of Game Informer built across those 33 years.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Javy Gwaltney, former associate editor (2015-2019) and current communications manager at EA:</p><blockquote><p>I can say without exaggeration Game Informer is one of the most important things to ever happen to me.</p><p>I moved to Minneapolis in 2015 and worked for the magazine as an Associate Editor just shy of four years before I was caught in the first wave of layoffs in 2019. During those years, I became a much better writer thanks to the constant feedback of my fellow editors and the rest of the staff. I mean, the sheer amount of talent I benefited from is mind-boggling. Matt Bertz. Kim Wallace. Matthew Kato. Kyle Hilliard. Imran Khan. Elise Favis. Daniel Tack. Ben Hanson. Brian Shea. Matt Miller. Leo Vader. Andy McNamara, whom I’m still fortunate enough to work with at Electronic Arts now. Jeff Akervik and his team that made the magazine look as amazing as it does. The names go on, so many names. To think I worked alongside such brilliant people everyday is wild. Reflecting on that time often leads to pure disbelief: sometimes there’s even moments where I briefly wonder if it happened at all or I just dreamed it all up as some wondrous fantasy. It’s that surreal.</p><p>The magazine opened up the world to me. I traveled for work to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver, Malta, Cologne, Stockholm, Guilford. I even went to Afghanistan to interview soldiers on military bases about what games meant to them and how they used them to connect with their families at home.</p><p>I also had a column where I wrote about the cultural impact of games. I interviewed brilliant people and asked them for their thoughts on gaming trends and accessibility and what creative forces inspired them day in and day out. If I had a creative desire I wanted to pursue – nine times out of ten – the staff would work with me to find a way to make it fly under the magazine’s banner. That’s what I remember most: all of us were passionate people and even if we were passionate about different things, we still wanted to come together to support each others’ interests and turn it into engaging content for our readers.</p><p>Look: I’m skeptical of any corporation that tries to present its employees as family but I can 100% say everyone I worked with at Game Informer, whether they were an editor or in production, felt like family to me and still do. I can’t even begin to describe just how much I miss all those people. The feeling is ethereal, just beyond words.</p><p>I know I’m running a bit long here but I think I’ll end things by saying that if you ever wanted a snapshot of what it was like to work at Game Informer, it’s all there in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr5xc6aJt94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">24-hour Extra Life charity streams we’d do at the end of the year</a>. We’d subject ourselves and one another to the most hilarious, downright diabolical humiliations to entertain our viewers and raise (a lot of) money for Gillette Children's Hospital. All the passion and love and mischief and the chaos of the crew coalesced during those streams in a wonderful way.</p><p>They shut down the magazine, they pulled the cord on the site, but they can never take away all the beautiful moments that every generation of Game Informer built across those 33 years.</p><p>GI forever.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Elise Favis, former associate editor (2016-2019) and current communications consultant at FIFTYcc:</p><blockquote><p>It’s hard to think of a world without Game Informer. Everything in my life stems from it. I’m currently sitting on my sofa, and if I look back at the wall behind me, there’s a framed poster of my first Game Informer<em> </em>cover story about <em>Control</em>. I thought about playing <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>later tonight, but hey, that too has ties, because I played it during my initial Game Informer internship. I’m heartbroken that Game Informer is gone, but I got three and a half years at one of the biggest magazines in the world as an editor. In the end, it gave me a lot more than what was taken from me.</p><p>I met my closest friends through not just the job, but also through its community, the games industry, and Minneapolis, where the Game Informer offices were situated. If I had never come to Minneapolis, I never would have met my wife, and I never would have gotten to live in my house that I love so much. I never would’ve gotten my two cats, Corvo and Totoro, or lived with my best friend and coworker Javy Gwaltney. It took Game Informer<em> </em>almost a year to hire me, because GameStop had no idea how to hire a Canadian, but it was through sheer will that managing editor Matt Bertz, editor-in-chief (at the time) Andy McNamara, and executive editor Andrew Reiner found a way to make it happen. And for that, I’m forever grateful. They believed in me more than I ever believed in myself.</p><p>It was a dream job — you’d hear this sentiment often throughout the office. I don’t think a single person lacked a genuine passion for video games, but what was so surprising was how unwaveringly kind everyone was while they worked incredibly hard. We loved it all, and it came through in everything we did. Our podcasts, magazine features, reviews, goofy videos — everything was crafted with a level of thoughtfulness and love that I haven’t yet seen again. And, sure, that thoughtfulness sometimes meant arduous issue meetings where we’d fight over trivial details like “are breakable weapons the worst” (probably started by a certain Joe Juba), or “is [insert XYZ game] <em>really </em>what we’re choosing for GOTY?!” But those impassioned conversations breathed life into Game Informer<em>, </em>every day.</p><p>I’m incredibly proud of what I accomplished throughout my time at Game Informer. I was the first intern to be published in the magazine. When I was brought on full-time, I got to travel the world. I wrote everything from a deep-dive into Telltale’s demise, a cover story about <em>Control </em>(little did I know this would become one of my favorite games ever), an analysis of sexual intimacy throughout games, how fictional languages are crafted in games, why <em>Hellblade </em>speaks to chronic illness and not just mental health, and so much more.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m sick to my stomach that everything Game Informer<em> </em>created — 33 years worth of meticulously researched, influential, and culture-shifting video game coverage — was gone in seconds. I never wanted to imagine a world without Game Informer, but sometimes even the best things in life come to an end. I’m just grateful it brought me as much as it did, and that I still have so much to hold onto, whether it’s memories, friendships, or career-defining moments. Thank you, GI.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><blockquote><p>&nbsp;I don’t think a single person lacked a genuine passion for video games, but what was so surprising was how unwaveringly kind everyone was while they worked incredibly hard.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Suriel Vazquez, former associate editor (2016-2019) and current narrative lead at Big Blue Sky Games:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I worked at Game Informer from August 2016 to August 2019. When I first moved to Minneapolis, I was terrified. Maybe this job I'd uprooted my life for was some kind of scam. Maybe my dream job was still a job and I'd come to hate it. Having written freelance on my own for over 10 years, maybe I wouldn't cut it with the more involved editing process of a print magazine. Maybe I wouldn't like the people there. I reminded myself not to get too attached. I did it anyway. I'm glad I did.</p><p>My dream job was still a job, but Game Informer couldn't have just been a job. Being on my own in a new city, I hung out with the people I worked with after work all the time. We'd go to bars after work every once in a while and shoot the shit. Ben Hanson would have board game nights with every round of interns (so about three or four times a year), and I think I went to nearly every one I could. I spent Thanksgiving at Kyle Hilliard's place 3 years in a row. Traveling for events and cover stories meant sharing a room with someone, and I was a pretty sheltered kid. "Game Informer" became a group of people to me, which really helped when "Game Informer" stopped being a job when I was laid off in 2019.</p><p>The job was great; I'm proud of the work I did there. I traveled all over the world on company dime. I beat <em>Sekiro</em>'s Butterfly Lady on my first try in front of a handful of From Software employees at their office. But the things I'll remember most are those times I spent outside work; watching <em>Solo </em>for the first time with Kyle in LA before E3 (it's a fine movie goddammit!). Going to Disneyland in Japan with Ben and Dan Tack.</p><p>I still spent time with Game Informer folks while searching for a job, working at MinnMax, and trying to make Minneapolis work until I decided to move back out. I was able to work on a few consulting gigs with Matt Bertz. I visited Javy Gwaltney in LA, after he'd gotten a job at EA. I spent Thanksgiving at Kyle's last year.</p><p>The way GameStop laid off all of its remaining staff last week is abhorrent, and the company's Dick Van Dkye-like stumbles, lucky breaks, and inability to figure out how to exist in a world where people can pre-order games on Amazon has been well-documented. But despite ending the magazine, GameStop didn't kill off Game Informer. They're still around.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Imran Khan, former west coast senior editor (2017-2019) and current freelance writer:</p><blockquote><p>I always tell people not to tie their identity to a job and, whether I was bad at following my own advice or not, I did end up doing exactly that at Game Informer. As someone that couldn't stop talking about video games in any conversation, Game Informer was a dream job for me, because it let me feed that compulsion while also contributing to one of the biggest outlets in our medium. To me, Game Informer will always be my first step into the industry and one of my favorite workplaces.</p><p>I'm saddened by the sudden closure and even more deeply upset by the quick removal of our years worth of work. That GameStop executives could be so callous and cruel in removing it is only proof that the C-Suite at that company have never created anything of value if they are willing to treat what we all did as disposable. Game Informer will have a legacy longer than any of them ever will and I genuinely hope that eats them up inside. To everyone who ever graced that outlet's pages (online or otherwise), know that we all pulled off one hell of a thing across three decades.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Blake Hester, former senior associate editor (2020-2024) and current <a href="https://vol.co/collections/guitar-hero" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">author</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>There are two things I will forever value about GI:</p><p>One, it let me be the writer I wanted it to be. In fact, it encouraged it. During my time there, I was never pestered to chase SEO, lists, and similar bullshit I didn't care about (a specific privilege we had because our magazine was so big, I recognize, but nevertheless). I was given the space to do the work I wanted to do, the money to make it happen (important!), and the platform to publish it. Especially these days, that's the most valuable thing a writer can receive. From a traffic perspective, on the website, my pieces were often huge failures. And yet that was never once brought up to me. Or anyone for that matter. What mattered at GI was that the writer was happy and proud with their work, and that they were supported in creating that work.</p><p>And secondly, of course, it's the people. It's so lame (and oftentimes dangerous) when people say a company is a "family." And yet, GI is part of my extended family. I have so many friendships that will last my entire life because I worked at that magazine for a couple years. Hell, some of those friends I didn't even work WITH! We're just connected by the fact we, at one point or another, passed through the same doors. That's huge. That's something I will never take for granted.&nbsp;</p><p>GI for life. Fuck GameStop.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><blockquote><p>From a traffic perspective, on the website, my pieces were often huge failures.

I knew I wanted to work in the industry and Game Informer was my holy grail of media. As a kid, it was such a source of comfort and connection - especially when this was before social media, before the internet was a household commodity - Game Informer was my connection to other gamers and the people behind some of my favorite adventures.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm thankful that my last stint in journalism before moving on to the developer side of the proverbial tracks because Reiner allowed me to reconnect with the part of myself that poured my heart and soul into my written work. He allowed our team the freedom to do well but on our terms, a monumental freedom in an age where rage bait and – let's be honest – clickbait runs rampant.&nbsp; Every single person that worked there put everything they had into everything they did and it was beautiful. To see the callous way GameStop treated the staff and the property throughout its evolution leading into the eventual closure fills me with rage and honestly? Heartbreak. It feels good to see the community rallying, I just wish we didn't HAVE to rally. If it had to close down, a little empathy goes a long way. GameStop has proven, time and time again, that empathy is the one thing they don't deal in – not even for store credit.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>John Carson, former associate editor (2021-2022) and current news editor at Indie Informer:</p><blockquote><p>I was a small part of Game Informer’s 33-year history, but Game Informer was family to me long before I worked there. I became friends with the staff in my early 20s, often hanging out in the office I would kill to work in and the people it would mean everything to work with. Years later, after most of my connections there had left for various reasons, I got the chance to see my words printed on the pages of the largest gaming magazine. I was green, never having had to write for a living, but I like to think I learned quickly and made the most of my time there. A year was allowed to put my soul into GI before the corporate overlords randomly sheared me from the roster.</p><p>Unfortunately, that same callousness and carelessness have ended the outlet’s journey for good.</p><p>We may reminisce on the big announcements and cover stories GI was known for, but my favorite memories of Game Informer are of the people I’m honored to have spent so much time with throughout the years. Dancing with Andrew Reiner in <em>Kinect Star Wars</em> during the early days of streaming. Road trips to wrestling events with Dan Ryckert and Ben Reeves. Grinding out matches in<em> Street Fighter X Tekken</em> with Jason Oestricher. Spending weekends at the office for Extra Life or Guinness World Record attempts. They’re all memories I’ll continue to hold dear.</p><p>It was a miracle a print product went out nearly once a month, especially during COVID. Thanks to everyone during my generation of GI who made it all happen despite the waning support from GameStop in its meme-stock-fueled heyday: Marcus Stewart, Alex Stadnik, Margaret Andrews, Alex Van Aken, Lahleh Azarshin, Brian Shea, Kristin Williams, Lianna Ruppert, Jason Guisao, Wesley LeBlanc, Jill Grodt, Jon Woodey, Ben Reeves, Mónica Rexach Ortiz, Blake Hester, Matt Miller, Jeff Akervik, Dan Tack, and Kimberly Wallace. Thank you all. I’m proud to call you colleagues and friends.</p><p>There may not be a magazine delivered to your door anymore or a website where you can check for the latest news and reviews, but I urge anyone reading this to follow the GI alumni and support them in whatever way you comfortably can.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Nintendo Switch is getting closer to matching the PlayStation 2 for lifetime sales in the US. Mat Piscatella of the research firm Circana reported that the Switch is only 1.1 million units behind PS2 for lifetime sales domestically.</p><p>Globally, it's a bit of a different story. Nintendo recently reported that Switch sales through June 30 stood at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-closing-in-on-ps2s-sales-record/1100-6525497/" data-ref-id="1100-6525497">143.42 million units</a>. The PS2 is understood to be the best-selling home console of all time with about 155 million units sold.</p><p>Nintendo is forecasting to sell 13.5 million Switch consoles during its current fiscal year that ends on March 31, 2025.

He noted that Xbox Series X|S sales (and presumably PS5 as well) will get a boost from College Football 25, a highly anticipated game that was only released on new-generation consoles.</p><p>Nintendo is cooking up its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">next console</a>, and many are wondering when the company will officially unveil and discuss it.

                <p>Developer Free Range Games has announced that Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria will be coming to Xbox Series X|S and Steam on August 27, along with a bevy of new features.</p><p>Titled the Golden Update, cross-play will be implemented on all platforms, so PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, and Epic users will be able to host games with each other. The sandbox mode, which was previously only available in the Epic Games Store beta, will fully launch on all platforms and let players go through procedurally generated game worlds.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfuq_25M5I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bBfuq_25M5I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Some other features include a pause button for offline single-player, as well as more difficulty settings. This will let players adjust different aspects such as enemy aggression, combat, patrol frequency, and mining drops. There will also be new building parts, decorations, weapons, and armor.</p><p>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is a survival-crafting game that was released in October 2023 on PC, first as an Epic Games Store exclusive. It then came to PlayStation in December. It's gotten mixed reviews so far, sitting at a 59 average on GameSpot's sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>.</p>
