			<p>NVIDIA did not forget about its GeForce NOW cloud platform during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2025-ceo-jensen-huang-keynote-live-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big CES 2025 keynote</a>. First, it was confirmed that two highly anticipated PC games, the action RPG Avowed from Obsidian and the first-person shooter DOOM: The Dark Ages from id Software, will be available to play on GeForce NOW.</p>
<p>Avowed is coming in a little over a month. Set for release on February 18 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, the game will provide fans of the Eora setting (previously seen in the Pillars of Eternity franchise) with a brand new perspective on the vibrant fantasy world.&nbsp;I got to play a few hours of a demo build last month and shared these thoughts in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview article</a>:</p>
<p><em>Overall, this hands-on experience definitely left me hopeful and eager for the final version. It's unlikely to be a big success on the scale of Skyrim or Baldur's Gate 3, but it looks like another fun and engaging role-playing game from Obsidian that improves on their previous first-person title. All the worldbuilding work done for the Pillars of Eternity games will certainly pay off, too, both for returning fans of the isometric cRPGs who get to enter Eora from a wholly different perspective and for newcomers who will feel the depth and uniqueness of this fantasy setting.</em></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages doesn't have a launch date yet, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will support path tracing and DLSS 4</a>. While the GeForce NOW servers don't support the newly announced DLSS 4 yet, Ultimate tier users will be able to run DLSS 3 as usual.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also announced that GeForce NOW is officially coming to a series of new devices, such as Valve's Steam Deck. Truthfully, a beta installation method was <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-can-now-be-installed-more-easily-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by NVIDIA last May. However, a native app will be available for download later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="GeForce NOW | Full Support for Steam Deck Coming Soon" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlK5UWuj9is?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA's cloud gaming solution is also expanding to VR and MR devices like the Meta Quest 3 and 3S, Apple's Vision Pro, and Pico headsets. Starting later this month, VR and MR users will be able to use GeForce NOW on these devices by opening the browser <a href="http://play.geforcenow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on this page</a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, NVIDIA is adding India to the list of supported GFN countries later in 2025 thanks to the opening of an RTX 4080-powered data center. Thailand should also be added soon via a local partnership with Brothers Pictures.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-teases-two-of-the-games-most-impactful-scenes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new trailer for The Last of Us has been released, teasing some of the events to come in the show's second season.</p>
<p>Additionally, while we still don't have a specific date, it has been announced that The Last of Us season two will begin airing in April. That's the same month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">The Last of Us Part 2 will make its PC debut</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer, which you can see below, lasts a little over a minute, but still manages to cram in the suspense. Along with Ellie and Joel, we also get another look at new characters for this season, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever's Abby</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/isabela-merced-cast-as-dina-in-hbos-the-last-of-us-adaptation">Isabela Merced's Dina</a>. Please note, beneath the trailer I will be going into more detail about what was shown, so <strong>be aware of major spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 below</strong>.</p>

<p>A fair portion of the trailer is made up with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-trailer-shows-our-best-look-yet-at-season-two">snippets of scenes we have seen before</a>: Ellie and Dina getting swarmed by infected in the subway, Ellie at the Jackson dance (although this time with Dina), Joel shedding a tear during a presumed therapy session, the tender moment between a weary looking Tommy and Maria, and so on.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Wright, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-casts-jeffrey-wright-reprising-his-role-as-isaac">reprising his role as Isaac</a>, and the Seraphites are also glimpsed during the latest trailer for season two.</p>

<p>But there are also two moments I particularly want to highlight, which are sure to pack an emotional punch upon the series' release.</p>
<p>The first is the very opening of the trailer, which begins in a hallway with a wailing siren and ominous red lighting. A lone figure walks into the shot. She is holding a gun with a Firefly pendant around her neck. It is Abby, and this scene is clearly set in the hospital <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-explain-joels-john-wick-moment-as-a-god-mode-power-up">after Joel's rampage at the end of season one</a>.</p><p>Those who have played The Last of Us Part 2 know this means Abby is about to come across the body of the doctor who was set to perform surgery on Ellie before Joel killed him - her father. I won't deny, I cried when I played through this part.</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Max</cite></span></figcaption></figure>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The second moment that bears mentioning specifically is the lone shot of Ellie, again bathed in a red light, aiming a gun at an unseen target. The scene then cuts to black, but heavy breathing can be heard.</p>
<p>Based on events in The Last of Us Part 2, I am going to say this moment takes place after Ellie chases WLF member Nora (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">played in the show by Tati Gabrielle</a>) down in Seattle. Ellie proceeds to torture and kill Nora, in one of the already harrowing game's most harrowing moments. Ellie's actions here traumatise her even further, and she returns to Dina and Jesse in a state of shock.</p><p>When I played The Last of Us Part 2, this moment with Nora left me feeling especially uncomfortable. I wonder if those who have not played the game will feel this same sense of unease when the second season airs.</p>

<p>Last year, The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">the second season of The Last of Us will comprise of seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length.</p>
<p>"The story that we're telling is much bigger than the story of season one, there's just a lot more going on, it's a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster to be honest with you," Mazin said in June.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part 2's story will not be told in full during season two, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">subsequent seasons expected to wrap up the narrative</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and Sega have released a “pre-development concept video” for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/its-finally-happening-were-getting-a-new-virtua-fighter/">new Virtua Fighter project</a> that was announced during The Game Awards last month. Check it out:</p>
<p><iframe title="“New VIRTUA FIGHTER Project” pre-development concept video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtLRfES1YQU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Looks good, right? Well, it’s all just proof of concept right now, labelled as “Pre-development in-engine footage” and “not actual gameplay”, and so there’s absolutely nothing about the game name, platforms or release windows a moment, but it is showing some of the intent behind RGG’s fighting series revival.</p>
<p>There’s various things to note here, from the density of detail through the backdrops to the light 3D shifting through the stage, and an element of destruction as one Akira throws the other Akira around. There’s also some more of that fighting game visual flair with motion trails and other effects as hits land, where Virtua Fighter has generally been more constrained than others in the genre.</p>
<p>All of this is subject to change, of course, but it’s an initial direction that RGG are taking.</p>

<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has become a lynchpin studio for Sega over the last few years. You’ll know them best as the studio behind the hugely popular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-latest-trailer-reveal-naval-combat/">Yakuza/Like A Dragon</a> series, but as broad as that series has become, they’ve also handled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review/">recent Super Monkey Ball games</a> as well. Given that Yakuza’s own combat was a hand-me-down from Shenmue, which was in turn fed a branch off from Virtua Fighter, this makes them the perfect team to take the series’ reins.</p>
<p>Thus far, we’ve only seen Akira and Sarah Bryant going fighting, and with this pre-production video, it’s a pair of Akira battling.</p>
<p>Fans of the series have been waiting patiently ever since the original launch of Virtua Fighter 5. While it leapt through the past couple of generations with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/18/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown-review/">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a>, and is still very playable on modern consoles, there’s little to no online community right now. Sega is looking to give that game a shot in the arm, both with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny9qqpSc0cs&amp;pp=ygUQdmlydHVhIGZpZ2h0ZXIgNQ%3D%3D">a recent 2.0 update to Ultimate Showdown</a> with a new PC port, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaR2wHDKlU">Virtua Fighter 5 REVO coming later this month</a>.</p>

		<p>HBO has released a new teaser trailer for The Last of Us Season 2, confirming that the show will return in April. Where season one of The Last of Us covered the events of the first game, season two will be delving into the story of the second game, introducing characters like Abby who will have a big part alongside Joel and Ellie.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last Of Us Season 2 | April 2025 | Max" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylovT43x3yo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Last of Us Season 2’s trailer gives us a lot of brief shots, showing scenes from The Last of Us Part II captured by the show, with a mix of action and terror as the danger increases for everyone. Neil Druckmann has stated that Season 2 will not cover all of The Last of Us Part II. This was revealed by co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin in an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/the-last-of-us-finale-ending-explained-interview">GQ</a>. When asked if The Last of Us season 2 would feature the entirety of the second game, Mazin said, “No. No way.” Druckmann added, “It’s more than one season”.</p>
<p>In a previous <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-teaser-trailer-reveals-some-new-story-beats/">The Last of Us Season 2 teaser trailer</a> there was more focus on the story, with one major change being Joel talking to what appears to be a therapist about his experiences. This may help people remember some story beats from the previous season, along with providing additional background to the events that occur in Season 2 without having to dive deeply into all of them.</p>

			<p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32-gb-gpu-1999-usd-2x-performance-of-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new GeForce RTX Series GPUs</a> at CES 2025, NVIDIA has also unveiled a series of new or updated RTX technologies that will be in upcoming PC games, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>.</p>
<p>id Software's much anticipated medieval-themed first-person shooter game coming later this year will run on the latest version of the id Tech engine, powered by full path tracing and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly announced DLSS 4</a> with support for Multi Frame Generation. It will also take advantage of the improved Ray Reconstruction for increased lighting stability and detail. You can take a peek at DOOM: The Dark Ages with the full suite of NVIDIA RTX technologies in the DLSS 4 medley video below. Needless to say, it looks absolutely stunning.</p>
<p><iframe title="RTX. It’s On. | The Ultimate in Ray Tracing and AI with DLSS 4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3fglmDxD2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Billy Khan, Director of Engine Technology at id Software, has shared a comment:</p>
<p><em>With DLSS 4, we are stepping into a new era of gaming. The new ray reconstruction transformer model powers a historical leap in raytracing capabilities; not just accelerating performance but also enhancing visuals in DOOM: The Dark Ages.</em></p>
<p>The game doesn't have a fixed launch date yet. When it comes out, it will be playable on PC, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 5 on day one.</p>
<p>Back on DLSS 4 and the newly announced or updated NVIDIA RTX technologies, they will, of course, be available at launch on other upcoming PC titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher IV</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-is-an-impressive-looking-single-player-third-person-shooter-with-strong-metal-gear-solid-vibes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black State</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-qa-funcom-talks-endgame-post-launch-updates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Awakening</a>, all of which will support DLSS Multi Frame Generation. Kadir Demirden, CEO of Black State developer Motion Blur, said:</p>
<p><em>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series and DLSS 4 are game-changing. We now have the power and technologies to realize the future of interactive storytelling with Black State.</em></p>
<p>Rui Casais, CEO of Dune: Awakening developer Funcom, added:</p>
<p><em>GeForce RTX 50 Series and DLSS 4 mark the beginning of a new generation of games.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison - Captured on GeForce RTX 5090" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjnEiP9a9kQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But it's not just new games that will be updated. On top of the 75 games with day 0 support, more hit games from 2024 and 2023 will receive improvements, such as Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Alan Wake 2. The former is being updated not only to add DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the improved Ray Reconstruction and Super Resolution models but also with a new RTX Hair technology. Jim Kjellin, CTO of Indiana Jones developer MachineGames, said:</p>
<p><em>With GeForce RTX 50 Series, players will be able to experience Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at its best. With elevated image quality, performance, and new neural rendering tech like NVIDIA RTX Hair introduces a new level of character realism, truly adding to the immersion of becoming Indy.</em></p>
<p>According to NVIDIA, RTX Hair features a new Linear-Swept Sphere rendering that runs faster, with improved image quality, whilst using less VRAM. You can preview the RTX Hair update in the comparison image below.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As for Alan Wake 2, Remedy's horror game will be updated to include the new <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx-kit#ido12x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Mega Geometry technology</a>, which is going to be available on all RTX GPUs and laptops. NVIDIA says it can accelerate BVH building for cluster-based geometry systems, enabling up to 100x more ray-traced triangles and better performance in heavily ray-traced scenes, reducing CPU overhead.</p>
<p>The game will also add DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the improved Ray Reconstruction transformer model. Additionally, NVIDIA unveiled that Remedy will introduce a new Ultra quality Ray Tracing preset featuring fully ray-traced refractions, fully ray-traced transparent reflections, and higher quality fully ray-traced indirect lighting. This will all be part of the next Alan Wake 2 update. Mika Vehkala, Chief Technology Officer at Remedy Entertainment, commented:</p>
<p><em>With DLSS 4 and GeForce RTX 50 Series we are seeing significant performance gains which enable us to create new game worlds larger and more detailed than ever.</em></p>

<p>Later this year, three more popular PC games will introduce support for DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation: Black Myth: Wukong, Marvel Rivals, and NARAKA: Bladepoint.

<p>During CES 2025, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku revealed a 35-second snippet of in-engine gameplay from the ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’ that was unveiled during The Game Awards 2024. The glimpse of this developing title <strong>isn’t </strong>a gameplay sequence, but it’s a perfect representation of what RGG is aiming for with the first new Virtua Fighter game in almost 20 years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pre-development-only-no-gameplay">Pre-Development Only, No Gameplay</h2>



<p>It’s important to stress that the 35-second clip aired by Sega <strong>is not </strong>gameplay. It’s pre-development footage taken from the game’s engine.</p>



<p>In the short video, we get a look at two characters fighting in a marketplace after a brief introduction,. They trade blows for a few seconds, kicking each other into destructible elements of the environment before the sequence fades to black and the Sega logo flashes up.</p>



<p>Check it out here:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="“New VIRTUA FIGHTER Project” pre-development concept video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtLRfES1YQU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s little more than a conceptual thing, but it admittedly looks brilliant, and that’s coming from someone who has never enjoyed a fighting game. The small details like the NPCs milling around in the background are super, and the intro sequence is interesting, taking players outside of the typically tiny environments that players fight in.</p>



<p>At The Game Awards 2024, RGG unveiled the ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’, which will be the first new VF game in the series since 2006. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/acer-nitro-blaze-11-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/acer-has-revealed-the-nitro-blaze-11-an-enormous-gaming-handheld.1075728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/acer-nitro-blaze-11-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Acer’s recently revealed Nitro Blaze 11 is a new handheld, but they’re cutting it close with the dimensions of this thing. With a massive 10.95-inch display, the Nitro Blaze 11 is by far the chunkiest gaming handheld on the market, and it weighs more than three times as much as a Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>It’ll be a forearm workout just wielding the thing, regardless of how powerful or capable it is under the hood.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-performance-portable-gaming">‘High-Performance Portable Gaming’</h2>



<p>Acer’s Nitro Blaze 11 is a certified handheld device, but the portable aspect might be coming under question, given the size and weight of the thing. Once you’ve factored in the casing, the Nitro Blaze 11 is going to be 12 or 13 inches across, which trumps the ASUS ROG Ally X by a couple of inches.</p>



<p>It also weighs a staggering 1050g, while the Ally X, which is widely seen as the industry leader, weighs just 670g. That means a lot when it comes to a portable device. Do you really want to spend a lot of time gaming on something that weighs more than a kilo?</p>



<p>Size aside, the Nitro Blaze 11 is more than capable. It features a 120Hz display, an AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS processor, and up to 2 TB of storage. It also has detachable controllers in case you want to take the weight off, and it accommodates WiFi 6E and USB 4.</p>



<p>In the product’s blurb, Acer wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nitro Blaze 11 smoothly transitions between daily tasks and gaming. Whether you’re browsing, working, or playing, this handheld adapts seamlessly with precise Hall Effect sticks, a sturdy built-in stand, and detachable controllers that provide flexibility for solo or connected play with the included connector. The front camera makes video calls and streaming easy, ensuring you stay connected wherever you are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Also, the gigantic screen will likely be a monumental drain on the relatively small battery. The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 comes with a 55 Wh battery, which is nothing compared to the Ally X’s 80 Wh battery.</p>



<p>Finally, the price point isn’t ideal. The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 will set you back a whopping $1199, making it the most expensive gaming handheld on the market right now. It’s hard to see a real selling point for this device if I’m being honest.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-bethesda-dev-tired-massive-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-bethesda-dev-suggests-players-are-tired-of-massive-games.1075710/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/former-bethesda-dev-tired-massive-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bethesda is the king of the castle when it comes to expansive, enormous games. Over the years, the company has produced the likes of Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, and most recently, Starfield, all massive open-world titles with hundreds of hours of content. However, one developer who contributed to many of these creations has suggested that players are ‘fatigued’ by these types of games.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Kiwi Talkz on YouTube, Will Shen, former lead quest designer on Starfield, said just that. He believes that players are growing tired of 100-hour campaigns and gargantuan worlds that can’t possibly be explored in their entirety.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-tall-order">‘A Tall Order’</h2>



<p>Speaking exclusively to Kiwi Talkz, Will Shen explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re reaching a point where people are fatigued — or a large section, a growing section of the audience, is becoming fatigued at investing 30-plus, 100-plus hours into a game.</p>



<p>They already have the games that they will continually come back to, and adding another one to that list is a tall order. It’s always a tall order.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Shen was instrumental in the delivery of Starfield, the biggest game that Bethesda Game Studios has ever produced. It features more than 1000 planets, all of which can be explored by the player at will. Before that, he worked on Skyrim and Fallout 4, which are gigantic games in their own right, if not by map size then at least by the amount you can do in them.</p>



<p>He mentioned that you can ‘pretty much play (these games) forever’, which is true for many Bethesda titles.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview for your perusal:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Will Shen left Bethesda Game Studios after a 15-year stint in October 2023, just a month after the release of Starfield. He moved into Something Wicked Games to work on Wyrdsong, and since August 2024, he has assumed a lead designer role at Unknown Worlds Entertainment.</p>

<p>ASUS ROG has revealed the 2025 ROG G700 gaming desktop, a stunning device with more power under the hood than you could dream of. It comes equipped with either an Intel Ultra 9 or a Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor and an all-new NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, packing a whopping 32 GB of VRAM.</p>



<p>It’s a purpose-built device that features ‘hyper-efficient cooling’, ‘tool-less entry’, and ‘flagship-level performance’, per the release from ASUS ROG.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-last-pc-you-ll-buy">The Last PC You’ll Buy</h2>



<p>During CES 2025, ASUS ROG unveiled the <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-rog-g700-gaming-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2025 G700 desktop</a>, uncovering a PC with unparalleled gaming power.</p>



<p>Featuring the latest innovations in PC hardware, the G700 can rock the newest Intel and AMD processors, which go hand-in-hand with the recently revealed NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU. This powerhouse of a unit features 32 GB of GDDR7 VRAM, which will provide gamers with a blistering gaming experience.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the G700 features up to 64 GB of DDR5 RAM and a 2 TB PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD.</p>



<p>If you want to tweak, expand, or upgrade (yeah, right) the G700 desktop, you can do so with ease. One of the selling points of the G700 is that it boasts tool-less entry and standard-sized components that make maintenance a breeze.</p>



<p>If you’re concerned about the heat that’ll be generated by the top-of-the-range CPU, GPU, and the 1000W PSU, fear not. The team has promised hyper-efficient cooling that can be customised to suit either an air-cooled or water-cooled preference, as well as dust filters and a unique airflow path. </p>



<p>The price point of the G700 is yet to be revealed, but would you consider making a massive investment in this PC? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung has lifted the lid on a staggering piece of gaming technology at CES 2025 – the Odyssey OLED G60SF. It’s the world’s first 500Hz monitor, and it’s a stunning OLED device with the lowest response time in the business at just 0.03ms. It’s a new bar for high-end monitor manufacturers to aim for, and it’s set to change gaming experiences worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-evolution">The Evolution</h2>



<p>Samsung’s Odyssey range has long been known as a pinnacle of technology, but the latest devices revealed during CES 2025 are borderline ridiculous.</p>



<p>The G60SF is set to shatter expectations, delivering a world-first 500Hz experience in 4K. It’s a VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack 400-certified unit, which means the depth of contrast and colour will be unparalleled. It’s a 27-inch monitor that’ll blow your hair back, and it comes with HDR10+ capabilities.</p>



<p>Alongside the new G60SF, Samsung also revealed the Odyssey 3D, a glasses-free 3D display that utilises light field display technology to give you an immersive experience, the likes of which are currently unseen in the industry. It’s a hyper-ergonomic monitor with stacks of adjustment options, plus a 4K resolution and 1 ms response time to boot.</p>



<p>Also, Samsung took the opportunity to show off the Odyssey G7. This all-new, 40-inch display boasts a 21:9 resolution over a super-sized, widescreen profile. It’s the industry’s first 40-inch gaming monitor, and it’s enormous. If you want to cut down the number of screens you’re using, why not opt for one giant display with the Odyssey G7?</p>



<p>The price point for the 500Hz OLED G60SF is yet to be revealed, but you can bet your last dollar it’ll be a pretty penny. It’s one of the most innovative and incredible monitors I’ve ever seen, so you can be sure it’ll break the bank.</p>

<p>Recently, a slew of leaks and reveals surfaced online from the Marvel Rivals universe. Since being released on December 6, Marvel Rivals has established itself as a powerhouse title, maintaining a solid player base and refusing to stop growing, soaring up the charts as players dive in to experience the free-to-play, Marvel-backed shooter.</p>



<p>The most recent reveal showcased Reed Richards’ ‘The Maker’ skin, which will arrive with the introduction of the Fantastic Four on January 10. In a series of leaks, the Invisible Woman was detailed further, with her Malice skin being revealed alongside gameplay snippets.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-fantastic">That’s Fantastic</h2>



<p>In a leak posted online by Rivals_Leaks, a promotional image of Malice and The Maker was revealed. These skins, which are tied to Sue Storm and Reed Richards respectively, are now half-confirmed. Following the leak, NetEase posted a short clip showcasing The Maker, the skin for Mr. Fantastic that’ll arrive when the team enters the game on January 10:</p>

<p>Malice is yet to be unveiled in the same fashion, but NetEase did show the full promotional image at the end of the short trailer above. However, Sue Storm’s character was shown fighting bots while wearing the skin in a quick leak, also posted on socials by Rivals_Leaks (originally from RivalsLeaks):</p>











<p>The Fantastic Four will be the latest in a long line of iconic characters to make their way into Marvel Rivals. The game has a stunning lineup of characters and given how expansive the Marvel universe is, there’s a roster to pick from that’ll keep NetEase busy for quite some time.</p>

<p>WWE 2K25 has been teased by 2K and WWE during RAW’s first show on Netflix. The grandiose event, which was backed by a star-studded cast featuring John Cena, Roman Reigns, The Rock, and CM Punk, served as the official welcome for WWE on Netflix.</p>



<p>More information will be revealed by 2K on January 28, but the game can already be wishlisted on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-grand-reveal">Grand Reveal</h2>



<p>The upcoming reveal of WWE 2K25 has fans energised, and it comes just days after WWE 2K23 was finally taken offline, leaving just WWE 2K24 in a fully playable state.</p>



<p>Here’s the statement offered by 2K in the wake of the tease:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WWE 2K returns bigger, bolder, and better than ever in a breakthrough year for the franchise! WWE 2K25 is preparing to charge down the ramp with all the authenticity and action fans love from the best in sports entertainment.</p>



<p>Discover game-changing features, iconic Superstars, and more details on&nbsp;<strong>January 28th, 2025.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The expectation is that WWE 2K25 will follow a similar release pattern to last year’s instalment, dropping in April 2025 – but that’s speculation and nothing more. </p>



<p>Following the teasers, Xbox took to social media to reveal the first screenshots of the game:</p>











<p>This tells us that at least CM Punk, Damien Priest, Liv Morgan, and Cody Rhodes will appear in the game, but that’s hardly a revelation in itself. What fans are most curious about is who will feature as the cover star for WWE 2K25. Last year, it was Cody Rhodes, and the year before that, John Cena took centre stage. </p>



<p>Given that all the recent talk is centred around John Cena’s epic retirement tour, could the superstar make yet another appearance on the cover of a WWE game? </p>

<p>It has been reported that the United States has added Tencent Holdings Ltd. to a blacklist identifying companies as having ties to the Chinese military. This story was shared by Bloomberg, and as the revelation broke online, Tencent’s shares declined. Tencent was joined by CATL, a tech manufacturer linked with Tesla.</p>



<p>Tencent is China’s most valuable company and has a reach that covers some of the biggest video game companies on the planet, such as Epic Games, Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Riot Games, and SuperCell.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pentagon-warning">Pentagon Warning</h2>



<p>The ‘blacklist’, backed by the Pentagon, indicates whether a company is inherently linked to China’s military or the nation’s ‘defence industrial base’. In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s recent report</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s unclear whether either company deals regularly with the PLA. Beyond direct ties to the government, US officials have pointed to laws that require Chinese companies to share information with Beijing on matters deemed relevant to national security.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tencent’s stock value took a dive as the Pentagon’s designation hit the airwaves. It was followed up by a statement from Tencent’s representatives:</p>



<blockquote>

<p>It was suggested <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9q78wn9g8zo">by the BBC</a> that the Pentagon had been ‘pressured’ to add more Chinese companies to the blacklist, which is how CATL, a company that contributes to the manufacture of electric cars, ended up on the list.</p>



<p>Historically, companies have challenged the Pentagon’s decisions regarding this damning blacklist. For instance, DJI and Hesai Technologies took the intelligence agency to court but at the time of publishing, both remain on the list. In 2021, Xiaomi successfully petitioned for a removal from the blacklist.</p>



<p>The Department of Defense-backed list now features a whopping 134 Chinese companies, and that number is growing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-z2-steam-deck-2-says-valve/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98there-will-be-no-z2-steam-deck%E2%80%99-valve-denies-recent-steam-deck-2-rumours.1075674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-z2-steam-deck-2-says-valve/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, rumours started circulating online regarding a Steam Deck 2, powered by AMD’s Ryzen Z2 processor, revealed just hours ago. The source of this speculation came from VideoCardz.com, which was the first site to share slides containing tech specs for the new processors, one of which mentioned that Valve’s Steam Deck would be a recipient of the Z2.</p>



<p>However, a Valve employee has taken to social media to declare that there is not and ‘will be no Z2 Steam Deck’, clearing the air and setting the story straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-for-now">For Now?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lf36y66ggs2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, Valve employee Pierre-Loup Griffais wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There is (not) and will be no Z2 Steam Deck. Guessing the slide was meant to say the series is meant for products like that, not announcing anything specific.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The slide in question also mentioned the Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally, which already feature AMD’s Z1 processor range. It’s easy to see how the assumption could have been made that it would be <strong>the next Steam Deck </strong>that would house the Ryzen Z2, but that’s not the case.</p>



<p>In a report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, it was highlighted that AMD wouldn’t confirm either way whether the Z2 would be implemented in a Steam Deck 2 unit, nor would it mention <strong>any </strong>definite home for the new hardware – Lenovo, Asus, MSI, or whatever else. These conversations took place at CES, the ultimate stage for tech announcements. </p>



<p>With all that being said, there <strong>is </strong>a Steam Deck 2 on the horizon – Valve has made it clear that it intends to produce one at some point, such as the natural lifecycle of any gaming device. Only time will tell what hardware powers the device, though. For now, it doesn’t look like it’ll go hand-in-hand with an AMD Ryzen Z2 processor.</p>

Set primarily within the early Midgar chapters of Final Fantasy 7, the remake gives Cloud Strife and the rest of the Avalanche crew a massive graphical glow-up as they fight to stop Shinra Inc. from turning the planet's life essence into a power source. Ghosts from the past threaten Cloud and his friends, and toward the end of the game, there are major changes to the storyline that shake up the status quo.</p><p>The Intermission expansion focuses on Yuffie Kisaragi and her partner Sonon Kusakabe as they work to steal a powerful artifact from Shinra. This is a short but fun add-on to the main campaign of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, which also saw various technical and graphical improvements added to the game. It's a fairly linear game overall--with some annoying padding--but if you're looking to revisit the cyberpunk world of Square Enix's beloved sci-fantasy game, Final Fantasy 7 Remake won't disappoint.</p></div>                      </div><p>You should also check out the official Material Ultimania book focused on the PS5 version of FF7 Remake.

			<p>Despite being one of the longest-running JRPG series still active today, Falcom's Ys series started seeing some measure of success only recently, but this wasn't caused by an increase in the quality of newer entries in the series over the older ones, as Adol's adventures have always been extremely fun to play through and generally well-received by the dedicated fan base, with only a few exceptions. One of these exceptions is the third entry in the series, Wanderers from Ys, a game that wasn't as well received as the first two entries in the series due to the fact that it did away with the fast-paced top-down experience, replacing it with a side-scrolling experience similar to Zelda II which left something to be desired. As such, no one was surprised to see the original eventually getting completely remade with Ys: The Oath in Felghana, a well-realized remake that surpassed not only the original but almost every other entry in the series. Twenty years after the remake's original release, Western audiences on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch can now enjoy an enhanced version of the game with Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana, which stands out as the definitive edition of the classic action role-playing game by Falcom.</p>

<p>The core features that made up the Ys: Oath in Felghana experience haven't changed much in Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana, such as the story. Following their adventures in Esteria and Ys, the renowned red-haired adventurer Adol Christin and his new friend Dogi journey to Felghana, a region that has changed a lot since Dogi left his hometown of Redmont eight years prior. Everything that could go wrong is seemingly doing so, as the region is beset by monsters, a once dormant volcano has become active again, and the lord of the land is vexing the population and extorting money from them, with the apparent involvement of Dogi's childhood friend Chester. Not capable of turning the other way, Adol decides to help the people of Felghana and his friend Dogi, eventually discovering that there is much more at work than some tyrannical lord out to take money from the poor people he was supposed to guide and protect.</p>
<p>Those who got into the series only recently with games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-viii-lacrimosa-dana-wonderful-adventure/">Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-the-night-is-dark-and-full-of-terrors/">Ys IX: Monstrum Nox</a>, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">Ys X: Nordics</a> may find this story a little on the straightforward side, lacking a huge cast of well-developed characters or plot twists, but in more than a few ways, playing Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana in 2025 feels quite refreshing, as the game does its absolute best to keep players into the action, keeping the story elements to the minimum. This is not to say that the story is in any way bad. The contrary, actually: the sense of adventure that permeates the series is in full show here, just in a more condensed form that serves the experience in the best of ways.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/YsMemoireTheOathInFelghana_Screenshot_Battle_02.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like for the story and characters, playing Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana for the first time after experiencing more recent entries in the series may feel at first like taking a few steps back, as the experience is considerably more straightforward than in pretty much every game that came after the 2005 original. There are no multiple playable characters nor deep character customization here, only Adol, his sword, and the three special elemental attacks obtained during the course of the adventure that add a little complexity to the intense but basic hack-and-slash combat system together with Boost Mode, which can be used to temporarily power-up Adol once a specific meter is full. While combat doesn't evolve much during the course of the game, it doesn't overstay its welcome with its short 12-hour duration, the clever enemy design and the fast pace of the action make it enjoyable for the whole length of the game. As usual for the entire series, boss battles are among the highlights of the experience which push the limits of the combat system and player's skill to the maximum, even at lower difficulty settings.</p>
<p>While combat is a clear previous iteration of mechanics that are still present in the latest entries in the series, Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana feels like a markedly different game from titles like Lacrimosa of Dana or Nordics when it comes to exploration. Instead of featuring a variety of bigger locations that provide plenty of opportunities to stray off the beaten path in search of secrets, The Oath in Felghana is a much more compact and linear experience, as players don't get the opportunity to roam around almost freely, as each location is explored only when the story dictates. There are still plenty of secrets and alternate paths to find, but most definitely not in the same way as the latest entries in the series. What makes traversal nonetheless enjoyable are the platform game mechanics, which require a little bit of skill from the player in using certain abilities to reach normally inaccessible areas and so on. If you have played Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim or Ys Origins, you will find yourself right at home in this regard, as Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana employs similar mechanics.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/YsMemoireTheOathInFelghana_Screenshot_Battle_03.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While those who have played through the original PSP release will find a very familiar experience, there are some new additions and quality-of-life improvements that enhance the experience, some lifted from the PC release, others completely new. For example, at the Very Easy difficulty, it is possible to completely skip the Clock Tower segment, which is among the most challenging of the game, if not the most challenging. Turbo Mode is both a quality-of-life improvement and a feature that can up the challenge, as it speeds up the whole game and can make Inferno difficulty even more challenging. Rounding up the new additions are new narrated sequences that better tie the game with the rest of the series, making it feel more like a page in Adol's chronicles like more recent games, newly recorded voice acting for Adol, high-quality character illustrations, which can be switched with the original versions at any time, and enhanced visuals sporting higher quality textures and sprites. These visual improvements, however, are minor and are essentially a resolution bump, so if you already have played the PC version of the game, you shouldn't expect Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana to look any better. Nor sound any better, as the game features three soundtrack options (Original, PC-8801, X68000), which were included in previous versions of the game. Still, it is a great soundtrack featuring some blood-pumping pieces that go extremely well with the game's no-holding-back fast pace.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana was mostly meant to free the original game from the PSP prison it was stuck in, regarding consoles, while offering a bunch of new features and enhancements to make it more enticing, and in this regard, the game definitely doesn't disappointing. Those looking for some old-school Ys action will be quite happy to return to Felghana with Adol and Dogi, while those who never had the chance to play the game will find a fast-paced adventure that does not disappointing.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana was clearly designed to bring the remake of the third entry in the Falcom series to modern consoles, and in this regard, it fully succeeds. The game delivers a fast-paced, no-frills experience that remains engaging from start to finish, enhanced by new features, improved visuals and quality-of-life improvements. However, compared to more recent entries in the series, Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana is a more straightforward game with a relatively simple story and combat system, which may not appeal to those who were introduced to the series through its modern installments.</p>

But at CES 2025, the company is taking the ACE characters a step further by showing how they can be “autonomous game characters” — including, sometime this year, a teammate to help you get a chicken dinner in <em>PUBG</em>. </p><p>Nvidia says that ACE characters can use AI to “perceive, plan, and act like human players,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-ace-autonomous-ai-companions-pubg-naraka-bladepoint%2F">per a blog post</a>. “Powered by generative AI, ACE will enable living, dynamic game worlds with companions that comprehend and support player goals, and enemies that adapt dynamically to player tactics.” The characters are powered by “small language models (SLMs)” that are “capable of planning at human-like frequencies required for realistic decision making” as well as “multi-modal SLMs for vision and audio that allow AI characters to hear audio cues and perceive their environment.”</p><p>As for how that will work in <em>PUBG</em>, you’ll be able to team up with the “<em>PUBG</em> Ally,” which Nvidia and <em>PUBG</em> publisher Krafton are calling the “world’s first Co-Playable Character (CPC).” The Ally will be able to “communicate using game-specific lingo, provide real-time strategic recommendations, find and share loot, drive vehicles, and fight other human players using the game’s extensive arsenal of weapons,” Nvidia says. </p><p>Basically, it sounds like an AI teammate you can talk with natural language who’s supposed to be as capable as a human. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEKUSMqrbzQ">a video</a> shows the Ally indeed helping a player find specific loot, bringing over a vehicle, and attempting to flank opposing players. But the video is heavily edited and isn’t live, so I’m skeptical that the Ally will work as well as is being shown here.</p><p>AI characters built with ACE are coming to other games, too. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint Mobile PC Version</em> will get a “a local inference AI Teammate feature” in March 2025, while <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> on PC will get the feature “later in 2025,” according to Nvidia’s blog post. “AI Teammates powered by NVIDIA ACE can join your party, battling alongside you, finding you specific items that you need, swapping gear, offering suggestions on skills to unlock, and making plays that’ll help you achieve victory.”</p><p>Krafton’s upcoming life simulation game called <em>inZOI </em>will also get CPCs called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk9z1upOj3U">“Smart Zoi.”</a> And Nvidia says that ACE characters can be bosses, too, and they’ll be used for boss encounters in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8XeiZ4djKw&amp;t=2s">Wemade Next’s <em>MIR5</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335012/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-amd-ryzen-max-plus-price-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asus has a new version of its Surface Pro-like gaming tablet for CES, and it’s making some sizable changes both inside and out. The Asus ROG Flow Z13 for 2025 is once again a slightly chunky, almost-half-inch-thick, 13-inch tablet with a built-in kickstand, magnetic keyboard cover, a bunch of ports, and a clear window on its rear with RGB lighting to show off its innards.</p><p>That fun glass window is now larger, with a direct view of the motherboard, but the biggest change for the ROG Flow Z13 is its switch to integrated graphics. That may seem like a step backward for a gaming-focused tablet since gamers covet dedicated GPUs, but Asus is outfitting it with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">AMD’s powerful new “Strix Halo” processor</a>. The ROG Flow Z13 can be configured with the Ryzen AI Max 390 for $1,999.99 or the Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 for $2,199.99. The top-end model with the Max Plus 395 has 16 CPU cores and 40 graphics cores, while the base-model Ryzen AI Max Plus 390 (curse these names) has 12 CPU cores and 32 graphics cores. The Z13 utilizes a redesigned stainless steel vapor chamber for cooling these graphics-heavy chips, which are capable of 120W TDP. </p><p>All that power in the Z13 is responsible for driving a 13-inch, 2560 x 1600 touchscreen display with a speedy 180Hz refresh rate (up from 165Hz on the last-gen model), which you don’t often find in laptops and tablets of this size. For ports, it’s got two USB 4, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, HDMI 2.1, a microSD card slot capable of UHS-II speeds, and a 3.5mm combination headphone / mic jack. It’s also got a 5-megapixel front-facing webcam and 13-megapixel rear-facing camera — so you can flash your RGB as you awkwardly take tablet photos in public. It also has Wi-Fi 7.</p><p>The Z13 supports USB-C Power Delivery for charging, but that won’t be powerful enough to allow its full performance under load. Instead, it comes with a 200W power adapter that uses Asus’ proprietary and reversible slim power jack — like on its recent laptops.</p><p>Other quality-of-life improvements for the Z13 include a new detachable keyboard with larger keycaps and a more generously sized touchpad. And on its right side, beside the power button and volume rocker, is a new “ScreenXpert” button that summons a Command-Center-like widget that includes multiple-display window management controls, quick access to operating modes like Turbo mode or Silent mode, and other settings like muting your mic. It’s primarily there to help control things while in tablet mode since the keyboard contains shortcuts for most of these functions.</p><p>I got a quick glimpse of the new ROG Flow Z13 at a preview event, and Asus sent me a preproduction model right before CES to get a little bit of hands-on time. It’s what I’m writing this post on right now, and boy do I appreciate the updates to this keyboard cover. The 1.7mm key travel and bigger touchpad go a long way toward getting work done. While the Ryzen 395 chip has the potential to be power-hungry, the battery life on the Z13 shows some promise. Asus is only claiming 10 hours of battery life, and I did manage to get through a full eight-plus-hour workday of Chrome tabs, streaming music (though the speakers seem kind of bad at first listen), and writing across multiple virtual desktops the day before flying to CES — with pretty much no issues.</p><p>I definitely prefer a proper laptop to a tablet with a kickstand and keyboard cover, but being able to remove the keyboard deck for a little more flexibility and comfort when it’s time to fire up a game is pretty slick. I tried out a little <em>Helldivers 2 </em>on the Flow Z13, and it performed quite well, especially for a tablet. Set to the Z13’s native 2.5K resolution, in-game render scale on Ultra Quality, and texture details on medium, I saw 60fps or just slightly under, and it looked really nice. If I bumped it down from Ultra Quality to Quality scaling, it jumped up to an even smoother 80fps. This was, of course, while the tablet was plugged in and its fans were blasting on Turbo mode. Diving in again while unplugged dropped the Ultra Quality render scale performance down to the 45 to 50fps range since playing on battery limits you to Performance mode instead of Turbo.</p><p>This is preproduction hardware, but so far, it’s pretty impressive for integrated graphics. AMD’s new chip might have something special here for thin and light devices, but since it lacks Thunderbolt 5, that means the Flow Z13 can’t use the full GPU bandwidth of Asus’ new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24100176">XG Mobile eGPU</a>. (Previous models could use the older XG Mobile via its proprietary connector.) But of course, that would make this somewhat portable PC gaming solution a little less portable, and the new XG Mobile costs about as much as the Flow Z13 itself.</p><p>But does a gaming tablet make much sense in 2025 when portable PC gaming is being so adequately served by the Steam Deck and a bunch of other dedicated handhelds? We’ll have to see how a production model of the ROG Flow Z13 fares when it launches sometime in February.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

			<p>During NVIDIA's CES 2025 keynote, <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-showcases-latest-advancements-in-game-development-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inworld AI</a> announced a partnership with the maker of GeForce graphics cards and with Logitech's <a href="https://wccftech.com/logitech-enters-streaming-fight-with-89m-purchase-of-streamlabs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streamlabs</a> division to unveil what they're calling the world's first Intelligent Streaming Assistant.</p>
<p>The collaboration mixes Streamlabs' live streaming expertise, NVIDIA's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-unveils-ace-model-for-next-gen-games-integrating-ai-into-virtual-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACE</a> technology and AI vision models, and Inworld AI's perception and cognition capabilities. Using multimodal AI, Inworld powers the brain of the Intelligent Streaming Assistant, transforming it into an interactive co-host, expert producer, and technical assistant.</p>
<p>Here's a more detailed overview of how everything works under the hood:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Interactive Co-Host:</strong> Leveraging NVIDIA’s computer vision capabilities to detect events in real time with Inworld’s ability to drive real-time agent behavior based on game state and contextual understanding of games, the Intelligent Streaming Assistant can offer contextually relevant commentary at the creator’s request. This awareness enables the assistant to do things like highlight a well-timed build, provide commentary during a dramatic Victory Royale, or even shout out at audience members for sending tips.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Stream Producer:</strong> The Intelligent Streaming Assistant can trigger audio and visual effects to enhance high-impact gameplay or clip the best highlights for replay. Inworld processes multimodal inputs from the creator, chat, and game to execute these Producer Actions through the Streamlabs API, giving the creator full control over how their stream unfolds.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Technical Assistant:</strong> The Intelligent Streaming Assistant also helps with setting up Streamlabs Desktop and troubleshooting. Inworld processes the input from the creator to execute scene transitions or animations through the Streamlabs API, helping ensure the stream runs smoothly.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Creators will be able to select from assistant personalities that pair well with the tone of their stream, whether they are looking for subtle behind-the-scenes support or a lively co-host. Check out a short demo video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/909h0VZeOMM?si=nK6W23sTZR2xLDqi" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Kylan Gibbs, CEO of Inworld AI, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>The pace of innovation in generative AI is nothing short of extraordinary, propelling us beyond first-generation applications into a new era of sophisticated agentic behavior. Our collaboration with Streamlabs and NVIDIA exemplifies how Inworld's AI agents enable real-time, context-aware interactions. More importantly, it demonstrates the real-world potential of AI to augment games and entertainment—empowering creators to deepen engagement and delight their audiences.</em></p>
<p>Ashray Urs, Head of Streamlabs, added:</p>
<p><em>We hope that with this groundbreaking technology, creators can now embrace AI in a way that is authentic to their brand and enables them to push the boundaries of innovation. The first intelligent streaming assistant represents another leap forward for the medium, giving creators the power to harness this technology to make streaming easier and more captivating, all while maintaining the level of authenticity they need to nurture and grow their community.</em></p>
<p>The Intelligent Streaming Assistant will be available via the Streamlabs App Store later in 2025.</p>

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></span></span></p><p>Photography by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</p></div><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p><div><h2>Share this story</h2></div></div></div><div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer announced it’s overhauling the Razer Blade 16 inside and out. In addition to a new CPU and GPU, the Blade 16 is now thinner overall than the outgoing 2024 model and comes with a few tweaks to its audio system and keyboard. </p><p>The new Blade 16 comes with up to a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU and a “next-gen Nvidia<strong> </strong>GPU.” The company also bumped its speaker array from four to six speakers, while the display carries over the 240Hz OLED <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24024217/razer-gaming-laptop-updates-blade-16-18-oled-4k-ces">introduced to the line last year</a>. This is the first time Razer has put an AMD processor in the Blade 16.</p><p>Razer says it’s packing all of that into a chassis that’s over 30 percent thinner than last year’s model at just 0.59 inches — or 14.9 millimeters — thick<strong> </strong>in the front and 0.69 inches (17.4mm) in the back, not including the feet. For reference, the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 is 0.61 inches (15.5mm) thick, including feet. The new Razer Blade&nbsp;is also deeper than last year’s model, measuring 250.5mm front to back, versus 244mm for the 2024 Blade 16. Despite all of that, Razer says it increased the travel of its keyboard keys from 1mm to 1.5mm. And there’s now a Copilot key, of course.</p><p>That thinness may come at a cost: the new Blade 16 has a 90Wh battery that it says can charge to 80 percent in about 45 minutes. The fast charging may come in handy; the larger 95.2Wh battery in the Blade 16 we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23588660/razer-blade-16-2023-review-specs-features-design">reviewed in 2023</a> already felt like it wasn’t up to the task. That review unit was also a hot laptop. Razer says it’s using a new thermal gel that covers more interior surface area than the 2023 model.</p><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The 2025 model (top) vs. the thicker 2024 model (bottom).</em></figcaption></p></div><div><figcaption><em>2024 (left) vs. 2025 (right).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>The AMD chip it’s using might help things, though. When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point">we tested an Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 with that Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU</a> against the same laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, the AMD version ran for three hours longer in non-gaming tasks and put out slightly less heat, though Asus puts a much lower power draw cap on its gaming laptops than Razer does. Naturally, we won’t know how any of that affects the new Blade 16 until we have one in hand to test. </p><p>The 2025 Razer Blade 16 is due out in the first quarter of this year. Razer didn’t announce pricing, but you can bet it won’t be cheap.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</p><div><figcaption><em>The new Razer Blade 16.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Razer</cite></p></div></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news"><h2>CES 2025: all the news, gadgets, and surprises</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24325799/dell-pro-max-premium-plus-ces-laptop-pc-rebrand-announcement"><h2>Dell kills the XPS brand</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date"><h2>Nvidia announces next-gen RTX 5090 and 5080 GPUs</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337117/microsoft-bing-search-results-google-design-trick"><h2>Microsoft is using Bing to trick people into thinking they’re on Google</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336154/samsung-the-frame-pro-features-specs"><h2>Samsung announces The Frame Pro: could this be the perfect TV?</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></main><div><h2>More from this stream<!-- --> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news">CES 2025: all the news, gadgets, and surprises</a></h2><ul><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335238/msi-gaming-laptops-cyborg-stealth-raider-vector-nvidia-rtx-intel-amd-ces">MSI’s 2025 gaming laptops have the latest from Nvidia, Intel, and AMD — plus lots of RGB</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335564/alienware-27-inch-4k-240hz-oled-price-date">Alienware’s 27-inch 4K 240Hz OLED monitor is only a couple months away</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335027/msi-titan-18-dragon-edition-norse-myth-gaming-laptop-ces-price-specs">The Titan Dragon Edition is MSI’s latest all-out gaming laptop</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24332341/alienware-area-51-16-18-rgb-laptop-price-specs-ces">Alienware’s new Area-51 laptops have light-up trackpads and fans</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li></ul><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news">See all <!-- -->177<!-- --> stories</a> </div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The panel covers 95 percent of the Display P3 and 99 percent of the sRGB color gamuts, and it has support for G-Sync and FreeSync Premium. For video inputs, it has one DisplayPort 1.4 port and two HDMI 2.1 ports, plus a 65W USB-C Power Delivery port with alt mode support for DisplayPort. It also has two USB-A 2.0 ports for peripherals, 3.5mm for audio (plus four built-in 3W speakers), and even an ethernet jack.</p><p>The hardware specs don’t jump off the page compared to other gaming monitors in its class, but the Google TV integration sets it apart. You’ll find it familiar if you’ve used a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214471/google-chromecast-line-discontinued">Chromecast</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214055/google-tv-streamer-features-price-matter-thread">Google TV Streamer</a>, or select <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/1/23619895/sony-2023-tv-lineup-bravia-xr-features">TVs from Sony</a>, Hisense, and the like. It delivers recommendations based on your watch history, and you can use Google Assistant voice commands to search for specific content within its deep library of apps as it pulls options from all available sources. You can also cast content from supported mobile apps. Most other smart monitors, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/31/24020920/lg-myview-4k-smart-monitor-display-tv-webos">LG’s MyView line</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23735566/samsung-smart-monitor-2023-m80c-m70c-m50c-tv">Samsung M series</a>, use their own custom operating systems, and most of them are more focused on productivity than gaming.</p><p>The Omen 32x also has some unique tricks we haven’t seen before, such as native support for streaming your screen to four platforms — including Twitch, YouTube, and Instagram — simultaneously with no additional hardware. It can stream up to two webcam sources in addition to what’s on your screen. You can also mirror your Android-based smartphone to the display and use it in desktop mode within a multiview window while you’re gaming. HP even built in wireless KVM functionality, allowing you to operate everything using the same keyboard and mouse.</p><div><figcaption><em>HP’s 2025 G2 monitors, like the pictured Omen 34c G2, have a minimum 180Hz refresh rate.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: HP</cite></p></div><p>HP is also updating its mainstream G2 line of monitors for 2025, including the $479.99 Omen 34c G2, a 34-inch WQHD curved ultrawide (21:9) display with FreeSync Premium, DisplayHDR 400, and a 4,000:1 contrast ratio. We’re also getting new 27-inch 16:9 options in the 1080p Omen 27 G2 for $249.99 in May, the QHD Omen 27q G2 for $299.99 in April, and the QHD 27qs G2 for $449.99 in June. </p><p>All will benefit from factory color calibration for the first time, and the former three will support boosted refresh rates up to 180Hz. The 27qs G2, however, is distinguished as the only monitor in the G2 lineup with an IPS Black display and the first ever with a 280Hz refresh rate. IPS Black displays are said to offer higher contrast ratios (2,000:1 on the 27qs G2) and better color accuracy than ordinary IPS panels.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company announced its Titan 18 HX laptop at CES 2025. It’s an 18-inch behemoth with an illuminated touchpad, Intel’s Core Arrow Lake processor, and Nvidia’s new RTX 50-series GPU for a starting price of around $5,000. </p><p>But is that really outrageous enough?</p><p>It’d be much wilder to also release a fully unhinged Titan adorned with dragon designs and runes inspired by Norse mythology. And that’s exactly what MSI is doing with its Titan 18 HX Dragon Edition Norse Myth. It has the innards of the standard Titan, complete with a new dedicated heat pipe cooler just for its PCIe Gen5 SSD to maximize transfer speeds, and it adds a massive etching of a hand-drawn dragon head to its lid as well as a 3D-printed dragon coin under glass within the palm rest. Now we’re talking.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>According to MSI, those Norse runes on the lid mean “Dragon Edition.”</em></figcaption></p></div><p>We’re still awaiting pricing information, but spec-wise, this thing is roaring. It packs an Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX CPU, Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU with 24GB of GDDR7 VRAM, up to 96GB of DDR5 RAM, one slot of Gen5 NVMe M.2 storage, and three extra slots of Gen4 SSD storage.</p><p>It has an 18-inch 4K Mini LED screen capable of 3840 x 2400 (16:10) resolution at 120Hz refresh, a six-speaker audio setup (two of which are woofers), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, Cherry mechanical keyboard switches with per-key RGB illumination, a 99.9Wh battery, and a power adapter capable of delivering 400-freaking-watts. </p><p>For I/O, you get two Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, three USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, HDMI 2.1, gigabit ethernet, and a full-size SD card slot. This whole fire-breathing magnesium alloy package weighs in at a <em>hefty</em> 3.6 kg / 7.94 lbs, but it’s somehow not as heavy as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24096382">Alienware’s boat anchor of a new 18-inch Area-51 laptop</a>.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><p><figcaption><em>The inlaid dragon medallion has some nice detail work within it.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>MSI has done Dragon Edition laptops before, but compared to previous incarnations, the new Titan Dragon Edition looks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22227970/msi-ge76-raider-dragon-edition-ge66-tiamat-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3000-series">more fierce</a> and actually less garish — just <a href="https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GT70_Dragon_Edition/Specification">look at this old thing</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24332341/alienware-area-51-16-18-rgb-laptop-price-specs-ces<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Alienware is bringing back its Area-51 computer line, and its new flagship laptops are much showier than the secretive air base they’re named after. The bombastic, UFO-like Area-51 laptops are paired with a range of top-flight specs featuring Intel Arrow Lake CPUs and next-gen Nvidia GPUs — coming in two sizes: big (16-inch) and bigger (18-inch). They’ll start at a pricey $3,199 when select configurations launch by the end of Q1 2025, with an entry-level $1,999 model and other configs coming later.</p><p>Unlike last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24026555/dell-alienware-m16-r2-ces-2024-gaming-laptop">M16 R2</a>, which trimmed down the protruding butt found on many Alienware laptops, the Area-51 has a full-on dump truck for a rear. And this protrusion, where all its ports are located, even lights up with a soft, supple glow of RGB illumination. The Area-51’s RGB light show extends to per-key keyboard illumination, a light-up trackpad, and lit case fans. The light-up fans are visible through the intake holes on the top deck as well as a seethrough Gorilla Glass panel on the underside, also showing off some of the laptop’s innards.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The teal case color has a bit of a shimmer in the right light.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Area-51 duo will rely on their RGB lighting for their splashiest pops of color, as both sizes of Alienware laptops come in just one chassis color, called liquid teal. The anodized finish is said to take inspiration from the aurora borealis, looking nearly charcoal black in a dimly lit room until its lid or underside shows a slight shimmer of iridescence when the light catches it.</p><p>Housed within that aluminum chassis, the Area-51 sports some high-end specs. It can be outfitted with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, Nvidia’s new 50-series GPUs, up to 64GB of dual-channel DDR5 RAM, and up to 2TB NVMe PCIe Gen5 SSD. Powering all of that in each the 16-inch and 18-inch laptops is a sizable 96Wh battery. Alienware doesn’t list any battery life estimates in the Area-51’s tech specs. We’ve asked how many hours of use people should expect when unplugged and haven’t yet heard back. </p><p>The Area-51 duo use a new thermal architecture to keep all this hot hardware cool, and Alienware claims it moves up to 37 percent more airflow while running 15 percent quieter than the older Alienware X16 R2 from 2024. All those specs and improved thermals sound nice on paper, but keep in mind, these new Area-51 models are hefty laptops. Remember that older X16 R2 laptop that Alienware compares them to? The X16 R2 weighs six pounds. At 7.6 pounds, the new 16-inch Area-51 weighs about as much as the average American newborn baby, and the 18-inch is even heavier at nearly 10 pounds.</p><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The seethrough glass panel on the bottom has some alien-like glyphs.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>That absolute unit of a derriere offers lots of I/O.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Tipping the scales like that, the Area-51 laptops don’t feel like just a resurrection of Alienware’s flagship brand name but a throwback to older, basically immobile desktop replacement laptops. That does come with some benefits, like a plethora of rear-mounted ports including HDMI 2.1, 2.5 gigabit ethernet (RJ-45), three USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 5Gbps ports, two Thunderbolt 5 / USB-C ports, and a headphone jack and full-size SD card slot on the side. </p><p>The big drawback here is that the displays also feel a little retro, since the laptops use older IPS display tech. Both machines have 2560 x 1600 QHD panels with 3ms response time and up to 300Hz refresh (240Hz on the 16-inch), but there’s no fancy tandem OLED or anything of the sort like Alienware’s parent company Dell put in its upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24092096">Pro Premium laptop</a>. If you want OLED displays from Alienware, you’ll instead have to check out its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23011794/alienware-aw3423dw-review-qd-oled-curved-gaming-pc-monitor">gaming monitors</a> — of which, it announced a new 27-inch 4K QD-OLED at CES 2025 as well as some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24099606">Area-51 and Aurora prebuilt desktops. </a></p><p><em> Photography by Antonio G.

The new model looks to not only be a powerful rig with impressive gaming specs, it's also the company's thinnest gaming laptop yet.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Razer Blade 16 features a 0.59-inch chassis, which is 32% thinner than the previous Razer Blade 16 model. Razer has made other adjustments to the laptop's design to accommodate the smaller size without impacting durability, cooling, or usability. The new laptop has a metal body made from a single piece of anodized aluminum and features vapor chamber cooling. The redesign also includes a new keyboard with 1.5mm travel, which is 50% more key travel than the previous model.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423411-blade16hero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423411" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423411-blade16hero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423411"></a><figcaption>Razer Blade 16 2025 Model</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423411-blade16hero.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Razer Blade 16 will be available with multiple hardware configuration options, with the highest-end model sporting an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor. Other components will be detailed later. All models feature a 16-inch OLED display with 3200 x 1800 pixel QHD+ resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, and 0.2ms response time.</p><p dir="ltr">The Razer Blade 16 2025 model will be available sometime in Q1 2025.

Also, in an upgrade that will work on all GeForce RTX GPUs, DLSS games with Ray Reconstruction, Super Resolution, and DLAA&nbsp;can be updated to new transformer AI models that use the same tech as AI tools like ChatGPT, which it says is a first for the graphics industry.</p><p>Nvidia says its new frame generation model is 40 percent faster and uses 30 percent less VRAM than the old one. By replacing the old Convolutional Neural Networks with its new transformer model, the claim is that generated pixels will have less ghosting, more detail, and more stability in a scene for a clearer picture overall. </p><p>Nvidia is promising <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fdlss4-multi-frame-generation-ray-tracing-rtx-games%2F">there will be 75 games and apps that support Multi Frame Generation on day zero</a>, with <em>Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, and <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>supporting it when RTX 50 Series GPUs launch at the end of January, while “over 50 games” will have support for the new transformer-based DLSS features that can run on all GeForce RTX hardware.</p><p>We will want to see how the new frame generation tech affects latency, but Nvidia also announced Reflex 2 with Frame Warp technology, which it says can cut latency by up to 75 percent:</p><div><blockquote><p>As a frame is being rendered by the GPU, the CPU calculates the camera position of the next frame in the pipeline, based on the latest mouse or controller input. Frame Warp samples the new camera position from the CPU, and warps the frame just rendered by the GPU to this newer camera position. The warp is conducted as late as possible, just before the rendered frame is sent to the display, ensuring the most recent mouse input is reflected on screen.</p></blockquote></div><p>Nvidia’s figures show Reflex 2 cutting latency from 27ms with Reflex 1 to just 14ms in testing with<em> The Finals</em>. It says the tech is “coming soon” to both <em>The Finals </em>and <em>Valorant</em> for gamers with 50 Series GPUs first, before it’s available on other RTX hardware.</p><p>For games and apps that don’t have updates available immediately but have DLSS support, the updated drivers and Nvidia app have new DLSS Override switches. Users can force Multi Frame Generation on the new GPUs when frame generation is already turned on in the game, rendering based on the latest models when DLSS is turned on in the fame, and using updated Super Resolution rendering when that feature is turned on in the game.</p><p>Here’s a slide showing which DLSS 4 features are available on which series of RTX GPUs:</p><p>DLSS 4 arrives more than two years after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23362990/nvidia-dlss-3-0-demonstration-ada-lovelace-graphics-cards-upscaling-technology">Nvidia introduced DLSS 3</a> with Frame Generation to boost performance in a variety of games. Nvidia then introduced DLSS 3.5 in August 2023 with an AI-powered Ray Reconstruction technique to improve the quality of ray tracing and introduce path tracing (full ray tracing) in select titles. In August last year, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps%2F">Nvidia revealed</a> it now has more than 600 games and applications with RTX support.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia is officially <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Frtx-50-series-graphics-cards-gpu-laptop-announcements%2F">announcing its RTX 50-series</a> GPUs today. After months of leaks and rumors, the next-generation RTX Blackwell GPUs are now official, and there are four of them on the way. </p><p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang revealed the RTX 50-series GPUs during a CES keynote this evening, announcing a $1,999 RTX 5090, a $999 RTX 5080, a $749 RTX 5070 Ti, and a $549 RTX 5070. Nvidia’s new RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs will both be available on January 30th, with the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 to follow in February.</p><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s RTX 5090 GPU is surprisingly small.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>The RTX 50-series GPUs include a new design for the Founders Edition, with just two double flow-through fans, a 3D vapor chamber, and GDDR7 memory. All of the RTX 50-series cards are PCIe Gen 5 and include DisplayPort 2.1b connectors to drive displays up to 8K and 165Hz. </p><p>Surprisingly, the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F50-series%2Frtx-5090%2F">RTX 5090 Founders Edition</a> will be a two-slot GPU and will be capable of fitting inside small form factor PCs — a big departure from the size of the RTX 4090. The RTX 5090 has 32GB of GDDR7, a memory bandwidth of 1,792GB/sec, and a massive 21,760 CUDA cores. </p><p>This all adds up to a GPU that Nvidia says will be two times faster than the RTX 4090, thanks to DLSS 4 and the Blackwell architecture. But it will come at a cost of power consumption, as Nvidia says the RTX 5090 will have a total graphics power of 575 watts and a recommended PSU requirement of 1000 watts. That’s 125 watts more than the RTX 4090, but hopefully the RTX 5090 will be a lot more power efficient so that you’ll rarely be using the full 575 watts.</p><p>Nvidia demonstrated <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> running on an RTX 5090 with DLSS 4 at 238fps compared to 106fps on an RTX 4090 with DLSS 3.5. Both GPUs are running the game with full ray tracing enabled.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F50-series%2Frtx-5080%2F">The RTX 5080</a> is designed to be twice as fast as the RTX 4080 and will include 16GB of GDDR7 memory, a memory bandwidth of 960GB/sec, and 10,752 CUDA cores. The RTX 5080 will have a total graphics power of 360 watts and Nvidia is recommending a 850-watt power supply. Nvidia is promising big performance gains with the RTX 5080 over the previous RTX 4080 model as a result of these specs.</p><div><figcaption><em>RTX 5090 performance.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s RTX 5080 performance promises.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>Nvidia is also launching an <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F50-series%2Frtx-5070-family%2F">RTX 5070 Ti</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F50-series%2Frtx-5070-family%2F">RTX 5070</a>. The RTX 5070 Ti includes 16GB of GDDR7 memory, a memory bandwidth of 896GB/s, and 8,960 CUDA cores. The RTX 5070 has 12GB of GDDR7, a memory bandwidth of 672 GB/sec, and 6,144 CUDA cores. The RTX 5070 Ti will have a total graphics power of 300 watts and require a 750-watt PSU, while the RTX 5070 has a total graphics power of 250 watts and only needs a 650-watt PSU.</p><p>Nvidia says the RTX 5070 Ti will be 2x faster than the RTX 4070 Ti, and the RTX 5070 should be twice as fast as the RTX 4070. Huang even claimed on stage at CES that the RTX 5070 will deliver “RTX 4090 performance at $549,” but this will undoubtedly be because of DLSS 4 improvements and not pure rasterization performance.</p><p>Nvidia is also bringing its RTX 50-series to laptops, with the RTX 5090 laptop GPU debuting with 24GB of GDDR7 memory. The RTX 5080 laptop GPU will ship with 16GB of GDDR7 memory, the RTX 5070 Ti with 12GB of GDDR7 memory, and the RTX 5070 with just 8GB of GDDR7 memory. RTX 50-series laptops will be available starting in March from a variety of PC makers.</p><div><figcaption><em>RTX 50-series laptops are coming in March.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>Huang demonstrated Nvidia’s RTX Blackwell GPUs with a real-time rendering demo at the beginning of the company’s CES keynote today. The demo included new RTX Neural Materials, RTX Neural Faces, text to animation, and even DLSS 4. “The new generation of DLSS can generate beyond frames, it can predict the future,” says Huang. “We used GeForce to enable AI, and now AI is revolutionizing GeForce.”</p><p>Nvidia’s new RTX Neural Shaders can be used to compress textures in games, while RTX Neural Faces aim to improve face quality using generative AI. The next generation of DLSS includes Multi Frame Generation, which generates up to three additional frames per traditional frame and can multiply frame rates by up to 8x over traditional rendering, according to Nvidia.</p><p>DLSS 4 also includes a real-time application of transformers to improve image quality, reduce ghosting, and add higher detail in motion. The DLSS 4 upgrade will even work on existing RTX GPUs, as features have been upgraded to the new transformer AI models.
