			<p>Grit &amp; Valor 1949 is set, fairly obviously in 1949, but it’s not the 1949 that our grandparents experienced. This is an alternate history, and one where WW2 still rages on. It’s also an alternate history drawing on Steampunk ideas and aesthetics, where battlefields clamour with the sounds of mechs and unlikely weaponry. Grit &amp; Valor takes this setting and turns it into a real-time tactical roguelite, fusing ideas from games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/19/advance-wars-1-2-reboot-review/">Advance Wars</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/31/into-the-breach-review/">Into The Breach</a> with small scale RTS games like Bad North into a new, mostly cohesive, whole.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grit and Valor - 1949 | Official Console Launch Trailer: XBOX X|S and PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sv2Cs_oZhl4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You’re part of the Resistance, fighting back against the evil Axis from a small island outpost off the coast of Scotland. Your task is to liberate each region from its Axis occupiers, forcing them from the British Isles, back into France and Western Europe, before finally facing the enemy’s seat of power in New Germany. Each area has multiple stages, and multiple pathways through which, as this is a roguelite, you’ll be hoping to pick up the best enhancements along the way.</p>


<p>The tutorial is suspiciously straightforward, and extremely quick before sending you over the top into live combat. While you move around each battlefield by stomping through a fixed grid, you don’t select individual targets for regular attacks; instead, you rely on your mechs targeting the nearest villain in their sights.</p>
<p>Just like Fire Emblem, there’s a weapon triangle at work here to distinguish who will have the upper hand, so Ballistic Class is strong against Fire, Fire is strong against Explosives, and Explosives beat out Ballistics.</p>


<p>Each Mech has a different class then, but also its own pilot, with each driver having their own special ability to help you out in the field. Archie Miller, the chap in control during the tutorial, has a Jump Jet ability that lets you leap across the battlefield and cause damage to enemies in a wide area, while Emilia Rochefort can heal her Mech. The third starting pilot, Jan Nowak, can lay traps, leaving mines in the path of advancing enemy vehicles. You need to know when to deploy these skills, not least because they have a limited number of uses, and they’ll often mean the difference between success and failure.</p>
<p>During each battle, there are crate drops containing enhancements for your mechs. Each crate gives you three options to choose from, with different levels of rarity denoting the most powerful or unique abilities. You might also pick up repair packs here, letting you regain some health for one of your team, while you steadily try to create an arsenal that will see you through to the very end.</p>
<p>That’s unlikely to happen in one run. As you fight you’re also earning currency to spend on permanent upgrades, and it’s these that will fundamentally raise your chances of success.</p>

<p>There’s a lot going on in Grit &amp; Valor’s diorama-like levels. You have to juggle grabbing objectives, taking cover, protecting your Command unit, and taking out the Axis forces, all the while making sure you’ve got the best matchups going on through the weapon triangle. As it takes place in real time, it can be a little chaotic, and while the pad controls do a good job, I can’t help but feel that a mouse makes these things easier. Now, if they happen to drop a Switch 2 patch with mouse support, that might be the perfect answer.</p>
<p>It’s all a lot of fun though. While the game on Switch isn’t as detailed or high resolution as on other platforms, I still appreciate the Steampunk comic-like visuals. The action is easy to parse, but challenging, and there’s a clear sense of progression, as every run grants you new Mechs, new parts or the ability to upgrade something that will make your life easier next time out. It’s fast-paced and it doesn’t waste your time, and as a Switch game, it’s an ideal title to pick up and play, get a run in, or a couple of stages within one, and then head off to do something else.</p>

<p>There were a couple of times where the game crashed while playing, with it soft-locking in the menus and preventing me from advancing. However, a quick reset let me progress, and it didn’t get in the way of things too much – it’s possible that it might have been an oddity compatibility support when playing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>By its very nature, Grit &amp; Valor becomes quite repetitive. It’s carried through by your steadily expanding arsenal and abilities, and that search for an ideal run into enemy territory, but you have to be completely sold on the fundamental gameplay early on. Personally, I think it pulls it off, with the visuals and alternate history setting really drawing me in, but I could see some players losing faith with the repetition and chaos-tinged battles.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-mode-out-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-%E2%80%98deep-of-night%E2%80%99-mode-is-out-now.1294446/</guid>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-high-difficulty-game-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> yesterday, FromSoftware has now released a free update for Elden Ring Nightreign, adding the brand new Deep of Night mode to the game.</p>



<p>This was designed as an endgame challenge for experienced players. Deep of Night can hide the Nightlord and Shifting Earth from players until battle begins. Enemies across Limveld will be more challenging, and random enemies will be mutated, potentially presenting greater dangers to players, who, however, can oppose these strengthened foes with new weapon enhancements. Beware, though, as some of these weapon enhancements could also have detrimental effects, such as increasing the amount of damage players take. </p>



<p>Players must be highly selective if they hope to survive the night and ultimately defeat the Nightlord. Three new relic slots have been introduced exclusively for Depths Relics, a new reward players can earn while playing the Deep of Night game mode. These Depths Relics can provide powerful enhancements, but, as with the new variant weapons, they also come at a cost. Victory will require skillful calculation and execution. Deep of Night mode is meant explicitly for the bravest Nightfarers, providing an extreme challenge and showing players the darkest depths of the game, including the dreadful possibility of unknowingly facing an Everdark Sovereign Nightlord.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is the latest in a series of successful game releases by FromSoftware. While not quite as critically acclaimed as its predecessor, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already sold five million units in the first month of its release</a>. Meanwhile, the Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree reached 10 million units.</p>



<p>Even Hollywood noticed the franchise's popularity. In late May, a live-action film was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rumored-a24-elden-ring-movie-with-alex-garland-writing-and-directing-is-reportedly-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>; it will be produced by A24 and Bandai Namco. Alex Garland, the man behind 28 Days Later, Dredd, Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War, and Warfare, is attached to direct and write the script. </p>

<p>EA has also made some changes to the game's ranked competitive Road to the College Football Playoffs mode, to make the experience feel more competitive and reward skilled play. All players will now earn more Rank Points overall, especially in lower divisions, which will be balanced by a lower starting rank. Some players may find their ranks moved down as a result of the update. EA is also making improvements to playoff qualifications to reward strong performance, as well as making win modifiers like Away wins or lower-tier victories more significant.</p><p>Alongside the many gameplay updates, fixes, and improvements, CFB26 will also get some updates to the aesthetics and feel of the game. There are over 30 new additions in equipment and uniforms, including some teams' new season uniforms that didn't make it in in time for the game's launch. As the video game evolves to match the real college football season, EA is also adding over 50 new audio commentary intros for rivalry games, covering some of the 2025 season's most anticipated matchups.</p><p>As a last little bonus in this title update, CFB26 is getting a handful of new marching band pop covers, including contemporary pop hits like Apple and Espresso, as well as some older favorites including Misery Business and Get Lucky.</p><p>Check out everything that's new, changed, and fixed in the September 11 College Football 26 <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-26/news/campus-huddle-title-update-september-11th?utm_campaign=cf26_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_cfb26-title-update-4&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=86084&amp;ts=1757570124033" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">title update</a> below:</p><h2>College Football 26 Title Update September 11th</h2><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Pass Blocking &amp; Pass Rush</h3><ul><li>Added option to set Base Protection by default.</li><li><strong>DEV NOTE:</strong> <em>For players who don’t want built-in pass protections on passing plays, we have included a new Coaching Adjustment to allow players to elect Base Protection as the default protection for all dropback passing plays.

This prevents scenarios where players could reach the playoffs with a losing record in lower divisions.</li><li><strong>Division Rank Adjustments:</strong> If you’re currently in one of the affected divisions, your rank may be moved down to reflect the new starting points until you begin your next season.</li><li><strong>Improved Playoff Qualification:</strong> These changes ensure that strong performance is rewarded, especially in higher divisions. Previously, playing mostly Tier 1 matchups could make it difficult to reach the playoffs even with a great record.</li><li><strong>Win Modifiers Matter More:</strong> The base Rank Points for a win are increased, making modifiers like Away wins or victories as a lower tier team even more valuable.</li><li><strong>No Change to Win Requirements:</strong> The number of wins needed to move up or stay in a division remains the same.</li><li><strong>More Time to Compete:</strong> Based on player feedback, we are making all RTCFP games 4 minutes a quarter vs 3 minutes so that you have enough time to overcome Home Field Advantage.</li></ul><h2>Why Are We Making These Changes?</h2><p>Our goal is to make playoff qualification more competitive and rewarding, while ensuring that every win counts—especially in tougher matchups. These updates will help create a more balanced and exciting Road to the College Football Playoffs experience.</p><h2>Presentation</h2><h3>Equipment</h3><p><strong>New Equipment Pieces:</strong></p><ul><li>6 New Axiom Masks</li><li>Adidas Ultra Boost Mono Cleats</li><li>Adidas Adizero Electric 2 Exotic Speed Cleats</li></ul><p><strong>New Uniforms &amp; Uniform Pieces:</strong></p><ul><li>Air Force Space Force Alternate Uniform</li><li>Central Michigan University Sleeve Numbers</li><li>East Carolina University Purple Fleck Helmet</li><li>Florida International University Vice City 2023 Uniform</li><li>Fresno State Camouflage Helmet</li><li>Fresno State White USA Helmet</li><li>Mississippi State 2023 Throwback Uniform</li><li>Mississippi State Black Alternate Uniform</li><li>Mississippi State White Interlocking Helmet</li><li>Old Dominion University Blue Helmet</li><li>Oregon State Camouflage Uniform</li><li>Sam Houston State Home Jersey</li><li>San Diego State University New Home and Away Uniform</li><li>University of Alabama at Birmingham New Home and Away Uniform</li><li>University of California Paw Print Helmets</li><li>University of Kansas Blue Alternate Uniform</li><li>University of Kansas White Alternate Uniform</li><li>University of Louisiana at Monroe Black Alternate Helmet</li><li>University of Nebraska Black Uniforms</li><li>University of Nebraska Blackshirts (2020) Uniform</li><li>University of New Mexico New Home and Away Uniform</li><li>University of New Mexico Red Lobo Script Helmet</li><li>University of New Mexico Turquoise Alternate Uniform</li><li>University of New Mexico White Lobo Script Helmet</li><li>University of Virginia Stars and Stripes Helmet</li><li>University of Washington 2022 White and Gold Set</li><li>University of Washington Throwback Uniform</li><li>Western Michigan Bumpers</li><li>Names now appear on the New Mexico State University Crimson, Black, and White Jerseys</li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><p>We hope you’ve enjoyed the Pop Song Covers that were part of our original launch.

"They then promptly tell on themselves across social media, asking 'Why did this happen?'"</p><p>"These are our mitigations at work, ramped up and powered by new detection systems that have been extremely effective at disrupting bad actors in real-time," continued the developer. "We don't hit every cheater with these mitigations; most are banned upon detection. But in August alone, over 55,000 cheaters were disrupted by Call of Duty's mitigations."</p><p>After nerfing cheaters in action, the developer collects info about the users and permanently ban them.

            <p>
Nintendo has been granted a new patent in the US, following its ongoing patent infringement lawsuit with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair.
</p>
<p>
The new patent, granted last week by the US Patent and Trademark Office, covers the gameplay mechanic of summoning a sub-character to let it fight another. The patent application was filed in March 2023 and has been granted without objection (thanks <a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/">Games Fray</a>).
</p>
<p>
Such a patent would not only implicate Palworld with its monster summoning and battling, but many similar games from long-standing rival Digimon, to the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/honkai-nexus-anima-revealed-a-spin-off-creature-collector-from-genshin-impact-studio">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a> and DokeV, as well as indies like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/temtem">Temtem</a> and Cassette Beasts.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of steps in the patent pertaining to the gameplay mechanic, as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li>A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored therein a game program, the game program causing a processor of an information processing apparatus to execute:</li>
<li>performing control of moving a player character on a field in a virtual space, based on a movement operation input;</li>
<li>performing control of causing a sub character to appear on the field, based on a first operation input, and</li>
<li>when an enemy character is placed at a location where the sub character is caused to appear, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a first mode in which the battle proceeds based on an operation input, and</li>
<li>when the enemy character is not placed at the location where the sub character is caused to appear, starting automatic control of automatically moving the sub character that has appeared; and</li>
<li>performing control of moving the sub character in a predetermined direction on the field, based on a second operation input, and, when the enemy character is placed at a location of a designation, controlling a battle between the sub character and the enemy character by a second mode in which the battle automatically proceeds.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>
All of these steps must be followed for Nintendo to have a case, but in theory it could launch an infringement lawsuit against a number of games with this patent now in place.
</p>
<p>But is this patent enforceable through further lawsuits from Nintendo?</p>
<p>
Don McGowan, former chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company, believes the patent will likely be ignored. "I wish Nintendo and Pokémon good luck when the first other developer just entirely ignores this patent and, if those companies sue that developer, the developer shows decades of prior art," he told Eurogamer, adding: "This isn't <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-now-allowed-auxiliary-mini-games-during-loading-screens">Bandai Namco with the loading screen patent</a>".</p><p>"The filing for such patent protection indicates that Nintendo does intend to pursue a legal strategy in defending itself against entrants in the pocket monster genre," games industry lawyer Richard Hoeg told Eurogamer. "But that strategy may or may not involve lawsuits, as the 'muddying of the waters' effected by the patents existence may be enough to deter investment in and creation of competitors.  That is, if Nintendo looks like it <em>could</em> pounce, that may be enough. No actual pouncing required."</p>
<p>What's more, the patent is broad and Nintendo won't want to jeopardise seeing it narrowed in the context of a legal challenge, Hoeg explained.</p>
<p>"So yes, it's enforceable in so far as it has been granted," said Hoeg, "but Nintendo likely knows it 'got away with one' here and would prefer not to make a court actually sign off."</p>
<p>What's more worrying for Hoeg is whether the USPTO is "up to the task" when it comes to games patents. "Law and technology are often strange bedfellows, and in my opinion the patent office has appeared out of its depth on evaluating video games for quite some time," said Hoeg. "It may be time for reform there."</p>
<p>
At the least, the patent is certainly worrying for the games industry in the face of creativity and developer freedom.
</p>
<p>
Already Pocketpair has altered gameplay in Palworld as part of its ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">disputing the claims of copyright infringement</a>.
</p>
<p>The patent is also well-timed ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Nintendo's forthcoming Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, due out on 16th October.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' DLC Claws of Awaji will be ready to dive into very soon, and in anticipation Ubisoft is issuing a new update for the base game.</p>
<p>This update, which is scheduled to go live later today, will include a level cap increase, upgrades for your hideout, the ability to fast-forward the time of day (hurrah!) and new Ezio themed Project Rewards.</p>
<p>As for Claws of Awaji, that's coming on 16th September, as paid DLC (though those who pre-ordered Assassin's Creed Shadows will get it for free). On its release, Claws of Awaji will introduce a new region, a new weapon and abilities, new outfits and legendary gear, a new enemy faction and bosses, and a new chapter of Shadow's story. The expansion is said to be adding over 10 hours of content to the game.</p>

<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Assassin's Creed Shadows Title Update 1.1.1, to give it its full name, below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>PATCH SIZES: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PS5: 12.94 GB</li>
<li>Xbox Series X|S: 33 GB</li>
<li>MAC: 24 GB</li>
<li>PC: 42 GB</li>
<li>Steam: 17 GB</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PATCH HIGHLIGHTS </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New expansion: Claws of Awaji </li>
</ul>
<p>A storm is coming.</p>
<p>A new threat rises from across Osaka Bay as rumors surface of a hidden blade wielding shinobi, and of a long-lost relic. Naoe and Yasuke journey to a new land in search of answers, but find themselves surrounded by danger, ensnared in the Claws of Awaji.</p>
<p>In this expansion to Assassin's Creed Shadows, discover a new island region dominated by the Sanzoku Ippa, a nefarious faction intent on uncovering the final Regalia. Avoid traps and ambushes as you track the legendary Fujibayashi Tsuyu, and as Naoe, master the new Bo staff to eliminate enemies with tactical efficiency. New legendary gear, skills and abilities also await across more than 10 hours of additional content.</p>
<p><em>We also would like to inform MacOS users eligible for the Claws of Awaji DLC that the content may not be accessible immediately after launching the game for the first time following the release of the DLC.</em></p>
<p><em>To resolve this, please launch the game while connected online, then close it and reboot—either online or offline—to ensure the DLC becomes available.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>New free story quest: Go with the Bo</li>
</ul>
<p>Join Junjiro in his quest to meet a legendary Bo Master and learn more about the Bo staff, a dynamic new weapon type perfectly suited to Naoe's acrobatic fighting style. Upon finishing the quest, you will receive a Bo to use across your adventures.</p>
<p>Originally developed exclusively for the Claws of Awaji expansion, we thought this weapon was way too cool not to share with everyone... for FREE! You get a Bo! And you! And you at the back! Everyone gets a Bo, coming September 16th.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level Cap Increase</li>
</ul>
<p>To support the launch of the Claws of Awaji expansion we've raised the level cap to 100, giving players more room to grow and more options to customize their builds.</p>
<ul>
<li>New Hideout Upgrades</li>
</ul>
<p>With the new update, each unique building now includes two additional upgrade levels, bringing a total of 20 new enhancements, alongside three new Hideout levels.</p>
<p>These upgrades introduce valuable bonuses that accelerate Hideout growth, improve crafting capability by making Gold more accessible, and directly enhance Naoe, Yasuke, and their allies, making them more effective in both combat and exploration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Advance Time of Day</li>
</ul>
<p>By upgrading the Nando to level two, the player will gain the ability to meditate and skip time forward to the next 6 o'clock (AM or PM). To activate meditation, find a safe location and hold the up button (L on keyboard). This allows Naoe and Yasuke to prepare for nighttime assault and be ready to strike [#@!%&amp;*] Castle at night.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved Scouts</li>
</ul>
<p>Upgrading the Study to level four now allows Scouts to reveal both Viewpoints and Safehouses. Discovering Safehouses is especially valuable, as it enables Naoe and Yasuke to join the action more quickly by reducing their travel time.</p>
<p>And with the Kakurega upgraded to level four, uncovering all Viewpoints within a province will also reveal the entire province automatically, giving players full visibility of its terrain and strategic locations. No more fog!</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced Gear Quality</li>
</ul>
<p>By upgrading the Forge to level six, Naoe and Yasuke gain the ability to enhance their gear to new quality tiers: Mythic and Artifact. Once an item reaches a new quality, it can be further upgraded through eight additional levels to unlock its full potential.</p>
<p>Epic items can be transformed into Mythic items, which improve their stats with each level, add a Boosted Stat if one wasn't present, and boost non-legendary perks, including the one in the engraving slot, by 50 percent at level five and 100 percent at level nine. (For perks related to damage reduction, refill ration, ammo, or tools, this bonus is halved, capping at a 50 percent increase at level nine.)</p>
<p>Legendary items, on the other hand, can evolve into Artifact items, which not only increase their stats with each level but also receive additional Boosted Stats at levels three, seven, and twice at level nine. Engraved non-legendary perks are also boosted like the Mythic items.</p>
<p>These powerful enhancements are designed as long-term goals, supporting players through the increasing difficulty of subsequent New Game+ cycles and other upcoming challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>New Project: Sanctuary</li>
</ul>
<p>We are releasing a new Project available in the Animus HUB, called Sanctuary, in which you can get Ezio themed gear, kusarigama, and much more! Activate the new Project, complete Anomalies and progress through the rewards like previously released ones.</p>
<ul>
<li>New Anomalies in Awaji</li>
</ul>
<p>With the release of the Claws of Awaji expansion, we added new Anomalies available in that region, with one available in every schedule. These Anomalies are only available for players who have the expansion installed.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL HIGHLIGHTS </strong></p>

<p>Ubisoft recently celebrated welcoming five million players to Assassin's Creed Shadows. Along with those five million assassins, at the time there had also been 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted. Meanwhile, players have travelled 1bn kilometers since the game was released in March. And it sounds like Assassin's Creed Shadows may soon be welcoming more players to Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">with a Switch 2 port seemingly being on the cards</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Assassin's Creed news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-its-finally-go-time-for-netflixs-live-action-assassins-creed-series">earlier this year it was revealed that Netflix's live action adaptation is finally a-go</a>, five years after it was first announced.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-26-launches-on-november-4-powered-by-unity-and-featuring-big-improvements.1294416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>SEGA and Sports Interactive have unveiled Football Manager 26 and its release date. The football management simulation game will be released on November 4 on PC and Mac, while Football Manager 26 Console launches simultaneously on Xbox Series S|X, Xbox One, and PlayStation 5. FM26 and FM 26 Console will be available on PC and Xbox, respectively, to Game Pass subscribers on day one. November 4 will also mark the debut of Football Manager 26 Mobile as a Netflix exclusive. Lastly, Football Manager 2026 Touch will be released one month later digitally for the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>You may recall that last year's edition, Football Manager 25, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-announced-launches-november-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch on November 26</a> but was ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-has-been-canceled-to-focus-on-next-installment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> to double down on creating a better version for this year. Well, at least on paper, it appears to have paid off as there's a laundry list of new features.</p>



<p>Chiefly, there is the engine switch from Sports Interactive's proprietary engine to the widely used Unity engine. This allows for a much greater level of fidelity when spectating matches than before, thanks to new volumetric animations from real-life matches. Despite the engine change, FM26, FM26 Console, and FM26 Touch will all launch with save game compatibility for Football Manager 2024 and Football Manager 2023.</p>



<p>The dated user interface has been refreshed to give players greater control and influence over make-or-break decisions in every career. Designed to be more intuitive for everyone from newcomers to veterans, the Football Manager 26 User Interface supports improvements in tactics, scouting, and recruitment. Another big addition is the long-awaited arrival of Women’s Football, which is seamlessly integrated into the FM ecosystem thanks to the most comprehensive database of its kind and a host of licensed competitions that Sports Interactive and SEGA will reveal in the weeks ahead of November 4. Authenticity has been further enhanced, too, with the newly licensed Premier League taking the spotlight in this regard. </p>

<p>Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson said: </p>



<p><em>I’m honoured and delighted to be revealing Football Manager 26’s release date today. Setting Sports Interactive up for the next twenty years and beyond was an enormous undertaking but I couldn’t be prouder of the efforts of the whole team over the past two years. FM26 represents a landmark release in our quest to produce football management perfection and the whole studio is really excited to share it with the world.</em></p>



<p>Football Manager 26 can be pre-ordered now at £49.99/€59.99/$59.99, although select digital retailers provide a 10% discount. Lastly, PC and Mac users who pre-order through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3551340/Football_Manager_26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/football-manager-26-080e85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a> can look forward to two weeks of advanced access to the game.</p>

                <p>College football players who lent their names and likenesses to both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-25-review-university-of-madden/1900-6418261/" data-ref-id="1900-6418261">EA Sports College Football 25</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-26-review-sophomore-success/1900-6418383/" data-ref-id="1900-6418383">EA Sports College Football 26</a> reportedly received a pay bump from $600 to $1,500 per player. However, that may not be enough for players when EA begins putting together the deals for College Football 27.</p><p>According to <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/group-that-facilitated-nil-deal-for-football-video-game-now-says-its-not-enough/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Front Office Sports</a>, the issue at hand is revenue sharing. EA's Madden NFL and other pro sports games include players when dividing the revenue. However, EA's deal for the College Football games only included extra payments if the athletes appeared on the cover or if they were involved with the marketing of the game.</p><p>FOS notes that EA also left out the language in the contract that allowed college players to opt out of the deal, but the company told Front Office Sports that players can still do so if they contact EA directly. OneTeam Partners--the organization that worked with EA to line up the college players--has shared a statement calling for revenue sharing in the next installment of the series.</p><p>"OneTeam does not dictate the terms of the NIL agreements between college players and EA," a OneTeam spokesperson told FOS. "The decision to remain silent on the opt-out was EA's unilateral choice. We continue to work with EA to influence its NIL License agreement, but these changes were implemented by EA ... The higher payouts in this year's title show the progress, but it's not enough. We continue to advocate for meaningful revenue sharing for college athletes from all partners."</p><p>Earlier this year, Pathway Sports and Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-college-football-26-could-offer-bigger-payouts-to-players/1100-6529500/" data-ref-id="1100-6529500">reached out to college players directly</a> for their name, image, and likeness rights for $1,500, which was the rate EA reportedly ended up paying for College Football 26. Since there isn't a union for college athletes, neither OneTeam nor Pathway Sports can negotiate deals on behalf of all college players.</p><p>The report adds that OneTeam objected to EA's terms for this year's College Football 26, but was contractually obligated to present those deals to the athletes as written. Without a union in their corner, college football players may not have the leverage to get revenue sharing from EA in the immediate future.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-gets-official-details-testing-starts-this-week-on-bf-labs.1294395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, the Battlefield 6 development team <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> the long-rumored (and recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-map-leaked-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a>) Battle Royale mode, which will begin testing this week via the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-labs-testing-environment-announced-first-pre-alpha-footage-of-next-entry-in-the-series-shown-in-new-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs platform</a>. The goal is to infuse this highly popular game mode with Battlefield DNA, including destructible environments, classes, and more.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the map has been designed specifically for the Battle Royale experience. It features a diverse array of tactical points of interest, each with a distinct layout and theme that offers unique gameplay opportunities. During a Battle Royale match, players can find common vehicles around the map and eventually unlock powerful armored vehicles. The goal is to provide users with more ways to traverse the map early in a match and create interesting combined arms action, again playing to the trademark strength of the Battlefield franchise.</p>



<p>Destruction will include anything from creating pathways through walls all the way to toppling whole buildings, which is definitely something other Battle Royale games don't really have. The initial test will host a hundred players split into twenty-five squads of four, each vying to be the last squad standing. Communication tools include text, VoIP, and pings. To keep their squad alive, players can count on the Support class's revives and the Mobile Redeploy option.</p>



<p>The Battle Royale subgenre's defining feature is the ever-shrinking 'circle'. In Battlefield's twist, this will be a fire ring that instantly kills anything it touches, pushing players to always be inside it at a safe distance. In most other games of this kind, the circle merely damages players at a not-so-deadly rate, which players sometimes exploit to go around enemies and kill them. </p>



<p>Ahead of a Battlefield Battle Royale match, each squad selects the classes, another distinguishing feature compared to most games. The chosen class is not changeable during the matches. Players begin with two default gadgets from their class and level up during each match; XP is earned by defeating an opposing player or completing missions. Intel Cases will be a particularly juicy target since they provide experience to the whole squad. Leveling up a class provides access to new traits. For example, the Assault class can equip an armor plate faster.</p>



<p>Throughout a Battlefield Battle Royale match, players explore the map, complete missions, and battle for loot. There will be five rarity tiers of weapons to loot, as well as attachments, throwables, gadgets, strike packages, armor, upgrade kits, and custom drops of favorite weapons. These items can be found in general or class-specific loot crates, by unlocking armored trucks, through mission rewards, or by looting defeated enemies.</p>



<p>The game will constantly assign missions to squads, asking them to complete objectives that offer extra rewards, giving them a competitive edge over their opponents. Tasks range from unlocking high-value caches to planting explosives to eliminate mission-critical targets. Mission details will include the available rewards, such as a weapons cache, vehicle key, or mobile redeploy unit. Once the mission objective is complete, the rewards are airdropped in, which means other squads may swoop in and steal them if those who earned the rewards aren't careful.</p>



<p>While the developers are focused on delivering the core Battlefield 6 experience first on October 10, it is clear that a well-received Battle Royale mode could make all the difference in reaching <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA's lofty goal of 100 million players</a>. Once ready, this mode might be released as a standalone and free experience, just like Warzone is to Call of Duty, but it's too early to say for sure at this stage.</p>

            <p>Early start today! One of those mornings where my mind woke up before my body. We're back with another day of video games, gathering all of the news and events here, while talking about them with you.</p>
<p>By the way, thank you for your feedback yesterday. We're gathering it to help shape and drive change.</p>
<p>But onto today, and a question that formed in my brain this morning, while sipping coffee and looking at my dormant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> beside my television. How many of you are using your Switch 2? Does it get frequent use or occasional use? Or, perhaps, none at all.</p>

He seems quiet and cool at first glance, but he’s actually fiercely competitive. He shows his feelings through actions. If someone messes with him, he’ll settle it with a fight. Though he was quiet and not well-known among his peers, he demonstrated considerable skill in combat by defeating several top-tier fighters from neighboring middle and high schools during his junior high days. Apparently, he intended to settle down after entering high school. However, about a month after enrolling at Kitafushi, He witnessed a female student from Kitafuji being harassed by Douju delinquents. He beat the delinquents to the ground and rescued the female student, and rescued her. This incident was the catalyst that prompted him to join the fight against Doshu.</li><li><strong>Midou Batsuya</strong> – Kitahamahushimi High School, 1st grade. They are the life of the party and often laugh things off while solving problems. Their strong sense of justice and dependable nature earns them the deep trust of those around them. About a month after enrolling at Kitafushi, he witnessed a male student being harassed by Doshu delinquents and stepped in to help. He apologized, took a few light punches and insults, and calmed the situation down. Later, he lured the three students who had harassed him into an alley and beat them up. Renmaru is my childhood friend. We were partners in junior high, but stopped seeing each other after an incident in our third year. I know he’s at Kitafushi High, but we haven’t interacted since I enrolled.</li></ul><p>More to be announced.</p><p><strong>System</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Brawl Battle <a title="Genres > Action [3,026 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> x <a title="Genres > Roguelite [286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">Roguelite</a></strong> – Players control Renmaru and storm into Doushuu alongside his partner, Batsuya!

<p>"We are working on Switch 2 stuff by the way. I don’t think that needs to be secret anymore. We finally have… thanks to our friends at Nintendo, we are on it, and there’s a lot of amazing things that are happening…</p>
<p>"…It is a very impressive piece of kit. Our tech leads are working on and are very excited about it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Digital Extremes Creative Director Rebecca Ford added to this, mentioning how the team would potentially capture gameplay of this particular version of Warframe and share it in an upcoming development stream.</p>
<p>This online third-person action shooter was previously released on the original Switch in 2018, and at the time, we called it a remarkable technical feat for Nintendo's hybrid hardware. This particular port was handled by the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/12/feature_sitting_down_with_panic_button_nintendo_switchs_most_important_third-party_studio">talented team at Panic Button</a>.</p>

<p>Last month, this same collection of classics received a "free title update" - unlocking additional characters in <strong>Street Fighter Alper 3 UPPER</strong> and also adding quality of life upgrades, new artwork and more remix tracks. Now, this package has been updated again for all platforms (including Switch).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in July,<a href="https://aftermath.site/civil-war-middle-age" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Riley went public with some very important news</a>: as a newly middle-aged man, he had developed a passion for historical armed conflicts, and was beginning to express it, as so many middle-aged men do, by playing dusty video games about them.</p><p>In an attempt to help coach him through this (sometimes) difficult transition from one stage of life to the next, myself and some other strategy game nerds got Riley into the hotseat for an episode of<a href="https://www.idlethumbs.net/3ma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Three Moves Ahead ("the leading strategy game themed podcast on the internet")</a>, in which we used Riley's growing thirst for the Civil War--and attempt to satisfy that thirst by playing a real-time strategy game about it, a genre he's not exactly comfortable with--as an opportunity to welcome him to the fold, to take him by the shoulder, ease him into his seat at the table.</p><p>Which was (hopefully) useful for Riley, but also for <em>us</em>, because it was a chance to re-examine the field of strategy games through fresh eyes, pondering everything from accessibility to core gameplay mechanics. Riley had been frustrated at the repeated death of his infantry in a tutorial mission, for example, and while that <em>could </em>have been an opportunity to make fun of him, it turns out he had uncovered a shortfall in so much strategy gaming, where gameplay mechanics and buttons are explained to the player in great detail, but not other, vital, prior-knowledge-taken-for-granted stuff like infantry tactics.</p><p>From there, the discussion moves to the meatier topic of playing strategy games based on conflicts like this and the Second World War, where at least one of the factions is, for want of a better term,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h242eDB84zY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the baddies</a>. And what it means to have<a href="https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a little fun moving guys around a map</a> when those conquests and victories on the battlefield had very real consequences.</p><p>A subject on which I'd like to make a little apology while I'm here! I say on this podcast that<a href="https://aftermath.site/order-of-battle-ww2-turn-based-tactics-game-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Order Of Battle</em>, my favourite empty-calories WW2 tactics game</a>, took a somewhat distant approach to depicting the German armed forces. After re-playing a German campaign since, that is <em>not </em>true! You unlock the Waffen SS as a whole sub-faction, can occupy cities and fly its little skull flag over them, and yikes, that is an error I would very much like to correct on the record, thank you!</p><p>Anyway, I'm saying all this because I really enjoyed being a part of the discussion, and think anyone interested in strategy games--and especially the underlying politics and sensibilities of playing them--<a href="https://www.idlethumbs.net/3ma/episodes/civil-war-midlife-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should check the episode out</a>!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/unikat-32-33-indie-games-publisher-marketing"><h3>Running A Video Games Publisher AND Marketing Agency Sounds Absolutely Exhausting</h3></a><p>'Seeing all of your different efforts, ones that are synced by the work of many people, all being unveiled at once is a cool feeling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-author-immortal-image-comics-interview"><h3>The Author Immortal Is A Metanarrative Isekai Comic That Explores The Messiness Of Separating The Art From The Artist</h3></a><p>Amid canceled creators, cultural reckonings, and A.I.’s rise, Frank Barbiere and Morgan Beem’s new Image Comics series invites readers to reclaim fantasy and confront who stories truly serve

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Acclaim is back, and earlier today, it welcomed in a "new era" with its very own showcase. If you didn't tune in, don't worry – we've got you covered here on Nintendo Life with a quick round up.</p>
<p>Although there is only one game confirmed for a Nintendo platform at the time of writing (that's <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/basketball_classics">Basketball Classics</a></strong> for the Switch), there were a bunch of <em>other</em> "exciting" new games announced that will be getting console releases in the future. However, specific platforms for each of these titles have not been confirmed just yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"We’re ecstatic to relaunch Acclaim with a lineup that captures our legacy of bold creativity and delivers fresh, unforgettable experiences,”</em> said Alex Josef, CEO of Acclaim. <em>“These games are just the beginning of our mission to redefine fun for players everywhere."</em></p>

                <p>Next week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is getting its first DLC expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-expansion-launches-in-september/1100-6533445/" data-ref-id="1100-6533445">Claws of Awaji</a>. But before Naoe and Yasuke take on the Sanzoku Ippa in a new island region on September 16, Ubisoft is releasing the 1.1.1 update for Assassin's Creed Shadows on September 11.</p><p>As part of the Claws of Awaji storyline, Naoe and Yasuke's ally, Junjiro, goes on a quest to meet a legendary bo master, which will unlock a bo staff for Naoe. However, Ubisoft's new update will give the bo staff to every player in the game for free--even if they don't have the DLC--starting on September 16.</p><p>The previous update raised the level cap to 80, but <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/62imkAfEdpZSadOqfktQHv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update 1.1.1</a> will push the cap to level 100. Players will receive two additional upgrade levels for unique buildings and three new hideout levels. For anyone who favors running stealth missions at night, upgrading to Nando level 2 will allow players to meditate and advance time to either 6 AM or 6 PM.</p><p>Scouts will now be able to reveal viewpoints and safehouses upon upgrading Study to level 4, which can help Yasuke and Naoe fast travel. Uncovering every viewpoint in a province will also get rid of the fog once players reach Kakurega level 4. That means you'll get a clear view of the entire province as you plot your next move.</p><p>Naoe and Yasuke will be able to upgrade their gear to Mythic and Artifact tiers by upgrading Forge to level 6. Each item can be upgraded eight additional levels once it reaches a new quality. As an example, epic items can evolve into mythic items, while legendary items can be upgraded into artifact items.</p><p>Additionally, a new project called Sanctuary has been added to the Animus HUB, which will offer fans the chance to get Ezio-themed gear. For players who have the Claws of Awaji expansion, the Awaji region will have some new anomalies that can be discovered.</p><p>The rest of the Assassin's Creed Shadows 1.1.1 udpate notes can be found below.</p><h3>Uncapped Cutscenes</h3><ul><li>Cutscenes are no longer limited to 30 FPS (PC Only).</li></ul><h2>Bug Fixes</h2><h3>General</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the game crashed during the cutscene of the "Chained" rift.</li><li>Fixed various localization issues.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the vertical sliding sound effect continued if you switched characters during a slide.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some tutorials repeated themselves after unlocking Yasuke.</li></ul><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the Naginata Ronin were not vulnerable after using the Vault ability.</li><li>Addressed an issue where the Scale of the Koi and Soaring Tatsu trinkets were not functioning as expected.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the aiming reticle option "Only While Aiming" was missing from the settings.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a persistent "New Item" notification appeared after looting weapons from scout supply chests.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to start horse archery in Iga because the quest giver had moved locations.

                <p>This week, Apple unveiled its next wave of hardware, including four new iPhone models and the next generations of the AirPods Pro and Apple Watch--and Apple users who are looking to grab the new releases can preorder several of the devices now. While the new iPhone 17 and iPhone Air are easily the marquee announcements of the presentation, we'll have to wait until September 12 for preorders to open. In the meantime, preorders for the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AirPods Pro 3</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Watch Series 11</a> are now open at multiple online retailers. Both devices launch on September 19, so you only have a few days left to reserve these devices ahead of release. If you're interested in doing so, we'll go over where you can preorder the AirPods Pro 3 and Apple Watch Series 11 online. </p><div title="[Various] new Apple AirPods preorders - Sept 9 2025" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4312" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] new Apple AirPods preorders - Sept 9 2025" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">AirPods Pro 3</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$249 | Releases September 19</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The new AirPods Pro 3 are a smaller, more powerful iteration of Apple's premium earbuds, featuring new functionality like in-ear audio translation powered by Apple AI. The feature is similar to the live translation features found on Google's Pixel Buds, allowing you to listen along as the earbuds translate spoken words into your language of choice in real-time. Along with audio translations, the AirPods Pro 3 can connect to iOS devices to provide text translation as well.</p><p>The other big new feature for the AirPods Pro 3 is an integrated heart rate sensor--the smallest heart rate sensor in an Apple device yet. This means you can track workouts and get additional health data tracking just from the AirPods Pro 3 alone.</p><p>There are also several spec upgrades and feature overhauls compared to previous AirPods Pro models, including 4x more effective active noise cancelling (ANC) compared to the original AirPods Pro (and twice as effective compared to the AirPods Pro 2), plus new foam-infused eartips for added passive noise isolation. They also feature enhanced 3D spatial listening and hearing aid functionality, IP57 sweat-proof and waterproof materials, and longer battery life (up to 10 hours during normal listening, or 8 hours with ANC).</p><p>The AirPods Pro 3 launch September 19 and will ship with a charging case and five eartip sizes. Preorders are available now for $250 at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Apple's online store. Best Buy is offering a few preorder bonuses, including three free months of Apple Fitness+, three months of Apple Music, and two months of Apple TV+.</p></div>                      </div><div title="[various] Apple Watch Series 11 preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4311" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[various] Apple Watch Series 11 preorders" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Apple Watch Series 11</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Starts at $399 | Releases September 19</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Apple Watch Series 11 introduces several upgrades, including a more durable design that Apple says is twice as scratch-resistant as previous models.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/cuomos-latest-strategy-to-resuscitate-his-flatlining-campaign-go-after-zohran-mamdani-for-associating-with-a-twitch-streamer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cuomo%E2%80%99s-latest-strategy-to-resuscitate-his-flatlining-campaign-go-after-zohran-mamdani-for-associating-with-a-twitch-streamer.1294278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, is currently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/nyregion/mayor-poll-mamdani-cuomo.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 20 points ahead</a> of his nearest general election rival, Andrew Cuomo, who he already obliterated during the primary. Despite this, Cuomo has yet to slither back into the cavern of slime and obscurity which most assuredly awaits him in the near future. His latest attempt to jumpstart his raspy, dying cough of a campaign? Concern trolling over Mamdani’s decision to appear on a Twitch stream earlier this year.</p><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://x.com/hollypret/status/1965469787238400019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">near the World Trade Center memorial</a>, Cuomo accepted the endorsement of a 9/11 first responder who now has cancer, Sal Turturici, and his wife, Wendi. Behind them stood two conspicuous pieces of posterboard: one displaying a picture of leftist Twitch streamer Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker and his infamous “America deserved 9/11” quote from 2019 and another with two pictures of Mamdani and Piker clasping hands during their April 2025 stream together. Sans context, which is the way these sorts of things tend to travel around the internet, this made for <a href="https://x.com/MattBinder/status/1965491149122273722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an odd scene</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.andrewcuomo.com/press/911-heroes-endorse-andrew-cuomo-mayor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a release from Cuomo’s camp</a> commemorating the occasion, Wendi lambasted Mamdani for talking to one of the few authentically consequential influencers on the left.&nbsp;</p><p>“I know firsthand what kind of leader Andrew Cuomo is,” she said. “As Governor, he fought to secure benefits for 9/11 families, and he treated our community with the respect and dignity we deserve. That’s the kind of leadership New York City needs again. … His opponent, Zohran Mamdani, proudly associates with Hasan Piker, a man who said ‘America deserved 9/11.’ To families like mine, that’s not politics, that’s life and death.&nbsp; His association with Hasan Piker disqualifies him to serve in any role for New York City, let alone one as important as Mayor.&nbsp; I am calling on Zohran Mamdani to disavow Hasan Piker and his hateful words.”</p><p>This elicited predictable headlines from the usual suspects, like the New York Post, which <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/09/us-news/9-11-family-blasts-zohran-mamdani-for-associating-with-terror-sympathizer-hasan-piker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came in extra hot</a> with “Terminally-ill 9/11 hero blasts Zohran Mamdani for associating with terror sympathizer Hasan Piker."</p><p>Piker has taken flack for his “America deserved 9/11” line for years, despite being correct. There is no point in relitigating it, so I’ll let my own book (<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Stream Big</em>, in stores now</a>) do it for me:</p><blockquote><p>In 2019, Twitch suspended [Piker’s] channel for seven days after he said, “America deserved 9/11,” igniting a full-on Fox News firestorm fronted by Republican congressman Dan Crenshaw. Granted, Piker made it personal by joking about Crenshaw’s eye during a Twitch stream (Crenshaw is a war veteran who’s missing an eye), but the bulk of his commentary was in response to Crenshaw’s assertion on an episode of the Joe Rogan podcast that prior to 9/11, Bin Laden had no reason to hate America except our “Western ideology” and that “millions” in places like Yemen and Iraq were “begging” for further United States intervention. Piker took issue with that, blaming America’s destabilizing foreign policies in the Middle East, which helped arm the groups that eventually became the Taliban and Al Qaeda, for sowing the seeds of 9/11. “We fucking totally brought it on ourselves, dude,” Piker said at the time. “We fucking did. Holy shit. Look at the way that this dipshit is running his fucking mouth, justifying genocide right now.”</p><p>This is not an uncommon set of beliefs among those who oppose American imperialism, but what Piker said—and the way he said it—was red meat to Fox’s red state crowd. Crenshaw and Fox News host Laura Ingraham largely used his comments as fodder for a conversation about how leftism is anti-American, ignoring the substance of Piker’s criticism and mocking how he spoke. It was a perfect snapshot of how difficult it can be to actually discuss thorny topics on the modern internet, especially from a socialist perspective in a country whose default is militaristic patriotism. In almost no time at all, Piker’s words were taken out of context by opportunists on Twitter and YouTube, who in turn escalated them up the opportunism food chain to Fox News. The end result was a game of telephone where everybody was screaming at the same time. Then everybody moved on, because nobody actually cared. It was all dust in the wind, all content in the end.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Since then, Piker has gone on to regularly advocate for Palestinians in the face of Israel’s genocide, which has prompted a “terror sympathizer” label from various politicans, media types, and influencers despite <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/11/un-special-committee-finds-israels-warfare-methods-gaza-consistent-genocide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observable reality</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Piker and others have called out Cuomo’s latest stunt for what it is: a sweaty, desperate ploy for relevance from a campaign that’s grasping at straws (when it’s not <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2025/07/andrew-cuomo-zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-election-adams.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copying its supposed existentially threatening enemy outright</a>).</p><p>“These guys are incredibly desperate, and they’ll get even more racist as the election nears,” Piker said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjVeNKYJy3E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a recent stream</a>. “I suspect that they’ll do a big push around 9/11 as well to try to, like, associate Zohran Mamdani with 9/11, because they’re just leaning on Islamophobia. That’s it. Zohran is Muslim. They’re trying to fucking be like: ‘Yeah, Muslim guy kind of did 9/11. His people did 9/11. Remember 9/11? His people did it. Do you want an insider to do 9/11 again?’”</p><p>“Judge me by my enemies,” Piker <a href="https://x.com/hasanthehun/status/1965541497853636821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added on Twitter</a>, referencing Cuomo. “Another <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/26/cuomo-sexual-harassment-doj-00138140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sex pest</a>.”</p><p>Other political content creators asked a salient question: Who is this even for?</p><p>"Imagine you are a New Yorker who knows who Hasan Piker is,” said the Majority Report’s Sam Seder <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOZTB4cjqYx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a recent broadcast</a>. “When you see that picture of him with Zohran Mamdani, is your reaction going to be 'Oh my god, Mamdani has shook hands or had sat down at a table with Hasan Piker?’ Is your reaction gonna be like 'Oh my god, Zohran I was thinking of voting for, but Hasan Piker? Oh my god, that's terrifying.' This is so out of touch. It's fascinating."</p><p>"They're trying to audition for Zionist donors who hate Hasan," replied cohost Emma Vigeland.&nbsp;</p><p>"The only person above the age of 45 in New York City who knows who Hasan Piker is,” said Seder, “is the guy from the ADL.”</p><p>New York City voters are <a href="https://x.com/MichaelLangeNYC/status/1965763607653969957" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">significantly more sympathetic to Palestinians</a> than they are to Israel.</p><p>In a statement to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/andrew-cuomo-throws-9-11-at-zohran-mamdani.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NY Mag</a>, Mamdani’s campaign pulled no punches.</p><p>“Andrew Cuomo knows exactly what he’s doing. He’s holding a press conference to suggest that Zohran Mamdani – who is poised to become New York’s first Muslim mayor – somehow supported 9/11. It’s vile, it’s dangerous, and it’s deliberate,” the campaign wrote. “Cuomo would rather you forget his own record: that he had to be pressured into ever setting foot in a mosque, that he’s repeatedly trafficked in Islamophobia when it suited him politically, that he’s used Muslims as convenient punching bags for decades. New Yorkers can see this for what it is – a cynical attempt to recycle the ugliest playbook in our politics. Cuomo is not protecting the memory of 9/11 victims; he’s once again desecrating it by weaponizing grief and pain for his own ambition.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/unikat-32-33-indie-games-publisher-marketing"><h3>Running A Video Games Publisher AND Marketing Agency Sounds Absolutely Exhausting</h3></a><p>'Seeing all of your different efforts, ones that are synced by the work of many people, all being unveiled at once is a cool feeling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-author-immortal-image-comics-interview"><h3>The Author Immortal Is A Metanarrative Isekai Comic That Explores The Messiness Of Separating The Art From The Artist</h3></a><p>Amid canceled creators, cultural reckonings, and A.I.’s rise, Frank Barbiere and Morgan Beem’s new Image Comics series invites readers to reclaim fantasy and confront who stories truly serve

You want an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> update? You've got an Assassin's Creed Shadows update! Well, you will tomorrow, September 11th anyway, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> did release the patch notes for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game in any case. Here's what you can expect for the Assassin's Creed Shadows 1.1.1 title update! First up is the fact that the game will be ready for its first expansion, Claws of Awaji, which is due out next week, September 16th. The level cap is also being raised to 100 to account for the expansion!
</p>
<p>
For everyone who won't be picking up the expansion, there is a new free story quest, Go With The Bo. Here you'll join Junjiro as he sets out to meet a legendary Bo master and a new weapon that Naoe can use, the Bo staff. There's also new hideout upgrades, including two more upgrade levels, 20 new enhancements, and three new Hideout levels. Upgrading the Nando to level two will now give you the ability to meditate and move the time forward to the next six o'clock, AM or PM.
</p>
<p>
If you upgrade the study to level four, scouts will now have the ability to reveal viewpoints and safehouses, and with upgrading the Kakurega to the same level, uncovering all viewpoints within a province reveals it completely.
</p>
<p>
There are two new gear quality tiers that you can upgrade your kit to if you've got your forge to level six, called mythic and artifact. "Once an item reaches a new quality, it can be further upgraded through eight additional levels to unlock its full potential," the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/62imkAfEdpZSadOqfktQHv/ac-shadows-title-update-111-release-notes">patch notes</a> explain.
</p><p>
Ubisoft still can't seem to let go of Ezio either, as in the Animus Hub there are some fresh rewards for a new project called Sanctuary. These include Ezio's outfit, Ezio's outfit but for a cat, an Ezio-themed kusarigama, and a Charm of Firenze trinket.
</p>
<p>
There are also new anomalies to be found in Awaji if you own the expansion, and cutscenes are no longer limited to 30 FPS. You'll also find a number of other fixes and tweaks, but you can read the full patch notes to learn about those small details.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-leaks-mario-re7-smash-bros-2000624779</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-games-upgrades-and-ports-what-to-expect-from-the-longest-nintendo-direct-ever.1294254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Nintendo Direct that fans have been waiting for is finally here and it’s a big one. September is usually when the company has its annual blowout showcase, and after a messy first half of 2025 ahead of the Switch 2 launch, it seems like we might be getting back into a familiar flow. After a quiet couple of years, the drought may finally be over. The Switch 2 is out and Nintendo can finally wheel out the big guns.</p> <p>With Nintendo promising an hour-long livestream, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-12-mario-metroid-prime-4-2000624629">the September 12 Direct</a> will be the longest in the company’s history outside of the April one earlier this year for revealing the Switch 2 hardware. It also comes just ahead of the 40th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> on September 13, suggesting plenty of Mario-themed announcements may be in tow as well. And then there’s the flurry of recently leaks from self-proclaimed insiders, some with a good enough track record to take them seriously going into the event. Here’s what we’re likely to see at the latest Nintendo Direct this Friday, from rumors and best guesses to some wild longshots that are too cool not to think about.</p> <h2><em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, and more ports</h2> <p>According to <em>Resident Evil</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1965424695731478833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1965424695731478833%7Ctwgr%5E6786e5247f19b31b1c73c98ae9cc0dc0eabda24e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fa-bunch-of-resident-evil-games-are-reportedly-getting-switch-2-ports-2000624442">leaker Dusk Golem,</a> we should expect a whole lot of Capcom’s horror series to be coming to Switch 2 in the year ahead. That includes <em>Resident Evil 7 </em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em>, as well as the <em>Resident Evil 2</em>,<em> 3</em>, and<em> 4</em> remakes. Notably, all of these were created on the current RE Engine, which Capcom has been using for all of its new games. Dusk Golem has suggested the newest sequel,<em> Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, will arrive on Switch 2 at some point as well.</p>

 <p>While only a port of<em> RE7</em> has been claimed to be getting revealed at this week’s Direct, fans have already started speculating about what this will mean for Capcom’s other franchises on Switch 2. Both <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> were also developed in the RE Engine, as was <em>Street Fighter 6</em> which was a launch game for the hardware back in June.</p> <p><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094">isn’t out on Switch 2 yet</a>, but there are already rumors that <em>Rebirth</em> isn’t far behind. Reliable Switch leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n9qetv/comment/ncoma6b/">recently claimed</a> the sequel is headed to Nintendo’s new console sometime in 2026. He’s also previously reported that <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-direct-july-mario-red-dead-2-1851786219"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is being ported</a> to Switch 2, which seems likely to arrive sooner than later. That doesn’t mean either will be at this week’s Direct but they are certainly in the mix. There are rumors that<em> Starfield</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will end up on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid at some point, too.</p>

 <p>Then there’s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n9qetv/comment/ncoma6b/">very messy riddle from leaker SwitchForce</a> who was the first to reveal that a Nintendo Direct was happening on September 12. The tease is that there will be three games at the showcase with the number seven in the title. Outside of<em> FF7</em>, there’s been speculation about <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> and <em>Ace Attorney 7</em> being the others, though SwitchForce said the long-running courtroom series <a href="https://xcancel.com/INRamos13/status/1964543031216157045?t=jnplNfO2lqZpB6lvD7zsoQ&amp;s=19">definitely wouldn’t be in the livestream</a>. A more obvious choice is<em> 007 First Light</em>, which was recently at the PlayStation State of Play as well.</p> <h2>The year of <em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em></h2> <p>SwitchForce has also been teasing big Mario news at the event. “They buy the new systems for the mustache,” <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1965782433674199051">read a tweet</a> featuring a GIF of Mario from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. One theory is that the <em>Odyssey</em> team split in two, with a younger offshoot working on <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> and another developing the next 3D <em>Mario</em> game. The timing makes the reveal of<em> Super Mario Odyssey</em>‘s successor feel all but assured, though it probably won’t be the only Mario announcement in the Direct.</p>

 <p>We’re also less than a year out from <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2</em> with no real info about what the story will be or which celebrities will be joining the English-language cast. At least an initial teaser, if not a full-blown trailer, could be in the cards. Maybe we’ll even get a double feature with a tease for the upcoming <em>Zelda</em> movie in 2027 as well? It could be as simple as confirmation of whether it will be a brand-new story or not, or whether it will be another isekai tale (people from the real world magically appearing in Hyrule).</p> <p>But back to Mario. It’s his time to shine after all. The way Nintendo usually likes to handle these anniversaries means we could get a new anthology of remasters or remixes of older games in the series, or ports of more recent entries that have been languishing on old hardware like <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>&nbsp;(I’m still holding out hope for <em>Super Mario Galaxy 3</em> myself). Another Switch Online exclusive multiplayer spin-off like<em> Super Mario Bros. 35</em> doesn’t sound out of the question either. Maybe this time it’ll go from 2D side-scrolling to a <em>Fall Guys</em>-style 3D battle royale mode.</p>

 <p>Finally, we know Nintendo loves its limited-edition accessories and merchandise. A <em>Mario Bros. </em>40th anniversary Switch 2, new Amiibo, and new Switch 2 Joy-Con colors feel like an easy prediction. More exciting would be some new sort of dedicated device like the Nintendo Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros., only this time with more than just the first two games. And what’s going on with that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-detachable-dual-screen-patent-has-been-updated/">detachable dual-screen add-on</a> that Nintendo patented? Could the Switch 2 finally get DS games coming to its subscription service?</p> <h2><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> deserves a Switch 2 upgrade</h2> <p>If the original Switch taught us anything, it’s that Nintendo loves double-dipping. Half of the first-party library for that console was just Wii U games. And I fully expect the company to maintain that pattern with Switch 2 by continuing to roll out free and paid upgrades for older games. A recent Monolith Soft job posting on social media included <a href="https://x.com/SoSnake13/status/1959893819190824996#m">fresh footage of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em></a> that appeared to show it running at a much higher resolution. Those open-world RPGs have always struggled on the first Switch, leaving fans pining not only for <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 4</em> on Switch 2 but also upgrades for the last two numbered entries. They’re also still waiting to see what’s up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-hidden-60-fps-mode/"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>‘s hidden 60fps mode</a>.</p>

 <p>There are also still lots of other old games Nintendo can pull onto the Switch 2 in one form or another. A Wii U HD remaster of <em>Twilight Princess</em> is still MIA on modern platforms, and the original <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> could be remastered or added to the GameCube library on Switch Online. Nintendo’s also getting ready to release <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> (a release date reveal at this Direct would be nice!) and yet two of the games in the original trilogy still aren’t available to play on Switch.</p> <h2><i>Smash Bros., Animal Crossing, </i>and <em>Mother 3</em></h2> <p>Beyond the next <em>Mario</em>, there are plenty of other Nintendo franchises that are ripe for their next entries. <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is five years old now, and <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> got its last DLC character in 2021. Despite multiple remakes in the series since, the last new<em> Luigi’s Mansion</em> was in 2019. It’s not quite time for a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> but we are getting close. And what about Nintendo’s back-bench franchises like <em>Star Fox</em>, <em>Punch-Out</em>, and <em>Pilotwings</em>? The company loves pulling from the past just as much as building new things.</p>

 <p>Speaking of new things, a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-splatoon-3-raiders-upgrade-price-maps-1851784179"><em>Splatoon</em> spin-off called <em>Raiders</em></a> was teased earlier this year and will no doubt make an appearance at the Direct if it’s coming out any time in the next 12 months. It would also be nice to see more of FromSoftware’s upcoming Switch 2 exclusive <em>The Duskbloods</em>. There’s also no word on what Platinum Games is working on for the console. Could Switch 2 be getting <em>Bayonetta 4</em> or <em>Astral Blades 2</em> anytime soon? And I know Team Ninja has been very busy lately, but it would be neat to see <em>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 4</em> confirmed.</p> <p>The deepest cut of all would be <em>Mother 3</em>, the GBA game never officially localized in the West but which is already available through Switch Online in Japan. There was a big exhibit for the series <a href="https://essential-japan.com/news/classic-rpg-earthbound-gets-major-new-exhibition-in-tokyo-this-summer/">in Tokyo this summer</a>, and this year marks the 30th anniversary of <em>Earthbound</em> coming out in the U.S. Meanwhile, 2026 will mark the 20th anniversary for <em>Mother 3</em>. Series creator Shigesato Itoi is already 76 and not getting any younger. It’s time. Seriously. Just give us <em>Mother 3</em>. Hell, give us <em>Mother 4</em>! Or even a 3D remake of <em>Earthbound</em>. How much money do I need to spend these <a href="https://www.1101.com/mother_project/items/goldbox5.html"><em>Earthbound</em> figures</a> to make it happen?</p>

              <p>Now that the film and TV industries have finally cracked the code to making decent, sometimes great, live-action adaptations of video games, there’s actually good reason to pay attention to the developments of these works. To be excited about them, even. One of the latest games to get the treatment is none other than Xbox 360-era darling <i>BioShock</i>. The first one (not <i>Infinite</i>, thank god).</p> <p>As reported by <i>The Direct</i>, producer Roy Lee (<a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345"><i>A Minecraft Movie</i></a>, <i>Weapons</i>, <i>The Long Walk</i>) said that while everything else about the movie must be kept secret, “it’s definitely going to be based on the first <i>BioShock</i> game.” The deep sea adaptation hit a snag after some necessary script work, but it looks like it’s on track; now it just awaits director Francis Lawrence (<i>Constantine</i>, <i>The Hunger Games</i>, <i>The Long Walk</i>) who first has to wrap work on <i>The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping</i>.</p> <p>While I’ve been something of a hater of the non-stop barrage of live-action video game adaptations, I find the idea of bringing the first <i>BioShock</i> “to life” as a big-budget movie a neat proposition. Sure, the story is the most obvious expression of why <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>’s themes are stupid, but the setting, the underwater city of Rapture, was a real treat to explore, and seeing it reproduced on the big screen should be a treat.</p> <p>As a thematic device, Rapture is a pretty straightforward tool for skewering libertarian-minded politics, but as a setting, it’s dreamy and atmospheric, with tremendous potential for some seriously cool set and prop design. And if Francis Lawrence’s work on 2007’s <i>I Am Legend</i> is anything to go by, the man knows how to work well with evocative settings. Who knows, maybe we’ll take some better lessons away from this trip down to the doomed ocean floor city than we did the first time.</p>

              <p>Yesterday, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/crusader-kings-iii-the-kotaku-review-1844848772">Crusader Kings 3</a></em> released a new DLC for the popular historical strategy game. The reaction to it was very negative, with complaints about it being small and broken, as well as including features that some players felt should have been in the main game. Now, the game’s QA manager has issued a lengthy apology and explained what happened.</p> <p>On September 9, Paradox Interactive released the “Coronations” DLC pack for <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>. This is just one of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/">many, many DLCs and expansions</a> that have been released for the large-scale strategy game since it launched back in 2020. However, shortly after Coronations launched on Steam, players began sharing negative reviews and complaining that one feature of the small DLC, oaths, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1nd6c2j/i_completed_my_oath_years_ago_wtf_paradox/">was completely broken and causing problems during campaigns</a>. Others complained that the small DLC should have been a free update and argued that Paradox has been squeezing player wallets more and more with these smaller DLCs. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3315520/Crusader_Kings_III_Coronations/">The Coronations DLC now has an overall negative rating on Steam</a>.</p> <p>In response to all this negative feedback and anger, Paradox’s QA manager has posted an apology, explained what happened, and promised that the studio would do better in the future to prevent this from happening again.</p>

 <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/517472660906573991">On Thursday, <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>‘s QA manager, Riad, shared a message</a> with fans on the game’s official Steam page. According to Riad, he’s been wanting to apologize to the community for the last 24 hours and asked the “higher-ups” for permission to write an apology.</p> <p>“I’m sorry. <wbr>Coronations was not up to the standard you deserve, and that’s on me,” said Riad. “As the QA Manager for the studio, it is my job to ensure that our releases meet the [quality assurance] vision we have set out. It is clear we didn’t give the project the resources and attention it needed, and the result was a release that let you down. You have every right to be upset, and I want to acknowledge that openly.”</p>

  <p>Riad explained that the studio has been “pouring enormous effort” into the next massive <em>Crusader Kings 3</em> expansion, All Under Heaven. According to the QA boss, it’s the biggest expansion the studio has ever made and “basically every resource” is “committed” to making sure the expansion is “up to [fan] expectations.” However, this led to other projects at Paradox, like the Coronations DLC, having fewer resources and staff. And while Riad is “very proud” of what the team was able to pull off with limited resources, the QA boss called the whole situation “unfair” to both fans and the devs. Riad also blamed “last-minute” changes for oaths being broken in the new DLC and claimed the studio was going to be more “stringent” about these tweaks.</p> <p>“Many of us on the team, myself included, joined Paradox as fans of the games. Meeting you at events…hearing your stories, and seeing how much <em>Crusader Kings 3 </em>means to you is what makes this work so meaningful,” said Riad. “That’s why it hurts so much when we fuck up like this. We don’t take your trust for granted, and I want to do my best to ensure we earn it back.”</p> <p>Riad says that there is at least one more patch on the way to fix more issues in the Coronations DLC and added, “Thank you for holding us accountable and for continuing to care about this game as much as we do. We will do better.”<wbr><wbr><wbr><wbr></p>
