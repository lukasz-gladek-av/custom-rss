<p>Save those caps</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IZm-Hws334">Fallout Day Broadcast</a> delivered a very nice surprise to Switch 2 owners: Bethesda is bringing <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/fallout_4">Fallout 4</a> to the hybrid console in <strong>2026</strong> in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>.</p>
<p>The Anniversary Edition includes the base game and all six official add-ons — Automatron, Far Harbor, Nuka-World, and the three Workshop expansions. Plus there's over 150 pieces of Creation Club content to discover. New weapons, different breeds of Dogmeat (that's your dog companion in-game, in case you've never heard of this good boy), new quests... it's a big ol' package, let's just say.</p>
<p>The teaser above doesn't really tell us much about this port, so we'll likely have to wait until next year for some more info on how it looks and runs. We've popped some screens from the Steam version of the game below just so you get an idea of what the game looks like.</p>
<p>For now, here's a brief rundown of the plot — taking place a decade after Fallout 3, you are the sole survivor of Vault 111. After your spouse is murdered and your son is kidnapped, you step out into the world of the Commonwealth, a huge post-apocalyptic wasteland region which encompasses Boston and other parts of Massachusetts. Your goal? To save your kid, of course.</p>

<p>The fourth numbered <strong>Fallout</strong> game was praised for its world, customisation, and amount of freedom available, but many thought it wasn't much of a step forward compared to Fallout 3, and many of the game's RPG elements were toned down slightly. Still, it garnered a fair amount of acclaim and has grown in many people's estimation in the 10 years since.</p>
<p>We're now suddenly realising that Fallout 4 is a decade old on 10th November. How did that happen?</p>

<p><em>Fallout 4 comes to Switch 2 next year! Will you be stepping out into the Commonwealth? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Alana has been with Nintendo Life since 2022, and while RPGs are her first love, Nintendo is a close second.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>RocketWerkz and GRIP Studios have just announced that ICARUS, the sci-fi co-op survival game created by former DayZ lead Dean 'Rocket' Hall, is coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10013354" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9p3h2pvzzpsd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a> in Q1 2026. </p>



<p>ICARUS <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-the-co-op-survival-game-from-dean-hall-just-got-delayed-to-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched on Steam in late 2021</a>. It was initially quite rough, but over time, it secured a very dedicated fanbase, partly due to the continued support of the development team.</p>



<p>Console gamers can look forward to a much-improved version of the game that also includes the New Frontiers expansion, which added the alien region of Prometheus for an additional 64 square kilometers of terrain to explore (on top of the base game's 64 square kilometers). Prometheus also introduced three deadly biomes, a host of mutated apex predators, over 30 additional workshop items, the ability to craft over a hundred new items, and six narrative-driven missions across a single story arc.</p>



<p>As part of this announcement, I had the pleasure of interviewing Dean Hall about ICARUS: Console Edition, but we also discussed the game's four-year journey on PC, the evolution of the survival genre since DayZ, and more.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>First of all, Dean, it's a pleasure to have you on Wccftech for the first time. Can you walk us through today's news?</strong></p>



<p>Sure. ICARUS is coming to consoles. It's something that people have asked me about a lot on social media. In fact, there's people who still contact me every few months on the ICARUS subreddit, which is kind of awesome. A lot of work has gone into getting the game ready for that, and we had to actually partner with another studio because we just didn't really have the experience with even just basic stuff like a controller. That's something that's actually been missing from ICARUS, controller support, and there's a lot of specialty knowledge in there. </p>



<p><strong>As far as I understand, it will be developed by GRIP Studios for console, right?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, we partnered with them. A number of their staff I actually worked with on DayZ, and I ran into them a couple of years ago at the 10th anniversary of DayZ and they had set up their own studio and were doing a bunch of good work. I was familiar with their work and obviously knew them. So, we hung out and just kind of hit it off from there. It felt like they were a team that we could partner with, a team that understood survival games and could help us in all the areas we weren't experienced with.</p>



<p><strong>Can you tell me if there are any major differences between the PC and console versions, or will they be largely the same?</strong></p>



<p>Certainly, if you're coming from the PC, it's very different in terms of the controller versus the mouse. There's been a lot of work that had to be done in terms of how you navigate around. But broadly speaking, it plays the same as on the PC, except you can sit down and play on the couch. That's really I think the miracle of it: the experience has been able to be ported very nicely to consoles. The biggest difference for me at least is the controller and just learning to jump around the different menus, because ICARUS has a lot of menus. It has a talent tree, it has inventory, it has all the interactions with deployables and placing things and all that kind of stuff. How the game gets put together is a little different as well. We packaged stuff a bit more to make it easier for console gamers to get into it. That's in terms of some of the content.</p>



<p><strong>Will you also port this controller-based UI to PC for those who may want to play ICARUS with the controller?</strong></p>



<p>That's something that we'd really love to do. There's also a number of optimizations, fixes, and other things like that that the GRIP team has done. We're very interested in pulling those things off. In a way, I'm a little jealous of console gamers because their first experience of ICARUS is going to be the product of over 200 weeks' worth of updates. They're coming in with this refined experience, so we're hopeful that some of the changes that GRIP have made will actually be able to make it back to the PC game as well. There's certainly a lot of PC gamers who contact me about having really good controller support.</p>

<p><strong>Yeah. It's even my preferred way to play on PC nowadays because I have my PC connected to a big OLED TV. So it's much more relaxing to play with the controller. A lot of PC gamers have this kind of setup.</strong></p>



<p>True. It's very frustrating that we haven't been able to put the controller support in before. It's something we've long wanted to do, but we just haven't had a lot of experience with that. And I think too often a PC game implementing controller support poorly leads to a very bad result and vice versa, where a console game is ported to PC. I think it's very important that the teams doing that have experience with it. Being able to partner with GRIP, get their advice about how we approach controller support and integrate it with the menus. Now that work's done, it is much easier for us to look at that on the PC.</p>



<p><strong>The press release says ICARUS is launching on Xbox Series S|X and PlayStation 5, but several Unreal Engine games are also being ported to the Switch 2. Do you think that's potentially feasible, and if so, would you like that to happen?</strong></p>



<div><p>I know the Switch 2 is something that's been talked about. I think it's already a minor miracle that GRIP has been able to do the fantastic work getting ICARUS to run as it does on consoles, just because the game is very RAM hungry. It's very memory hungry, very resource hungry in general, and this is largely just because of the scale of the worlds and the content in them. I think sometimes it is lost on people just how big it is as a survival game. That all adds up to a lot. So GRIP has done a pretty fantastic job at being able to port to that. I certainly know they're very keen to get it to as many platforms as possible, but I guess we'll have to see how it goes on PlayStation and Xbox first. One thing I should add is that we've really tried to focus on improving the performance of the game over the last 200 weeks.</p><p><strong>Sometimes, with other games that were first released on PC and later on consoles, the optimization that had to be made for the console ports was eventually backported to the PC version. Do you think that might happen here, too?</strong></p></div>



<p>Definitely, I think there is stuff like that. We were very particular, though, to make sure that both the console and the PC version run sort of branched. That's very important to me, because I don't like it when a game comes from PC to console and it just feels like a PC game on console, or vice versa. We really wanted each version to live sort of free and able to best utilize what each platform gave it. So that means that when we want to port something between them, we actually really sit down and say, "Hey, is this appropriate? Does this work? Does this best utilize the hardware?" Obviously, with a PC, you get a massive breadth of hardware available to the consumer. You have some people with insanely good graphics cards who want to turn everything up to a million. With consoles, you're getting a much more standardized experience. So, we wanted to make sure that each of those was able to go in its direction. We're definitely hopeful that we'll be able to pull across some really good stuff on the PC, but we also want to make sure that on the PC, people can utilize the latest and greatest hardware they have. That does limit some of those things we pull across from consoles.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be crossplay between PC and consoles in ICARUS?</strong></p>



<p>Crossplay was something we really wanted to do, but because there are those two separate versions, it's just not something we can deliver at the moment. The biggest challenge is simply that we've been updating the game every week on PC, which would just make that absolute hell for GRIP to try and deal with. Either we would have had to stop those weekly updates or figure out a way to try and do weekly updates on the consoles. which just isn't possible at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Is there crossplay between consoles?</strong></p>



<p>No, not even then. Multiplayer sessions are hosted natively on each console platform, which prevents cross-platform connectivity between PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X.</p>



<p><strong>ICARUS has been live for nearly four years on PC. It's been quite a long journey for you. Can you walk us through it and all the expansions that you've made? How important has the community's feedback been to get these updates right?</strong></p>



<p>When we launched, it was a little rough. We went straight to Mixed reviews on Steam. We had broken localization. That was one of the biggest issues. We actually released to Mostly Positive reviews in the United States, but there was a simple bug with a drop-down combo box for the language settings that meant the language settings didn't get applied. So, a whole bunch of people weren't able to play the game in their language, which was super frustrating. We did get that fixed within hours, but there was that and there were a bunch of other bugs, not to mention a lot of optimization concerns. That's where we really committed to that idea of doing an update every single week just to build trust with the community and turn that around a bit. And we did an update every single week. We didn't miss one. We did it through the floods of Auckland, the city we live in, which got flooded twice. There was basically a cyclone, too. We went through many different natural disasters and still managed to deliver an update every week. That community feedback was intensely important through both Steam as well as Discord and Reddit. There's actually two ICARUS subreddits, so we hang out in both of them. They really helped us head the game in the right direction.</p>



<p>Probably the biggest example would be bringing in the open world. We still really love the idea of the session-based survival, but I think for that to really hit it off, we would have needed to have put a lot more work into the orbital side of it, which we just weren't able to do and deliver to the level of quality we wanted. However, we were able to bring in a full open world, which means that people could do the missions in one session. That came from a lot of discussion and a lot of working with our community veterans, who got early builds and gave us a lot of feedback. It has been a really long journey, very difficult, especially the first two years, and also when we removed our backend. Some people don't realize this: when we launched, we had this huge backend and we were spending like $100K a month running it. It had some good features, but it meant people couldn't run their dedicated servers. Eventually, we were like, look, this is really bad. If we get into financial trouble, the game will stop working. What we did was sit down and look at it. It was an enormous amount of work, but we changed it so it didn't have that backend. So if the company stopped running, it would still be totally playable as it is today, and that lets people run their own dedicated servers.</p>



<p>Again, we worked really heavily with the community on that one as well, so it was a long journey. But the last two years have been just a lot of fun as we've added a lot of content and things we really wanted the game to have.</p>



<p><strong>Now that ICARUS has been out for a while, are you happy with how it's done commercially on PC?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. By all rights, a game that is this old should have tailed off. Actually, all the games we released with have disappeared off the radar, which is sad in its own way. But we actually had a resurgence, particularly in Europe and Germany, after Gamescom. For a while there, Germany was our top-selling region. In fact, one out of every two copies of the game was being sold in Germany. We just had a sale recently on Steam that really reinvigorated things as well. It's always been a little bit of a surprise in a good way. I like to think a lot of that is just because of the work we've put in to really turn things around, try to address some of the community's concerns, and sort of almost meet in the middle. We obviously have our vision for what the game should be and also what the game is capable of doing, but the players are the ones who actually play the game. We also really like to try and play the game a lot ourselves and try and experience it as a customer and then see where we can take it from there. I would say ICARUS has been commercially successful in terms of us being able to keep developing it for all this time and we hope to keep on developing it as well.</p>

It's always been a little bit of a surprise in a good way.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Regarding future content additions, I know you have been working on a map called Elysium, right? Can you share the status of this map? How far is it in development?</strong></p>



<p>The first thing I'd say is that there's a lot of DLC for ICARUS, and that's a good thing and a bad thing. Some people get pretty nervous, quite rightly, when they see so much DLC. We kind of identified when ICARUS launched that we didn't want to just leave the game where it was. We wanted to keep making stuff, and also, I get a bit frustrated with sequels. We tried to divide the content into three parts: expansions, which are almost like another whole game and they're priced accordingly. Those are for someone who plays ICARUS and goes, "Man, this is just the game for me." That is definitely not going to be everybody, but that's how we tried to position that. And then the content packs and outposts, they're more for people if they want to support the studio. The outposts are kind of a fun little thing that some people really like, and a chance for our map designers to show off some of their skills. With that in mind, we treat our next big expansion really as approaching almost like another version of ICARUS. We actually do a map review session every week, and the last two weeks have been fantastic as it's really been coming together. I won't give out any spoilers. But I think you will see the progression that we've had in the team with our technology around worldbuilding.</p>



<p>This new area just brings in a lot of those map design lessons that you started to see in Null. There are also a lot of art improvements in terms of how we design and approach areas, and a heck of a lot of new creatures, a few new mechanics, and quite a few surprises. The narrative chain I'm very happy with as well. I think it builds on the experience of New Frontiers and tries to give you this fun, interesting mission chain that you can play with your friends in the open world.</p>



<p><strong>Do you think it will be available in the first half of next year?</strong></p>



<p>It's definitely going to be the first half of next year. We'd really love to get it out this year, but it could end up being pretty tight. The internal target for the studio is to finish it this year, but people in the community who follow us a lot will remember that with Null and with Prometheus we did hold them back just to get the quality and stability we wanted. Actually, I think the real turnaround of ICARUS was when we released the New Frontiers expansion, which was the Prometheus map, because I think people saw, hey, that's what they wanted the studio to do. We were able to finally hit our stride, and then we went back and reworked the base game content as well. So yeah, the target would be the end of this year, but it will be pushed if we need to get that performance and quality we want. For example, very recently while we've been playing through it, we just realized we wanted more missions, so we are actually going back and adding more side missions.</p>



<p>Anyone who follows a lot on Discord will know that we push stuff if we have to. I'm so glad that now the studio has a bit of financial security that we can do that. It was looking very grim with the ICARUS launch as to whether we would be able to continually push it. The fact that people have bought those DLCs has meant that we could take our time with a lot of this content and updates.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The expansion is definitely going to be released in the first half of next year. We'd really love to get it out this year, but it could end up being pretty tight.

<p><strong>People want to know if they can get a power switch in the game!</strong></p>



<p>It's something that we've talked about a lot. I'll bring it up at the steering group and we'll see what the team says. A lot of our decisions around what we do with ICARUS are really made just by talking with the team from a technical perspective. I'm hopeful we can. I'd recommend that people post about this on Feature Upvote, where people can actually upvote different features they want to have. It doesn't mean we necessarily deliver it. But yeah, I will go back and check out and see if we can do that one.</p>



<p><strong>Did you ever consider adding vehicles to the game? Was that something you discussed internally?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. When we were developing ICARUS, we went all the way and we actually made a whole vehicle system. You could drive around in vehicles. You could actually assemble the vehicles from parts. But we noticed it just destroyed performance, particularly back then. The traversal of the terrain just got that stutter that many people have seen in Unreal Engine games and we worked extremely hard, to the point we nearly ran out of money at the studio, to try and bring that one and make that one work, and it just didn't. Additionally, it really affected how we were designing the maps. The speed at which you wanted to move around when you were in the vehicle just didn't really work, and we had a lot of technical problems, physics problems, etc. We'd even developed our building system so that you could build bridges to support this. If you have a mount and you stand on a structure, you actually add extra weight to it, and that was actually intended to be for a vehicle system. What we ended up doing instead of that was focusing on the mounts, and that seemed to work well, so we've just leaned into that. It also means we can deliver those talent trees per mount, which has worked out very nicely. So, what you're going to see particularly with uh you know the new expansion and in fact, there's a new mount coming to the game, the Ibis.</p>



<p>Vehicles are something we've thought about and we keep looking at again, but our maps are handcrafted and a lot of effort goes into them. As we found with our other game, Stationeers, if you have vehicles and the terrain doesn't handle them, it gets intensely frustrating for players. You get your vehicle jammed up in a corner every ten seconds or so.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be any updates to the pathing/pet AI?</strong></p>



<p>If people haven't checked the game out in, say, six months or so, it's definitely worth checking it out now because we've already done some updates to this all the time. If people do encounter problems or issues with the pathing, if they've managed to get a video of that, throw it on Feature Upvote. We have some really good programmers who then just look at those edge cases, particularly if people can report where they have pathing issues on the map. There are some spots that are just difficult for even the player to path, which is deliberate, particularly some of the areas in Null are designed to be quite tricky to navigate. We do a lot of work on the AI stuff, but it can be a sort of work that can take three to four months, and then we test it and we're like, okay, it's actually causing problems, so we have to go back and do some more work. It's the kind of thing that people might be like, why are they not working on pathing? It's just because it's not linear from how much work you put in to what you get out. It's almost a bit like prospecting, really. You're exploring to see if something is going to help and work. </p>



<p><strong>You've been making survival games for a long time, since the days of DayZ. What do you think about this genre and where it is today compared to when you started? How has it evolved in your opinion?</strong></p>



<p>It's evolved awesomely. You can tell there's features in ICARUS that are a result of playing Valheim. Valheim came out in our development and I remember that I went like, oh man, we made some bad decisions. We tried to change some of the things we could. There were just some fantastic things in Valheim. It can be such a cozy game sometimes, and I really love that push and pull and the feeling of the biomes is just so consistent. Our food system and that stacked buff system came as a direct result of us putting about 400 hours into Valheim. We were playing Valheim to the point that it almost delayed the project. I wish we could have gotten more in-world interaction. It's something we've done an enormous amount on with Stationeers and we had intended to do with Icarus. You know that idea, like in Minecraft when you walk up to a door and you just whack the door and it opens, or you walk up to a switch and you whack it and it moves.</p>



<p>Stationeers does a fantastic job of all that in-world stuff, but we never quite got into Icarus. But yes, there has been a lot of new survival stuff. There's <a href="https://wccftech.com/popular-survival-game-enshrouded-launch-update-november-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enshrouded</a>. I'm actually pretty keen to get back into playing Project Zomboid's new build. I mostly play multiplayer, so I like multiplayer survival games, but with Project Zomboid, there's just so much good new innovation in terms of its experience. Some people would say that there are probably too many survival games out there. Players do have a difficult time finding the time to try them.</p>



<p><strong>True, even though the new kind of hotness is PvPvE games, right? With some extraction and survival elements thrown in.</strong></p>



<p>It is. Many people asked me, "Why did you make a PVE game after making Day Z?" The thing is, I'd love to look at another PvP game. But with Icarus, I didn't want to look at a PVP game until we had learned to deal with performance stability, quality, and particularly antisocial-type issues like hacking and stuff like that. I really feel that the survival genre hasn't dealt with this enough: how do we deliver these consistent experiences that aren't getting destroyed by other people?</p>



<p>I actually think I made a mistake with DayZ where I tried to solve it all just in terms of everything on the server. If you look at Minecraft communities, I think a lot of it can actually be solved by the communities themselves if you give them the tools to do so. So, giving people a lot of support for how they run and control dedicated servers, logging, and stuff like that. That's super important. I'm still extremely interested in PvP. I just think it's really important that we deal with the ability for the games to scale. Even Icarus suffers from this a lot. I saw people posting on Reddit about performance. We have done an enormous amount of work to try and improve the performance with large bases. In fact, in the last month or so, we actually released an update, well, two updates focused entirely on performance, particularly for large bases and stuff like that.</p>



<p>That's a very long-winded answer to your question. I'd say I'm very interested in survival and PvP, but I think it has to be done right, and it is something that we're not doing a very good job at, including myself, which is why I kind of needed to get back to basics and develop technology and approaches that would deliver those experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Do you plan to support ICARUS for years to come?</strong></p>



<p>Absolutely. This is probably a good segue to another controversial topic: DLC. Broadly speaking, I think the community is very positive towards the DLC in Stationeers but also in Icarus, because we kind of said to the community, hey, we want to keep developing this game as long as we can. We really love all the effort we put into it. There's still heaps of people playing it. I think there's like 8,000 people playing Icarus right now at this at this very second. We really want that to continue, and we want to keep paying our staff and pay them well. The content approach we came up with delivered on that and I think we managed to find a really nice sweet spot instead of doing a whole bunch of bad stuff. We split it into those three parts, and that actually allowed us to keep the base game cheaper and also allows us to put it on discount while still being able to fund the studio. We don't have any plans to stop. We've done an update every week and they're pretty meaty updates. Last week, it was the farming backpack, and this week, it's a new, combat-focused mount too.</p>



<p><strong>Just a final question about AI and its impact on game development. What's the opinion within RocketWerkz? Did you discuss the possibility of using it in some way or are you just against it? What are your feelings?</strong></p>



<p>I'm part of that micro-generation that first had the Internet at school. It just sort of came in, and all the adults lost their minds over Wikipedia coming out and Google and it's going to be the end of information. It feels a little bit like that. I think that regardless of what we do, AI is here. So really then it's about a matter of how do we deal with what the impact of that is. We handcraft our maps and a lot of stuff. We like to say games are played, not made. For us, there's not really a lot of stuff that we use AI on for ICARUS because the whole idea of it is we want to sit down and handcraft an experience. That's not a judgment against AI. It's more, that's what we really wanted to do. We wanted to sit down and sketch a big map out on a whiteboard and then see it come to life. Our lead world builder actually worked at Bethesda for a while and just loves worldbuilding. We do utilize AI for some of our other projects as a coding support tool. We get an AI model, expose it to our codebase, and that means you can ask it questions, which is really helpful because one person can't easily have the whole codebase in their head so that we can expose the codebase to it and then ask it questions. As to getting it actually to do work, I don't think we are necessarily quite there yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is bringing back some fan-favorite Black Ops 2 maps for Season One of the game.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, Black Ops 7 continues the Black Ops series name, as well as its story. Players will finally reunite with the Mason family from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2</a> and witness another mind-bending narrative, now with friends. However, it seems the story isn’t the only thing coming back, as two remastered maps from Black Ops 2 are returning for the new entry, as said by Activision.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-2-s-standoff-and-meltdown-return-as-season-one-maps-in-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 2’s Standoff and Meltdown Return as Season One Maps in Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Season 01 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> will be the biggest post-launch content drop in our history, and we're just getting started. Get your first look in our new Dev Talk:</p><p>✅ 7 signature 6v6 maps<br>✅ 7 new &amp; fan-favorite weapons (Maddox! 😍)<br>✅ 3 Zombies maps<br>✅ S01 remasters confirmed<br>✅ MP… <a href="https://t.co/VoKWLqycLW">pic.twitter.com/VoKWLqycLW</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1981421047376465996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1981421047376465996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Dev Talk</a> with the team at Treyarch, the team revealed two Black Ops 2 maps returning for Black Ops 7 as part of Season One: Meltdown and Standoff. Each map will be remastered and available as part of the next batch of maps, though a release date was not given. Standoff did join Black Ops: Cold War’s roster of maps during Season Three, acting as both a Multiplayer map and Zombies map. However, Meltdown has not been in the series since Black Ops 2 back in 2012, so fans will be excited to return to the nuclear powerplant.</p>



<p>The Season One roadmap for Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was revealed today</a> as part of the Dev Talk. Seven maps, including Meltdown and Standoff, will will release during the season, with more to come later. Three other Zombies maps, two being Survival, are also coming in Season One. The team is calling the new season its biggest yet and based on what we can tell, it sure seems to be. Either way, both new and returning players are in for a treat when it releases on November 14th.</p>



<p>Are you excited to return to Standoff and Meltdown? Any maps you hope make a return for Black Ops 7? Will you be getting the game at launch?

                <p>Embark Studios recently wrapped up a big Server Slam test for Arc Raiders ahead of its public launch on October 30, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-server-test-put-up-some-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535545/" data-ref-id="1100-6535545">the test was <em>huge</em></a>. Given that, Embark got a lot of feedback, and the developer has now disclosed some of what's it's working on addressing ahead of release.</p><p>The developer said player feedback, along with the team's own internal data, provided "crucial insights" into how Arc Raiders can be improved for launch. Here are the key points, <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/server-slam-thank-you/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as written by the developer.</a></p><ul><li><strong>Stability:</strong> You helped us quickly identify and resolve stability issues across all platforms during the test. We’ve locked in even more solutions leading up to launch day to ensure a smooth launch experience.</li><li><strong>The Flying ARCs:</strong> It turns out their awareness was a bit too high, allowing them to essentially see through trees and bushes. This made their vision unintentionally over-powered, but we’ve adjusted what they can see now, so expect a fairer fight at launch.</li><li><strong>The Dam Tower:</strong> We watched many of you bravely, and perhaps a little too easily, access the Dam Control Tower on Dam Battlegrounds. It was fun to watch, but a bit too accessible for a key loot location. That's been fixed to keep the challenge sharp.</li><li><strong>Visual Difference:</strong> Some noticed a visual difference between Server Slam and earlier tests on certain hardware. The default settings did change a bit to favor more performance, and we are looking into tuning further to strike the right balance.</li></ul><p>Additionally, Embark said feedback from the test gave the studio valuable feedback in terms of bug-fixes and game balance. "Every piece of data and feedback you provided is helping us to make <i>Arc</i> Raiders a better game," the developer said.</p><p>The studio also shared some key milestones from the test that players collectively achieved, including 30 million rounds played, 58 million Arc destroyed, and, most importantly, that players collected more than 800,000 rubber ducks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4589812-screenshot2025-10-23at2.49.30%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589812" data-ratio="0.55882352941176" data-width="748" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4589812-screenshot2025-10-23at2.49.30%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589812"></a><figcaption>Here are some Server Slam stats.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4589812-screenshot2025-10-23at2.49.30%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>Arc Raiders launches on October 30 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and it's priced at $40 USD.

The developer's latest Dev Talk video confirmed seven new multiplayer maps, three zombies maps, new weapons, seasonal events, and more for Season 1 of Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">This new Black Ops 7 <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1981421047376465996" rel="nofollow ">Dev Talk video</a> boasts that Season 1 is packed with content across multiplayer and Zombies. "This will be the biggest season we've ever done in franchise history," said senior director of production Yale Miller.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAcJLh2tE2o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LAcJLh2tE2o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There are seven 6v6 maps confirmed for multiplayer, and this will be a mix of new and remastered maps. The video shows a brief look at Fate, which is a brand-new map inspired by the game's campaign mission called Time and Fate. This features a trippy setting of fractured and floating building pieces from a city in Nicaragua. Other maps briefly shown are Odysseus, which is based on the campaign mission of the same name, and Utopia is a futuristic Guild facility based in Australia. For the season's remasters, Meltdown from Black Ops 2 will return in Season 1 of Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also confirmed map changes were being made based on community feedback from the beta. Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce said that the team is looking at all the doors across Black Ops 7's entire map pool to see where it can reduce automatic doors without disrupting gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">Seven weapons are coming in Season 1. Scronce confirms the fan-favorite Maddox assault rifle from Black Ops 4 is included in the lineup. A crossbow and the ballistic knife are also returning.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589841-season1roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589841" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589841-season1roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589841"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 launch content and Season 1 roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589841-season1roadmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for game modes, the return of Treyarch's crossbow and ballistic knife also means the popular Sticks and Stones party mode is packed into the Season 1 update. Prop Hunt and seasonal limited-time modes are confirmed as well.</p><p dir="ltr">For Zombies, there will be three maps. Season 1 is confirmed to have one brand-new round-based map and two survival maps based on locations from the Ashes of the Damned launch map. The update will add more augments, field upgrades, ammo mods, and other Zombies content. Players can also expect two limited-time holiday modes for Zombies on the season's new round-based map.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Black Ops 7 variant of Nuketown arrives on November 20, so players won't need to wait long after launch to start receiving more content.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's previous Dev Talk video discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-highly-requested-changes-to-aim-assist-perks-and-movement/1100-6535601/">multiplayer changes players can expect at launch</a>, including adjustments to the game's movement, aim assist, and perks.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Art the Clown from the Terrifier series of horror movies has sliced through three movies so far and is even a marquee haunted house at Universal's Halloween Horror Nights season of events this year. He'll soon be tearing into games, though, as <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/terrifier-the-artcade-game">Terrifier: The ARTcade Game</a> is launching on PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam next month on November 21.&nbsp;</p><p>Publisher SelectaPlay and developer Relevo revealed this news with a new gameplay trailer highlighting the special occasion. This trailer also features Terrifier: The ARTcade Game's theme song, which is composed by Cody Carpenter, the son of horror legend and <em>Halloween </em>creator John Carpenter. Not surprisingly, Carpenter follows in his father's footsteps with a nightmare-inducing synth-fueled theme for Art the Clown in video game form.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the latest Terrifier: The ARTcade Game trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNZp1zCvGTA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNZp1zCvGTA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, Terrifier: The ARTcade Game features vibrant pixel art, but it's still full of the blood and guts you expect if you've seen Art the Clown on the silver screen. While you can go it solo, the game also features local co-op for up to four players, and you can work together (or against each other) in various game modes while using a variety of weapons like chainsaws, cleavers, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>SelectaPlay says players can expect multiple stages with different paths to explore, plenty of enemies to defeat, boss battles at the end of each stage, a chiptune soundtrack, finisher attacks, and six game modes when Terrifier: The ARTcade Game launches on PlayStation 5 and PC on November 21.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to check out Terrifier: The ARTcade Game next month?

            <p>Icarus, the survival game made by Dean Hall of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dayz">DayZ</a> fame, is coming to console. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions of the game will be released in Q1 2026, and a trailer for the ports was aired during the Galaxies showcase today.</p>
<p>The console ports are being handled by a separate team to Hall's RocketWerkz studio in New Zealand. They're being developed by Grip Studios in the Czech Republic, which helped make games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, <a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a> and more in the past.</p>

<p>Icarus, a PvE survival crafting game for up to eight players, was released four years ago on PC and got off to a rocky start. But three expansions and many content updates later, it's in better shape. The console ports arriving later in the game's lifecycle means Grip has the benefit of cherry picking the best additions, and notably, the console version will include the New Frontiers expansion released in 2023.</p><p>There won't be cross-play, though, because the two versions of the game, PC and console, are different and therefore incompatible. Hall explained this to me in a separate interview which I've written into a bigger piece to be published tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hall said: "Instead of holding PC development back because of console, and holding console development back because of PC - personally that bothers me <em>intensely </em>as a consumer; I really, really, really don't like that... I wanted the console version to be the best console version that could be, and I wanted the PC version to be the best version it could be, and that means there are some content differences and some of the content on the console was packed differently."</p>
<p>Cross-play incompatibility "was unfortunately one of those casualties" caused by this.</p>
<p>One of the upsides of console development, however, has been proper controller support for everyone, finally.</p>

<p>Now that's a shock</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Yes, Nightdive Studios is bringing yet <em>another</em> game to the Switch later this year — and Switch 2 as well. This time around, the developer has revealed that it's porting its acclaimed 2023 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake to both consoles in 2025 with the full game on the cartridge.</p>
<p>The news dropped during the Indie Horror Showcase, and it makes for a rather nice surprise, especially as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2</a> only just launched earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version of the game, which is a remake of one of the most-influential first-person RPG shooters of all time, will support mouse controls, and come with 1080p and 60fps out of the box. Both Switch 1 and 2 releases will also be fully playable with gyro.</p>
<p>Nightdive Studios have remained extremely faithful to the 1994 original, instead focusing on updated controls, updated interfaces, and updated music and sounds. But really, we're all here to face off against one of gaming's greatest villains in SHODAN, right?</p>

<p>Many absolutely loved the remake back when it launched on PC in 2023, with a console port following the year after. Over <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/system-shock">on Push Square</a>, however, they were a little more critical, citing that the game was "showing its age" a little. So be prepared for a bit of a blast from the past there!</p>

Under this new “AI First” strategy, Krafton plans to use agentic AI to help automate work and implement an “AI-centered” management system, <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%86%A4-ai-first-%EA%B8%B0%EC%97%85-%EC%A0%84%ED%99%98-%EC%84%A0%EC%96%B8-1000%EC%96%B5-%EC%9B%90-%EC%9D%B4%EC%83%81-%ED%88%AC%EC%9E%90/">according to a translation of a press release</a>.</p><p>The company also plans to spend more than 100 billion Korean won, a figure that equates to nearly $70 million, to build a GPU cluster. Using its infrastructure, Krafton will pursue “AI workflow automation, as well as strengthen AI R&amp;D and in-game AI services,” the translated release says. Krafton aims to complete its AI platform by the second half of next year. The company is also going to invest about ₩30 billion every year to help employees apply AI tools into their work and it will also restructure its “HR and organizational operations” in support of the “AI First” strategy.</p><p>Tech companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644943/shopify-ceo-memo-ai-hires-job">Shopify</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/657594/duolingo-ai-first-replace-contract-workers">Duolingo</a> have made AI a key part of their internal operations as well, and Krafton may not be the only big gaming company to make big structural changes due to AI. The investors that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">plan to take EA private</a> are “betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA’s profits in the coming years,” the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133"><em>Financial Times</em> reported</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/805509/krafton-pubg-ai-first-developer-agentic-gpu-cluster]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a> has some laborious achievements. I know because I’ve been chasing them for weeks and still haven’t satisfied all of the necessary criteria to 100-percent the game in that regard. How tempting then to discover there’s a bug where you can pop every achievement in the remake and claim a complete Xbox gamerscore in just a couple of minutes. How fitting for an RPG about making deals with the devil!</p> <p>The trick was discovered by achievement hunter VidGamiac and shared on the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/forum/viewthread.aspx?tid=1654991&amp;anchor=12598482#m12598482">True Achievements forum</a> earlier this week. It’s a weird one and I still have no idea why it works the way it does. It revolves around starting a fresh save file, choosing English, selecting the Enhanced version, and then later changing to Japanese after you finish the tutorial battle. You can skip the initial cutscenes and fast-forward through all of the dialogue and most of the combat, letting you complete the glitch in just a few minutes. The precise steps are laid out in the video below:</p>

  <p>“Confirmed,” wrote fellow hunter Vudix. “Works. Hat tip to you, Gamiac.” Not everyone is so impressed. “Kinda sad and pathetic tbh,” wrote OldMateClown. “Appropriate Gamertag,” Vudix responded. All of these people have gamer scores of over 1 million.</p>

 <h2>The<em> FFT</em> achievement glitch does not work on PlayStation</h2> <p>Sorry trophy hunters, this is an Xbox exclusive and won’t work for the PlayStation 4 and PS5 versions of the game. Bad news for any Sony sickos looking for easy Platinums, but good news for anyone like me who might be easily seduced by the allure of being able to finally finish this game off. Unlocking every achievement and trophy in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> requires doing close to everything in the game, including all of the errands you can sign up for at shops, even the ones that only appear on random days of the in-game calendar year.</p> <p>But the one that’s really stopped me in my tracks is called “Master of All Trades” which requires one party member to learn every ability in the game. I’ve spent a handful of nights setting up auto-battles to grind for JP points and chip away at it with Ramza but it’s taking a while. Setting up <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-guide-xp-jp-grind-tips-2000633724">those XP fog farm arenas</a> is harder than it looks. I didn’t think I’d ever get sick of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> and yet, well, we’re getting close!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The full roadmap for Season One of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been revealed by Activision.</p>



<p>Launching on November 14th, Black Ops 7 is the latest installment in the iconic FPS series. Putting an emphasis on Multiplayer, the game is set to hone in on what fans want when it comes to the series. Furthermore, the series returns to the futuristic settings of games past, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-not-have-jetpacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though without jetpacks</a>. With the release fast approaching, the team has shown off what players can expect at launch, as well as Season One.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-includes-new-post-launch-multiplayer-zombie-maps">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season One Includes New Post-Launch Multiplayer, Zombie Maps</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The biggest year in Black Ops history starts with BO7 launch, and it's just the beginning. Season 01 will be our most massive season yet 💥</p><p>🚀 18 MP maps and 2 Zombies experiences on Nov. 14<br>☢️ Nuketown 2025 on Nov. 20 <br>🔥 7 Multiplayer maps in Season 01 <br>🧟 3 Zombies maps in… <a href="https://t.co/qeau4DVBiB">pic.twitter.com/qeau4DVBiB</a></p></div>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1981422889497690225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1981422889497690225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Twitter/X post</a>, Activision revealed the content of the launch and Season One of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. At release, the game will have 18 Multiplayer maps and two Zombie maps for players to enjoy. A week later, the iconic Nuketown will make a return, nicknamed Nuketown 2025. After that, six maps, including Meltdown and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-showcase-tokyo-game-show-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previously revealed Yakei</a>, will come out. More maps are expected to be revealed at a later date. Furthermore, three new Zombies maps will be included in Season One, including two Survival ones.</p>



<p>Given that the game will launch on Xbox Game Pass, like Black Ops 6, it’s sure to be quite the hit. However, the decision may hurt sales, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sales-microsoft-cost-millions-game-pass-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it did last year</a> for Microsoft/Xbox. Even still, with the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, it’s clear the genre still has some juice in it. While the open beta didn’t go too well in terms of numbers, Black Ops 7 remains a heavily anticipated title for many. Fortunately, it seems it’ll be supported for long after November 14th, should it all go well.</p>



<p>What do you think of Black Ops 7’s Season One Roadmap? Any maps you can’t wait to play in? Will you be getting the game at launch? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Valve benefits from any panicked trading in the short term, with every Steam Marketplace sale <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/61F0-72B7-9A18-C70B#steamfee">carrying</a> a 5 percent “Steam Transaction Fee” on top of a 10 percent “<em>Counter-Strike 2</em> fee… that is determined and collected by the game publisher” (read: Valve). In the long term, though, making some of the rarest items in the game easier to obtain will likely depress overall spending among the whales that dominate the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wild CS2 update tonight. I’ve spent the last few hours digging through market data and built this projection chart to show how I think things play out.</p>
<p>Knives and gloves drop fast (40–50%) as the new trade-up path floods supply, while Covert skins surge short-term as everyone… <a href="https://t.co/8NOMIBPZ1F">pic.twitter.com/8NOMIBPZ1F</a></p>
<p>— SAC (@SAC_IG) <a href="https://twitter.com/SAC_IG/status/1981195130880115068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Using marketplace data, Irish Guys esports team owner SAC <a href="https://x.com/SAC_IG/status/1981195130880115068">ran some projections</a> estimating that, over the next few months, “the market settles about 5–10% lower overall, not a crash, just a correction.” But there are also <a href="https://x.com/SAC_IG/status/1981334081032843542">more bullish and bearish possibilities</a>, depending on how overall item demand and market liquidity develops in the near future.</p>
<p>Market tracker CSFloat <a href="https://x.com/csfloatcom/status/1981208712963641810">also crunched some numbers</a> to determine that the overall supply of knives and gloves could roughly double if every common item were traded up under the new update. In practice, though, the supply increase will likely be “far less.”</p>
<p>Massive monetary shifts aside, this latest update seems set to make it easier for new <em>CS2</em> players to access some once-rare in-game items without breaking the bank. “I got burned a little [by the update]… but honestly, this is the way to go for the long term health of the game,” Redditor chbotong <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cs2/comments/1odyl57/thank_you_valve_for_this_update/">wrote</a>. “[It’s] given me faith that Valve is actually steering in a direction that favors the average player than a market whale.”</p>

                <p>Epic Games has yet to officially confirm that the next major Fortnite update will focus on The Simpsons, but the evidence continues to grow. Today, it was reported that <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Moe_Szyslak" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Moe Szyslak</a>, the slimy bartended from Moe's Tavern, will have a skin in the forthcoming Simpsons collaboration.</p><p>He would join <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-collab-could-feature-a-flanders-skin/1100-6535598/" data-ref-id="1100-6535598">Ned Flanders</a>, who was previously leaked, along with presumably some or all of the main Simpson family members like Homer and Marge.</p><p>Moe is one of the best-known and most-recognizable characters from The Simpsons, so him being included with the rumored collab is not a big surprise. The leak, from user Blortzen, said Moe will have a skin in Fortnite and will appear on the map as an NPC. Moe's Tavern will be on the map, too, it seems.</p><p>The rumored upcoming Fortnite collaboration with The Simpsons is said to be significant, with Fortnite adding a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-springfield-is-reportedly-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6535560/" data-ref-id="1100-6535560">new map based on Springfield</a> and featuring its various points of interest, like the nuclear power plant where Homer works.</p><p>For more, be sure to check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-season-everything-we-actually-know-so-far/1100-6533563/" data-ref-id="1100-6533563">everything we've heard so far about the rumored Simpsons collaboration with Fortnite.</a> The new season is rumored to begin in early November.</p><p>In semi-related news, a fan-made re-skin of The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run focusing on Futurama has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/simpsons-hit-run-designer-loves-fan-made-futurama-re-skin/1100-6535602/" data-ref-id="1100-6535602">drawn the praise of one of the game's original designers</a>.</p><p>As for the TV series, The Simpsons debuted in 1989 and is now in its 37th season. The show was renewed earlier this year and will continue through at least Season 40 in 2028-2029. A second Simpsons Movie is coming as well, and it's set for release in July 2027, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-2-announced-coming-july-2027/1100-6535348/" data-ref-id="1100-6535348">on the same day as A Minecraft Movie 2.</a></p>

		<p>We love Warhammer 40,000 here at TSA. There’s been a cavalcade of brilliant Warhammer 40K games over the past couple of years, and the Gorkamorka-based Speed Freeks definitely sits amongst them, with its multiplayer proving to be an absolute blast. In honour of Warhammer Day, developer Caged Element and publisher Wired Productions have announced the arrival of the Deffkopta, a unique airborne vehicle that completely changes up the combat dynamic, while also bringing two new battlegrounds to the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks Deffkopta Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/csOxDI0YpZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Firstly, this is a free update, which is the way all things should be, and secondly, if you haven’t hopped into Speed Freeks already, it’s currently on sale on Steam with 55% off. I really enjoyed it at launch, and on its way to an 8/10 I said, “Speed Freeks is a perfect example of how smaller, more focused, multiplayer titles can find a place in the swollen games market. It’s all the better for losing its free-to-play status, and it deserves to find a committed community of players. Here’s hoping that it’ll find its way to console, as I think it’s a great fit for pick up and play action, especially for people who want to play online, without having to devote their entire life and personality to gaining access to the next tier league or justifying a battle pass purchase.”</p>
<p>“This new vehicle really changes the dynamic of the game”, said Chris Mallinson, Game Director. “And although it’s so different, it fits right in and complements the rest of the vehicles we’ve got. We’re pumped to see how players will use it, because it’s a hell of a lot of fun to even just fly around”</p>
<p>The two New Maps Battle are built for maximum mayhem. The first is Scrap In Da Yard, a Kill Konvoy map featuring vertical combat and a trench requiring expert driving skills to navigate. The second is Deff Gorge, the existing Kill Konvoy map “Da Gorge” gets a visual overhaul and expands its borders into a Deff Rally map.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-unveils-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-includes-all-dlc-150-creation-club-content-and-it%E2%80%99s-also-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2.1333210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As part of Bethesda's <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/5S63EJI5hmThAU6I8jaiQj/fallout-day-broadcast-2025-news">Fallout Day celebrations</a>, a new edition of Fallout 4 was unveiled: Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition, which includes all six official expansions, over 150 Creation Club items, making it the new definitive version of Fallout 4 across PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S when it arrives on November 10, 2025. This new version is also coming to Nintendo Switch 2, though we'll have to wait a little longer to see it arrive, since that version is scheduled to release sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>This new version is also part of celebrating Fallout 4's ten-year anniversary, since it originally arrived on PS4, Xbox One, and PC on November 10, 2015. The Anniversary Edition's launch will also mark the arrival of Creations in Fallout 4, as it will feature an in-game Creations menu letting you download and find even more creations along with what's already included.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Players who already own Fallout 4 or who have access to it through PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass will be able to upgrade to the Anniversary Edition through two upgrade options, though Bethesda didn't share more details on those options at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>Of course, this new version will also <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc-upgrade/">include the graphical upgrades we got in April 2024</a> for modern consoles, fully replacing the Game of the Year Edition as the new all-in-one definitive version to grab.</p>



<p>In other Fallout news, a physical anniversary bundle was announced for Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 76 is heading to Ohio in a new expansion that'll arrive on December 2, right in time for Season 2 of Amazon's Fallout adaptation.</p>

<p>Also, if you've never given the Fallout franchise a try, then this is certainly a good time to do so, since to go along with these new announcements, the games are all on sale on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation for a limited time.</p>



<p>This new edition of Fallout 4 is definitely nice to see as a way of celebration of the game's legacy, but it's yet another reminder of the fact that it's been a decade and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/">there's absolutely no sign of Fallout 5</a>. It might even be close to another decade by the time the game does come out, since as far as we know, Bethesda has <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-will-be-microsoft-exclusives-ftc-says/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a> in the works ahead of Fallout 5.</p>



<p>By the time it enters full production and is out on what will likely be the next generation of consoles and PC hardware, it'll be interesting to see if it can live up to the expectations that will have built up after years of waiting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>2015’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-the-kotaku-review-1743410637"><em>Fallout 4</em></a> turns 10 years old this year, and to celebrate this anniversary, Bethesda is bringing the open-world RPG to Nintendo Switch 2…in 2026. Meanwhile, this new version of the game, <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em>, will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in November.</p> <p>On October 23, Bethesda held its second annual Fallout Day Broadcast, a Direct-like pre-recorded event announcing new <em>Fallout</em>-themed content and games. It happens on October 23 because that’s the day the bombs dropped in the post-apocalyptic video game series. This year, the event didn’t have too much to announce. The big “news” was the reveal of <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/N00XVTawnzBBH7HNwv0hN/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced"><em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em></a>, a version of the RPG that combines the base game, all the DLC, and 150+ pieces of Creation Club content into one package. This version will also support Creations, Bethesda’s cross-platform mods system that already exists in <em>Starfield</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>.&nbsp; This version of the game is coming to all the platforms<em> Fallout 4</em> was previously launched on, plus a new one: the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

   <p>“The definitive edition of <em>Fallout 4</em>&nbsp;is coming to&nbsp;Nintendo Switch 2,” posted Bethesda in a press release. “It’s been ten years since players first stepped out of Vault 111 and into the post-nuclear world. To mark the occasion, Bethesda Game Studios is thrilled to announce <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em>. This is the ultimate celebration of a beloved classic, bringing together the complete&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4</em> experience on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.”</p> <p>This is the first official, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(franchise)#Games">mainline <em>Fallout</em> video game to arrive on a Nintendo platform</a>.<em> Fallout Shelter</em> and<em> Fallout Pinball</em> were previously released on Switch, but those hardly count.<em> Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 is the first time the franchise has truly made the leap to Mario’s base of operations, and it makes me wonder if some other <em>Fallout</em> games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-fallout-games-3-4-5-76-bethesda-rpg-new-vegas-611408965/2">like <em>Fallout 3</em> or <em>New Vegas</em></a>, could arrive on Nintendo’s new console in the future. Surely if<em> Fallout 4</em> can run on Switch 2, the older games can, too. For now, though, <em>Fallout</em> fans looking to play the franchise on Switch 2 will have to be happy with<em> Fallout 4</em> when it arrives on Nintendo’s system sometime in 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Datamine Reveals Battle Royale is to Release on October 28th]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-datamine/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-datamine-reveals-battle-royale-is-to-release-on-october-28th.1333198/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A datamine for Battlefield 6 has revealed that the highly anticipated Battle Royale is currently set to launch on October 28th, 2025. The strings of code which have been posted online refer to a mode codename “Granite”, which Insidier Gaming can verify is the Battle Royale gamemode.</p>



<p>First leaked by <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ModernWarzone</a>, who revealed that the mode will have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 28th release date</a>, he took to X (formerly Twitter) today to reveal that code within the game files also now confirms his past reports.</p>



<p>In a follow-up tweet, he posted the strings of code revealing that Granite, the codename for the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale, is currently set to go live during the Season 1 release on October 28.</p>



<p>Of course, things are indeed subject to change, but ModernWarzone’s confidence, especially over the last couple of days around the date, tells us that he’s almost certainly not wrong. While Insider Gaming isn’t currently able to independently verify the news, it’s certainly looking like a shadowdrop of the mode is on the horizon.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play">Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Free to Play</h2>



<p>Insider Gaming first exclusively reported on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Battle Royale</a> in February 2024, which we reported at the time that it was planned to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play experience</a>. At the time of writing, Battlefield Studios has only confirmed the game mode’s existence and hasn’t said when it will release or whether it will be free-to-play.</p>



<p>That said, we likely don’t have long to wait before hearing more.</p>

The cycle of day is ruled by humans, the night one by horrid creatures. Despite its efforts, humanity is annihilated with every arrival of the Night.</p><p>A group of humans, calling themselves ‘The Stalkers,’ discovered how to use the power of darkness to their advantage and fought the Night. However, it was not enough, and with every new dawn humanity rose again knowing that, with darkness, comes extinction.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Humanity found the ‘Seal of Night,’ an artifact that allowed them to stop the cycle in an everlasting day. In exchange for a blood oath that The Stalkers were willing to pay, the sun ruled for hundreds of generations and, for the first time, hope was a beacon of light. Yet fate proved unstoppable, and they paid the ultimate price.</p><p>Now, as the Night starts devouring every single glint of light, Vesper, a Stalker by right and daughter of the traitor, will travel a dying land trying to save the last embers of humanity. She hunts in a race against destiny, as the shadows lengthen both in the world and in her mind.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Engage in Fast-Paced Dynamic Combat</strong> – Dash through enemies while you unleash your combos, use your weapons or destroy them with your dark powers. You can switch between melee and ranged attack in quick succession: slashing enemies with your sword and then dashing away to use your ranged weapons, avoiding enemy attacks.</li><li><strong>Face Intense Challenging Bosses</strong> – Endure the ultimate challenge as you fight the ancient <a title="Genres > Horror [736 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s of the Night that have been annihilating humanity over and over in intense boss battles.

Customize the upgrades of your arsenal and use the equipment that best suits your gameplay: Critical Damage, Life Steal, Poison, Close Combat, Firepower and more. Collect Sanguine vials, Crow Feathers, Moonstones and Noctilium to increase your stats and get ready to face the Night.</li><li><strong>Discover the Dark World of Medhram</strong> – Explore Medhram in a combination of <a title="Genres > Action [3,138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>–<a title="Genres > Adventure [2,642 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> and dark fantasy lore. Survive huge dungeons full of traps, enemies, puzzles and challenges. Discover all kinds of locations, from ancient cathedrals and libraries of knowledge to lost kingdoms and devastated floating cities.</li><li><strong>Complete ‘Hunts’ as a Member of the Stalkers</strong> – Accept a hunt at ‘Crow’s Nest’ and track down the dark beast, find where it hides and hunt the most powerful creatures of the Night. After every completed hunt you will get rewards that will increase your health and dark energy bar.</li><li><strong>Follow <a title="Platforms > Quest [158 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>lines for Secondary Characters</strong> – Meet new characters and open full questlines that will vary depending on your actions: deciding to help them or not, finding them at their next location, failing to achieve the mission requirements in time… Everything counts!</li><li><strong>Play to Adapted and Immersive Music</strong> – Immersive and adapted music to every moment, boss and location, with the collaboration of Hiroki Kikuta, Secret of <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a> composer.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/hunt-the-night-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch-in-q1-2026]]></content:encoded>
