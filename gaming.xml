              <p>Looking for a new set of earbuds that sound absolutely fantastic? If money is a concern, you should skip some of the more expensive models and try the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2. They’ll offer some extra sound for the price and some serious oomph. All you have to do is lock yours in before they’re no longer on sale.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6645/">You can get the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 at Amazon for $179 right now. That’s $50 less than the typical $229 price.</a> That represents a $50 discount and a savings of about 22% compared to retail.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6645/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Excellent, comfortable earbuds with great noise cancellation</h2>
<p>These earbuds are extremely light with soft ear tips, so they’re comfortable to wear for long periods of time. They’re able to seal the ear canal better than other earbuds of this caliber, which gives you more bass and more accurate midrange sounds, so you can turn the volume back down and still be able to enjoy your music.</p>
<p>Fast songs sound alive, so to speak, with clean and distinct vocals. Even complex song mixes sound clear, with podcasts and audiobooks are also a pleasure to listen to because voices sound very natural and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Noise cancellation is another feature that helps you concentrate on whatever you’re listening to by blocking out surrounding distractions such as street noise, conversation, or train noises, allowing you to be able to listen to your audio at lower volumes. With Transparency Mode, you can also listen to ambient noise by allowing the surrounding environment to seep into the earbuds, to let you to hear traffic, or talking if you need to make sure you know what’s going on around you.</p>



<p>The battery life is excellent for wireless earbuds and gives you plenty of hours of playback per charge. The charging case is also a bonus as it gives you additional power when needed and also serves as a portable charging station, allowing you to charge the earbuds on-the-go via a USB-C cable or wireless charging pad.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 work seamlessly with applications and intelligent features that make customizing your experience easy. You can fine-tune sound settings, configure the earbuds’ controls, and even upgrade the earbuds’ firmware remotely. That alone saves some precious time where you need it the most.</p>
<p>For under $200, the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 are super affordable and a great option if you want good audio. Give them a try and save some serious cash while reaping the benefits of excellent earbuds.</p>

		<p>I hope you’ve all had a lovely Christmas break and are thoroughly refreshed for the year ahead, because we’ve doubtless got some serious gaming to get up to! But what did we all get up to over the holidays? Were there any big new games under your decorated spruce?</p>
<p>Swanning off to visit family, I made sure to pack the Switch 2 for my gaming time. I made a start on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a>… and then made another start because I quit the game during a cutscene and hadn’t hit the first save point. I duelled other in the micro retro gaming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/nintendo-world-championship-nes-edition-review/">Nintendo World Championship: NES Edition</a>. I scrolled through the eShop sale and snagged Fast Fusion. But the main thing I played was actually <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>. While I’ve often made a start on this classic for its rereleases and remasters on Wii U and Switch, I’d never made it past the second or third cluster of galaxies. So, it was high time to fix that, and I’m now on the cusp of the final showdown to rescue my “special one”, as Rosalina keeps calling them.</p>
<p>I assume Rosalina means it’s Jose Mourinho? But I’ll find out this weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> making a start to 2026 with his first review of the year, and it’s the charming and ambitious platforming adventure Big Hops. This was featured in the Day of the Devs stream last year, but to keep an air of mystery, I won’t tell you which kind of hopping animal you play as.</p>

<p><strong>Jason’s</strong> body is now ready for both a new D&amp;D campaign –&nbsp;he’s made a “silly build” –&nbsp;and for the next Genshin Impact patch. While he waits for both of those, he’s letting his Megabonk obsession carry him through to a score of 200,000… or at least that’s his plan.</p>
<p>We’re amongst gaming royalty, as <strong>Ade</strong> has made it up to Gold Tier 3 in Marvel Rivals – OK, so I’m stretching that definition pretty far, but he’s dead chuffed with himself. Alongside that, he’s been playing a shoot ’em up puzzler called Popucom with Laura for an upcoming review.</p>
<p>And speaking of his better half, <strong>Laura</strong> has continued to dive into the creepiness of Silent Hill f, which she’s pronouncing ‘fffffffff’. She’s also still tending to her dinosaur park in Jurassic World Evolution 3, but is starting to run up against the boundaries of the simulation and is being told her park is too big!</p>

<p>It’s mostly been our Game of the Year winner Ghost of Yotei for <strong>Gamoc</strong>, alongside Borderlands 4, and some Warriors: Abyss thrown in for good measure. His general verdict? “They’re all great.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> tells us that, “In keeping with the festive spirit I played through the ultra bleak and depressing Total Chaos which was great for a game that began life as a mod for Doom II. I’ve balanced that with some family Guitar Hero and Rock Band 3 evenings on Wii (through the WiiU) – even getting to try out the keyboard for the latter. Kids now want me to get Clone Hero sorted out for PC. Finally I started Lost Records Bloom and Rage which is already playing out in familiar Don’t Nod style but I’m interested to see where it’s going.”</p>

<p>And finally, not able to face the cold snap that we’re currently enduring <strong>Dom’s</strong> been playing Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road in the little bits of brain-soothing free time that he has away from the madness of working the festive season.</p>
<p>That’s us, but what about you? What did you play over the holidays?</p>

              <p>Marvel’s&nbsp;<em>Wonder Man</em> finally arrives on Disney+ January 27, and somewhat belatedly has received a trailer that actually gives us an idea of the show. And it looks&nbsp;<em>really</em> good! The new trailer, that introduces the three main characters, is delivered with wit and—at last—some action. We’ve got Wonder Man himself Simon Williams (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), former <em>Iron Man&nbsp;</em>fake terrorist Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley), and maverick director Von Kovak (Zlatko Buric), in a program that intends to send up the production of superhero movies, while telling a superhero story of its own.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-wonder-man-trailer-disney-mcu-2000634087">Previous trailers</a> have been weirdly shy of showing Simon Williams at all, instead peculiarly focusing on the secondary leads, and absolutely avoiding showing even a hint of Wonder Man’s wonder. Thank goodness that’s now over. The promo playfully riffs on Rossini’s <em>The Barber of Seville</em>, introducing us to the main players, and then at long last setting up the actual ongoing story of the show. Things begin with Williams auditioning to play Wonder Man in a remake of a (fictional) 1970s cult hit, while hiding the fact that he himself has superpowers. The director of the movie is the eccentric Von Kovak, a former Oscar winner now lowering himself to the popularism and tired field of superhero movies in an attempt to revive the genre. Meanwhile, actual Oscar winner Ben Kingsley reprises his role of Trevor, the actor hired to play terrorist Mandarin in <em>Iron Man 3</em>, who then also appeared in&nbsp;<em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em>, as well as his own one-shot&nbsp;<em>All Hail the King</em>.</p>

 <p>We get to see Williams’ powers appearing, from his purple sparkles in his eyes (perhaps rather unfortunately reminiscent of DC’s&nbsp;<em>Black Lightning</em>), and then an awful lot of rumbling, wobbling rooms, and explodifying a table.</p>  <p>I’ve not quite known what to think before now, mostly because the preview coverage has seemed so afraid to show us Wonder Man at all, making me suspicious it was trying to hide something. But seeing Abdul-Mateen II at last shows anything but. The actor, best known for playing Manta in the <em>Aquaman</em> movies and Morpheus in the lackluster <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em>, demonstrates excellent comedy chops in the short clips.</p>

 <p>There’s only a few weeks left to find out if it all comes together, and if Marvel can add a new compelling live-action Disney+ show to its slate following eight months of nothing, to accompany last year’s splendid <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>, but following&nbsp;the confused and disappointing <em>Ironheart</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Deus Ex lead actor Elias Toufexis has branded the franchise's owners as "psychopaths," as the wait continues for a new entry in the dormant stealth action series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006498544270856318" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on X, Toufexis laid out his work schedule for 2026, which he said included Bungie's upcoming shooter Marathon and three unannounced projects. Of course, this tease prompted Deus Ex fans to suggest that at least one of these mystery projects was a long-awaited new Deus Ex sequel — something Toufexis was quick to shut down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"...no Deus Ex because the people in charge are psychopaths," Toufexis wrote. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Toufexis has been vocal in support of a new Deus Ex game materializing over the years, though it has now been a decade since the arrival of 2016's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deus-ex-mankind-divided">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a>. Developed by Eidos Montreal, the game arrived on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to positive reviews. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But rather than develop a follow up, the next few years saw Eidos Montreal put to work on Square Enix's failed Marvel's Avengers live-service game, as well as its own take on Guardians of the Galaxy, alongside its continuing role as a support studio for the Tomb Raider franchise. With these franchises taking priority, Deus Ex fell by the wayside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fan excitement for a new Deus Ex was rekindled after Square Enix sold Eidos Montreal — and the Deus Ex franchise — to publisher Embracer, and indeed, a new game in the series was reportedly worked on for two years. Alas, this project was reported to have been canned in 2024, amid Embracer's widespread restructuring.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Deus Ex Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"As you guys all know, Jensen is one of the characters I’ve played who is near and dear to my heart. It seems I will always be associated with him and that’s just fine with me," Toufexis wrote in a subsequent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/s/oIdy7dsQWv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> post, after word of the game's cancellation spread.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Alas, his story seems done. I’m relatively certain the game that was canceled was not an Adam Jensen story, so the cancellation angers me more than anything else because friends at Eidos got laid off. Video game companies right now are in a weird place. I hope it gets straightened out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A year ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a> reported that Eidos Montreal was once again pitching an idea for a new Deus Ex title, though there was no suggestion this idea had been successful. Next up for the series will be Aspyr's recently-delayed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deus-ex-remastered">Deus Ex Remastered</a>, a polished up port of the franchise's original entry, which has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deus-ex-remastered-announced-with-february-2026-release-date">pushed from its original February 2026 launch date following fan concerns over its quality</a>. The project currently lacks a new launch window, and pre-orders have been refunded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Toufexis previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deus-ex-human-revolution-lead-was-canned-from-starring-in-far-cry-3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> he spent two years working on Far Cry 3, recording lines as the game's protagonist Jason Brody, before Ubisoft replaced him in the role. The voice actor claimed the reason for this switch was his work as the Deus Ex protagonist, whose voice had become too "popular" and recognizable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Underrated 'slow life' role-playing game Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - which stole a lot of my time last year on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> - has just received an exciting new year content drop.</p>
<p>The update, free and available now on all platforms (PC, Xbox, PlayStation and Switch), is called Sinister Broker Bazario's Schemes, and it adds a new location to the game called Snoozaland, where Fantasy Life i becomes a roguelike experience - one life, one attempt, see how far you get.</p>

<p>There, in Snoozaland, you'll always start as an unequipped level one character, and the world will rearrange itself every time you reattempt it. You'll learn new lives - the game's job/class/role system - on the job, and gather equipment as you explore. </p>
<p>A powerful end-boss and powerful rewards await, and there are alchemy robots you'll find that will potentially spit out powerful items, providing you fill them up with various unwanted materials and equipment first.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/dlc1/">The game's website</a> makes it sound like a self-contained experience, which presumably means the character you build while adventuring in Snoozaland only lasts for as long as your run does, and that there's no actual permanence there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-i-might-be-the-star-of-the-switch-2-launch-providing-both-the-animal-crossing-and-rpg-experience-it-needs">I found Fantasy Life i to be one of the Switch 2's most alluring launch titles</a>. It's a sort of cross between Animal Crossing and Dragon Quest - a game that's part town building and resource harvesting and crafting, and part role-playing adventure. It's bright and colourful and uplifting.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Console Hacking Has Detonated An Explosive’: PlayStation 5 ROM Keys Leak Online, Opening the Door to Permanent Jailbreaks, Custom Firmware]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/console-hacking-has-detonated-an-explosive-playstation-5-rom-keys-leak-online-opening-the-door-to-permanent-jailbreaks-custom-firmware/</link>
            <guid>1395805</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Since the PlayStation 5's release in late 2020, console hackers have attempted to gain complete access to the system by discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities, using software exploits to access features not normally available to consumers.</p>



<p>But on <strong>New Year's Eve</strong>, console hacking groups detonated another sort of explosive that could have <strong>massive consequences</strong> for the PlayStation 5 hacking scene, opening the door for <strong>permanent jailbreak, custom firmware, emulation,</strong> and much more.</p>



<p>As detailed in an <strong><a href="https://thecybersecguru.com/news/ps5-rom-keys-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extremely well-put-together report by <em>The CyberSec Guru</em></a></strong>, at the end of 2025, people in the PlayStation 5 hacking scene began discussing a <strong>massive data dump</strong> that appeared on <em>psdevwiki.com</em> and private Discord servers. This data dump contained the <strong>Level 0 BootROM keys</strong> for the system.</p>



<p>The <strong>BootROM</strong> is the first piece of code the PlayStation 5 runs when the system is turned on, the <strong>deepest level</strong> of the console's security architecture, which is used to decrypt and verify the initial stages of the system boot chain. As such, acquiring these keys, which are stored in a <strong>read-only chip</strong> and decrypted on boot by the system's APU, <strong><em>essentially means that anyone with these keys literally owns the system.</em></strong></p>



<p>Any exploit based on these keys would <strong>significantly surpass</strong> all software exploits available to date, as the code and keys in the BootROM <strong>cannot be modified</strong> with a software update.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Feature</strong></td><td><strong>Software Kernel Exploits (Previous)</strong></td><td><strong>Level 0 BootROM Leak (Current)</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Patchability</strong></td><td><strong>Fixable</strong> via System Update</td><td><strong>Unpatchable</strong> (Silicon-bound)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Persistence</strong></td><td>Lost after reboot</td><td><strong>Permanent</strong> Custom Firmware potential</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Access Level</strong></td><td>User/Kernel land</td><td><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Root of Trust</strong> (Deepest)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hardware</strong></td><td>Varies by Firmware version</td><td><strong>All existing PS5 models</strong> vulnerable</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>While Sony will likely introduce a <strong>hardware revision (CFI-3000 series)</strong> to rotate these keys in future retail units, the <strong>60+ million consoles</strong> already in homes are now effectively <strong><em>'unlocked' for life.</em></strong></p>



<h3 id="h-what-does-this-mean-for-the-end-user"><strong>What Does This Mean For The End User?</strong></h3>



<p>This massive PlayStation 5 leak has significant implications. Even if any end user gets access to the leaked ROM keys, they would be able to do nothing with them. However, the ability to <strong>decrypt the bootloader</strong> will greatly <strong>accelerate the development of a Custom Firmware</strong> to let the system boot into a modified operating system permanently, without having to run software exploits every time, and with <strong>no risk</strong> of firmware updates patching the vulnerability.</p>



<p>In addition to accelerating the development of custom firmwares, the leaked ROM keys could be a <strong>boon for the emulation scene</strong>, providing emulator developers with the necessary information to enhance the emulator's <strong>compatibility and accuracy</strong>.</p>



<p>In addition, the PlayStation 5 could become an <strong>emulation powerhouse</strong> capable of running games released on various systems, potentially even running <strong>PlayStation 3 games natively via the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-can-now-run-all-released-playstation-3-games/">RPCS3 emulator</a></strong>, which has been a long-standing community wish. Unfortunately, this could also <strong>pave the way for piracy</strong>, as a custom firmware could run pirated games on any system.</p>



<p><strong><em>'The PlayStation 5 you own today is not the same console it was yesterday. It is now an open book,'</em></strong> concluded <em>The CyberSec Guru</em> in their report, while the community jokes on Sony's HQ now being on fire, which probably is, at least figuratively, considering the severity of this leak.</p>



<p>No matter how the situation is addressed, it will be very interesting to see how the Japanese company will handle this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">critical situation</strong> alongside other potentially crippling hardware issues like the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/all-ps5-consoles-will-eventually-require-maintenance-playstation-5-liquid-metal-degradation/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">liquid metal cooling issues</strong></a>, and what will come with what is set to become an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">epochal leak</em></strong> for console security.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For years, fans of the high-octane gun-fu franchise, John Wick, have been crying out for a decent game tied to the series. The nature of the film franchise almost writes itself as a video game, but despite a couple of low-budget titles, nothing has really emerged in the space.</p>



<p>During a recent earnings call, Lionsgate Chairman Adam Fogelson confirmed that a ‘AAA John Wick game’ is in development and will be officially announced soon. He also mentioned that a new ‘SAW’ game is also incoming, the first since 2010’s SAW II: Flesh and Blood.</p>







<h2 id="h-john-wick-game-could-be-coming-soon">John Wick Game Could Be Coming Soon</h2>



<p>The recent earnings call at Lionsgate gave way to a solid revelation, and soon, we’ll have an official announcement of an all-new John Wick game <strong>and </strong>a SAW project. In a snippet pulled from the earnings call, Adam Fogelson, Chairman at Lionsgate, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our AAA game opportunities and other gaming opportunities. around John Wick and Saw and some others that we’ll be announcing soon.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/aaa-john-wick-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>It was further mentioned that Lionsgate has acknowledged the ‘increased interest’ fans have in adaptations of the popular franchises under its belt, like <strong>John Wick</strong>.</p>



<p>What’s not clear is what a John Wick AAA game could look like. It’s up in the air, and fans are eagerly debating the possibilities, such as an extension of John Wick’s story, played out by Keanu Reeves, or a unique, original story that allows players to create their own diehard assassin character.</p>



<p>Being frank, it’s most likely the latter possibility, as this would allow the developers much more creative freedom, both in terms of the story and the setting.</p>



<p>Fans then set about pulling apart the rest of Lionsgate’s line-up, surmising what other IP could be yanked into the video game world. One concept saw The Hunger Games emerge as an all-new battle royale game or a dystopian, post-apocalyptic epic of sorts.</p>







<p>What do you expect from a John Wick game? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rust’s next major update is going to be released on February 5th, Facepunch Studios has announced as part of Rust’s 12th anniversary roundup. That update is the Naval update and it is going to be adding new content like player made boats that will allow players to sail across the deep seas to find new islands and monuments, along with new encounters. If you want to try the Naval update early, you can do so by joining the <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/staging">Rust Staging Branch,</a> which is the game’s insider program.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rust - 12th Anniversary | 2025 Recap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K-fvgsGB9QI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In addition, Facepunch Studios has confirmed it will continue to release updates on the first Thursday of every month, though some will be lighter than others. The development team has also confirmed what else Rust players can expect over the course of 2026 in terms of new content, including new animals like cows and sheep as well as a dedicated animal breeding program. There will also be new monuments, including an apartment complex, and improvements to player animations, looks and movements. The team will also be looking at previous content that has been released that has not been popular and will explore ways to rework them to fit into the current Rust experience.</p>
<p>When it comes to DLC, Facepunch will continue to release new items or skins almost every month, with a dedicated DLC team working on these. Additionally, the studio has announced it is looking into a battle pass system for Rust, but this is still in early planning and it may not materialise if it does not prove to be valuable or rewarding to players. When it comes cheating in Rust, Facepunch Studios is looking to hire more support staff and developers focused solely on supporting anti-cheat methods, along with a new anti-cheat layer that should be coming in 2026. Performance is another area that the team continues to look at as it tries to balance new content with already existing game structures. One of the key improvements in 2025 saw load and server connection times reduced by around 65%. Finally, Rust Mobile is also due to be released this year though a release date has not yet been confirmed.</p>

            <p>Is there really going to be a new paid expansion released for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> in 2026? Because that's the suggestion I've seen. That's the rumour that's been ricocheting around the internet while I've been trying to enjoy a leftover sandwich this holiday.</p>
<p>The rumour stemmed originally from someone called Borys Nieśpielak, a trusted source of Polish games industry information - a leaker of sorts. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/polish-indie-lichtspeer-documentary-we-are-alright">He made a documentary a few years back about Polish indie game development, called We are alright</a>, which is a good watch, and it shows that he has industry connections.</p>
<p>Nieśpielak said in the summer last year that Fool's Theory, the studio remaking The Witcher 1 for CD Projekt Red, was making a new Witcher 3 expansion, and he reiterated this ahead of The Game Awards in December where he expected the announcement to be made, according to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/dlc-game-awards">PCGamesN</a>. But such an announcement never came.</p>

No, because a separate voice has added strength to it. <a href="https://x.com/MtChrzanowski">Polish Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski</a> wrote a report on 16th December - after The Game Awards - which said, "We expect the next paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026." That's according to a Google translation of <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk">a Polish website report</a> via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ptxa4g/the_witcher_3_dlc_to_release_in_may_2026_other/">Reddit</a>.</p><p>"We assume sales of 11 million copies at $30 each next year. We estimate the production budget at PLN 52 million. The release should kick off the proper marketing campaign for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>," Chrzanowski added. Later, he predicted The Witcher 4 would be released in Q4 2027.</p>
<p>I wonder: could this rumoured Witcher 3 expansion be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-whole-new-witcher-trilogy-of-games-released-within-six-years-of-each-other-is-that-even-possible-cd-projekt-red-thinks-so">the unannounced project referenced in a recent CD Projekt Red financial report</a>?</p>
<p>Partially, it makes sense. From a marketing point of view, beginning The Witcher 4 marketing campaign with a surprise content-drop for The Witcher 3 would certainly cause a stir. And storywise, an expansion could help bridge the gap between leaving Geralt as the main character and Ciri taking over. A paid expansion would obviously bridge a financial gap between now and The Witcher 4 being released, too - The Witcher 4 being the next big thing on the company's to-do list.</p>

<p>But there are reasons to doubt it too. One big one is Unreal Engine 5. The studio has wholesale moved development from its proprietary Red Engine to Unreal Engine 5 - that's what The Witcher 4 is being built on and what the Witcher 1 remake, which Fool's Theory is also tasked with, is being made with too. That Witcher 1 remake has been slightly backbenched while Fool's Theory helps CDPR make The Witcher 4 - that information was revealed during the recent financial call too. Why, then, give an already very busy developer another project to make and one made using the company's old Red Engine, which The Witcher 3 uses?</p><p>It's worth remembering how much effort CD Projekt Red puts into expansions as well. You need only look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-liberty-is-a-remarkable-expansion-and-a-bittersweet-end-for-cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-review">The Witcher 3's Blood and Wine</a> as examples of this. They are big, usually overly generous things. They provide a smaller game's worth of content. They are important enough, then, to be handled internally, and the best time to make them is while you have a still-warm development after a main game has been released.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-worked-in-the-witcher-3-and-what-didnt-looking-back-on-a-landmark-rpg-with-cd-projekt-red">It's been 10 years since The Witcher 3 came out</a>. The people who made and led that game have moved on, or are elsewhere in the company. Trying to reassemble some of that team and magic, and muscle memory, would be incredibly hard. And why would you pull people from arguably more important projects, such as The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk 2, in order to do it?</p>
<p>What's more, who would the expansion be centered on - Geralt again? Why bring that character back to the fore if you're trying so hard to get people on board with Ciri as the series' new protagonist? Blood and Wine was a perfectly fitting swansong for him, for Geralt, and Ciri's story will be covered by the new game. I don't see where a new story would fit in - or where it would be needed.</p>
<p>I've contacted Nieśpielak and Chrzanowski and CD Projekt Red to see if I can get any more information. But in the meantime, what do you think?</p>

            <p>The price of an obscure PS4 game is skyrocketing on the second-hand market, thanks to its necessity in a new PS5 jailbreak. This game, of which 1,000 or less physical copies were produced, has suddenly become a hot commodity among jailbreak enthusiasts and resellers alike.</p>
<p>The game in question is Star Wars Racer Revenge, specifically the Limited Run Games physical special re-release for the PS4. This collectors item was first sold in 2019 by Limited Run as a collectors item, the companies' business model focusing on taking older titles and repackaging them in special physical versions for enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Why is this game noteworthy? According to one of the developers behind the upcoming version 12.0 PS5 jailbreak, this physical version of Star Wars Racer Revenge is needed. The reason is interesting, as the game has a decade's old bug that allows players to inject code via its Hall of Fame menu. So in order to jailbreak the PS5, you'll need to snatch yourself a copy of the game.</p>

<p>As for how hard this is, you may be shocked to learn that these Limited Run games were part of a… limited run. As such, you can't buy them from the Limited Run Games website anymore, you can only buy them second-hand. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ko7iYqZDcr5Leq6I_1byupsVcyFjFZDYItTK5qhOwxk/edit?usp=sharing">According to official Limited Run Games sales data</a>, only 8,500 copies were produced. Your only bet is to luck out in a store out in the real world, or the treacherous world of online markets.</p><p>Taking a look at Ebay as of writing presents one with a shocking list of absurdly expensive copies of Star Wars Racer Revenge. Prices range from £70 to upwards of £300 as people attempt to profit off the game's newfound value to PS5 jailbreakers.</p>
<p>So if you've got a taste for diving deep into your console's guts and unlocking a world of interesting possibilities via niche means, or happen to have an old copy of Limited Run Games' Star Wars Racer Revenge release lying around, 2026 might be off to an explosive start.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's a big year for gaming anniversaries. There are five massive series that turn 40 years old in 2026 - The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Dragon Quest, Kid Icarus, and Castlevania - whilst Sonic the Hedgehog turns 35, and Persona and Pokémon both turn 30. There's probably a lot of celebratory stuff coming over the next 12 months, but let's start with a franchise we know is getting some attention this year before anything else: Persona.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Japanese developer Atlus unveiled <a href="https://asia.sega.com/p30th/en/">an official website</a> dedicated to the 30th anniversary of the Persona series. Whilst there's not too much over there at the moment, clicking through to the website will show you some fantastic new art from Persona character designer Shigenori Soejima (the most surprising aspect of this being that the team actually acknowledges Persona 1 and 2 - it's been a hot minute!)</p>
<p>The first announcement to tie in with this anniversary promotion is <a href="https://twitter.com/FitBoxingInfo/status/2006561021620584708">the reveal of Fitness Boxing Persona 5</a>. Not exactly Persona 6, is it? But if you're a fan of the series - which has previously done collabs with Japanese series like Fist of the North Star and Hatsune Miku - you'll probably enjoy a fitness gauntlet run by Joker or Ryuji or something… (let's just hope Kamoshida isn't taking on any new students). The Fitness Boxing series is developed by Japanese devs, Imagineer, and has been exclusive to the Nintendo Switch for the last few entries. You can probably expect the same, here.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>The biggest news on the site, though, for those that want something a little bit more Persona-related and a little bit less 'new year, new me', is that we're getting some sort of announcement on January 8th, or next Thursday if you're reading this article on the day of publication. Whilst I wouldn't get my hopes up too much for this (it could just be merch, or discounts, or news about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/individual-diablo-hades-and-persona-orchestral-musical-concerts-are-coming-to-london-and-if-last-years-baldurs-gate-3-concert-was-anything-to-go-by-you-wont-want-to-miss-them">the series' upcoming concert dates</a>), there's a chance we could hear something about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-4-revival-will-be-enjoyable-in-a-new-and-different-way-says-series-boss">Persona 4 Revival </a>or even the next full title in the franchise, assumedly titled Persona 6.</p><p>I expect we'll also get a console port of gacha title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-x-players-are-obsessed-with-the-subway-slammer-but-whats-his-deal-anyway">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a> at some point, too, and we may hear about that as part of the 30th anniversary celebrations. So keep your eyes peeled next week for the next entry in this announcement saga, and let's just hope the next reveal is something big.</p>
<p>Now, excuse me as I start singing "You'll never see it coming" to myself in an eternal loop.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/02/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-50-to-46/</link>
            <guid>1395769</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>That’s that then. 2025 is officially consigned to the history books – no doubt a year that will be extensively studied – and we are now in 2026, which means we look forward to the games that we are hoping will delight us in the coming twelve months.</p>
<p>As a team, we’ve discussed all the big games we’re expecting this year and now bring you our top 50. Today we’ll be looking at which games come in at 50 to 46. There’s a bit of horror, a bit of action, a bit of puzzling, and goblins.</p>
<h2>50 –&nbsp;Titan Quest II</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;2026</em></p>


<p>Having leapt into Steam Early Access back in August, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titan-quest-2">Titan Quest II</a> is aiming for a full release in 2026, this take on the top-down action RPG feeding off Greek mythology for its setting, world and enemies. It naturally shares a lot of common ground with Diablo, but those who’ve tired of the more MMO-like aspects of Blizzard’s latest could find a home here, with fewer enemies on screen and a more considered approach to combat which we enjoyed in our first looks at the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Titan Quest II | Early Access Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikmiyR8rutw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>49 –&nbsp;Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</h2>
<p><em>NSW2, NSW –&nbsp;2026</em></p>

<p>For how prolific Level 5 were with the Professor Layton series through the Nintendo DS and 3DS eras, it’s been a surprise to see the puzzle-solving sleuth almost entirely skip the original Nintendo Switch era, barring the port of Katrielle and the Millionaries’ Conspiracy. Nearly a decade later, not to mention three years on from its announcement, Professor Layton is finally making his return.</p>
<p><iframe title="【PV】『レイトン教授と蒸気の新世界』PV（TGS 2025 Ver.）" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lGg-DYmG3fI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Expect Professor Layton and the New World of Steam&nbsp; to be another feel good puzzler, as Professor Layton and Luke face new puzzles amidst the unfamiliar trappings of steam age industry. Just as unfamiliar is the much more lavish 3D animation and graphics, and then there’s the controls, with the Switch 2 version confirmed to have mouse mode support.</p>
<h2>48 –&nbsp;Styx: Blades of Greed</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;19th February 2026</em></p>
<p>The grubby, sneaky little goblin is back in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> this year with a new obsession driving him forward. He seeks the power of the Quartz to give him a bunch of new abilities, and to strike back at the humans and elves that would oppress him and his kind. That makes him sound like an altruist, but he’s always just been out for himself, really.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Styx: Blades of Greed | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pou-Wox_h1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/">our preview of Styx: Blades of Greed</a> from Gamescom, I said, “It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.”</p>
<h2>47 –&nbsp;Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;2026</em></p>
<p>Step into the flesh-ripping world of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hellraiser">Hellraiser</a>, if you dare, with Clive Barker’s latest game adapting this sadistic universe into video game form. Doug Bradley will also be returning to reprise the role of Pinhead for the first time in nearly two decades!</p>
<p>The game will follow the story of Aidan, who is uding the Genesis Configuration (a mysterious puzzle box) to try and rescue his girlfriend Sunny from the Labyrinth. That will mean dealing with Pinhead and battling the cult devoted to the Cenobites in this survival horror action game. Will it be as dark and twisted as fans of the books and films would like?</p>
<h2>46 – Crimson Desert</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;19th March 2026</em></p>
<p>Originally conceived as a prequel to Pearl Abyss’ MMO Black Desert Online, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> has morphed into something else, a single player action adventure game with a huge open world to explore and a plethora of bosses to battle against. You’ll step into the role of Kliff, a member of the Greymanes, who has been ambushed and fails to fight back against the Black Bears. Managing to survive, there’s a sweeping adventure ahead, spanning the continent of Pywel.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Crimson Desert - Release Window Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R59mT0IFKeI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/battling-four-bosses-in-crimson-desert-reveals-a-game-thats-full-of-surprises/">I got to play the game last summer</a>, sampling a few of the boss battles, saying “We only had around an hour to make our way through these boss fights, and didn’t get to see the wider open world, but I’m already impressed by what I saw. There’s a great deal of variation between these four encounters, the combat mechanics have plenty of depths to master, the visuals look great, and that’s all before the promise of the huge open world outside of these moments. Sure, it’s a bit of a hodge podge of ideas, but if you embrace that, then Crimson Desert is absolutely one to keep an eye on as it heads to release later this year.”</p>
<p><em>That’s it for today’s grab bag of games. Come back tomorrow for another batch of five!</em></p>

<p>Better late than never</p>

<p>If you're a fan of pixel art RPGs with a hint of <strong>Pokémon</strong> in its gameplay, then you'll want to keep an eye out for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/navinosuke_-_the_yo-kai_buster_-">Navinosuke – The Yo-kai Buster –</a> on the Switch. Originally developed in the early 2000s but never officially released, it's now been updated with improved UI and gameplay for modern audiences. Developer KOHACHI STUDIO announced the revival back in June 2025, but renewed interest online in recent days has compelled us to highlight it (and the release of a certain Nintendo hardware might have overshadowed it back in June).</p>
<p>Scheduled for release in <strong>early 2026</strong>, Navinosuke sees you explore a fictional version of ancient Japan as you work to solve a series of mysterious disturbances caused by Yo-Kai (supernatural entities). There are more than 150 unique Yo-Kai to discover on your journey, some of which will befriend you, and others you'll need to battle.</p>
<p>Navinosuke boasts a turn-based battle system that utilises support card mechanics to enhance the strategic gameplay. Much like Pokémon, many of the Yo-Kai will join you as allies to assist in battle, so you'll want to collect as many as you can to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>It certainly looks interesting, and we'll be curious to see if it resonates with Pokémon fans who have felt a bit letdown by the series in recent years. The gorgeous pixel art visuals is more than enough to get us onboard, at least.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- A "lost RPG" from the early 2000s, reborn for modern platforms<br>
- A unique Japanese fantasy world featuring a mechanical onmyoji protagonist<br>
- Turn-based auto-battles enhanced with strategic support card mechanics<br>
- Over 150 diverse yo-kai to discover, collect, and build into your party<br>
- Planned multilingual support (Japanese / English)</p>

            <p>Elias Toufexis, the voice actor behind robotic employee of the year and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> main character Adam Jensen, has assured fans that a new entry in the sci-fi series will not be coming in 2026, as the people in charge are "psychopaths".</p>
<p>This sad news and witty remark comes via Toufexis's <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006498544270856318">Twitter</a>, where he celebrated the new year by sharing a cheeky snapshot of his upcoming work in 2026. Cheeky because, while one of the four featured projects is clearly Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter Marathon, the remaining three projects are NDA symbols and cannot be discussed by the voice actor.</p>
<p>This post indicating three mysterious projects feature Toufexis' voice talents led some Deus Ex fans to feel hope once again that a new game in the franchise would be on the way. Aside from the original games Deus Ex and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-invisible-war">Deus Ex: Invisible War</a> in the early 2000's, we got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> in 2011 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-mankind-divided">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a> in 2016. Since then, one of gaming's most beloved sci-fi series has remained dormant.</p>

<figcaption>You can hear Toufexis' fantastic voice work here.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiehfhUgsRc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>With this context in mind, Toufexis came forward to break the bad news to Deus Ex faithfuls, writing: "no Deus Ex because the people in charge are psychopaths." The frustration is understandable, especially given the Mankind Divided ended on a narrative stinger which has gone without payoff ever since.</p><p>So who is in charge these days? Well, Mankind Divided was developed by Eidos Montreal and published by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> back in 2016. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">Square Enix would later sell the IP to Embracer group in 2022</a>, alongside Tomb Raider and Thief, plus the entire studio of Eidos Montreal. Embracer Group would later cancel a Deus Ex game in 2024,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-has-reduced-its-workforce-by-over-1800-people-in-the-past-year"> laying off a sizable chunk of staff while doing so</a>. Embracer still retains control of the franchise and studio as of writing.</p>
<p>Whether we'll ever see another Deus Ex game remains a mystery, though there's perhaps some hope. Crystal Dynamics, another studio sold to Embracer by Square Enix,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards"> has only recently revealed a new Tomb Raider game</a>. If Lara Croft can come back, why can't Adam Jensen? Fingers crossed.</p>

It also launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/survival-kids">Survival Kids</a> as a launch title for the Switch 2, though we suspect that one didn't make much of a splash, sadly.</p>
<p>Now, Konami appears to be preparing a new game for the Switch titled <strong>Enchanted Wonderland</strong>, as an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39525/enchanted-wonderland/">ESRB rating</a> has recently been spotted that also provides a brief description of the title. Naturally, no release information has been provided beyond the supposed target platform, so we'll have to wait for Konami itself to spill the beans.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fPY6QjqbSA8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fPY6QjqbSA8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfPY6QjqbSA8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fPY6QjqbSA8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fPY6QjqbSA8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5b8b1bqrkmts&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>For now, here's a look at the ESRB description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enchanted Wonderland</em> is rated E for Everyone by the ESRB with Mild Fantasy Violence. Also includes Users Interact. This is an adventure game in which players explore a magical world to gather joy and resurrect a theme park. Players interact with characters, learn magic, and engage in different theme park attractions/mini games. Among the several mini-games, one space-themed attraction involves shooting lasers at UFOs; flashing and small explosions my occur when space ships are hit.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Triple-A John Wick and Saw Games Teased by Lionsgate]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/triple-a-john-wick-and-saw-games-teased-by-lionsgate/</link>
            <guid>1395751</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It is somewhat of a mystery how, more than eleven years after the first <strong>John Wick</strong> film, there is still no triple-A action game based on the beloved character interpreted by <strong>Keanu Reeves</strong>. </p>



<p>2014's John Wick spawned not only sequels but a veritable universe for owner <strong>Lionsgate Studios</strong> to exploit, as seen recently with the <strong>Ballerina</strong> spin-off movie featuring <strong>Ana de Armas</strong>, the single-season prequel TV series, and two future spin-offs, in addition to the highly anticipated fifth mainline entry.</p>



<p>However, gamers were only treated to the indie turn-based strategy game John Wick Hex, a mix between X-COM and Superhot <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-wick-hex-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developed by <strong>Mike Bithell</strong></a>. It was a great game in its own right, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/john-wick-hex-action-choreography-masterclass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as outlined in Wccftech's review</a>, but it was certainly far removed from the cinematic spectacle that we've come to associate with the films. Hex <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-wick-hex-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was actually delisted from all stores earlier this year</a>, so it's not even available for purchase any longer.</p>



<p>Back in November 2022, Lionsgate mentioned it was 'exploring' several pitches for a triple-A John Wick game. During the most recent investor call that followed their Q2 2026 report (a complete transcript is available <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LION/earnings/LION-Q2-2026-earnings_call-372593.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Yahoo Finance</a>), <strong>Chairman of the Motion Picture Group Adam Fogelson</strong> provided a small update on this, as well as a game adaptation of the <strong>Saw</strong> horror franchise:</p>



<p><em>Our AAA game opportunities and other gaming opportunities around John Wick and Saw and some others that we'll be announcing soon, we're seeing increased interest and increased opportunity, and we remain on schedule. I think in totality, you are going to see a meaningfully additive financial opportunity coming in the coming years.</em></p>



<p>It is honestly unclear, based on the wording, whether the deals have already been signed between Lionsgate and some triple-A developer or not. Even in the best-case scenario, where they are already underway, triple-A game development typically takes at least four to five years nowadays, so <strong>we'd likely have to wait until 2030 or even longer</strong> to actually play these games. Still, both franchises have a lot of potential to become successful gaming adaptations.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 ROM Keys Leak Raises Jailbreaking Concerns]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-rom-keys-leak-jailbreaking-concerns-claim/</link>
            <guid>1395730</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recent claims have surfaced on social media suggesting that PlayStation 5’s ‘ROM keys’ have been obtained and leaked online. If the claims are accurate, it means that jailbreakers will now have a cakewalk of a time busting into the console’s operating systems. This has been reported as an ‘unpatchable issue’ that brings users one step closer to securing jailbroken PS5 consoles.</p>



<p>Later posts in the social space suggested that a new exploit surfaced tied to Star Wars Racer Revenge. The limited edition disc for the game is reportedly the trigger for the leak, but the technology behind it all is pretty complex.</p>







<h2 id="h-has-ps5-been-jailbroken">Has PS5 Been Jailbroken?</h2>



<p>On January 2, claims started surfacing online suggesting dire implications for Sony. It was said that PS5 ROM keys had been leaked online, presenting a major and irreversible security concern for the brand. As explained in an article penned by The Cybersec Guru:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the final hours of 2025, reports began flooding the internet that the&nbsp;<strong>PlayStation 5 ROM Keys</strong>—the deepest, most protected layer of the console’s security architecture—have been leaked.</p>



<p>This is not a kernel exploit that can be patched with a firmware update. This is the hardware root of trust. And it is out in the wild.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The leak has allegedly uncovered the BootROM code for the PlayStation 5, specifically the disc-based version of the console. As The Cybersec Guru <a href="https://thecybersecguru.com/news/ps5-rom-keys-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a>, ‘If you have the keys to the BootROM, you effectively own the hardware.’</p>



<p>On socials, some of the biggest names in the console modding and jailbreaking scene emerged to corroborate the leak. One user by the name of Gezine gave some technical context to the situation:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>mast1core based on disc game CUSA03474<br>This was the 12.00 dup exploit that was teased.</p><p>Will release code after polishing more.</p><p>Happy new year scene <a href="https://t.co/mskPXHQQ0b">pic.twitter.com/mskPXHQQ0b</a></p></div>— Gezine (@gezine_dev) <a href="https://twitter.com/gezine_dev/status/2006548152913215847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>From what we know, the potential leak of the PS5 ROMs doesn’t mean that jailbroken consoles will start popping up online, as there are other security thresholds for jailbreakers to contend with, but this certainly is a foot in the door.</p>



<p>At the time of publishing, no publicly accessible repository appears to contain the leaked code or data, and neither Sony nor the PlayStation brand channels have addressed the claims.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-failed-secure-traction-fumbled-again/</link>
            <guid>1395721</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splitgate has had a rough couple of years. From the support ending on the more successful first title to the second game launching amid a wave of controversies, the problems for 1047 Games and their portal-toting shooter began very early on. Following a catastrophic downfall, the team ‘relaunched’ Splitgate 2 under a new identity, but that too has proven to be a failure.</p>



<p>What was once dubbed the game that would ‘make FPS great again’ has been reduced to a title on life support. Only a few hundred people are playing on some platforms, nobody is interested in watching the game on streaming sites, and the sentiments are lower than ever.</p>







<h2 id="h-splitgate-arena-reloaded-is-collapsing">Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is Collapsing</h2>



<p>On December 17, 1047 Games released Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, a rebrand of Splitgate 2, which was initially released in June to a disappointing reception and several damning scandals.</p>



<p>In July, Splitgate 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developers-say-its-going-back-to-beta/">pulled back to beta</a> as player counts imploded. The game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-analysis-condemns-tone-deaf-influencer-campaign/">creator-backed marketing</a> campaign was criticized, insanely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-drops-fans-concerned-microtransactions/">expensive microtransactions</a> surfaced, and two rounds of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developer-holds-another-round-of-layoffs/">layoffs were held</a> in just six weeks.</p>



<p>Following a series of tests, 1047 Games revealed that Splitgate 2 would be overhauled with a fresh identity, becoming known as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded. The relaunch of the game pulled in a few thousand players at best on some platforms, but any traction that was secured has already dissipated.</p>



<p>It’s impossible to know how well the game is doing on console platforms, but we can extrapolate based on the data we <strong>do </strong>have.</p>



<p>On Steam, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded hit 2,297 players on December 17 when the rebrand hit. At the time of publishing, only 390 players were exploring Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on Steam.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>While some of the more recent reviews stressed positivity about the changes applied to the game, the underlying concept is one of ‘too little, too late’.</p>



<p>Additionally, the game boasted a viewer count of just 134 users on Twitch at the time of writing. That’s a mighty comedown from the all-time high of 138,110 viewers. Put simply, nobody is interested in watching <strong>or </strong>playing Splitgate: Arena Reloaded.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>How has your 2026 started? We’re only one day in, but hopefully things have kicked off how you wanted them to. There’s plenty of year ahead, but as always, it begins with you smashing another NYT Connections puzzle! Today, I’m here with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions you need to get your day started the right way.</p>



<p>Read on to find out today’s answers.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-2">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 2)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #936:</p>



<ul>
<li>HIVE</li>



<li>ROUTINE</li>



<li>RECORD</li>



<li>NUMBER</li>



<li>LOG</li>



<li>STANDARD</li>



<li>BIT</li>



<li>JOT</li>



<li>QUASH</li>



<li>BAR</li>



<li>NOTE</li>



<li>EEK</li>



<li>METRIC</li>



<li>GAG</li>



<li>ALE</li>



<li>EXAMPLE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of <strong>quick ways to capture information</strong>, whether you’re scribbling something down, keeping track of events, or making a brief reminder for later. Each word here is something you might <strong>produce</strong> when you’re trying to preserve a thought or detail.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – These are all words you’d use to describe a <strong>comic performer’s signature move</strong>, the little recurring bits that make their act recognizable. Whether it’s a short joke, a recurring segment, or a whole comedic persona, each term fits into the world of <strong>stage routines and comedic gimmicks</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>This set is all about <strong>measuring against a reference point</strong>. These words describe the things we use to judge quality, performance, or expectations — the <strong>yardsticks</strong> that define what’s typical, acceptable, or exemplary</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each of these looks strange at first glance, but imagine a <strong>common vegetable with its first letter chopped off</strong>. Once you mentally restore that missing initial, the original produce item becomes obvious.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 2:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-january-2-936">NYT Connections Answers for Today, January 2 (#936)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– JOT, LOG, NOTE, RECORD</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BIT, GAG, NUMBER, ROUTINE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BAR, EXAMPLE, METRIC, STANDARD</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – ALE, EEK, HIVE, QUASH</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

    <p><span>Moon Maiden Columbina and new companion Zibai welcome the dawn of Teyvat's New Year.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The Version <a title="Platforms > Luna [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">Luna</a> IV update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [131 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Song of the Welkin Moon: Postlude – A Traveler on a Winter’s Night,” will launch on January 14, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [218 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1017665"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update introduces the Moon Maiden, Columbina, and Zibai, an Adeptus from Liyue, as new playable characters. The Lantern Rite also returns, bringing a variety of festive rewards to welcome the New Year in Teyvat. Meanwhile, the journey in Nod-Krai moves toward a decisive confrontation with Il Dottore. For the first time, the region expands northward to reveal Piramida, the headquarters of the Lightkeepers, where the battle against the Wild Hunt continues.</p><p>As tensions in Nod-Krai approach a critical threshold, the latest Archon Quest reaches its dramatic climax. After seizing the power of the Moon Marrows, Il Dottore presses forward with his research, setting the stage for an inevitable showdown against the Traveler and their allies. Empowered by this unprecedented force, he draws the battle into his twisted domain where the rules of reality are upended and chaos is meticulously orchestrated. Upon completing this Archon Quest, the Traveler will unlock a brand-new outfit, offering deeper insight into their personal journey and evolving understanding of elemental power.</p><p>Columbina Hyposelenia, widely known as the Moon Maiden, now joins the battlefield as a 5-star Hydro Catalyst wielder, offering potent support centered around Lunar Reactions. Through her unique skill set, Columbina can trigger coordinated Lunar Reaction DMG even while off-field, while her special ability, Lunar Domain, enhances all Lunar Reactions with a general DMG Bonus and a range of powerful effects. The Lunar Domain can summon additional thundercloud strikes for Lunar-Charged reactions, generate extra resources for Lunar-Bloom reactions, and increase the number of Moondrift attacks for the new Lunar-Crystallize reactions. In addition, she can convert Electro-Charged, Bloom, and Hydro Crystallize reactions into Lunar Reactions and, during the adventure in Nod-Krai, even revive a fallen teammate, allowing allies to fight side by side under the moon’s blessing.</p><p>Version Luna IV also introduces Lunar-Crystallize, a brand-new elemental reaction triggered when Geo meets Hydro under specific conditions. This reaction summons three Moondrifts near enemies, and after being triggered three times, it activates Moondrift Harmony, dealing Geo DMG to nearby foes with a chance to land CRIT Hits.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_1017666"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>While Columbina offers powerful support for the Lunar-Crystallize reaction, the new 5-star Geo Sword wielder Zibai, known as the White Horse Adeptus in Liyue’s books and folktales, brings its potential to even greater heights. By entering a special state and building up unique energy, Zibai can unleash a powerful Elemental Skill that deals Lunar-Crystallize DMG. As more Lunar-Crystallize reactions are triggered, both the frequency and damage of this skill increase, allowing Zibai to dominate the battlefield with relentless assaults.</p><p>In Version Luna IV’s Event Wishes, the first phase will feature Columbina alongside a rerun of Ineffa, and the second phase will introduce Zibai and Illuga, a new four-star Geo Lightkeeper who fights with a polearm and battles alongside a messenger bird, together with a rerun of Neuvillette. Additionally, Neuvillette’s new outfit will be available in the shop for a limited time at a discounted price.</p><p>Nod-Krai expands northward for the first time, unveiling Piramida, the headquarters of the Lightkeepers, overlooking the western Pillar of Embla and the Kipumaki Cliff, where the Wild Hunt still lurks. In a new World Quest, players will join forces with the Lightkeepers and Illuga to continue the fight against the Wild Hunt.</p><p>Back in Liyue, the annual Lantern Rite returns with a vibrant array of events, generous rewards, and stories of the Adepti. This year’s tale unfolds under the celestial signs of Zhanzhu the Moon-Devourer, revealing how the long-reclusive White Horse Adeptus, Zibai, steps once more into the mortal world. During the celebration, players can place special Xiao Lanterns throughout Liyue Harbor, inscribe them with heartfelt wishes to share with others, collect Fortune Coins from Auspicious Treasure Trees to exchange for special gifts, and enjoy a variety of festive mini-games.</p><p>Version Luna IV also brings a generous lineup of free rewards, including 1,600 Primogems delivered via in-game mail, 10 Intertwined Fates from a login event, a brand-new outfit for Yaoyao available through the Lantern Rite event, and the chance to invite one four-star Liyue character for free. Players will also receive a special horse mascot cosmetic set via in-game mail and can obtain additional rewards from events.</p><p>Beyond the generous rewards, Miliastra Wonderland also introduces a brand-new Classic Mode, allowing players to invite select characters from Teyvat to join them on stage adventures. Additionally, players can support the Craftspeople by purchasing the Colorful Surprise Box, which unlocks extra gameplay experiences.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,143 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,526 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,627 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [25,193 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

<blockquote>

<p>Earlier this week, a Nintendo Switch 2 rating for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a> was spotted on the European age rating board PEGI.</p>
<p>Now, in another development, a Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> has been spotted on the same website (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/splatoon-3-rated-for-switch-2-in-europe">thanks for the heads up, Gematsu</a>). The difference here is Splatoon 3 already received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-heres-how-splatoon-3-on-switch-2-improves-visuals-and-performance">a free Switch 2 update in June</a>, enhancing the game's resolution and frame rate.</p>
<p>As you can see below, the Switch 2 version was added on 31st December 2025.

<section><p>We often only see one finalized version of a video game story. What if you could see 100 permutations of it?</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">At the beginning of 2025, I fully believed I had grown tired of stories about multiple timelines. During the past decade, the Marvel Cinematic Universe pushed the classic comic book narrative device into the mainstream, fueling a film conglomerate with legally approved cameos, flashy visuals on the silver screen, and loose plots that, eventually, came together for one final pay-off.</p><p dir="ltr">While the concept of the multiverse has been explored in film and TV even before Marvel's takeover, it quickly became the narrative foundation of choice. When done right, the potential is undeniable--works like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Everything, Everywhere, All at Once are heartwrenching displays of interpersonal relationships, making characters face the reality of what-if scenarios, reconciling with their choices and what could have been if they had turned the other way instead. But you can only hear the same tune so many times before it starts to lose its original impact.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn't until The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy that my interest was reanimated. The visual novel and strategy-RPG hybrid presents itself as deceivingly linear, only to push you into a completely different story structure at the very end. It makes for a sprawling web of outcomes based on your choices, all while showcasing different perspectives on events and characters that weave absurdity and sentimentality in equal measure in a showcase of creative prowess from the development team.</p><p dir="ltr">It all started after an eShop sale in July encouraged me to finally catch up with the Danganronpa and AI: Somnium Files series. It was the perfect motivation to prepare myself for this behemoth of a game, in which the lead developers of both series got together for a joint project that features 100 endings.</p><p dir="ltr">The concept sounded exhausting--as someone who's constantly playing games for work, I figured I'd never be able to justify the time for it, especially since I wanted to at least play the most prominent modern works from the developers first. To my surprise, I ended up adoring the messiness of Danganronpa's cruel killing games. But it was AI: Somnium Files and its sequel, Nirvana Initiative, that led me to begin to understand The Hundred Line's potential.</p><p dir="ltr">Both games kick off from linear storylines that set up a detective-style mystery. Eventually, the plot begins to branch out--depending on key decisions you make, you end up pursuing different timelines, all represented in a flow chart that you can use to jump back and forth between them, especially when routes get locked until you've made progress on a different timeline. There's a true ending that, on paper, symbolizes the intended culmination of events. Yet, the process of witnessing what could have happened if I had made a different decision, experiencing the ramifications on characters and their fates and getting alternative endings, was immediately arresting.</p><p dir="ltr">In a way, playing through The Hundred Line is similar to the experience of getting through both of these franchises as I did. You play as Takumi Sumino, one of 15 high school students who are sent to the mysterious Last Defense Academy to protect humanity from invaders. The story is structured in 100 days, which is exactly the period of time that the students have been commanded to endure. While none of them have as many in-game days, all mainline Danganronpa games share this structure, splitting the visual novel aspect of the story with exploration and trials--in The Hundred Line, the latter takes the shape of strategy RPG battles, as well as free time to increase bonds with characters.</p><p dir="ltr">But getting to the final day doesn't mean reaching the end. While there's little reason to believe that day 100 isn't basically the story's culmination, it only signifies the end of a prologue. Once you get to the tantalizing date, the game radically changes and becomes similar to AI: The Somnium Files (as well as previous games led by lead developer Kotaro Uchikoshi, such as Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward and Zero Time Dilemma). Your task, then, is to explore different timelines and dive into their own what-if scenarios, making decisions that lead to the aforementioned 100 endings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4624305-img_7357.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624305" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4624305-img_7357.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624305"></a><figcaption>As per usual, there's no shortage of meta text.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4624305-img_7357.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-11/-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-nearly-bankrupted-too-kyo-games" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, Danganronpa lead designer Kazutaka Kodaka said that writers were given the freedom to take characters in wild directions, from a comedy route to one where they all turn into zombies. The further you plunge into the flow chart, the more this becomes apparent, with characters adopting different personalities, or the game itself changing drastically in comparison to the calendar schedule of the original 100 days.</p><p dir="ltr">Normally, choice-driven stories fix you to certain paths depending on what you pick, and they have you carrying those choices from that moment on. Games like this year's Dispatch, for example, brought back the Telltale Games formula into the zeitgeist, as former developers of the studio led the project. There are plenty of "this character will remember that" messages on screen, and while some of your decisions do carry some weight toward the end, the main story is structured largely the same. Despite the player's input, the bigger outcomes have already been decided.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Hundred Line, experiencing different outcomes is akin to opening a treasure trove that will seemingly never run out of surprises. It embodies the curiosity of a whiteboard filled with ideas that the developers had, and the rare chance of actually being able to see them manifested. What would have happened if this character hadn't died? What ramifications could a seemingly small decision have in the lives of your fellow students? The answers to these questions are all laid bare for you to pick and experience for yourself. There is a true ending that you can pursue to uncover the overarching mysteries introduced during the prologue. But there's also the precious opportunity of witnessing completely different stories.</p><p dir="ltr">At its core, The Hundred Line makes a singular case of how the interactive nature of video games fits stories about multiple timelines like a glove. It's not often that we're able to witness the developers' creativity on such a big scale, either. Yet, it was that exact display that gave me a reappreciation of this narrative device, and left me ruminating about my own choices in life. 2025 marked the tenth anniversary of my first published article. It was the result of responding to a call for writers from someone in a Facebook group I barely knew who was starting her own blog. Had I done differently, that day would have been as any other. I would have continued studying graphic design, perhaps. I would have met completely different people in the years that followed, while video games would have been nothing but a mere hobby. It was only a short message that, at the time, seemed innocuous. I had no idea how much it'd completely change my life.</p><p dir="ltr">The more end-of-the-year discussions I get to be a part of, the more I realize I'll simply not be able to get to everything I want to see, do, and play in this lifetime. The time commitment of a story with 100 endings is daunting, to put it mildly. But I don't regret spending months preparing for it, as well as the dozens of ongoing hours dissecting its every route. It's a bold showcase of ambition and years of accumulated knowledge paying off, time and time again, in a way that only video games can muster. And it's also a constant showcase of how much our lives can change on a whim without us realizing.</p>

With hundreds of hours played in IllFonic’s ill-fated <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/friday_the_13th_the_game/b/playstation4/archive/2017/06/02/a-killer-formula-suffering-massive-casualties.aspx">Friday the 13th: The Game</a>, which launched in 2017, I have been devoutly awaiting the day this studio tackles <em>Halloween</em>. It is the natural next step, and though I had to wait nearly a decade and play other (great) IllFonic asymmetric multiplayer titles during the wait, the time has come. And with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/halloween">Halloween</a> set to launch this September, it will arrive just in time for me to perfect my abilities as Michael Myers for what will no doubt be a fun Halloween night play session the following month.</p><p>Halloween promises to flip IllFonic’s asymmetrical multiplayer formula, pitting one Michael Myers player against four Civilian players. But unlike Friday the 13th, for example, where your primary goal was to escape, Civilians in Halloween are both attempting to bring in local police to stop Michael Myers and save as many residents as they can. It’s not prey vs predator this time, but rather predator vs some Laurie Strode-like characters who refuse to let this boogeyman plague their home.</p><p>“Halloween is a special one because it is a true slasher horror game,” IllFonic chief creative officer Jared Gerritzen tells me. “We wanted to go back to the basic rules, jump scares, lots of gore, tension of what is around the corner; a real back-to-the-basics of what is seriously scary.”</p><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/haddonfield-heights-multiplayer-map-revealed-for-illfonics-halloween">The team revealed the Haddonfield Heights map last month</a>, which faithfully recreates the iconic neighborhood from <em>Halloween</em>, and while I’m excited to see what the multiplayer survivor action is like on it, I’m just as excited to become the boogeyman there and use his Shape Jump ability. It lets you show up out of nowhere and terrorize player-controlled civilians with great effect. But it’s not a cheat code to kill.</p><p>“[Michael’s] ability to show up in the most insane moments [during films] was not only a great jump scare but a really great way to break up moments,” Gerritzen says. “I noticed he shut the lights off in a scene, and we thought maybe he just wants it dark all the time, and why would that be? Then the idea of how we could play with that as a game mechanic started to form, and Shape Jump, as an ability to move around the map without anyone knowing, was born.</p><p>“We made some gameplay rules around it for balance purposes, of course. [As] long as there is no direct light and no one is looking at the area Michael is in, then the ability can be used. It really adds a great level of play, [and] the ability has brought a horrifying element of being stalked by Michael and never knowing where he will pop up.”</p><p>To use that ability, though, it’s likely the player controlling Michael will need to power up to an extent by racking up their kill count. Gerritzen says the biggest element IllFonic has been focusing on is adding a major focus on the bots in multiplayer. “They really add to the body count and allow a Michael player to power up if they desire,” he tells me. “This also affects the hero players as well, with their fear systems.”</p><p>What’s so exciting about all of this is it’s only one part of Halloween, which also features <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/25/everything-we-learned-about-single-player-and-multiplayer-in-illfonics">a single-player campaign where you play through the events of the original film</a> (and a little beyond it) behind that terrifying, sterile white mask. It represents IllFonic’s first crack at a single-player campaign in one of its multiplayer-centric games, and I can’t wait to see how the Shape shapes up in it later this year.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/01/01/why-im-excited-to-become-the-boogeyman-in-illfonics-halloween]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Happy new year, or almost new year, or just… whatever time it is when you’re reading this. For me, it’s the very tail end of 2025, and what better time to take a look ahead at some of the games coming out in the new year? Here are 2026’s biggest game releases</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get into it, just a heads up that this is by no means a 100% comprehensive guide to all the games coming out in 2026, as many of those haven’t even been announced yet. Also, as always, release dates are subject to change - I made something very much like this exactly a year ago in which I told you that GTA would be the biggest game of 2025… assuming it came out in 2025, which it didn’t. So, this is true in our regular monthly game release updates, but it’s especially true when we’re talking about games that are 11 months away, or games that don’t have release dates yet.</p><p id="january"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="January">January</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On January 15, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> gets a new lease on life, and also a new mortgage to pay off when the beloved debt, yard work, and interior decoration sim comes to Switch 2 - and if you happen to be one of the 50 million people who bought Animal Crossing on the original Switch, you’ll be happy to hear that you can upgrade to the Switch 2 version for just 5 bucks. Meanwhile, if you’re still playing on Switch 1, you’ll still be getting access to a ton of new features with the 3.0 update, which adds a ton of new features including hotel renovation, and in-game items based on other Nintendo properties, as well as LEGO’s line of Animal Crossing sets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can’t spell “Purchase a Game In January” without JRPG, or a lot of other letters, but this is the time of year when fans of that particular genre are bound to be especially busy. Still on the 15th, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond The Horizon</a>, which is the seventeenth installment in The Legend of Heroes series, or the thirteenth installment in the Trails series, and a direct sequel to 2022’s Legend of Heroes Trails Through Daybreak II. That’s coming to all the Switches, PlayStations, and PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/highguard-1765988376157.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Highguard is the new PvP game from ex-Titanfall and Apex Legends devs, landing January 26.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 22nd, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a> comes to Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series as well as Xbox on PC - this includes the base game, all the visual and technical improvements that it got when it was ported to PS5, a whole side story that follows Yuffie, and this latest release will add a new streamlined mode that maxes out your party’s stats and has all attacks do 9,999 damage so you can just blow through the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not quite a JRPG, but JRPG-adjacent, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors Origins</a> also hits Switch 2 that day, alongside the Visions of Four Heroes DLC expansion, which also comes to the other platforms the game’s already on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 26th, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> drops, which is the new PVP raid game from a bunch of ex-Respawn devs who worked on Titanfall and Apex Legends - and while you can see some similar DNA, it’s clearly going a very different direction, and instead of bunch of a bunch of wallrunning dudes and Neil Blomkamp mechs, it’s got more fantasy flair - so if you’ve ever wanted to bear arms while riding a bear, go nuts. That’s free to play on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, rounding out January’s JRPGs, on the 28th there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-seven-deadly-sins-origin">The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin,</a> an open-world RPG based on the hit anime series for PS5, PC, and mobile. And then on the 30th, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/code-vein-ii">Code Vein 2</a>, the sequel to Bandai Namco’s 2019 vampire anime soulslike, which is on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At some point in January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a> will hit PS5 and Xbox series, which is Riot Games’ 2v2 fighting game featuring a roster of characters from League of Legends - that’s been in early access on PC since October.</p><p id="february"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="February">February</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 5, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a> hits PS5, Xbox Series, both Switches, and PC. Originally released stateside for PS1 in 2001, and then 3DS 15 years after that, it’s now getting a full modern overhaul. JRPGs aren’t exactly known for being concise, but this one is pretty infamously beefy, and don’t be surprised if you sink 100 hours into this just doing the main quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d rather just make a bunch of colorful characters hit each other, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/my-hero-academia-alls-justice">My Hero Academia: All’s Justice</a> is a 3v3 arena fighter featuring several dozen characters from the beloved anime series. That’s on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC February 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also on the 6th is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, the third installment in Team Ninja’s tough-as-balls soulslike series that is actually its first true sequel, as Nioh 2 took place before the events of the first game - which probably has no bearing whatsoever on the moment to moment combat that’s the main selling point here. That’s on PS5 and PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/nioh-3-1765988443560.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nioh 3 promises even more tough-as-balls soulslike action on February 6. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 11, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo is a Deadman</a> is the latest whackadoo action game from Suda51 and the fine folks at Grasshopper Manufacture, who gave us such cult classics as Killer7 and No More Heroes - this latest one looks to be as stylish, absurd, and over-the-top as we’ve come to expect. That’s on PS5, Xbox series and PC. I’ve had the pleasure of interviewing a lot of really interesting people in this job, and Suda is one of my favorites - we did one with him years ago where we asked a bunch of really stupid questions rapid-fire and he didn’t skip a beat. So anyway, I’m happy to see he’s keeping busy making weird cool games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 12th, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> hits everything but Xbox One. Yakuza 3 was originally released for the PS3 back in 2009, and though it was included with the remastered collection in 2019, that version didn't get any major graphical or gameplay improvements. Kiwami 3, on the other hand, is a full modern overhaul, so this’ll play as great as it looks - and the Dark Ties expansion is a whole new side story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still that day on Switch 2 is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, which may sound like a fun casual sports game, but it’s also a very serious medical condition that can be deadly if not treated immediately. If you develop symptoms of Mario Tennis Fever while playing this game, please consult a Dr. Mario.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 13th we’re getting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</a>, the follow-up to the excellent 2022 first-person metroidvania - and between the first game, its High on Knife DLC, and now this, I gotta give the team at Squanch Games credit for shipping two and a half Metroid Prime-likes in half the time it took Retro to get Metroid Prime 4 out the door. Also, High on Life 2 is the only way you can legally purchase the classic 1991 Wisdom Tree platformer Bible Adventures for current consoles.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/residentthumb-1765504800570.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Everyone's favourite Leon is back for Resident Evil: Requiem, out February 27.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 20, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> is the latest Japanese action RPG rooted in Scandinavian folklore - and it’s actually an enhanced re-release of 2023’s Ys X: Nordics, but with enough added abilities, bosses and levels that it’s apparently very proud of itself. That’s coming to PS5, PC, and Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 24th, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tides-of-tomorrow">Tides of Tomorrow</a> hits PS5, Xbox Series and PC, which is set in a vibrant post-apocalyptic ocean world that’s riddled with microplastics, and where the choices made by other players in their game will affect how the narrative in yours unfolds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 27, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> - or the ninth mainline entry, if you’re keeping count - hits Xbox Series, PS5, PC, and Switch 2. I’m fairly late to the Resident Evil party, but as someone who liked 7, loved 8, and adored the remakes, I’m fairly lukewarm on what I’ve seen of this one so fair - but I’m also willing to give it a shot, since that team has been knocking it out the park with this series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any Switch 2 owners looking to play catchup, Resident Evil 7 and 8 - AKA Biohazard and Village - are also coming to the hybrid handheld that day as well. They got cloud-streamed versions on Switch 1, but this is the first time they’ll be playable locally on Nintendo hardware. </p><p id="march"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="March">March</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 5, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokemon Pokopia</a> comes to Switch 2, which sort of looks like Animal Crossing, except you play as a ditto who is masquerading as a human being, something that will never not be totally unsettling. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitting PC, Xbox Series and PS5 on March 12, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-carpenters-toxic-commando">John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando</a> is a post-apocalyptic co-op FPS that’s been developed by the World War Z team with some input from the legendary horror filmmaker turned grouchy hardcore gamer, and it looks as though it’ll sit well with anyone wishing the Left 4 Dead franchise hadn’t been… abandoned in a seemingly deceased state. That’s on Xbox Series, PS5, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That same day on PC is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/solasta-ii">Solasta 2</a>, the follow-up to the very well-received 2021 tactical CRPG, which should click with anybody who’s had their fill of Baldur’s Gate 3 and needs to kill some time before Divinity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also on March 12, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</a> hits all the newer consoles and PC, and that’s a modern do-over of the 2003 survival horror game that’s sort of like Pokémon Snap but with scary ghosts instead of cute animals.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/staglordthumb-1724252921663.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Massive open-world action game Crimson Desert saddles up for action on March 19.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d prefer a game about making friends scary animals, on the 13th, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> for those same platforms, which puts a more conventional turn-based JRPG spin on Capcom’s hit creature clobberer series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re more into big huge sprawling open-world RPGs with fast-paced realtime combat, on the 19th there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a>, the single player spinoff of Black Desert Online. That’s on Xbox Series, PS5, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d rather just shoot olde tymie cartoon criminal critters, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mouse-pi-for-hire">Mouse: P.I. For Hire</a> looks to like a boomer shooter with Cuphead aesthetics - that’s on everything</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 26, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/screamer">Screamer</a> hits PS5, Xbox Series, and PS5 - I heard about this game a while ago, and was wondering what was taking so long since the gameplay looked like it was in a pretty good state. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/screamer-official-story-trailer-the-game-awards-2025">trailer that dropped during The Game Awards</a> answered the hell out of that question: in addition to being a racing game, this is also a cyberpunk anime, and it sure looks like those cutscenes took a while. So, if you’ve ever wished for a cross between Redline and Initial D with playable races, here you go!</p><p id="april"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="April">April</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On April 16, yet another game with literary inspirations is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cthulhu-the-cosmic-abyss">Cthulu: The Cosmic Abyss</a>, a first person thriller mired in the unthinkable cosmic horrors of the works of H.P. Lovecraft, so that should be a nice cheerful jaunt. That’s on Xbox Series, PS5, and PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/sarosthumb-1765509236647.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Saros, the successor to Returnal, arrives on April 30.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On April 24 arrives <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, which is a totally new sci-fi property from Capcom that pairs third-person shooting with some realtime hacking minigames, which seems cool. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a similar note, on April 30, the folks who gave us Returnal are back with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saros">Saros</a>, a roguelite third-person bullet hell, which stars the wonderful Rahul Kohli and takes place in a sci-fi setting that’s cribbing from Robert W. Chambers' proto-lovecraftian classic, The King in Yellow.</p><p id="may"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="May">May</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On May 8th, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/mortal-kombat-ii">Mortal Kombat 2</a> hits theaters, the first of two very fun-looking fighting game movies. Something I very much appreciated about the first game is they didn’t make use of the whole roster, and saved some big names for round two - namely, Johnny Cage, who looks to be very much the central focus of the sequel, and he’s being played by the ever-delightful Karl Urban. Very excited to watch him do a split and punch someone in the groin.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/screenshot-2025-12-11-at-8-18-32-pm-1765508198447.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Our Arkham dreams (sort of) come true with LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight on May 29.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On May 27, we’ll get high speed chases and every other kind of action in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, a game I’m trying not to get too excited about, but which i can’t not - after all, it’s from the team behind Hitman: World of Assassinaiton, which is already basically the best James Bond game to date, except this one’s actually about Ian Fleming’s legendary spy. Anyway that’s coming to all the newer consoles and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> is the closest thing to an Arkham game we’ll be getting anytime soon, and while it might not have quite the massive roster of playable characters as TT Games’ previous LEGO titles, it looks to be making up for it with much tighter combat. That’s on all the newer boxes and also PC on May 29.</p><p id="september"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="September">September</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Illfonic, the studio that gave us asymmetrical multiplayer horror games based on Friday the 13th, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and Predator are giving the granddaddy of all slashers the same treatment with John Carpenter’s original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halloween-2026">Halloween</a>, which’ll also have a single player mode this time around. That’s coming to Xbox Series, PS5 and PC on September 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On September 12, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero">Phantom Blade Zero</a> hits PC and PS5, which looks like a soulslike or a hack and slash action game, and while it is an action RPG with lots of hacking and slashing, it’s apparently doing its own thing that’s somewhere in the middle - whatever the hell it is, buzz on this one is killer.</p><p id="october"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="October">October</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not a game, but obviously worth including is the newest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/street-fighter-2026">Street Fighter</a> movie, which looks like an absolute blast and I’ve been hyping this movie up since the first casting announcements trickled out - it’s directed by Kitao Sakurai, who is best known for his work with Eric Andre on the Eric Andre Show and the film Bad Trip, which has involved a lot of people getting injured in entertaining ways in public places as well as a few cars getting destroyed, so I think this movie is going to kick ass. That hits theaters October 16 and I will be there opening night.</p><p id="november"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="November">November</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/02/gta6-thumb-1746223309078.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 6 finally, finally arrives on November 19.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course, the biggest game of 2026, the 2020s as a whole, and possibly all time, assuming it ever comes out, is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which is hitting Xbox Series and PS5 on November 19 - a date which basically every other game in development is steering clear of. At this point we’ve been waiting so long for this game that it’s just stopped seeming like something I’ll ever get to play - but someday, I’ll get to actually play it, I think, and I hope it’s this year!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, that takes us to the very end of games that currently have release dates - but there a whole lot more that just have vague 2026 releases planned, so here’s what we’ve got right now:</p><p id="sometime-in-2026"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sometime in 2026">Sometime in 2026</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</a> is expected sometime in the first quarter of 2026, which lets you strategically square off with Cylons on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At some point in 2026, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> is supposedly coming to PS5, and while Bethesda's dropped a handful of updates post-launch, I feel like players weren’t quite over the moon for this one - but who knows, maybe it’ll get some more tweaks and content alongside its eventual PlayStation version.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-meat-boy-3d">Super Meat Boy 3D</a> adds a whole extra dimension to Team Meat’s beloved indie platformer, and that’s coming to PS5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/zero-parades-for-dead-spies">Zero Parades: For Dead Spies</a> is the latest offbeat and extremely cerebral CRPG from the developers of Disco Elysium. This is clearly a spiritual successor, but rather than take cues from detective fiction, Zero Parades is all about the world of espionage - specifically, the nerve-racking deception-based kind, not the sexy hollywood kind. That’s coming to PC and PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want a game that takes place inside books, but involves a lot less reading, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chronoscript-the-endless-end">Chronoscript: The Endless End</a> is an exploration based action-adventure sidescroller - or maybe more accurately, page turner. That’s on PS5 and PC as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/thick-as-thieves">Thick as Thieves</a> is a PvPvE stealth game from Warren Spector, who was behind the original Deus Ex, and that’s sneaking onto PS5, Xbox Series, and PC at some point in 2026</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re sad we haven’t gotten a brand new Metal Gear Solid game in over a decade, you might want to keep an eye on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mudang-two-hearts">Mudang: Two Hearts</a>, which looks like like a similar blend of stealth, action, tactical military stuff, and over the top sci-fi nonsense, and that’s coming to PS5, Xbox Series, and PC as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like sequels, don’t worry, they’re still making lots of those: if you want to go on a power trip, you can be a tyrannical dictator in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tropico-7">Tropico 7</a>. If you’d rather feel utterly powerless, you can get punched so hard your soul flies out of your body in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-shell-ii">Mortal Shell 2</a>. Those are both on the big consoles and PC. On Switch 2 and PC, you can go dungeon-crawling through even more bullet hells in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/enter-the-gungeon-2">Enter the Gungeon 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/onimusha-way-of-the-sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> marks the long-awated return of Capcom’s PS2-era supernatural samurai series, and that’s coming to Xbox Series, PS5, and PC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to travel through time and fight some ex boyfriends, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/scott-pilgrim-ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a>, the long-awaited follow-up to hit beat-em-up based on Bryan Lee O’Malley’s beloved Canadian manga, which is on basically everything. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-trailer-ps5-games-0001-1758750687975.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Wolverine should pop his claws before the end of the year. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Canadians, Marvel’s fan favorite canucklehead finally slices and dices his way onto PS5 sometime in the fall - Insomniac’s long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a> game is clearly not shying away from an M-rating, but hopefully it’s got as much brains and heart as it does blood and guts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two other Marvel games are also in the works expected in 2026 at some point: Skydance’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, which features Cap and Black Panther’s grandpa, who is also Black Panther, fighting in World War 2 on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC. And then there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</a> on PS5 and PC, a fighting game from Arc System Works that looks like it could be a proper spiritual successor to Marvel Vs Capcom - just, without the Capcom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve">Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve</a> is the latest entry in the long running jet pilot sim to try to tempt me into playing it with sequences of stuff happening outside of a jet that are so impressively realistic it makes me forget that I don’t actually enjoy the part where you fly the jet. Don’t get me wrong, I think jets are the coolest thing ever invented and this game looks gorgeous, but aerial dogfighting in video games just never clicks for me. Can I just play the parts where you eat hamburgers and drink beer with your friends on an aircraft carrier? Anyway, that’s on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remedy’s David Lynchian interconnected universe gets a bit bigger with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-resonant">Control: Resonant</a>, which is a continuation of IGN’s 2019 game of the year, but also connects with Alan Wake 2 and FBC Firebreak - and even if you’re not keeping track of what’s going on, this looks like it’ll still be a good time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve always wondered why nobody’s made any first-person soulslikes, and the trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/decrepit">Decrepit</a> answered that question very loudly: because they’d be too fucking scary. Get this shit outta here. Too scary! Just awful! No thank you! That’s on PC for now, so if you play on console, you’re safe from its horrors for the time being. Did you see that spider? Fuck off!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Less scary looking, but from a studio with some major horror chops is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ontos">Ontos</a>, which is from the folks behind Amnesia and SOMA and takes place in a hotel where a lot of weird stuff is happening, which is to be expected from a hotel that’s <em>on the moon</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want something nice and cute in space, there’s the two-player co-op adventure <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/orbitals">Oribitals</a> on Switch 2 which looks just gorgeous. Lots of games look like anime, but this one specifically looks like a bubble era OVA, which has not just a specific aesthetic, but a certain VHS graininess and poppy sound quality as well, and that’s such a pretentious delineation but as a reformed weeaboo whose formative years were filled with badly dubbed “Japanimation” from Manga Video, I applaud this attention to detail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another co-op adventure coming this year is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/out-of-words">Out of Words</a>, which is all stop-motion featuring handcrafted puppets. I have this theory that Geoff Keighley really loves puppets, and if you make a game with puppets in it, he’s more likely to feature it prominently in one of his shows - Out of Words was one of two puppet-centric games that debuted at Summer Game Fest, the other being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/felt-that-boxing">Felt That: Boxing</a>, and it showed up again at The Game Awards in between Miss Piggy appearances. Anyway that’s coming to the new consoles and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a> is hitting PS5, Xbox Series, and PC at some point in 2026, and I am <em>stoked</em> - like 10 years ago, when it was announced that EA had the Star Wars license, I was like, "Get the people who do Burnout and Need for Speed to do a podracing game." -And well, it took a minute, but we’re getting something even better: a studio founded by a bunch of ex-Criterion devs is making a game like that and EA has nothing to do with it! Also, this isn’t straight podcasting - it’s got a bunch of other speeders and stuff, which reminds me of the criminally underrated 2000 vehicular combat game Star Wars Demolition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you thought that was a stupid joke, well, bad news because <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stupid-never-dies">Stupid Never Dies</a> - which is the name of a video game that’s coming out at some point on PC and PS5. This is a dungeon crawler action game that has some major Lollipop Chainsaw vibes, but it’s actually from a new studio founded by Hiroyuki Kobayashi, who, among other things, worked on Devil May Cry, Resident Evil, and Dragon’s Dogma.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tankrat">Tankrat</a> is a game where you drive a cool tank around and shoot stuff while also exploring and finding new stuff to make your tank even cooler - and it reminds me of modern version of Blaster Master. You guys remember Blaster Master? No? Well it sort of looked like this except really old. Tankrat is coming to PS5 and PC. </p><p id="to-be-announced"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="To Be Announced">To Be Announced</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">A whole lot of games just have a vague “TBA” release window, which means that they’ll probably come out someday. And while 2026 seems like a safe bet for most of these, some might even be further down the road, while others might never come out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ever wished they’d do a Star Wars XCOM... well, they’re doing it! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-zero-company">Zero Company</a>, or ZCOM for short, is from a studio of ex-Firaxis devs, and looks like a turn-based tactical good time. That’s coming to Xbox, PS5, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cinder-city">Cinder City</a> is an open-world MMO tactical shooter that looks like it has literally everything in it, and that’s coming to PC at some point - though looking at this game in action, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a 2027 game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</a> is the sequel to the 2023 soulslike, which was itself the reboot of a game already titled Lords of the Fallen, so this is technically the third Lords of the Fallen game, but who’s keeping track? That’s on the newer non-Nintendo consoles and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All we’ve seen of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/road-kings">Road Kings</a> is a cinematic trailer where a dude drives his 18 wheeler straight toward a tornado, but that seems like it was enough to get people hyped. And it’s from Saber, the studio that gave us Mudrunner and Snowrunner and the recent Road Craft, and as a very casual truck game enjoyer, I’m curious to see what their spin on a long-haul trucking sim is like. That’s on PC, Xbox Series, and PS5.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/dow-1759142668541.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Loads of Space Marines are going to be vaporised by Necrons in Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War 4.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4</a> is the first installment in the fan-fave RTS series in almost a decade, and while it’s not from Relic, the studio that made the first three games, it is from the team behind another well-received RTS, Iron Harvest. That’s coming to PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomodachi Life might not have quite the same name-brand recognition as Animal Crossing, but the original mii-centric social game released in 2014 was the 11th best-selling 3DS game of all time, so it’s a surprise it’s taken Nintendo this long to make another one. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> will be on Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Somebody put <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> on our list of upcoming game releases, and while that’ll probably come out someday, I would be shocked if it dropped in 2026. However, if you’re after a big pretty fantasy RPG from Xbox Game Studios, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable">Fable</a> seems a lot more likely for a fall release. This one is from Playground Games, the studio that gave us Forza Horizon, so I’m stoked to see how they tackle wizard stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Forza Horizon, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-6">the sixth entry</a> is expected sometime in 2026, and though there have been rumblings it might launch in the first half of the year, nothing official on that front aside from the fact that it’s set in Japan this time around. Fable and Forza Horizon are both hitting Xbox Series and PC, with PS5 versions probably arriving later on, if recent Xbox release strategy is anything to go on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War turns 20 in 2026, and to mark the occasion we’re hopefully getting a brand new installment with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">E-Day</a>. This is a prequel set 14 years before the first game and will follow Marcus Fenix during the events of Emergence Day, when the big scary guys you’ve been shooting at and chainsawing into pieces in all the other installments first started coming out of holes in the ground. That’ll be on Xbox and PC for sure, and again, maybe PS5 at some point too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another major franchise celebrating a big anniversary is Tomb Raider, which turns 30 - To celebrate, we’re getting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis">Legacy of Atlantis</a>, a full ground-up Unreal Engine 5 remake of the original Tomb Raider. It certainly looks pretty, but I’m curious how much it plays like the originals. That’ll be on Xbox Series, PS5, and PC. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/tombatlantisthumb-1765507427086.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lara's finally back in action in 2026 with Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ever wished for a distant prequel to the Plague Tale games that swapped the medieval European setting for an ancient Greek one, well… you’re in luck! Because that’s exactly what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resonance-a-plague-tale-legacy">Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</a> is - and that’s coming to Xbox Series, PS5, and PC</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliott: The Millennium Tales</a> is the latest game from the folks behind Bravely Default and Octopath Traveller, and hopefully you won’t have to wait a thousand years to play - that one’s coming to all the newer consoles and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Usually it’s bad when a game freezes, but sometimes that’s a feature, not a bug - like the bleak frigid survival game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blackfrost-the-long-dark-2">Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2</a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/frostrail">Frostrail</a>, a survival game that’s also bleak and frigid, but at least you have a train - those are both coming to PC - and there’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ikuma-the-frozen-compass">Ikuma: The Frozen Compass</a>, a coming of age story set in the arctic, which seems frigid, but less bleak - which is on PC, as well as Xbox Series and PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d like to try your hand at surviving while submerged in melted ice, ie: water, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> is hitting early access on PC and Xbox any day now. And by “now” I mean at some point in the coming year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d rather go on adventures above the waves, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sea-of-remnants">Sea of Remnants</a> is a bright and colorful ocean-world RPG, which is slated to hit PC and PS5 at some point. If you prefer rails to sails, there’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/denshattack">Denshattack</a>, which looks like Jet Grind Radio, except you play as a train. Sure why not! That’s on PC as well as Xbox Series and PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At some point <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> is coming out, which is FromSoftware’s Switch 2 exclusive foray into the world of PvE multiplayer, and I know I’m not the only one who’s disappointed that something that looks so much like Bloodborne isn’t an action RPG. Still, as arcane as this game looks, my intelligence is high enough that I’ll pump a few points into having faith that Hidetaka Miyazaki and company know what they’re doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ever wished Hotline Miami was about actual animal men and not just men in animal masks, well, get a load of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kusan-city-of-wolves">Kusan: City of Wolves</a> - it’s exactly what I just described. That’s coming to PC as well as Switch, Xbox Series and both PlayStations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake has been in development for several dumptrucks worth of hourglass-grade silica powder, but at some point this year, that’s supposedly coming out - and hopefully it’s worth the wait.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Ubisoft remake we’ve been hearing about for almost as long is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag</a>, which isn’t even officially announced, but will presumably come to modern consoles and PC if and when it ever gets released.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/valor-mortis">Valor Mortis</a> is another first-person action soulslike from the studio behind Ghostrunner, which seems like a novel enough idea and hopefully has less spiders than Decrepit - and it’s coming to Xbox Series, PS5, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally slated for a fall 2025 release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/directive-8020-a-dark-pictures-games">Directive 8020: A Dark Pictures Game</a> is the latest cinematic choose-your-own-adventure game from the folks at Supermassive, which is coming to Xbox Series, PS5, and PC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> has been going strong on PC for a while now, and at some point in the foreseeable future, it’ll be getting Xbox Series and PS5 versions as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And last but not least, 2026 marks the 30th anniversary of the launch of the Pokémon series. In addition to Pokopia, we’re also getting the strategy game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-champions">Pokemon Champions</a> - I have a hunch those aren’t the only two Pokémon games that’ll be dropping this year, but they’re the only two we officially know about right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, there you go! That’s a look ahead at the biggest games coming in 2026 that we know about right now. Some of these might not actually come out in the next 12 months, but a whole lot more that I didn’t mention here that definitely will. If you want regular and slightly more accurate breakdowns of what games are coming on a more timely basis, keep an eye out for our monthly big game release videos - in fact, we should have one about January’s games, including a few that didn’t make it into this video.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have no doubt in my mind that there’s some big huge obvious game coming out in 2026 that we forgot to mention, so please, whatever we forgot, share it in the comments. But also, and I always say this and very few people pay attention - tell us what the games we left out are about! Why should people care? Sharing a cool recommendation is one of the best feelings in the world, so if there’s a game you’re stoked on, tell us about it!</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-games-coming-in-2026]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Year In Review: Forget GTA 6, 2026 is All About The Life-Sim Genre]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-forget-gta-6-2026-is-all-about-the-life-sim-genre/</link>
            <guid>1395505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s easy to look at 2026 as a year that will be dominated by the release of Grand Theft Auto 6, assuming there isn’t another delay from Rockstar, but while that stands as the biggest overall release of the year, 2026 itself could be defined by the life-sim genre.</p>



<p>Games like The Sims and Stardew Valley have achieved vast success over the years, with the genre now being extremely popular and attracting huge franchises into the scene, as seen with Disney Dreamlight Valley, but 2026 is going to be bigger than ever before.</p>



<p>Several big players are entering the scene with fresh games in the genre, the indie environment continues to grow, and fans are poised for news from arguably the biggest franchise in the entire genre.</p>



<h2 id="h-big-players-enter-the-scene">Big Players Enter The Scene</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Transforming the game. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The mammoth year for life-sim gamers kicks off on January 15 with the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 edition of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which adds new content for all players, regardless of system, alongside Switch 2 exclusive features like gamechat and multiplayer with up to 12 players.</p>



<p>Gamers will be hoping that this isn’t the only piece of big Animal Crossing news in 2026, with all eyes cast towards Nintendo for details on the next entry in the series following the launch of Switch 2, which could certainly come next year. Even if a release of a new Animal Crossing isn’t on the 2026 calendar, it’s still set to be a huge year on Nintendo.</p>



<p>In March, Pokémon enters the genre with the release of Pokopia, where players take control of a humanoid Ditto, bringing life back to a depleted region. Fans believe this is a post-apocalyptic version of Kanto, where players attract new Pokémon into the environment, learn new skills, and build a complete Pokémon village.</p>



<p>Pokémon’s entry into the genre makes a lot of sense, particularly with the franchise branching out into new experiences, and Pokopia could be one of the biggest hits of the year. However, The Pokémon Company isn’t the one big player set to make moves into the life-sim genre.</p>



<p>HoYoverse, the developers behind hit games including Genshin Impact, Zenless Zone Zero, and Honkai: Star Rail, is expected to launch Petit Planet in 2026, following the start of the closed beta in November 2025. While a precise release date has not been shared, it’s anticipated to land in the next 12 months, and, with the power of HoYoverse behind it, Petit Planet could be a huge hit.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-host-of-options">A Host of Options</h2>



<p>While the likes of Nintendo, Pokémon, and HoYoverse are set to make waves in the life-sim genre in 2026, they’re far from the only developers looking to make a splash, and there’s set to be an embarrassment of riches for those looking for their fix in the genre.</p>



<p>Starsand Island is due to release on multiple platforms on February 1, having raised over $300,000 in a Kickstarter campaign, presenting players with a new world to experience and various career paths to choose from, including an angler, explorer, farmer, or rancher. While the game is a new player on the scene, excitement levels are rising, and the success of games developed in China in recent years shows this isn’t a title to ignore.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Neverway, from Coldblood Inc, is also due to release in 2026, and has strong Stardew Valley aesthitics with the art style and lore, though there’s a fresh approach as the player-character, Fionna, becomes indebted to a dead god, becoming its immortal herald—which makes Tom Nook from Animal Crossing look extremely tame.</p>



<p>Both of those titles merely scratch the surface of what’s to come; however, with other releases to keep an eye on, including Moonlight Peaks, Sunkissed City, and Fields of Mistria, the latter of which has been in early access since 2024 and is poised for a full 1.0 release in 2026.</p>



<p>With so many titles to choose from in 2026, life-sim gamers will be spoilt for choice, so much so that the eventual release of GTA 6 could go unnoticed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Biggest Fortnite Collaborations We’d Love to See in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-fortnite-collaborations-wed-love-to-see-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1395469</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite is the undisputed king of collabs, regularly featuring huge crossovers with major franchises in the world of movies, TV, and gaming, but there’s still plenty of routes of collaborations to go down and skins that would be great additions in 2026.</p>



<p>From the world of movies to the major gaming franchises, Insider Gaming has selected the biggest Fortnite collaborations that would set 2026 alight.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-fortnite-collabs-we-d-love-to-see-in-2026">Biggest Fortnite Collabs We’d Love to See in 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-avengers-doomsday">Avengers: Doomsday</h3>



<figure><figcaption>New era. Image via Marvel</figcaption></figure>



<p>Admittedly, this one is probably a guarantee for the back-end of next year, but Avengers: Doomsday is arguably the biggest movie release in decades, marking a huge shift in direction for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and a Fortnite crossover in 2026 would be perfect.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s approach in Chapter 6 to deliver themed mini-seasons could be perfect for Avengers: Doomsday, which releases in December 2026, as Epic Games could introduce a Battleworld-themed map to star as the closing part of Chapter 7, featuring callbacks to various iconic moments and locations from MCU history.</p>



<p>There has already been a major Marvel collab with Doctor Doom as the main villain, however, so perhaps the best route for the collab would be to look back over MCU history, rather than solely tying into the film, but still having hints of what fans can expect from the huge movie.</p>



<h3 id="h-shrek">Shrek</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Swamp. Image via Dreamworks</figcaption></figure>



<p>Shrek returns to the big screens in 2025 with the release of Shrek 5, and it’s about time everyone’s favorite Ogre appeared in Fortnite, as it stands as one of the biggest animated movie franchises yet to be given an Epic Games’ makeover.</p>



<p>While skins and accessories would be a big hit, tying into the game directly and having a POI for Shrek’s swamp on the map would be excellent, especially if it came alongside the iconic voiceline of Shrek screaming ‘what are you doing in my swamp!?’ at any player who approaches.</p>



<p>The introduction of Sidekicks also opens the door for other characters like Donkey and the Gingerbread Man to feature, though I’d personally love to see Lord Farquad as a Sidekick, just for fun.</p>



<h3 id="h-toy-story">Toy Story</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You’ve got a friend in me. Image via Disney</figcaption></figure>



<p>Disney’s close relationship with Epic Games has brought a ton of major franchises and animated stars into Fortnite already but, so far, Toy Story hasn’t been touched, and 2026 is the perfect time to change that with yet another film in the franchise due to hit the big screens.</p>



<p>Toy Story is another great contender to feature in a larger collab with Fortnite in a full-island takeover, particularly if other Pixar titles are involved, but Disney, understandably, may be reluctant to allow Woody and Buzz Lightyear to run around with rifles, pistols, and other weapons.</p>



<p>Again, this is where Sidekicks could come in, as smaller versions of fan-favorite characters would be immensely popular, especially if they flopped to the floor when you stood still. Andy’s coming!</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon">Pokémon</h3>

<p>We can dream, right? Nintendo is famously extremely protective of its IPs, and previous attempts to bring the likes of Samus from Metroid into Fortnite have failed due to Nintendo’s apparent desire to keep the franchise as platform-exclusive, but it’s Nintendo whoi really misses out from this.</p>



<p>If Nintendo was to relent and ease their restrictions, Pokémon would admittedly be much further down the list of obvious franchises to feature, as it’s highly unlikely we’d see Ash Ketchum running around with a rocket launcher anytime soon, but, again, this is where Sidekicks could come in.</p>



<p>Having popular Pokémon like Pikachu, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander available as Sidekicks would be a huge boost, and, as the characters wouldn’t be directly involved in combat, it would save face for Nintendo.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-boys">The Boys</h3>

<p>Superhero collabs are a dime a dozen in Fortnite, with pretty much all of the biggest faces making appearances over the years, but, so far, The Boys is yet to star. With the final season of the popular series due to air in 2026, there’s no better time for the franchise to make a Fortnite debut.</p>



<p>Skins for the likes of Homelander, Starlight, Billy Butcher, Queen Maeve, and Hughie Campbell would definitely be big sellers in the Item Shop, and having Mythic weapons spawning on the map during a collab would be iconic, though I doubt there’s the potential of being able to pick up a baby and using it’s laser vision.</p>



<p>Regardless, it’s staggering that The Boys is yet to feature in Fortnite, and that needs to change in 2026.</p>

<p>Ok, we’re back to the Nintendo problem again, and there would be a lot of logistics to sort out with a collab, but if Nintendo and Epic Games were to get on the same page, surely Super Mario would be near the top of the list.</p>



<p>There are some obvious issues surrounding the heights of characters like Mario and Luigi, but others, like Bowser, could instantly be made into a skin, and there’s a potential for the collab to include Mario-inspired skins for Fortnite characters, rather than direct copies. Princess Peach Hope anyone?</p>



<p>The potential in-game is also great, with yellow question mark blocks replacing chests, Goomba’s to stomp on to receive loot, and a Mario Kart POI would be iconic.</p>



<h3 id="h-wwe">WWE</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More needed. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>WWE and Fortnite partnered for a small collab in 2025, bringing The Undertaker and Cody Rhodes into the game, but they were sub par. Frankly, how could you have Cody’s ‘WOAH’ Emote without the actual song lyrics? Rather than a brief collab, Fortnite should go all in.</p>



<p>The Fortnite x WWE roster includes the aforementioned duo along with The Rock, John Cena, Bianca Belair, and Becky Lynch, but there’s much, much more that could be done. Imagine the potential, with the likes of Rey Mysterio with various mask styles, Roman Reigns’ imposing figure, and R-Truth being hilarious.</p>



<p>If WWE and Fortnite were to really put their heads together, there are endless opportunities, even going as far as a full-on Fortnite Festival collab with a heap of entrance music made available.</p>



<h3 id="h-minecraft">Minecraft</h3>

<p>It does feel like that if we haven’t had a Minecraft collab in Fortnite yet, we’re never going to get one, particularly as LEGO Fortnite made the games a direct competitor, and the obvious opportunity for a collab with the release of the Minecraft movie in 2025 has passed.</p>



<p>Still, there are endless opportunities, and the chance for both iconic franchises to benefit. Skins for Minecraft characters would be a big win, though I can’t shake the feeling of how good a full-on Minecraft-inspired Battle Royale island would look like, featuring all the beloved biomes.</p>



<p>The likelihood of a Minecraft collab in Fortnite does seem extremely slim, but we’ll hold out hope anyway.</p>
