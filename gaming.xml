            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tekkens-katsuhiro-harada-says-the-developers-actually-love-anna-despite-what-fans-think<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Harada put some respect on Anna's name. </h2></div><section><p>Tekken 8 director Katsuhiro Harada's official X/Twitter account has quickly become the fighting game community town square thanks in part to his extra long behind-the-scenes trivia posts and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-director-katsuhiro-harada-has-more-questions-about-waffle-house">occasional Waffle House asides</a>. Harada's latest bit of Tekken lore dump put to bed a long-running fandom perception that Tekken devs have always hated Anna Williams. </p><p>In an impromptu Q&amp;A X/Twitter post, Harada responded to a fan's question about the relationship dynamic between Nina and Anna. In his <a href="https://x.com/harada_tekken/status/1808400818837901531?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>1,317-word response</u></a> — which was written during his lunch break — Harada also addressed the community rumor about Tekken devs hating Anna by stating the exact opposite. </p><p>"By the way, there is a small group of people who believe that Anna is not loved by the development team and they even say that Anna is hated [by the] dev team," Harada wrote. "Well, it doesn't matter, Because it's NOT true at all, but the Anna portrayed in the story of TEKKEN is filled with a lot of thoughts and feelings from me and the animation staff."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/03/anna-1720032586737.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Anna Williams In Tekken 7.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For those unversed in the melodramatic soap opera that is fighting game story modes, Tekken's long-running narrative can be boiled down as a family drama playing out in a series of high-stakes martial arts tournaments. While the epicenter of the series' familial beef involves the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8s-final-character-reveal-is-reina-perhaps-the-spiritual-successor-to-heihachi"><u>Mishima family's ever-increasing family tree</u></a>, Anna and Nina Williams serve as Tekken's tertiary rivalry. Some FGC players have felt Tekken developers heavily favor Nina as the series' golden child in that rivalry and view Anna as its black sheep. </p><p>Much of the Tekken fandom's perception of Anna being disliked by its developers was instilled by the number of times Nina would trounce Anna in a myriad of cutscenes and win quotes throughout the series. This perception also wasn't helped by the fact that Nina Williams is more often than not guaranteed as a launch character in Tekken game rosters, including Tekken 8. In contrast, Anna was allocated as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/tekken-7-season-pass-2-launch-trailer">DLC character in Tekken 7</a> and has yet to be announced in Tekken 8. </p><p>In the post, Harada revealed that he mainly worked on the development of Anna in Tekken 3 and that he personally created the names of her moves.</p><p>"Originally, Nina was very popular with players since the beginning of Tekken. There is a yin and yang to things, and Anna's popularity was often contrasted with Nina's," Harada said. "Back in Tekken 1 and 2, many mid-boss characters were 'convertible character' to other characters, but we wanted to make Anna from Tekken 3 as unique as possible to gain popularity."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/03/anna-nina-1720032652759.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Anna And Nina Clashing In Tekken 7.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Harada also acknowledged the gap in the sister's popularity throughout the years and took the position that even when Nina outshines Anna like a one-sided episode of Tom and Jerry, the team made sure <a href="https://youtu.be/Lry3FzA8uBw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna's charms shone through for players</a>. </p><p>"For this reason, Anna's settings in the game reflect the feelings of the people in charge of Anna on our development team. For example, Anna's settings include the following: "Anna is tired of losing not only the battle with Nina, but also the popularity ranking in the Iron Fist Tournament. I believe that was the very sentiment of those of us in charge of Anna (myself, the animation team, and the modeling team)," Harada added. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/03/vs-youtube-tekken7-seasonpass2revealfeaturingneganfromamcsthewalkingdeadps4x1pc-143-2-1720033071911.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Anna Blowing Nina Up With A Rocket Launcher.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Harada concluded his huge Anna and Nina Williams lore dump with a list of triva about their relationship that basically doubled down agaisnt the miconception that Anna is completely washed in compasioson to her sister. Here are some of the notable bits of pro-Anna trivia:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Anna is a better cook than Nina</li><li>Anna is better at darts</li><li>Anna is better with heavy weaponry like an anti-tank rocket launcher</li><li>Nina only assassinated Anna's fiance in Tekken 7 (and stole her wedding dress) because her would-be hubby had a "very dark side" that Anna wasn't aware of. Nina is also awaiting a thank you from Nina for the trouble. </li></ul><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-review"><u>our review</u></a> of Tekken 8, we gave the game a 9/10, saying, "Tekken 8 is an incredible evolution for the series, with tons of single player content, an excellent suite of training tools, a great online experience, and exciting new mechanics that make Tekken more dynamic than ever."</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

			<p>Today, DICE has <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1808516412819861814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a limited-time Battlefield 2042 crossover event with another franchise under EA's portfolio: Dead Space. The mode is called Outbreak and will run for a week (Tuesday, July 9-16). Here's the official brief provided in the press release:</p>
<p><em>In Outbreak, the human resilience and resourcefulness of the squad will be tested against a new and relentless enemy as they attempt to escape the Boreas lab.</em></p>
<p><em>Players can unlock free rewards for participating in this unique collaboration, including a new weapon charm and skin, as well as a new player card background and tag. This collaboration also includes a Dead Space bundle that includes a legendary "Marked Man" Specialist Outfit, 3 legendary weapon skins, and more. The bundle can be purchased for 2200 BFC.</em></p>

<p>Battlefield 2042 famously disappointed when it launched in November 2021, becoming the lowest-rated installment in the popular shooter franchise. However, DICE stuck with it for a couple of years, improving it in various ways, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-class-system-breakout-rework-info-blowout-gameplay-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returning to the traditional class system</a> beloved by fans. Still, support for Battlefield 2042 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-support-ending-motive-joining-dev-team-iron-man-still-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is now winding down</a> as work on the next installment in the IP intensifies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios has joined DICE, Ripple Effect, and Criterion, who are all working on the new Battlefield game. The Dead Space remake launched in early 2023 to very positive reviews; it got 8 out of 10 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in ours</a>:</p>
<p><em>The new Dead Space is a mostly-successful revival of a survival horror landmark, offering atmospheric new visuals and a series of precision updates to combat, level layouts, and the game’s scary bits that ought to surprise and excite veteran engineers.</em></p>
<p>However, fans who were hoping to get the remake treatment for the entire trilogy received some bad news in April when Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-space-2-remake-was-never-greenlit-by-ea-franchise-is-now-once-again-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Electronic Arts never internally greenlit the Dead Space 2 remake. As such, the franchise is once again on hold, and part of Motive is working on Battlefield (another team <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-motive-ue5-early-pre-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is making the Iron Man game</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/watch-dogs-movie/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The Watch Dogs movie has officially begun filming, but there’s currently no release date yet.</p>



<p>The announcement came via the Ubisoft X (formerly Twitter) page, where the <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1808540050046484836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publisher said</a>, “Lights_Camera_Action.exe.” alongside posting an image of a clapperboard from the set.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, not much can be gathered from the image itself, as it appears to be the production team rather than any cast members. However, we know that Tom Blyth and Sophie Wilde are set to star in the movie in some capacity. </p>



<p>Ubisoft’s head of content Margaret Boykin, New Regency CEO Yariv Milchan, and company president of motion pictures Natalie Lehmann are producers of the movie.</p>



<p>The move to start production will undoubtedly start discussions on whether or not a new Watch Dogs game is in the works. Unfortunately, despite the series’ success, we’ve not been able to verify if a new game has been greenlit. The first and second games accumulated 20 million units sold combined.</p>



<p>The last game in the series was Watch Dogs: Legion, which was released in 2020 by Ubisoft Toronto. The game received mixed reviews from critics.</p>



<p>Are you excited about a Watch Dogs movie? And would you like to see another Watch Dogs game? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <p>
EA has announced it'll be removing three more older Battlefield games from sale later this month, with their online services shutting down this November.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline (released in 2011, 2013, and 2015 respectively) will all be delisted from digital storefronts on Wednesday, 31st July. From this point onward, it'll no longer be possible to purchase the games or their corresponding DLC.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, online components for all three titles will no longer be available from 7th November this year. EA <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1806689437352341764">notes</a>, however, their single-player modes will remain accessible.

<p>
The publisher also stresses today's announcement applies to the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions only. Battlefield 3 will still be available for play on PC, while Battlefield 4 and Battlefield: Hardline will remain available for play on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. 
</p>
<p>
EA hasn't stated why it's "sunsetting" these particular titles, but an <a href="https://help.ea.com/en-gb/help/faq/list-of-ea-games-that-have-gone-away/">accompanying FAQ</a> says it usually takes these decisions "for legal reasons, or because players are asking for resources elsewhere". It adds, "There comes a time in every game's lifecycle when it makes sense for us to remove it from online stores."

Today's news follows EA's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mirrors-edge-battlefield-1943-bad-company-being-pulled-from-sale-in-april">remove Battlefield 1943 and Battlefield: Bad Company 1 &amp; 2 from sale</a> last year - a move it said it was making so it could "shift [its] focus towards our current and future Battlefield experiences."

In your attempt to rise and become the Elden Lord, you naturally come to blows with Gideon, who typically offers advice back at the Roundtable Hold—a gathering place for other Tarnished—even if he is secretly a rat bitch who wants to keep anyone from taking the throne. In short, he has this beating coming. He doesn’t put up a particularly great fight though.</p><p>Even on a first playthrough, Gideon is kind of a chump. His fight is immediately followed by a much more epic and demanding encounter against Godfrey/Horah Loux, making Gideon a sort of <em>aperitif </em>to whet the palette before the series of <em>really </em>demanding boss fights which round out <em>Elden Ring</em>. Gideon is a lanky, gaunt figure, whose appearance only betrays that he’s a nerd who knows a lot of spells to use against you. However, he’s mostly lacking in constitution and, anecdotally, he’s kind of a joke. I guess that’s why <em>Elden Ring </em>players relish flexing on him with their newfound abilities and weapons after wrapping up <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s exorbitantly more difficult content.</p><p>There’s a few clips making the rounds online, like a particularly brutal one where a player absolutely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/EldenRingMedia/status/1808112220456226906&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/EldenRingMedia/status/1808112220456226906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skewers Gideon with the Greatsword of Damnation</a></span>. They more or less follow the same formula: a player saunters up to Gideon, who launches into his spiel before getting almost instantly obliterated. Some clips are a bit longer than others, but for the most part, veterans returning from the Land of Shadow with new armaments and skills are wiping the floor with him and it is <em>extremely </em>funny.<br></p><p>Folks are having a lot of fun dunking on Gideon with a variety of new weapons. Some are using the elemental perfumes to completely melt the guy in a single hit, while a random TikTok I came across featured a guy using the new hand-to-hand combat to whoop him. Perhaps the funniest of the clips involves a large hammer getting swung around and eventually beamed at the guy’s head, at which point he disintegrates.</p><p>It’s been great seeing players on top after a few weeks of hearing all about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-steam-reviews-difficulty-1851561745&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-steam-reviews-difficulty-1851561745">how tough the DLC is</a></span>.

But <em>The Acolyte</em> doesn’t feel like empty fan-service—except for the horny shit, for once.<br></p><p>The latest episode, titled “Teach / Corrupt,” leans heavily into the raucous and raunchy shipping side of <em>Star Wars</em>, in which the internet daydreams about its ideal space couplings—a culture perfectly encapsulated by the Reylos, who yearn for more Kylo Ren/Rey content. Ever since 2019’s <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> sealed the romance with a kiss just to kill Kylo almost immediately after, the Reylos have felt both vindicated and robbed.<br></p><p><em>The Acolyte</em> dips back into that well and scoops up a generous helping of sweet, sweet, shipping nectar to serve us, as Qimir (Manny Jacinto) and Osha (Amandla Stenberg) argue up close and in hushed tones and take long, lingering looks at each other. There’s even an entire scene in which Qimir disrobes in front of Osha before stepping into a tide pool and inviting her in. When she threatens to kill him, he asks if he can put his clothes back on first, and when he emerges from the water she takes her sweet time averting her eyes.

But what’s most notable is that the series’ marketing push is leaning into the horniness—the official <em>Star Wars </em>X (formerly Twitter) account posted a god damn fancam of Manny Jacinto’s lightsaber training. They know what they’re doing, and they’re not ashamed nor afraid of it.<br></p><p><br>For years I’ve seen <em>Star Wars</em> take big steps forward just to be forced backwards when Disney caves to right-wing reactionaries complaining about every Mary Sue, Black character, or queer person that comes within a parsec of their beloved franchise. I’ve seen de-aged Luke Skywalkers pop up where they shouldn’t, Boba Fett get an entire boring-ass series, and every new piece of media circle back on old <em>Star Wars</em> stories like a tedious ouroboros. <em>The Acolyte</em> is something entirely different—it’s taking a chance with a brand-new setting, unfamiliar characters, and an unapologetic (and unapologetically horny) perspective, and while it isn’t perfect, it’s at least exciting. </p><p>And it’s doing all of this while still giving us one of the best lightsaber fights in live-action <em>Star Wars</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-bear-impressions-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Folks are mixed on Season 3 of FX’s <em>The Bear</em>, which released in full last week. The most common criticism I’ve seen is that it’s too up its own ass, leaning into its hallmarks of characters sabotaging themselves and screaming at each other instead of foundational things like plot. I don’t disagree–it’s a slow season that often falls into using volume as a stand-in for action, and the copious use of <a href="https://screenrant.com/the-bear-show-timeline-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flashbacks</a> makes it feel even slower. But this season, maybe more than any other, shines a light on its characters’ complicated relationship to work.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spoilers for Season 3 of <em>The Bear</em> follow.&nbsp;</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Bear | Season 3 Official Trailer | Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri, Ebon Moss-Bachrach | FX" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHiwdDFPsZY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In this season, The Bear, the restaurant the characters spent all last season building, is finally open for real. It doesn’t go great. Some of the problems are garden variety, namely that restaurants are very expensive to run and The Bear is losing money at a rapid clip. Other problems are problems main character Carmy creates himself. Besides the fallout of his Season 2 finale walk-in freakout that saw him ruin his relationship with girlfriend Claire and cousin Richie, we see him ruining The Bear’s chances at success by constantly changing the menu, berating his staff and business partners, and getting in everyone’s way by refusing to cede control. The big narrative question of Season 3 is an upcoming review in the Chicago Tribune, which will make or break The Bear in both the public eye and in terms of its continued financing. In the season finale, the review comes out, but we <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/28/nx-s1-5020609/the-bear-season-3-ending-finale-restaurant-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t find out what it says</a>.</p><p>Through flashbacks–oh god, so many flashbacks–it’s implied that some of Carmy’s behavior stems from the <a href="https://www.eater.com/22264517/restaurant-kitchens-abusive-working-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">toxic culture</a> he experienced in previous restaurants, especially at the hand of David Fields, an old boss at a New York restaurant. In the Season 3 finale, Carmy confronts David at the closing party for another restaurant. It’s not the catharsis Carmy hopes for: David says that his treatment of Carmy did what it was intended to do, saying, “You were an okay chef when you started with me, and you left an excellent chef, so you’re welcome.”</p><p>David’s comments are horrifying, but Carmy seems to consider them. At the party, Carmy says of David that “I don’t think he sleeps. I don’t think he eats. I don’t think he loves.” It’s said with fury and disgust, but also a certain admiration. In one way, <em>The Bear</em> <a href="https://chicago.eater.com/2023/10/18/23922527/the-bear-fx-hulu-tv-show-restaurant-hospitality-industry-trauma-chaad-chicago-op-ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glamorizes</a> toxic workplace cultures, fetishizing them through its hallmark screaming matches. And it struggles to show healthier cultures with nuance; there’s a bit of a golden glow around the show’s less toxic kitchens, and as much as I sobbed through Season 2’s episode “<a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/columns/the-bear-season-2-richie-episode-forks-1235651951/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forks</a>,” Richie’s lasting transformation just because he spent a week someplace where people were nice to him stretches the bounds of credulity. But in another way, <em>The Bear</em> shows how hard it can be to know what healthy cultures look like, how to recognize your role in perpetuating negative systems, and the slow, non-linear process toward changing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Season 3 also asks if or how the work done in a toxic system can be decoupled from it. Unlike Season 1, which was about saving a struggling restaurant, or Season 2, which was about building a new one, Season 3 feels mainly about the work itself and how the characters relate to it. This is highlighted by how little really happens in the season. There are few external events to move the plot along, just the day-to-day work of The Bear.</p><p>Carmy is fucking all that work up. He’s frantically spinning his wheels, working so hard and causing so much chaos in what must, externally, be a very short time. He’s burning through money by changing the menu, jeopardizing the restaurant’s future because he is so afraid of failure. Some of this behavior is blamed on his past, but he’s not just shown as a victim of his traumas. And while the show makes it obvious he’s behaving badly, it also doesn’t just come out and say that the whole enterprise is worthless because of that. Mysterious review aside, the food seems to be good. The staff’s peers seem to admire what they’re doing. Characters are a bit addicted to the adrenaline and chaos, playing their own roles in perpetuating it and finding some fulfilment there, even if it’s mostly fucked up. Even Sydney, who in Season 3 is offered a chance to get out of Carmy’s dysfunctional kitchen such that I spent the whole season screaming “oh my god, <em>take it</em>” at my screen, struggles to decide whether to break away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Through characters like Sydney or pastry chef Marcus, we see the possibility of healthier relationships with work. Chef Ebraheim struggles to handle the restaurant’s sandwich counter until he accepts help, offering one model of how things could function better. These are solutions on offer, in contrast to the aspirational environments of the healthier, established restaurants in the show. But how does that actually get transformed into a new culture? Can characters break free of their own unhealthy relationship to unhealthiness? Can or should Carmy be part of that? (“Carmy gets fired” is definitely a season of <em>The Bear</em> I would watch.)</p><p>In contrast to “Forks” (which again, to be clear, I <em>love</em>), this messy, spinning-in-place process feels like it reflects how these scenarios often play out in the real world. Though Carmy’s “non-negotiables” list is played as a joke because its items are so absurd, the list’s failure also shows that figuring this stuff out is harder than just writing “work-life balance” on a piece of paper, especially when the better cultures in the show have had years to figure it all out.</p><p>I think Season 3’s big question is “How do you unfuck yourself about work?,” a question there’s no easy answer to. Through the retirement of chef Andrea Terry that ends the season, one option on offer is to quit–to decide this isn’t worth it. Another option is the hard, unglamorous path toward fixing it. <em>The Bear</em> gives us glimpses of what that could look like, but no clear process to getting there.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There’s word that many old-school classics, remastered and reimagined for the new-school audience, will launch on Xbox Game Pass. One such title is Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, which makes excellent sense considering Microsoft bought Activision. But is Spyro Reignited Trilogy coming to Game Pass, too?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-spyro-reignited-trilogy-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Spyro Reignited Trilogy Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-activision-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent leak indicates</a> that a handful of Activision titles will start launching on Xbox Game Pass in August. We know that Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy will supposedly launch on Game Pass in August, but there are rumors about Spyro Reignited Trilogy and Tony Hawk 1+2 Remake, and we’re hoping for a few old-school Call of Duty titles, too. </p>



<p>Currently, however, there’s no concrete information that Spyro Reignited Trilogy is coming to Xbox Game Pass. It may happen and is pretty likely, but it’s not a guarantee. The original leak states Spyro is coming “very soon,” which could mean August or this fall.</p>



<p>Plenty within the Activision catalog deserves a spot on the subscription service!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-other-activision-games-are-on-xbox-game-pass">What Other Activision Games Are On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p>Currently, you can play Diablo 4 on Xbox Game Pass. It’s a clear winner for the subscription service, earning much love, downloads, and significant playtime from the community. Otherwise, we know that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Xbox Game Pass on day one later this year.</p>



<p>There’s likely more to come, as the buyout remains relatively fresh!</p>



<hr>



<p>We’re living in quite a fantastic time in which some of our favorite games from back in the day receive a new chance at life. For example, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/play-beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition on Steam Deck</a>!

<p>Following the purchase of Activision-Blizzard by Microsoft, it surprised absolutely no one when the latter announced many of the former’s titles would come to Game Pass. Diablo 4 was just the beginning, and it’s a fantastic start as one of the most downloaded and played games on the service. But it’s time for more. It’s time for Call of Duty on Game Pass. More specifically, past titles!</p>



<h2 id="h-are-past-call-of-duty-games-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">Are Past Call of Duty Games Coming to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p>As previously revealed, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-coming-game-pass-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Xbox Game Pass on day one</a>, which means subscribers can hop straight into the first-person shooter alongside everyone else who didn’t receive early access. Of course, that’s the most recent Call of Duty. What about past titles?</p>



<p>As of right now, there is zero confirmation as to when or whether Call of Duty will launch on Xbox Game Pass outside of the upcoming Black Ops 6. It’ll likely happen, though. A recent report indicates many of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-activision-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision’s fan-favorite titles will start to hit Xbox Game Pass in August</a>.</p>



<p>At this point, it’s just a matter of time!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-call-of-duty-titles-may-hit-xbox-game-pass">What Call of Duty Titles May Hit Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p>Personally, I don’t see Xbox launching every single Call of Duty game on Xbox Game Pass. Could I be wrong? Absolutely! I’d love to be wrong here and wake up one morning to an announcement about Xbox bringing every single title, even Big Red One, to Xbox Game Pass! For now, we can dream and plan. Here are the Call of Duty games that may wind up on the subscription service eventually:</p>



<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Cold War</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Ghosts</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Vanguard</li>
</ul>



<p>I wouldn’t mind replaying Ghosts, Cold War, or Modern Warfare on Game Pass!</p>

                <p>Final Fantasy Creator Hironobu Sakaguchi said he has no interest in returning to the series after partnering up with Square Enix for the PC and console version of Fantasian, a game previously only available on mobile devices.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-03/-final-fantasy-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-reunites-with-square-enix?srnd=technology-vp" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview with Bloomberg</a>, Sakaguchi said he has switched to a consumer of the Final Fantasy series now, particularly Final Fantasy XIV. He doesn't want to know how games in the series are made now, as he feels that it would impact his enjoyment of playing it. "If I take on the Final Fantasy brand again, I don’t know if I’ll be able to genuinely enjoy Final Fantasy XIV as much," he explained.</p><p>Sakaguchi also said that his studio, Mistwalker, is working on a new game and in the process of finalizing its story. Mistwalker's previous games include cult classics like Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon for PC and Xbox 360. However, Sakaguchi said he also has no interest in bringing them to new platforms.

            <p>Tiny Garden is bringing back the spirit of Polly Pocket with a cutesy farming sim game set inside a virtual plastic clamshell inspired by the nineties toy phenomenon.</p>

<p>Spanish developers Ao Norte’s adorable game imagines a world in which the iconic hinged mini-dioramas are ecosystems of their own able to grow crops, as players sow seeds before turning the handle on the side of the clasped toy to help carrots, lettuces and all other manner of plants and vegetables spring up. (Nice find, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tiny-garden-looks-like-an-adorable-polly-pocket-full-of-sunshine-for-pc-and-switch">Eurogamer</a>.)</p>
<p>The objective is simply comfort and customisation, with no defined scoring or challenges to speak of. Harvesting crops gathers more seeds, with the chance to discover new plants - including rare shiny plants, Pokemon style - and complement your garden with furniture and other decorations acquired by trading your crops.</p>
<p>Certain plants can also terraform the gridded landscape, allowing for more arid solid to plant cacti in, verdant grass and bushes, or water created by fountains to grow water lilies and other aquatic flora.</p>

<p>Ao Norte explicitly describe the game as being as compact as the clamshells that serve as its levels, saying not to expect hundreds of hours of unique gameplay from the “tiny game by a tiny team”. Still, it sounds like there should be plenty for anyone after a relaxing few hours to pass the time with at least.</p>
<p>Tiny Garden has already passed its modest funding goal <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aonorte/tiny-garden-build-your-own-magical-garden-inside-a-90s-toy">over on Kickstarter</a>, with Ao Norte aiming for a release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2812450/Tiny_Garden/">Steam</a> and Itch.io next February for the relaxing farming toybox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-development-of-varsity-high-school-football-part-1/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Football fans are a passionate group. That goes double when it comes to football video game fans. With so few options over the last two decades, players get restless whenever a new game is announced and in development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They want a game that is feature rich while being fun to play on the field. Often, however, they get something that is one or the other. With Varsity High School Football, developers Spear Interactive and Pyramid Lake Games are hoping to change that.</p>



<p>Varsity High School Football is taking a sport that millions love, and bringing it to the most-played level in America: High School. Featuring thousands of schools representing every county in the United States, Varsity is aiming to be one of the deepest football games you’ve ever played.</p>



<p>Recently I was invited up to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, where Spear Interactive is located, to get an exclusive look at the game, play some of what’s built, and talk about its development.</p>



<p>Varsity will be centered around its gameplay and Dynasty mode (more on that coming soon). For the gameplay, the developers are stopping at nothing to make it as realistic of an experience as possible for a studio of its size.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption>An exclusive screenshot for Varsity High School Football</figcaption></figure>



<p>They’re motion capturing every aspect of the gameplay with suits and equipment that cost tens of thousands of dollars. From the quarterbacks to offensive and defensive line interactions, what you see in game will have been motion captured. To help with that realism, they’re using actual football players from the Canadian Junior Football League (CJFL) to get the captures with thousands of different animations coming in.</p>



<h2 id="h-varsity-on-the-field-feels-smooth">Varsity On The Field Feels Smooth</h2>



<p>When speaking to one of the game’s lead developers, it was emphasized that getting “tight motions and smooth player movement” was as important as anything else they’re working on. Even if they have to capture the same thing dozens of times, it’s something they want to make sure they get right.</p>



<p>One concern I had with capturing players that are as old as 22 years old – the max age for the CJFL – is the speed. Obviously, older players are going to be faster and more powerful, on average, than your typical high school athlete. To make sure the play isn’t hindered by that and it’s on par with what you’d expect, they manually adjust custom-developed sliders for things like overall game speed, agility, and more. Think of it like what games offer with sliders for play, and amplify it. It’s all being done behind the scenes within the Unity-built game.</p>



<p>For the sake of transparency, the build I played had just the quarterback and wide receivers on the field. There was no defense, no line, and no real challenge. What it was, however, was a solid showcase of the detail going into every position on the field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seeing, and feeling, the way the quarterback moves in and around the pocket – a position they’ve spent the most work with so far – was impressive. Footwork felt and looked natural, and the throwing motions were as smooth as any independent football game I’ve ever played.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t want to hype it up too much, but it was satisfying to watch how the throws were made. Receiver animations were still being worked on, but, with what was there, the catches looked good when doing crossing and similar routes. Even how the players run, an aspect that many football games struggle to accurately create, looked pretty natural.  And while playing, it was once again reiterated that it was all about getting the tight motions and smooth player movement, something that it feels like Varsity is on its way to achieving.</p>



<p>There’s no release date set for Varsity, and that’s by design. It was made clear during my time with the team that the last thing they wanted was to announce a date too soon and have to push it back should something come up. Instead, they’ll continue to work on the game, have playtests with select supporters from its <a href="https://www.patreon.com/varsityvideogame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Patreon</a>, and share progress with fans each month.</p>



<p>As far as the game’s other major selling point, Dynasty Mode, there’s a lot to unpack. And unpack it we will.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/03/battlefield-3-4-and-hardline-are-being-delisted-from-playstation-3-and-xbox-360<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>EA has announced that it will delist three Battlefield titles from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 digital storefronts at the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On July 31, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/battlefield_3/b/xbox360/archive/2011/10/26/review.aspx">Battlefield 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/battlefield_4/b/pc/archive/2013/10/28/holding-the-line.aspx">Battlefield 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/battlefield_hardline/b/playstation4/archive/2015/03/20/battlefield-hardline-review-game-informer.aspx">Battlefield: Hardline</a>, along with their associated DLCs, will be removed from sale. Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.</p>

<p>It never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.</p>

            <p>It’s been a good while since we last got a proper Transformers video game, with the four years since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xcom-enemy-unknown">XCOM</a>-ish Transformers: Battlegrounds in 2020 only seeing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/transformers-online">long-in-the-works</a> MMO Transformers Online finally biting the dust. That’s about to change, with the reveal of a curious new combination of racer and roguelike starring the robots in disguise.</p>

<p>Transformers: Galactic Trials somehow marks the first time the vehicular bots have featured in a racing game, though as you might expect from a franchise known for switching between forms it’s not quite a pure driving experience, either.</p>
<p>Instead, developers 3DClouds are billing the game as a mixture of traditional racing game and action-RPG  as the vehicular robots speed around tracks before shifting into their bot forms to fight through groups of enemies standing in the way of the finish line. There’ll apparently be roguelike progression in the form of Prime relics to collect to level up certain skills, while also unlocking extra characters - both Autobots and Decepticons - and skins for said characters.</p>

<p>Galactic Trials will launch with two modes: a titular single-player mode working through the 10 included levels and an Arcade offering with two-player local multiplayer in quick races, with the option to customise the available tracks, weapons and characters. “Location-based specialised tournaments” will also be a thing, though I’m honestly not sure how that translates to just two players being able to play in the same room - this might just be a word-salad way of saying that you can create bracket-based tournaments for bigger groups, perhaps.</p>
<p>2024 is apparently the Transformers series’ 40th anniversary, with Galactic Trials arriving on October 11th. After a relative drought of Transformers video games, there’s a chance we’ll see more of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-tactics-studio-splash-damage-are-making-a-transformers-action-game">Splash Damage’s co-op shooter Transformers: Reactivate</a>, too, after its planned closed beta slipped out of last year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-executive-producer-addresses-spiderbot-concerns/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When  XDefiant released its major patch for Season 1, it ended up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/op-xdefiant-ability-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making one of its abilities</a> — spiderbot — even more powerful. It’s led to a lot of discourse online about why it was done and if/when it should be fixed.</p>



<p>The conversation has gotten so loud that even executive producer Mark Rubin has <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1808511436173529112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taken to Twitter</a> to address players.</p>



<p>In his post, Rubin explained that what players were able to do against the spiderbot when XDefiant first launched wasn’t actually supposed to be allowed. It was a bug that ultimately got fixed with Season 1, taking away a defense against them. </p>



<p>“[T]here was also a bug in that meleeing them was way harder than it was supposed to be,” he said. “So we wanted to keep the bug of shooting them off your own face in the game until we fixed other spiderbot issues.”</p>



<p>Rubin added that taking away a “important counter” was unintentional, and that it will be reverted as part of the game’s next “non-emergency patch”. The reversion will return the ability to shoot them off by shooting at your feet. </p>



<p>“The other changes to spiderbot will remain. i.e. longer cooldown, etc.,” he said.</p>



<hr>



<p>You can read his full statement below:</p>



<p><em>“OK now that we’ve gotten through the patch and Ranked is now live, I want to talk about the Spiderbots.</em></p>



<p><em>“So when the game launched there was a bug that you could shoot down at your feet and destroy the spiderbot. This was not intended. However, there was also a bug in that meleeing them was way harder than it was supposed to be. So we wanted to keep the bug of shooting them off your own face in the game until we fixed other spiderbot issues.</em></p>



<p><em>“However, the bug fix got integrated into the Season 1 patch and so an important counter was removed unintentionally. We are reverting that fix in the next non-emergency patch. So you will again be able to shoot them off your own face by shooting at your feet. The other changes to spiderbot will remain. i.e. longer cooldown, etc. </em></p>



<p><em>“For the future, we are going to change the way spiderbot works so that there is a easier and clearer way to get them off you own face. But until then the bug where you can shoot them off your own face will remain. </em></p>



<p><em>“And we will continue to find other ways to balance all of the abilities over time.”</em></p>
