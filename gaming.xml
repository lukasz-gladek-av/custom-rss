Millions of Helldivers died liberating the autumnal planet from Terminid control beginning with  Operation Valiant Enclosure. Players only ever lost one battle there. But this week, it proved to be all for naught when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyCgEeXRZ5I&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyCgEeXRZ5I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Helldivers</em> dungeon master Joel</a></span> decided to make it the first pawn to fall in a much more sinister game.</p><p>But it’s not the first time a planet was destroyed in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Meridian was the first to fall, and not at the hands of outside forces. It was players who destroyed that planet last year by turning it into a black hole as a means toward eradicating a mutated Terminid Super Colony of their own unintentional making. It was the first example of Arrowhead Game Studios fundamentally altering its in-game cosmos in service of its grim military storytelling. And it’s not clear it was part of a grander plan. </p><p>Last weekend, players were given the Major Order to go contest the Illuminate’s control of the black hole, lest the aliens fuel it with dark energy for unknown purposes. “The Illuminate are now actively moving Meridia,” an in-game message informed players on February 8. “The Center of Science on Fenrir III can confirm: Meridia is in motion. The Dark Energy that the illuminate muster through their many invasions appears to be key. The Helldivers is [sic] now called upon to limit the Illuminate accumulation of this Dark Energy.”</p><p>It’s unclear how the black hole can be stopped but things will get very, very bad if it’s not. The anomaly is now on a collision course for Super Earth, with five other planets in the way. Plus, the more dark energy it accrues, the faster it moves. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ii9dlw/dark_energy_accumulation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ii9dlw/dark_energy_accumulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Players had been tracking</a></span> it via in-game tools over the past week. How many more planets will fall before the Illuminate’s plan can be unraveled and halted? Or is Arrowhead planning to celebrate <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s one-year anniversary with a Super Earth showdown players have been waiting for?</p><p>Either way, it’s a testament to the game’s one-of-a-kind evolving online world that it feels like it’s building toward something despite all of the repetition and incremental progress. Players of the original <em>Helldivers</em> have won the Galactic War multiple times at this point, with each victory clearing the board ahead of a new campaign. I’m excited to see what Arrowhead’s long-term plans are with this sequel. It feels like <em>Helldivers 2</em> has room to continuing evolving, both mechanically and narratively, for years to come. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Was it the first look at Saros? Or the new game from the lead designer of Grand Theft Auto?

And what’s more, it’s incredible that he’ll be modeled after one of my favorite actors, Toshiro Mifune.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So let us know how the State of Play news items ranked for you below.</p><div id="playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-announcements-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">PlayStation State of Play February 2025 Announcements Tier List</h3><h3>PlayStation State of Play February 2025 Announcements Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Josef Fares, the director of It Takes Two and the upcoming Split Fiction, said that Hazelight Studios will never make a live-service game.</p><p>"We will not have them, I do not believe in them," Fares said in an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-will-never-convince-us-to-make-a-live-service-game-it-takes-two-developer-says-after-suggestion-biowares-dragon-age-the-veilguard-should-have-been" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "I think [live service] is not the right way to go. I hope more and more [developers] focus on their passion and what they believe in."</p><p>Fares explained that he understands the financial pressures of having to make live-service games, but emphasized the need to not lose all focus on creativity. He believes that there should be a balance between the financial and creative aspects, as developers can't just ask for $100 million in funding and do whatever they want.</p><p><span>He pointed to the success Hazelight has seen as evidence that "trust[ing] in your vision" can still lead to a "big audience." Last year, Hazelight revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-takes-two-crosses-20-million-copies-sold-developer-teases-title-of-next-game/1100-6527240/" data-ref-id="1100-6527240">It Takes Two had surpassed 20 million copies sold</a>.</span></p><p><span>Other studios have recently followed the live-service trend to varying success.

In a recent earnings call, Ubisoft said that it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">double down on both live-service games and open-world action adventure titles</a>.</p><p>Fares also recently discussed his thoughts about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-takes-two-and-split-fiction-director-shares-his-thoughts-on-ai/1100-6529493/" data-ref-id="1100-6529493">AI and its effects on the video game industry</a>, saying that it needs to learn how to work with AI and other emerging technologies.</p><p>Hazelight's previous game, It Takes Two, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2021-winners-revealed-it-takes-two-wins-game-of-the-year/1100-6498845/" data-ref-id="1100-6498845">won Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2021</a>. The studio's next game, Split Fiction, launches on March 6 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Like Hazelight's past projects, Split Fiction is a co-op adventure game and it follows two women named Zoe and Mio as they traverse through both fantasy and sci-fi-themed levels in order to survive.</p>

			<p>The Farm 51 has been working on Chernobylite 2 for over three years, and today, one of the most significant milestones for the team has been achieved. The Kickstarter campaign for this game has reached more than 200% of the initial funding goal. The team exceeded its campaign target with six stretch goals, which has allowed the team to secure additional expansion of the project beyond the original plans that were set in place. This includes extra locations to explore for both single-player and co-op missions, as well as a customizable interface. The Farm 51 has created an infographic that goes into detail about their Kickstarter, as well as the team's dedication to creating this new game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The developers have announced that the Kickstarter campaign will continue to be live thanks to the option of Late Pledges, where those who pledge can still support the team and get some of the rewards that are available.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone Early Access Announcement CGI Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEoeb1g88e0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of the most exciting parts of the team's news is that Early Access is just around the corner for Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone. The Farm 51 has confirmed today that Early Access on Steam will begin on March 6, where approximately one-third of the final game's content will be available for players to explore, as well as provide the team with valuable feedback while they continue their efforts in the development process.</p>
<p>For those just hearing about this game, Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone is a post-apocalyptic action RPG that combines free exploration in a realistic open world with challenging combat, base management, non-linear storytelling, and more.</p>
<p>Character creation is a huge main feature of this game, as you get to develop your hero exactly how you want them. Whether it's skillful combat, being a fantastic conversationalist, or someone who can charm their way out of sticky situations, it's entirely up to you.</p>
<p>You can also choose how you handle the combat in Chernobylite 2. Whether you decide to utilize the complex melee combat system or use a variety of firearms to take out your enemies, the choice is completely up to you.</p>
<p>Base building will also be a huge part of this game, where you can develop your base, create valuable items, and upgrade your weapons. Here, you can assign your people to tasks where they will continue to take care of your equipment and supplies while you are away.</p>
<p>You can play the game your way, whether it's playing solo, or experiencing and engaging in online co-op missions, the choice is yours.</p>
<p>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone will be in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2075100/Chernobylite_2_Exclusion_Zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early Access on PC</a> on March 6, with it soon to follow on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.

When I saw that, my immediate thought was “Oh, so the people who wanted those back finally got what they wanted,” and then I mentally moved on to the next thing. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,196049" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I forgot that if you hadn’t been paying attention to <em>Overwatch 2 </em>for several years, you might be confused as to why Blizzard would make this choice, much less <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1889741290394227102&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1889741290394227102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frame it as something worth celebrating</a></span>. It’s tied up in years of nostalgia toward the “way things used to be” in the original <em>Overwatch</em> and a dislike of <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s methods of monetization. The return of loot boxes doesn’t mean Blizzard is dismantling the expensive money dump entirely, but it is giving players a free option to <em>maybe</em> get the skins they want.</p><h3 id="h1064444"><a id=""></a><strong>Why did people want loot boxes back in <em>Overwatch 2</em>?</strong></h3><p>When <em>Overwatch 2 </em>launched, it completely reorganized how you unlock and purchase cosmetics. Blizzard added an in-game shop that rotates cosmetics in and out weekly that can be purchased with in-game currency and real-world money. Compare this to how you would unlock most things in the original <em>Overwatch</em>; you’d unlock a loot box with each level you gained and would hope and pray the skin you wanted was inside. You couldn’t control what you got from them, but the trade-off was that everything from skins to victory poses was obtainable for free. However, if you’re not so patient, you could also buy loot boxes with real money, which is how they get you. So there was an element of gambling involved.</p><p>By the time the original <em>Overwatch </em>was replaced by the sequel, I had unlocked so many cosmetics that opening the free loot boxes I’d gotten was a waste of time because I was mostly finding duplicates. Sure, I probably spent a few bucks here and there trying to find something specific, but the monetary investment was nothing compared to what it’s cost me to buy new skins in <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s store.</p><p>That’s part of why fans have been asking for a return to loot boxes. They’re pretty much a gambling mechanic that incentivizes players to spend real money in hopes of finding their desired skin, but there was still an option to earn them for free. A dedicated player could get everything they wanted without paying a cent, but in <em>Overwatch 2</em> that Mercy or Kiriko skin you’ve been eyeing is locked behind a paywall, and probably costs a pretty penny.</p><p>It’s easy to see how someone might yearn for the days when <em>Overwatch </em>wasn’t such a huge money investment on top of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-prereview-roundup-free-hero-shooter-grind-1849601813&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-prereview-roundup-free-hero-shooter-grind-1849601813">being such a grind</a></span>, and it’s a pretty damning criticism of <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s expensive store that some people think gambling is the preferable approach. But looking at loot boxes in an <em>Overwatch</em>-shaped vacuum isn’t telling the whole story, which is why people who aren’t in the payload-pushing trenches are bewildered by the excitement.</p><h2 id="h1064445"><a id=""></a><strong>Are <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s loot boxes exploitative or just another means of progression?</strong></h2><p>Loot boxes have always been a controversial form of microtransaction in video games. Most gacha games use them in an inherently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592">exploitative way</a></span> because they require significant monetary or time investment with only a chance of getting the rewards you want. Such mystery packs have also been a centerpiece in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-class-action-lawsuit-loot-box-mario-kart-tour-1850462828&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-class-action-lawsuit-loot-box-mario-kart-tour-1850462828">lawsuits</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/u-s-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-loot-boxes-and-pay-1834612226&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/u-s-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-loot-boxes-and-pay-1834612226">legislation</a></span> as parents and elected officials deem them a predatory business model. With all this baggage, it probably looks insane from the outside to see Blizzard tout their return and fans respond with excitement, eager to accept them with open arms. From the sound of it, however, Blizzard isn’t bringing them back in the same way, and the approach the team is taking this time around sounds less exploitative than what came before.</p><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/some-overwatch-fans-are-thrilled-loot-boxes-are-coming-back-some-not-so-much&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-overwatch-fans-are-thrilled-loot-boxes-are-coming-back-some-not-so-much" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>director Aaron Keller confirmed that Loot Boxes will only be available on the battle pass and completing challenges, with no option to purchase them with real money. Keller also confirmed in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRoM9B6vmhw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRoM9B6vmhw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with YouTuber emongg</a></span> that if you get a duplicate cosmetic, you can re-roll so you’re not wasting the limited loot boxes you can get per season. <em>Overwatch 2</em> has found so many ways to monetize things that were once free in the original that I’m surprised Blizzard didn’t try to monetize gambling on top of it, but considering the gambling aspect is so fraught that the U.S. government wants to get involved, this was probably the safer approach. Blizzard is also trying to be more transparent about what you might get by providing explicit drop rates so there’s less randomized mystery.</p><p>Ultimately, what Blizzard has described is less like the gambling we typically associate with loot boxes and more like a free form of progression that harkens back to the old days of <em>Overwatch</em>. As long as there isn’t any predatory option to pay for them with real cash, I don’t see the harm in giving people chance drops to earn old cosmetics that have rotated out of the shop. Reviving the little glowing chests that burst open with a celebratory fanfare is a nostalgia play just like the <em>Overwatch Classic </em>modes and bringing the old 6v6 format back. But in another timeline loot boxes could’ve been brought back exactly as they were, ready to rake in money from some poor Mercy main desperate to get the latest legendary skin.</p><p>Loot boxes will return in season 15 on February 18.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Valve has officially <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/497187349280587904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the full schedule of Steam Sales and Festivals for the remainder of 2025.

<p>The 2025 schedule features the major seasonal Sales, genre-specific Fests, and Next Fests highlighting upcoming titles. Valve has noted that this year’s Autumn Sale will be at “a different time frame compared to previous Autumn Sales.”</p>

</ul>



<p>Valve provided some insight on their scheduling via their 2025 second half announcement. The Fests are centered around “a rotating category of games,” with dates set well in advance for developers to have time to plan their participation. Back in 2021, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3002196778013479574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> that daily wishlist additions jumped 421% during the 2020 Next Fest, resulting in a an increase of 292% in “converting wishlists” sales. While gaming sales number in general were incredibly inflated during the first year of COVID, this still demonstrates how important Steam Sales and Fests are to selling games.</p>

			<p>The cult classic Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is receiving a lot of attention in the modding community <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic-modders-show-rtx-remix-upgrade-co-op-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to wiltOS Technologies</a>, which is hard at work on three mods (plus a bonus one) to rejuvenate the 2006 game originally developed by Arkane and published by Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Firstly, there's the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/dark-messiah-restoration-mod" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restoration mod</a>, which brings back some cut content with the help of Ubisoft. The modders were provided with access to assets from Elements, the Xbox 360 version of the game. Thanks to this, the bonus missions and alternate levels that were featured in that version of the game can now be played on PC. Players can also experience The Caves, a cut level, and use cut weapons such as the Sword of Misery or the Necromancer's Staff.</p>
<p>WiltOS Technologies even introduced quality-of-life features such as the Bonus Maps system, which allows level loading without console commands, and a redesigned new game menu with chapter and class selection taken from the Elements. With the Bonus Maps menu, the madders also added a Challenge mode that uses the map add system.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Then there's the online co-op mod, which has just launched as a public test build downloadable <a href="https://github.com/KingDavidW/DarkMessiah-Coop-Mod-Files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via GitHub</a>. This is still an early build, though, as evidenced by the fact that three major features are missing: the new player models, the refined revive mechanics, and the cutscenes.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's the Dark Messiah of Might and Magic graphics overhaul mod powered by NVIDIA RTX Remix. This mod just got a new trailer, which you can find embedded below.</p>
<p><iframe title="RTX Remix Project | Dark Messiah of Might and Magic | The City of Stonehelm" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kN347m66sgc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The team of asset makers for the RTX Remix mod has expanded from two to three, but these high-quality assets take a long time to complete. Because of that, wiltOS Technologies plans to first release a version with the original textures and the RTX Remix enhanced lighting and then slowly introduce the improved textures as they are ready.</p>
<p>The bonus mod mentioned earlier in the article is a proof-of-concept for random map generation based on certain rules. Called 'The Trials of Kha-Baleth', it's meant to be an unofficial continuation to the story that uses DungeonGen technology derived from Alien Swarm's TileGen technology. In addition, players have the option to simply start a randomized level or create their own campaign. You can follow the progress of this work <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-trials-of-kha-baleth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the dedicated page</a>.</p>
<p>Are you excited that Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is getting all this attention after nearly twenty years from its release?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/arcane-wonders-announces-onstage-trick-taking-game-about-theater-troupe<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arcane Wonders has announced a new board game is coming to GenCon. They have partnered with Rolling Wizards Games to produce <em>Onstage</em>, a trick-taking game that blends Vietnamese-inspired artwork with theater performances.</p>

<h2>The <em>Onstage</em> Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Arcane Wonders provides more details on the Onstage board game. Three to five players are part of a theater company competing for the best performers to join their troupe. It is a must-follow trick-taking game with a twist. The trump suit can (and often will) change mid-round, which will keep players on their toes. Each game takes 15-30 minutes to complete.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onstage-board-game-set-up-artwork.jpg?itok=59QnLjls 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onstage-board-game-set-up-artwork.jpg?itok=dr_PWMos 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On top of this unique gameplay, Onstage features beautiful Vietnamese-inspired artwork. Everything from the cards to the meeples to the game's pop-up stage all showcases a distinct art style featuring rich pinks, greens, blues, and dark reds.</p>

<p><em>Onstage</em> is the latest board game to join the Dice Tower Essentials line. This is a list of prestigious board games curated and hand-picked by board game critic Tom Vasel.

But it is a very important part of any game that features loot, potions, food, weapons, and gear.</p><p>A bad inventory system can ruin a great game and make it a chore to play. Having to endlessly fiddle about with various bags or being forced to run back to a shop or town to offload crap isn’t my idea of fun. So I was happy to discover that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-rpg-obsidian-hands-on-preview-xbox-pc-1851703825&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-rpg-obsidian-hands-on-preview-xbox-pc-1851703825"><em>Avowed</em></a></span><em> </em>avoids all that annoying busywork with its streamlined and smart inventory system. The result is a more enjoyable experience because you spend less time fussing about with 400 items and more time doing stuff you actually want to do in a big RPG. </p><figure id="" data-id="aa43aa999221dd18d33e6c22b884af59" data-recommend-id="image://aa43aa999221dd18d33e6c22b884af59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa43aa999221dd18d33e6c22b884af59" data-recommend-id="image://aa43aa999221dd18d33e6c22b884af59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Perhaps the biggest and smartest feature in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-avowed-rpg-tips-tricks-before-you-play-1851760887&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-avowed-rpg-tips-tricks-before-you-play-1851760887"><em>Avowed</em></a></span><em> </em>is the ability to instantly and easily transport items to your camp stash. Find a cool sword that doesn’t quite fit your current build, but you want to play around with it later? Send it back to camp with a single button press. Stumble upon some valuable armor that is really heavy and will make you overencumbered, but you want to sell it later?  Well, just hit a button and send it back to your camp. You can do this anywhere with no restrictions and it’s awesome. Does it make sense? No, but the fact that I can even hold 10 swords in the first place doesn’t make sense either, so who cares?</p><p>The thing is, though, you might not even need to use this feature all that much because a lot of loot you find in <em>Avowed </em>doesn’t weigh anything. Consumable items—foods, potions, lockpicks—don’t weight anything. Likewise, crafting and upgrade materials—iron, wood, furs—also weigh nothing. I never, in my 40 hours or so with <em>Avowed</em>, left a dungeon  desperate to sell stuff in order to free up some inventory space. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-overencumbered-contraband-ship-parts-how-to-1850815667?_gl=1*29yk13*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTQ2NjIwNS40NDMuMS4xNzM5NDY2ODM4LjU3LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-overencumbered-contraband-ship-parts-how-to-1850815667?_gl=1*29yk13*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTQ2NjIwNS40NDMuMS4xNzM5NDY2ODM4LjU3LjAuMA..">That’s a common occurrence in many RPGs</a></span>, but not <em>Avowed</em>. And even if you do pick up way too many swords and armor items, which <em>do</em> weigh you down, you can just teleport that stuff to camp.</p><p>But funnily enough, you often won’t even have to do  that because you can always break down any weapon or piece of gear you find at any time and get its resources. Then you can use those resources, which weigh nothing, to upgrade your equipped gear and make it better. It’s wonderful.</p><figure id="" data-id="cad8190ca65bfb41f76a32380ce16da7" data-recommend-id="image://cad8190ca65bfb41f76a32380ce16da7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cad8190ca65bfb41f76a32380ce16da7" data-recommend-id="image://cad8190ca65bfb41f76a32380ce16da7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some might argue that this is too convenient and easy. I disagree. I think Obsidian correctly realized that managing stacks of crappy swords and pieces of iron isn’t much fun, nor is it what people want out of a roleplaying game. I want to fight monsters, meet new characters, explore strange lands and save the day. And <em>Avowed </em>focuses on all that stuff and doesn’t let inventory management get in the way.</p><p> I think more games should do that. Figure out what you want your game to be and the experience you want players to have while playing it. Then, once you understand that, cut anything that doesn’t help achieve that desired experience. Ultimately, sorting through forty pieces of iron isn’t why people play games like <em>Avowed</em>, so why make them do it?</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this year, EA officially announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-announced-launches-this-summer/1100-6528861/" data-ref-id="1100-6528861">EA College Football 26 was in development</a> for release this summer. Last year, EA offered high-profile college football players $600 each for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-offering-college-athletes-600-to-appear-in-new-football-game/1100-6521289/" data-ref-id="1100-6521289">the right to use their names, images, and likenesses</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-25-review-university-of-madden/1900-6418261/" data-ref-id="1900-6418261">EA College Football 25</a>. But if a new sports representative company is successful, EA may have to pay a significantly higher amount to include those players in EA College Football 26.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/college-football-players-sign-agreement-to-be-paid-for-likeness-in-video-games-134529715.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yahoo Sports</a>, Pathway Sports and Entertainment is making aggressive inroads by pursuing the elite players in college football. The company has offered players $1,500 upfront for their NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) rights in addition to royalty pay that has yet to be fleshed out. Over 450 students at Alabama, Illinois, Georgia, Texas Tech, Wisconsin, and Oregon have already taken the deal, and Pathway has even grander ambitions.</p><p>Pathway is currently sending representatives to colleges across the nation with the desire to sign every football player who is on a scholarship program. There are approximately 11,000 players who have scholarships, and it would take more than $17 million to sign them all at the currently offered rate. However, the report suggests that the total payout may exceed $20 million when factoring in "ambassador payments" for certain students.</p><p>"The overall vision is for athletes to make more money than we saw in the first year of the video game," said Pathway co-founder Casey Schwab in a statement. "We are creating mutual value here. This is a good thing for athletic directors, coaches, and schools because they are trying to create legit opportunities for their players. These are legitimate."</p><p>EA doesn't have any involvement with Pathway at this point. But if Pathway can sign up all or most of the athletes that EA wants to get for EA College Football 26, then the video game publisher will either have to agree to a new deal or go without the star players who helped make the franchise into one of EA Sports' top-sellers. </p>

                <p>As part of Ubisoft's earnings report, the company discussed what kinds of games it wants to focus on going forward--and these include open-world action adventure titles and games-as-a-service projects.</p><p>Ubisoft executive Frederick Duguet <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/nb5rhxgg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on an earnings call that</a> the company has been "investing significantly" in recent times on a "big pipeline" of its two main product categories. These are the aforementioned open-world action adventure and games-as-a-service genres. "That's what we want to deliver year after year," the executive said.</p><p>Ubisoft focusing on big open-world games and live-service titles is nothing new for the company. However, historically, Ubisoft had a more diverse lineup of games spanning multiple different genres and formats. And not every live-service project has worked out for Ubisoft, as the company launched and shut down games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">XDefiant</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyper-scape-servers-are-shutting-down-april-28-ubisoft-says/1100-6500039/" data-ref-id="1100-6500039">Hyper Scape relatively quickly</a>. The pirate game Skull &amp; Bones is still up and running but hasn't exactly broken through to become a hit.</p><p>Duguet went on to list off some of Ubisoft's upcoming projects that have been announced so far, including Assassin's Creed Shadows and more ongoing updates for Rainbow Six Siege, Anno 117: Pax Romana, and The Division Resurgence. The executive said the company will share more details about other upcoming games around May, which is when Ubisoft will release its next earnings report. That's also around when many game companies open the floodgates for gaming news throughout the summer season after various shows and events.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="899300527" data-promo-id="0"

It is expected that Ubisoft would speak in this manner. Duguet was responding to a question about the company's future outlook, and presenting it in a rosy and robust manner is normal behavior for an executive speaking to analysts.</p><p>Regarding Assassin's Creed Shadows, the game is coming this March and preorder numbers are tracking in line with those of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Ubisoft said. Odyssey was the second most successful entry in the entire Assassin's Creed franchise, according to Ubisoft, though it didn't say by what metric.</p><p>In other news, Ubisoft is in the midst of a cost-reduction program that has resulted in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">layoffs and studio closures</a>. CEO Yves Guillemot said these changes were "difficult but necessary." Additionally, Ubisoft is undergoing a "formal review process" for helping to turn its business around, with one potential scenario being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">a deal of some type with Tencent.</a> Guillemot said of negotiations about the company's future, "We are convinced there are different potential paths to achieve this ambition."</p>

			<p>Today, Thunderful announced that Lost in Random: The Eternal Die will be launching in the Summer of 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. This game is set within the same universe as Lost in Random, a Gothic fairy-tale-inspired action-adventure that was released in 2021 as an<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-announces-originals-it-takes-two-lost-in-random-rocket-arena/"> EA Original</a>. If you want to see what you can expect from Lost in Random: The Eternal Die, there is an official gameplay trailer below to introduce you to the world and combat.</p>
<p>This game is the leading project for Stormteller Games, the recently rebranded studio that was previously known as Thunderful Gothenburg.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost in Random: The Eternal Die | Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsxC6L4k-kE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those on PC, the first public demo is available now on Steam, with the demo also being available on Xbox as of tomorrow, February 14. There is no word as to whether there will be a demo for this game on PlayStation 5 or Nintendo Switch as of yet.</p>
<p>In Lost in Random: The Eternal Die, Aleksandra, who was once known as The Queen, has been captured alongside her companion Fortune and jailed inside the Black Die by Mare the Knight, who is plotting their final chapter. As a result of this, you have to fight your way through a randomly generated gauntlet, where there will be pawns to take on and giant board games. As you explore, you will be given the opportunity to claim treasure, which will improve your improve your chances of dealing with Aleksandra's tormentor, much like typical roguelikes.</p>
<p>The roguelike element comes in with the randomly generated gauntlet, as well as the ability to combine over 100 relics that have powerful card-based abilities that can then unleash devastating synergies. You get to pick between four unique weapons as you explore four randomly generated worlds, with each of them being home to unique secrets and challenges to undertake. There are over 30 different enemy types that you will encounter on your journeys, with some really challenging bosses that will pull you out of your comfort zone.</p>
<p>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die is set to stand out from the crowd with a fully voiced story that takes place in a Tim Burton-inspired world, which is brought to life with gorgeous Gothic landscapes and a fitting soundtrack that encompasses the energy of Tim Burton's work.</p>
<p>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam in Summer 2025. As a reminder, there is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2564520/Lost_in_Random_The_Eternal_Die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a demo</a> available on PC right now, with the demo set to release on Xbox tomorrow.</p>

It’s easy to lose moments watching the ambience of the gameboard change in the demo for haunted house RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-horror-at-highrook">The Horror At Highrook</a>. The colours alter from daytime greyness through winey shades of sunset into pale lavender moonlight. There are little details to notice and zoom on: a fleeting embroidery of rain, the seep of flames in the kitchen and guest rooms, a fidgeting of moths in the archives. Ah, nice. The last time I felt so beguiled by a view of a house was while looking out from the hamlet of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You can’t just sit and stare, however. Left idle, your characters will grow hungry, fatigued and unhinged, while useful items such as potent breeds of fungus will disintegrate. So move your cards around. Put somebody in the kitchen to make a meal out of that sack of grain you found, while somebody else combs the archives for the door code to the locked laboratory, and somebody else fumbles around in the courtyard with a trowel.</p>

<p>Once your party’s basic needs are met, you can spare a thought for the mysteries of the game’s house, beginning with the disappearance of the Ackeron family who once lived here. Notes hint at secrets in the sealed chapel and deep underground. Tunnels and “tears” and worrying designs upon the walls. Yes, this is like Darkest Dungeon in many more ways than one.
</p>
<p>
It’s also quite a lot like Cluedo, if Cluedo has been written by Poe or Lovecraft. In The Horror At High Rook, you plonk your characters down in rooms and give them items so they can complete tasks, ranging from deciphering books to running a spyglass over the crags beneath the mansion. These tasks have resource requirements corresponding to character stats, which can be amplified by means of other, supporting cards - some representing artefacts, some "visions", tendencies, qualities.</p>
<p>The “Gift of the Bee”, for example, might help your plague doctor Caligula with her lab work. “My blood buzzes, as if my body is a hive,” the card description explains, adding “I am in awe of the simple alchemies of the everyday”. There’s another “vision” card with simian properties that makes life easier in the machine shop, ensuring that your Mecanist always finds the correct spanner at her elbow.</p>
<p>These representations of the paranormal, together with the visual design of the cards themselves, put me heavily in mind of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cultist-simulator">Cultist Simulator</a> - a game I loved but haven't played since its primary creator, Alexis Kennedy, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alexis-kennedy-denies-allegations-of-abusive-or-coercive-behaviour">accused of harassment by several women</a> (allegations he has denied). I'm still thinking about how that association shapes my feelings about The Horror Of Highrook. It's very much a case of one game being haunted by another.

The writing so far is wordier than you'd find in Cultist Simulator - a bit too opulent when you’re trying to process a bunch of card timers or attend to several characters who need resting or feeding, but there’s always the pause button. There are some more obvious rough edges. Atticus Hawk, the streetwise muscle in my group of occult investigators, has an accent I can’t quite hear in my head. Is he from Blighty or the States? It feels like the developer, former Big Robot lead programmer Tom Betts, hasn’t quite decided. But perhaps I just need to get used to Atticus. I’ve barely played this game for half-an-hour and there are many more layers to peel away.
