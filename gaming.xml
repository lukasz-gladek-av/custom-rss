			<p>The fantasy farm-life sim filled with wiggly squidgy slime creatures is back. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/slime-rancher-2">Slime Rancher 2</a>, players join Beatrix LeBeau on her latest adventure on the mysterious Rainbow Island. But can this ambitious sequel recapture the magic of the innovative original game?</p>
<p><iframe title="Slime Rancher 2 - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZIiUWODikw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One can’t review Slime Rancher 2 without giving an honourable mention to the key characters of the game: the slimes. These cheeky balls of goop are brimming with squishy, adorable charm. There’s a vast assortment of slimes to discover, from your common-or-garden Pink Slimes and rabbit-style Cotton Slimes to the more elusive Golden Slimes and Lucky Slimes. Plus, after consuming each other’s poops – I’m sorry, I mean “plorts” – the slimes mutate into a combo creature called a Largo Slime which contains both Slime’s features and produces double the plorts. Somehow these bulbous creatures manage to be even more endearing than the normal slimes. Particularly when you slurp them onto the end of your vacpack and their charming little smile fills your screen!</p>


<p>Like with all collectible cuties, you’ll wanna catch ‘em all. But to do this, you’re going to have to spend a lot of time exploring. An awful lot of time! If you’re a fan of exploration in games, the intrigue of what you can discover when you’re away from the ranch will keep you going for some time, with an extensive array of resources to unearth, strange slime foodstuffs to obtain, new locations on Rainbow Island to uncover and more. That said, some of the map unlocks are particularly tricky to find and you’ll end up getting very turned around and a bit bewildered as to where you are and where you’re going.&nbsp;Thankfully with the charming cartoon visuals exploding with vivid colours, all this exploration remains a joy to undertake.</p>


<p>And after a long meander across Rainbow Island, it’s always heart-warming to return to the happy, smiling faces of your ranch slimes bouncing around in their corrals. The farming aspect of the game can be good fun, but also rather time consuming. The more slimes you farm, the more long-winded the farming becomes. Running back and forth collecting and distributing food for them to eat, gathering the resultant plorts 30 or 40 at a time, and dispensing them in the plort market or refinery gets monotonous very quickly. The corral upgrades, once you can afford them, keep the process moving, but somehow seem to add yet more to-ing and fro-ing.</p>
<p>This time sink isn’t helped much by the utilities, warp tech and vacpack upgrades. I don’t mean the upgrades themselves, but rather the grind to unlock them. They take a tonne of resources to unlock – that’s more getting lost on Rainbow Island, then – and don’t often supply you with a helpful solution to cross these ranching or exploration barriers.</p>

<p>Between the laborious farming tasks and getting obscenely discombobulated on Rainbow Island, there’s very little time to actually advance the narrative of the game. In fact, it took me a while to work out that there even was a narrative! &nbsp;After 16 hours of gameplay I still hadn’t managed to find the “Grey Labyrinth” location to progress the storyline to any satisfying degree. There are so many technologies and utilities to obtain before you can get anywhere, which in turn all involve you having to spend ages collecting a mass of different resources, that after a while, it all starts to feel a bit too much like hard work. There are so many barriers to narrative progression that one wonders why it was included at all.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Slime Rancher 2 is filled with charm, joy and adorable creatures, but the fun doesn’t translate to every aspect of the gameplay. In seeking to expand and add content to the game, the developers have made what should have been an effortlessly delightful experience a somewhat monotonous one.	</p></div>

<p>"It’s a given that Super Mario will constantly evolve"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="885a84dfd21f9"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Wonder" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/885a84dfd21f9/super-mario-bros-wonder.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's incredible to think how much <strong>Super Mario</strong> has evolved since those early days back in the '80s.</p>
<p>Starting as a simple, albeit incredibly intuitive 2D platformer, Mario has since developed the ability to fly, shoot water from F.L.U.D.D, traverse the literal depths of space, and transform into completely different characters via an anthropomorphic hat known as 'Cappy'.</p>
<p>But of course, if Mario is to reach his 100th anniversary, he'll need to evolve even more. And that's exactly what his creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, believes he'll do.</p>
<p>Speaking via an interview in a special Nintendo Museum book to celebrate Super Mario's 40th anniversary (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hell-constantly-evolve-nintendo-creators-discuss-if-mario-can-reach-100-years/">VGC</a>), Miyamoto, alongside Takashi Tezuka, Koji Kondo, and Toshihiko Nakago, says that Mario "will constantly evolve by incorporating new digital technology" in an effort to reach that lofty 100th anniversary. Furthermore, despite branching out into new mediums, Miyamoto believes Mario's true appeal lies in the interactivity that games provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now we’re working in visual fields like movies, but I want to make sure we keep it interactive and digital. As long as we don’t forget Mario’s prime point – running and jumping – as we add new things, I think Mario will be with us for a long time to come.</p>
<p>“Nintendo takes on unique challenges, and if a new technology is interesting, I believe that by incorporating that technology, we can make that fun expand and grow-like rolling up snow for a snowman. So I hope that you will continue to stick with us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tezuka expands on this by stressing the need to keep players from getting bored while playing Mario games, stating that he's "always thinking of how to keep it so that something like that doesn’t happen so that people keep playing".</p>
<p>And just in case you needed a bit of reassurance, Tezuka finishes by stating "We’ll continue to make Mario games for a long time", so that's good to know.</p>

			<p>Wrekcreation, the sandbox open-world arcade racing game from Three Fields Entertainment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">a studio founded by former Criterion developers</a> who worked on the Burnout series, is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Published by THQ Nordic, Wreckreation gives players the freedom to create whatever kinds of tracks they want, from the kinds of things you'd only expect to see in <a href="https://wccftech.com/hot-wheels-unleashed-one-million/">Hot Wheels Unleashed</a> to something super realistic if that's more your speed, and race the wide variety of vehicles on them to your heart's content.</p>



<p>With more than 400 square kilometres of space to create tracks in and absolutely wreck your cars, along with 16 radio stations and the ability to mix game modes, weather and atmosphere effects, and of course, the cars themselves, there's more than enough to dig your heels into as you slam on the gas.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Wreckreation | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ru9Nn-ZGjjg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>What makes Wreckreation feel like a complete sandbox is the fact that you don't have to stop and jump into a separate mode to switch between driving and racing around to creating tracks. Have an idea for a new layer of track to add or a new ramp, obstacle, or basically any other kind of addition? Press a button and add it right there.</p>



<p>It definitely looks like the kind of game where you'll have to make your own fun, but as it stands, Wreckreation also seems to give you every tool you might want to do so when it comes to having mindless fun racing around and smashing cars.</p>



<p>Wreckreation is available now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S for $39.99/€39.99.</p>

              <p>Sure, you can use your regular laptop for gaming, but those machines won’t really give you the immersive experience you’re hoping for. Even the supposedly powerful machines can struggle when it comes to demanding titles, which is why if you want to game seriously or maybe even work on creative tasks, you need hardware that’s specifically built for this.</p>
<p>Asus makes some of the best options out there, and right now, you don’t have to break the bank to grab one.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5058/"> Currently, the Asus TUF F16 Gaming laptop is going for just $1,660, thanks to a 54% discount on its $3,599 list price.</a> <strong>That’s a rare discount on this 2025 model, but it doesn’t end here</strong>. The bundle also includes an accessory box with a whole bunch of essentials to help you get started – for absolutely free. This is one of the biggest drops we’ve seen on a high-performance gaming laptop this year, but we don’t expect the discount to last long. Snag it up before the retailer pushes the price back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5058/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant, Immersive Graphics, Paired With a Fast Processor</h2>
<p>Asus has packed the machine with Intel’s latest 14th Gen i7-14650HX processor that can clock up to 5.2GHz. This ultra-fast processor is paired with 32GB of DDR5 RAM that keeps slowdowns at bay, even when you’re playing heavier titles or working with resource-intensive applications. There’s a 1TB SSD for storage, so housing all your essentials won’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Graphics are handled by the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 GPU. Expect better frame rates, real-time ray tracing, and sharper visuals for an immersive experience. The 16-inch FHD+ IPS display takes the visual experience even further with a 165Hz refresh rate, Adaptive-Sync, and 100% sRGB color gamut that brings content to life.</p>



<p>Best of all, unlike most powerful gaming laptops out there, this machine stays quiet and cool while working. It features dual Arc Flow fans, full-width heat sinks, and built-in dust filters that make sure you enjoy consistent performance even during intense sessions. Connectivity-wise, you get Thunderbolt 4, USB-C 3.2, three USB-A ports, an HDMI 2.1 output, RJ45 Ethernet, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5058/">The free accessory bundle includes a gaming mouse, an RGB mechanical feel gaming keyboard, a six-pack cable organizer, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed</a>. That’s all you need to get started right away! But again, just be sure to grab the offer before it expires for good.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today marks a monumental moment for the saga of video games: it is the 20th anniversary of the release of Strangelite’s <em>Starship Troopers</em> PC game. On October 28, 2005, the world received a truly terrible game based on a truly excellent film, a concept that modern audiences couldn’t even hope to understand. A phenomenon I truly miss. What ever happened to the wildly incongruous video game adaptations of action movies?</p> <p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, every Hollywood action outing would receive a tie-in video game. Publishers would have a side-scrolling platformer or 2D action game ready to accompany any major movie, no matter how utterly inappropriate or gloriously irrelevant it might be. And no, we’re not talking about some obscure, backwater companies you’ve never heard of—we’re talking the biggest names in the industry. Thus it was that in 1989 you could visit your local gaming store and pick up a copy of Activision’s <em>Die Hard</em>, developed by&nbsp;<em>Tribes</em> legends Dynamix, or the abysmal NES release <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em> made by [double-checks notes] Rare.</p>

 <p>These tie-ins weren’t exactly famous for sticking particularly closely to the films on which they were based. While the <em>Die Hard</em> I mention above is very much set in Nakatomi Plaza, another version was made for PC Engine and TurboGrafx-16 that, incredibly, has you battling through jungles and rivers to reach the Nakatomi building in scenes that would feel more at home in a game set during the Vietnam war. More normally, however, these games were primarily about stripping out all nuance, subtlety, and subversion to create a straight-faced action game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639579"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639579">© Ocean / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <p>Who can forget Ocean Software’s 1988 Amiga tie-in <em>RoboCop</em>, for instance, a surprisingly great side-scrolling action game ported from an arcade machine release? A beloved game it might have deservedly been, but it’s perhaps fair to say it might have somewhat missed the satirical elements of Paul Verhoeven ‘s film. Or perhaps the best example of all time: 2004’s <em>Fight Club,</em> released for PS2 and Xbox. And yes, that’s right, 2004. You aren’t losing your mind, David Fincher’s deeply subversive and satirical film was released in 1999, and this—wait for it—<em>fighting game</em> came out a full five years later. Was it, too, a treatise on the self-destructive psyche of male violence? No, it was not. It was a game about the actual fight club, the men beating the shit out of each other, and had you winning fights to rise up the ranks, until you’re eventually able to unlock Limp Bizkit’s Fred Durst as a playable character. I’m not making that up. It took an anti-capitalist, anti-violence film and said, “I like the bit where the man punched the other man.”</p>

 <p>There are obviously a squillion examples of truly horrendous movie tie-ins, like the notorious <em>E.T.</em> disaster or 2003’s&nbsp;<em>Charlie’s Angels</em> flop, but my favorite examples are always the ones that just woefully miss the point of their subject matter. And that’s why 2005’s&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers&nbsp;</em>has such a fond place in my heart.</p>

 <p>Once again, no, you aren’t slipping loose from time. Paul Verhoeven’s wonderful&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272"><em>Starship Troopers</em></a> was released to theaters in 1997, a full eight years before Empire Interactive released this outstandingly terrible video game tie-in. The anti-war film certainly was, and still is, willfully misunderstood. That’s not because there’s any ambiguity, but because a lot of people aren’t very clever, misunderstanding its loudly telegraphed satire as a sincere representation of militaristic campaigning, seeing its excoriating portrayal of the modern military’s fascistic core as some sort of enthusiastic thumbs up for Nazism. Whether furious because they thought it was endorsing fascism, or delighted to think it was, people failed to understand this film from impressively diametric positions. (We can put aside the much-debated nature of the book on which the film mostly wasn’t based, given Verhoeven’s vision was clearly distinct and—given his childhood in Nazi-occupied Holland—not exactly in favor of the obvious baddies.)</p>

  <p>But the film isn’t exactly a work of subtlety. From its gruesomely silly “WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?” propaganda commercials to its sequences directly spoofing movies like <em>Platoon</em> and <em>Full Metal Jacket</em>,&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em> wears its furious satire on its sleeve. Verhoeven’s genius in films like this and&nbsp;<em>RoboCop</em> (heck, even&nbsp;<em>Total Recall</em> if you look beyond the cheesy veneer) isn’t delivered quietly, but rather with unavoidable brutality. Which is all to say, no, this was never a film about brave Americans fighting off the cruel bug armies. Can you sense the foreshadowing?</p>

 <p>My favorite thing about the&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em> PC game was the way it would lock up my PC, forcing hard reboots. This offered merciful little moments between having to play the game for the review I was writing at the time. Created by a British studio called Strangelite (who would go on to be bought by Rebellion and folded into the teams developing the <em>Sniper Elite</em> games), the game made its failure to comprehend its source material apparent before you’d even taken it out of the box. “Hesperus, a planet perilously close to Earth, has fallen to the bug menace,” it stated, ensuring you knew that a) it wasn’t going to try to recreate the events of the movie, and b) woefully didn’t realize that the Bugs never were a “menace.” That was kinda the point.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639575" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639575"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639575">© Empire Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game, a first-person shooter, was meant to be about taking on vast hordes of the arachnoid Bugs, desperately fighting to survive against the odds. Although those odds would often turn in your favor when all the dozens of identical enemies would choose to attack a nearby rock instead of you, kindly standing still while you shot them all in the side. It was a spectacular clusterfuck of atrocious graphics, dismal load times, lines of voice dialogue overlapping each other incoherently, and then to really drive home how bad this all was, super low-quality clips of the movie played at you to point out what it wasn’t portraying. (This reminds me of an utterly awful movie you hopefully never saw called <em>Carrie 2: The Rage</em>, that frequently included clips of Brian De Palma’s 1976 masterpiece to make sure you had constant context for just how outrageously terrible this sequel really was.)</p> <p>It sucked. That’s the point I’m trying to make.&nbsp;<em>Really</em> sucked. And you know what? I kind of miss that, a bit.</p>

 <p>Of late, we keep getting movie/TV tie-ins—albeit often years or decades later—that are really good! Games like 2023’s&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-new-game-2023-review-shooter-rpg-pc-1851000568"><em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em></a>, and 2022’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972"><em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em></a>, that embrace the point of the source material in a winsome fashion. Which is brilliant, and bring it on! But there’s definitely a part of me that wishes 2025 could have seen a side-scrolling beat ’em up based on <em>One Battle After Another</em>, or a <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em> platform game about collecting microphones. Where’s my egregiously misguided <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> third-person action game that tries to recreate major scenes from the film through minigames? We didn’t even get a top-down racing sim based on&nbsp;<em>F1 The Movie</em>.</p> <p>So happy 20th birthday,&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em>, you colossal pile of shit. You were one of the last of your kind.</p>

<p>Talking about the most unexpected collaborations, a Borderlands 4 x PGA Tour 2K25 crossover is happening tomorrow. </p>



<p>Borderlands 4 has had a highly successful launch, becoming the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-was-the-best-selling-game-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game</a> in its first month. However, to keep the hype going, the developers will keep adding more content and doing some crossovers as well. And the first crossover has been announced —it’s with another 2K title. </p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-x-pga-tour-2k25-post-teases-new-content-for-the-game">Borderlands 4 x PGA Tour 2K25 Post Teases New Content for the Game</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/borderlands-4-confirms-pga-tour-2k25-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, the official confirmation about the Borderlands 4 and PGA Tour 2K25 crossover comes from the latter’s official <a href="https://x.com/PGATOUR2K/status/1982858198425235500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The official post, however, doesn’t provide any concrete information about the content of this crossover. The only thing confirmed is the release date for the collaboration, set for Wednesday, October 29, 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even though no information about the crossover has been revealed, players can make some predictions based on the image in the announcement post. First things first, it seems like PGA Tour 2K25 players will get their hands on a Psycho skin. On top of that, the character is seen holding a golf club, which includes some form of cybernetic enhancement. Lastly, if the background is a hint, then a new golf course inspired by Kairos might be on the cards as well.</p>



<p>However, this is just speculation based on the teaser image; none of the details have been officially confirmed by the developers. </p>



<p>In other news, a new Borderlands 4 Vault Hunter has been revealed as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-borderlands-4-vault-hunter-revealed-as-part-of-first-dlc-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of the first DLC</a>. Additionally, NBA 2K26 has become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game</a> in the United States.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts (EA) employees are reportedly frustrated and even mocking the company internally over its push to use more AI in its development and other areas of work.</p>



<p>According to a new report from Business Insider, higher-ups at EA have<strong> “spent the past year urging its nearly 15,000&nbsp;employees to use AI for just about everything.”</strong> This includes anything from code to concept art to even <strong>“scripting conversations with direct reports about sensitive topics such as pay and promotions.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-employees-are-worried-about-their-jobs">Employees Are Worried About Their Jobs</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Employees who spoke anonymously</a> to the outlet say that they are encouraged to use the in-house chatbot called “ReefGPT”, despite it producing “flawed code and other so-called hallucinations that they need to correct.” Those on the creative side, like character and level design, say that they are expected to train the AI software on their own created work. It’s led to a belief and frustration that these decisions will ultimately lead to the company no longer needing that type of talent, with layoffs to come.</p>



<p>Even one former employee, a senior QA staffer at Respawn, believes that AI was at least partly to blame for his job loss this year. He told the outlet that AI was <strong>“able to perform a key part of his job — reviewing and summarizing feedback from hundreds of play testers.”</strong></p>



<p>This mandate within EA to use AI has even led to mocking among employees. One meme sent within the company Slack, according to Business Insider, depicts the following:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>A meme posted last month to a Slack channel for employees at Electronic Arts shows a cartoon man asking a trio of CEOs what they want. They answer in unison: “AI!” Then the man asks, “AI to do what?” The CEOs reply, “We don’t know!” The man follows, “When do we want it?” The CEOs cheer again: “Right now!” Dozens of the video-game company’s staff responded with crying laughing emojis.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>EA declined to comment to Business Insider for the story. They also haven’t responded to Insider Gaming’s request for comment. Should any public statement be made, it will be added to this story.</p>

Nobody supports this sale, and it is putting creators in a very difficult position. They have built their entire career and livelihood over a game that they have no control over. I ask that you please not harass other Sims creators over their decisions regarding the game and the creator network. I am very fortunate to be in a position where I can make a choice like this, but not everyone has that ability. I don't truly don't believe there is a 'right' answer here, and everyone is still trying to figure out their next steps."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sims closed on writing: "I'm really, really distraught over this sale, and I know that many of you are as well.

It is the first Halo game ever to launch on a PlayStation console, and cements Microsoft’s position as a multiplatform video game developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The U.S. administration then doubled down on the Halo AI images, with the Department of Homeland Security using Halo to promote the Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s website (ICE).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Finishing this fight. <a href="https://t.co/6Ezq9NUqMq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6Ezq9NUqMq</a></p>— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) <a href="https://twitter.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The social media posts have sparked a vociferous response from Halo fans, which led to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1ohjpkg/white_house_twitter_posts_donald_trump_is_johns/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Halo subreddit changing its enforcement rules</a>.

"First, think of how little you see [The Pokémon Company International]'s name in the press.

This will blow over in a couple of days and they'll be happy to let it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Trump administration has form when it comes to using AI images to promote the President. In May, Trump sparked a backlash from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope. The picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, was released as Catholics mourned the death of Pope Francis and prepared to choose the next pontiff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The White House has also released AI images of Trump as Superman and as a Star Wars Jedi.

                <p>It's been nearly 20 years since Rockstar Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bully/" data-ref-id="5000-24303">Bully</a> came out, and while there's no word of a sequel, the next best thing may have dropped: a mod that introduces online multiplayer to the high school action sim.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-may-not-have-bully-2-but-this-fan-made-bully-online-mod-may-be-the-next-best-thing" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported by IGN</a>, a group of modders has finally revealed Bully Online. Led by YouTuber, developer, and "massive Bully fan," SWEGTA, the project has been a long time coming, but is inching ever closer to an early-access launch in December 2025 for those who <a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">support the team on Ko-Fi</a>. At the time of this writing, it appears the developers have received at least 76 Ko-Fis.</p><p>What is Bully Online, though? According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J0_BnWKvEA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the YouTube video's description</a>, the mod "allows you and your friends to play minigames, role-play, compete in racing, fend off against NPCs, and much more." SWEGTA described it in greater detail in the nearly nine-minute video below, stating that it's a "mix between minigames, free-roaming, and role-playing." There's a "fully fleshed-out inventory system," letting you earn money in-game to spend on Bully goodies from items to housing to vehicles. It sounds like the online modes of other Rockstar games, such as GTA Online and RDR Online.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J0_BnWKvEA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2J0_BnWKvEA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you do support the project on Ko-Fi for $8 (either as a one-time donation or a monthly subscription), you get additional perks alongside early access in December. This includes behind-the-scenes content (like developer commentary), a blue player nametag to denote your specialness, an in-game camera to save and share up to 10 photos, priority server queue to get in more quickly, and a Discord role and access to an exclusive text channel to yap with the development team behind the mod.</p><p>This is all well and good, and a welcome addition to a franchise beloved by many, but what about Bully 2? Well, you never say never, but you certainly say "wait a while," as, according to Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-vp-talks-gta-6-explains-why-bully-2-never-happened/1100-6535080/" data-ref-id="1100-6535080">a sequel never materialized due to bandwidth</a>.</p><p>"If you've got a small lead creative team and a small senior leadership crew, you just can't do all the projects you want," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/GdAYM7QNIOA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Houser told IGN at LA Comic Con in September 2025</a>. "With certainly how we're structuring it, [we were] trying to do two projects with a very fairly small team, and just really trying to think through that. 'How can we do that and keep them both moving?'"</p>

			<p>Developer ArenaNet has launched the sixth major expansion for Guild Wars 2 today, with Visions of Eternity <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-next-expansion-october-28/">now available to players on PC</a>. Visions of Eternity adds a new island to explore called Castora, with two new maps to explore, a new storyline, and plenty more.</p>



<p>The new storyline kicks off with whispers and rumors of the island of Castora, with the Tyrian Alliance stepping in to uncover more about the magical island once they discover that the Inquest has begun sniffing around for Castora.</p>



<p>Alongside two new maps included with the new expansion, Shipwreck Strand and Starlit Weald, players will be able to check out a new and improved skimmer, new raid encounters, a new homestead plot, and new legendary gear. Visions of Eternity will also feature new boss fights, new skills, and new seasonal rewards.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>The team is thrilled to launch Visions of Eternity</em>," said game director Josh Davis in a press release. "<em>This is the first time Guild Wars 2 is going to a location in Tyria that's truly brand new to all players. The island vibe of the setting gives us a lot of room to explore improvements and evolutions to the skimmer and homesteads that are also thematically appropriate to the setting, and we can't wait to see</em> <em>how players tackle our new world and raid bosses</em>."</p>



<p>The new expansion is available for $24.99, and ArenaNet has plans to release multiple free content updates to the expansion throughout 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crash-bandicoot-netflix-animated-series-reportedly-in-the-works.1336789/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, streaming giant Netflix is working on an animated adaptation of Naughty Dog's legendary platforming series&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, and one of its stalwart animation partners is reported to be developing the show.</p>

<p>Per a report from Netflix-focused news platform <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">What's On Netflix</a>, the streaming company has been "quietly developing" the&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>series, and it's being worked on by none other than&nbsp;<em>Sonic Prime</em>'s&nbsp;WildBrain Studios.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no further details regarding the potential&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>series are forthcoming, and since Netflix has a habit of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-netflix-series-is-officially-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceling shows</a> (as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/boss-fight-entertainment-netflix-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shutting down subsidiaries</a>&nbsp;in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">gaming space</a>), the show may never actually see the light of day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crash-bandicoot-netflix-animated-series-rumor.jpg?itok=xSP8uhtg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crash-bandicoot-netflix-animated-series-rumor.jpg?itok=rtuGzapX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>animated series is reportedly in the works at Netflix.</figcaption></figure><p>As What's On Netflix points out, this wouldn't be the first time Crash Bandicoot has appeared in a Netflix streaming show; his debut was for&nbsp;<em>Skylanders Academy</em>, which ran for three seasons between 2016 and 2018. That show also featured a cameo from Crash's sister Coco.</p>

<p>This potential Netflix series would, however, mark the marsupial's first starring role, assuming it goes ahead. Presumably, we'll also be seeing some of Crash's most iconic allies, including Coco, the wise mask Aku Aku, and Tawna, whose design was revised for 2020's&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot 4</em>.</p>

<p>As for what's happening elsewhere in the world of&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, the&nbsp;<em>N. Sane Trilogy&nbsp;</em>remaster package crossed the 20 million sales mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-sales" rel="nofollow">back in June last year</a>, while 2019's&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Racing&nbsp;</em>remaster <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-10m-sales" rel="nofollow">passed 10 million sales this year</a>.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, the bandicoot's latest video game outing is 2023's&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Rumble</em>, a multiplayer spinoff for which updates concluded less than a year after its initial release.</p>




<p>It remains to be seen whether Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>series materializes, but if it does, it'll join a host of other video game adaptations on the platform, including the likes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-soon" rel="nofollow">upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series</a>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow">animated&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>show</a>, and a series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix" rel="nofollow">based on&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Boring gaming setups are no fun. If you’re looking to add a bit more energy and character to your desk space, gaming lights can make a big difference. There are a bunch of different options in the market to consider, but if you’re looking for something smarter that’s easy to control and also offers creative freedom, we recommend checking out the Govee RGBIC gaming neon rope lights.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5057/">These are flexible, bring life to every setup, and can now be yours for less. Amazon is being generous with a 25% discount on these, which brings the price down to just $75 from its original $100 tag.</a> That’s a nice $25 drop, but the offer might not be around for long. Take advantage of the discount while it’s still live, and while supplies last.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5057/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Millions of Colors to Choose From</h2>
<p>These Govee lights get you 42 independent light segments and 252 LED beads across the 10-foot strip. The inverted illuminated lighting technology removes the typical glare and spotting you often see with traditional LED strips for a smoother glow that’s easier on the eyes. The strip is also flexible, meaning you can shape it around the edge of your desk and even resize it according to your needs using the 12 designated cut points.</p>
<p>Once the strip is all set, you can use the Govee Home app to access 16 million color options, 64+ preset scenes, 11 music modes, and much more. Switching between these literally takes seconds, and you can play around with the modes to get the setup of your dreams. Not in the mood to bother with the in-app controls? Pair your lights with Alexa or Google Assistant and use voice commands to manage the lights.</p>



<p>For an even more immersive experience, you can consider grabbing an AI Gaming Box that syncs your lights with what’s happening on-screen. It’s definitely more of an add-on, but worth it if you’re looking to build a full setup that makes you feel like you’re a part of the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5057/">All-in-all, these lights offer a great way to improve your current desktop setup</a>. They add personality to any space, and you have a wide range of colors, plus patterns to choose from. Feeling some boost of energy? Go for vibrant colors. Want to relax while streaming your favorite show? Warm tones should work best. Snag the deal while the 25% discount is still available.</p>

              <p>What would <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> have been like as an online game? Will <em>Civilization 7</em> finally be good before its one-year anniversary? And what lesson will publishers relying on game key cards for Switch 2 take from <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>‘s juggernaut physical sales? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Are you brave enough to <a href="https://x.com/mega64/status/1982951652811518329">spend a night in the Xbox haunted house</a>? The prices keep going up and the games keep leaving.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> had the biggest physical launch since <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></h2> <p>That’s with around 6 million copies sold globally, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c">according to Circana</a>. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> sold 10 million copies at launch despite being Nintendo’s first $70 game, with millions of those being physical copies as well despite the overall shift to digital games in recent years. At the time, the 2023 Switch hit pushed “new physical video game software spending” to its highest May total since May 2014.</p>

 <p>This tells us what we’ve already known: some franchises can still buck the trend when it comes to the disappearance of physical games, especially on Nintendo’s platforms. But the question remains: are controversial Switch 2 game key cards a way to satisfy that same demand, or a clumsy band-aid the company’s better ripping off sooner rather than later?</p>

 <h2><em>Call of Duty</em> is still trying to rain on <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s parade</h2> <p><em>Black Ops 6</em> multiplayer and Zombies is once again going free from <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1982928103417753961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1982928103417753961%7Ctwgr%5E11d055f620a693ec5cf2b2fa9081b608928c48f7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Factivision-announces-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-and-zombies-go-free-again-today-just-as-ea-launches-battlefield-battle-royale-redsec">October 28 through November 3</a>. Is that just a fun Halloween treat from Activision, or another attempt to trick players out of engaging with <em>Battlefield</em>‘s latest content drop? The EA competitor’s new, free-to-play battle royale mode is coming later today. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-far-behind-battlefield-6-on-steam-preorders">Data firm Alinea Analytics projects</a> that Call<em> of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> has sold under 200,000 pre-order copies so far on Steam, compared to <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s million pre-orders during the same pre-launch period.</p>

 <h2><em>Civilization 7</em> is still trying to turn the corner</h2> <p>The embattled 4X strategy sequel will get a boost from the addition of a feature players have wanted since launch. Firaxis’ latest <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-oct-27/">status update on the status of its updates</a> says it’s currently testing lots of big changes, including an option to play as the same civilization throughout an entire match. One of the game’s big departures was forcing players to swap during age transitions. It’s by far one of the most unpopular new mechanics. Meanwhile, Tide of Power update 1.3.0 arrives next week with pirates and an overhaul of the game’s sea power dynamics.</p>

 <h2><strong><span dir="auto"><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> started as an online co-op game because the dev loved <em>Battlefield 1942</em></span></strong></h2> <p>Creator Fumito Ueda reflected on the iconic 2005 PS2 game’s legacy in a recent interview <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/251027y#i-3">with <em>Denfaminico Gamer</em></a>. “<span dir="auto">Speaking personally, I used to play</span><span dir="auto">&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 1942</em></span><span dir="auto"> a lot at the time,” he said. “I was really impressed by the fact that all the characters on the screen were players, and I felt like, ‘This is the future of gaming.’ </span>I was really drawn to the energy and live feeling of online games, but at the same time, the feeling of excitement and disappointment over winning and losing gradually faded away.”</p> <p><span dir="auto">He continued, “I used to enjoy the excitement of competing against other people, but as I got older, I began to seek a different kind of immersion. This made me reconsider&nbsp;</span><span dir="auto">the appeal of single-player games . </span><span dir="auto">Video games started out as entertainment where you played against a computer, but&nbsp;</span><span dir="auto">the idea of ‘encountering a being that feels alive, even when you’re alone’ </span><span dir="auto">became central to my interest.”</span></p> <p>Hey Sony, it’s 20 years later, sure, but it’s never too late to throw a couple hundred million at Uedo to make a multiplayer sequel to <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-selling-ps2-games-madden-gta-guitar-hero-25-year-anniversary-2000639307">The PS2 just turned 25 years old and only one of the top-10 best-selling games doesn’t start with the letter “G” or “M”</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-ranking-worst-best-list-chocolate-bar-1851679251">We rank the best and worst Halloween candy&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308">Our government is dumb as fuck</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

<p>Black Ops 7 Vault Edition is the most premium way to experience and enjoy the newest Call of Duty release. We’ve got answers to all the crucial questions regarding its price, where and how to buy, and what you’re getting for your hard-earned dollars.</p>



<p>Treyarch is back with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. It represents the second year in a row where we’ve gotten a Black Ops release. Everyone’s looking forward to no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-skill-based-matchmaking-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skill-based matchmaking</a>, and there’s an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensive roadmap of season one content</a> already announced.</p>



<p>If you’re already buying the new Call of Duty title, you should consider whether BLOPS 7’s Vault Edition is right for you.</p>

<p><strong>Black Ops 7’s most expensive version—the Vault Edition—costs $99.99 or £99.99.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve bought or seen previous Vault Editions, you’ll be somewhat pleased to see there’s no price increase. That said, it’s still a hefty wad of bills required to buy the priciest Call of Duty edition.</p>



<p>Should the cross-gen edition not meet your criteria, consider spending a bit more for the Vault Edition. Read on for reasons why you should consider doing this.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-black-ops-7-vault-edition">Everything Included In Black Ops 7 Vault Edition</h2>

<p><strong>The Vault Edition comes with a plethora of bonuses from the BlackCell Pass to new Skins, Mastercrafts, and Unlock Tokens in Black Ops 7.</strong></p>



<p>We’ve seen Ultimate Editions that don’t really justify their price tag. To be fair, Black Ops 7’s Vault Edition does come loaded with handy consumables and longevity benefits that reward you for playing the game.</p>



<p>Let’s check out the full extent of Vault Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>4 Operator Skins:
<ul>
<li>Harper</li>



<li>Karma</li>



<li>Reaper EWR-3</li>



<li>T.E.D.D.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>5 Mastercraft Weapons</li>



<li>8 Ultra Rarity GobbleGums</li>



<li>BlackCell Season One Battle Pass:
<ul>
<li>20 Tier Skips</li>



<li>1,100 CP</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Cross-Gen Bundle (PS4 &amp; PS5)</li>



<li>Mastercraft Collection</li>



<li>Operator Collection</li>



<li>Permanent Black Ops 7 Unlock Token</li>



<li>Ultra GobbleGum Pack for Zombies</li>
</ul>



<p>We said it didn’t skimp on the special items! You’re covered across Zombies and online multiplayer with a variety of one-time consumables. </p>



<p>Plus, while BLOPS 7 is cutting down on the over-the-top content and skins, you’ve still got some mindbending Mastercrafts to look forward to through the Vault Edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-black-ops-7-vault-edition">How to Get Black Ops 7 Vault Edition</h2>



<p><strong>The best way to get the Vault Edition is by accessing the platform of your choice through the Black Ops 7 site and pre-ordering it before launch to ensure you’ve got your copy locked in.</strong></p>



<p>Again, let’s cut the chatter for now, and let you know the best way to approach this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/gb/en/store/games/blackops7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 official website</a>.</li>



<li>Click <strong>Pre-Order Black Ops 7 </strong>in the top-right corner of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down, and make sure <strong>Vault Edition</strong> is selected.</li>



<li>Choose one of the five platforms available:
<ul>
<li>Xbox</li>



<li>Xbox PC</li>



<li>PlayStation</li>



<li>Battle.net</li>



<li>Steam</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>Note: The Vault Edition is a <strong>digital-only</strong> purchase. If you like your physical media, you’re out of luck with the Vault Edition.</p>

Her timing sparks disaster as the town quickly descends into a deadly game of survival against omnipresent floral overgrowth. Players must solve ingenious puzzles, defeat horrifying enemies, and uncover a mysterious plan to create new life in the most inhuman way imaginable.</p><p>Exploring Joycliffe and its surroundings reveals many dark secrets. Players must use their intuition and observation skills to determine the best path forward, using an array of hidden items and cryptic clues to make progress. Key information is recorded via the in-game journal, which includes story discoveries and data of floral specimens. Players will discover many weapon types throughout the game to do battle against evolving enemies and bosses. The world of Joycliffe is always changing, and as day turns into night the floral growth presents new deadly foes with abilities that change over the course of the game.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1003001"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><em>The Florist</em> has cultivated a unique identity of color and beauty to bring something special to fans around the world. Joycliffe is not a dark abandoned town after years of neglect. The danger here is fresh, with color and light being used as primary gameplay and artistic devices to create tension and unsettling ambience in a style never seen before. With hand-crafted environments and fixed camera design, every level has been finely developed for both beauty and playability. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Other notable design features include multiple difficulty and accessibility options, unlimited inventory to pick up everything along the journey, autosave checkpoints and plenty of bonus features and hidden content—a staple of the genre.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/white-house-claims-trump-is-%E2%80%98hugely-popular%E2%80%99-with-gamers-despite-sky-high-console-prices.1336723/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, the Trump Administration, in all its brain-rotting glory, posted </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-halo-gamestop-console-wars-meme-ai-images-2000639237"><span>an AI mockup of the president in Master Chief armor</span></a><span> as it declared that the man, who has likely never played a moment of </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>in his life, had ended the console war. This whole thing started because retail chain GameStop made a joke about the bitter feud between PlayStation and Xbox players finally ending, thanks to the impending arrival of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><i><span>Halo: Campaign Evolved </span></i><span>on PS5</span></a><span>. For some reason, the administration jumped in, presumably because someone on staff pays attention to video game news and only views the world through a memetic lens. Now, in what I can only assume is further committing to the bit, the White House has put out a statement declaring not only that&nbsp; Trump has ended a war, but that he is “hugely popular” with gamers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In a statement issued to journalist and ex-</span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>editor </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link&amp;fbclid=PAZnRzaANtDVtleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABpz3WlKQSLeaQPnwHSgd_8kbdaOk9khYlDlkGwojXSUxrjZoBTQMEypzyzDjJ_aem_4-XJdI-3mwtRpkA9nPgsXQ"><span>Alyssa Mercante</span></a><span>, the White House said that he is the only leader “fully committed to giving power to the players,” which is a reference to GameStop’s tagline. So, taking this at face value, the Trump administration is claiming credit for Microsoft bringing its longest-running series to PlayStation, and saying that under his presidency, gamers are thriving.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Yet another war ended under President Trump’s watch—only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J. Trump,” the statement reads. “That’s why he’s hugely popular with the American people and American Gamers.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Putting aside that this is obviously just some White House goon taking the piss out of a situation for the meme, the fact of the matter is, the video game industry has been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881"><span>thrown into a tailspin by the Trump administration</span></a><span>. The president’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438"><span>tariffs have increased console prices</span></a><span> across the board, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471"><span>Nintendo</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873"><span>Sony</span></a><span>, and Microsoft all raising their respective price tags on systems and accessories over the course of 2025. Xbox </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228"><span>even did it twice</span></a><span>, though it does sound like Microsoft’s internal shifts </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546"><span>have contributed to that</span></a><span> as well.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Trump has done tangible damage to the video game industry in the past 10 months, and yet, there’s an odd, concerted effort within his administration to brand him as some kind of gamer-friendly leader. This includes dumb shit like these memes, but also the Department of Homeland Security’s use of imagery from video games and anime, such as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>,&nbsp; to try and recruit people to ICE. Misinformation and fascist rhetoric is the Trump administration’s M.O., however, so they’re counting on people to clap and cheer at stupid posts of the president dressed as a character they like while he simultaneously undermines the very industry they’re a fan of. Anyone who falls for this isn’t paying attention, and if a fascist playing AI-generated dress-up as Master Chief is enough to get you to ignore this on top of all the bigger problems happening because of this idiot’s nationwide ego trip, we are well and truly fucked.</span></p>

                <p>For the second year in a row, it's looking like an official Lego tabletop game is going to be one of the most popular board/card games during the holiday season. Last year it was <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monkey Palace</a></strong>, a fun strategy board game for up to four players. This year it's <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party/dp/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Brick Like This</a></strong>, a collaborative party game for up to eight players. Brick Like This: A Lego Party Game--not to be confused with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO%C2%AE-Party-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FCGVMVRD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Party</a>, the video game--is available now for only $20 at Amazon and other major retailers. </p><p>Brick Like This and Monkey Palace were designed by Dotted Games, a studio under the Asmodee umbrella dedicated to Lego board games. Based on the sustained success of Monkey Palace and how well Brick Like This appears to be performing out of gate, it seems likely we'll be talking about Dotted Games' third Lego board game this time next year.</p><div title="[Lego] Brick Like This: A Lego Party Game" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4827" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Lego] Brick Like This: A Lego Party Game" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party/dp/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party\/dp\/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party/dp/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Brick Like This!

It's a fast-paced game that's dynamically designed to offer a different experience each time you play.</p><p>Players are split into teams of two in a race to see who can build miniature Lego models the fastest. One player builds the model based on instructions communicated by their partner. There are 92 shape cards and 48 total Lego pieces. Models have a minimum of five bricks and a maximum of eight bricks. You're awarded more points by opting for models with more pieces--though the instructor won't know what the model actually looks like until they flip the card over.</p><p>In addition to the regular shape cards, there are 20 challenge cards that introduce restrictions for builders and instructors, such as building the model with your eyes closed or with one hand and limiting the types of hints you can provide as the instructor.</p><p>When a team completes the model, they flip the hourglass, which starts a 30-second countdown to the end of the round. After six rounds, teams tally their scores and declare a winner. Each game takes around 15 minutes total.</p></div>                      </div><div title="[Lego] Monkey Palace Board Game" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4829" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Lego] Monkey Palace Board Game" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Monkey Palace: A Lego Board Game</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$39.25 (was $42)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you haven't played the studio's debut game Monkey Palace, I'd highly recommend for family game nights if you like strategy and puzzle games. </p><p>Two to four players take turns building staircases and decorating the makeshift palace.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> may soon be an Xbox Play Anywhere title, according to a presumed premature advert spotted on the Xbox Store.</p>
<p>I don't personally see the advert on the Xbox store, either on console or PC, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ohg4ay/baldurs_gate_3_xbox_play_anywhere/">an image was captured on Reddit</a> showing a Baldur's Gate 3 promo block with the words "Now Xbox Play Anywhere" on it. This could have been faked but the scruffy nature of it and the odd angle make it a convincing fake if so.</p>
<p>I asked Larian for clarification this morning but its position is "no comment" for now, which I think bodes well.</p>

<p>Xbox Play Anywhere games, as I'm sure you know, are games that you buy once and can play on PC and Xbox and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">the new handheld ROG Ally X</a>, all within the Xbox-branded ecosystem. So if you were to buy Baldur's Gate 3 as an Xbox Play Anywhere game, you'd be able to chop and change where you play.</p><p>I'm not sure how it works retroactively, and whether if you already own the game on Xbox you'd be able to go back and play on a different platform, but I presume that'll be the case. I don't see why you'd punish earlier adopters of the game.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 remains one of the finest role-playing games of this generation, and it's a game that's been heavily updated by Larian since it was released in 2023. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-last-ever-major-update-gets-a-long-awaited-release-date">The final BG3 patch, Patch 8</a>, released in the spring, brought cross-play, new subclasses, a photo mode, and the long-awaited addition of split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S. In short, if you haven't played it, do.</p>

			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach now supports the PlayStation 5's power saver mode, and its implementation is among the most interesting to date, according to a new technical analysis.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> examined how the two entries in the Kojima Productions series support Power Saver Mode, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/">a newly introduced operating mode for the PlayStation 5 console</a> that cuts CPU resources in half, halves the memory bandwidth, and reduces CPU and GPU clocks to reduce the system's power consumption.</p>



<p>While the implementation in Death Stranding: Director's Cut was not particularly challenging, as it is the enhanced port of a PlayStation 4 game, things get more interesting in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. According to Digital Foundry, Power Saver mode in the second entry in the series, at a glance, only runs the game in Performance Mode while capping the framerate to 30 frames per second.</p>



<p>A closer look, however, reveals some interesting details. Tessellation and geometry, for example, are in line with that seen in Quality Mode, while the resolution is kept at 1440p, although with dynamic resolution scaling in place. This approach is interesting in how the developer worked around the constraints to balance the reduced framerate, possibly caused by the CPU limitations, with increased fidelity in some instances over Performance mode.</p>



<p>Seeing how Kojima Productions handled Power Saver Mode support in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach again raises the question of why so much effort is being put into supporting an operating mode that will likely see very little use. According to Digital Foundry, this could be a way to prepare developers for a certain level of expected flexibility required to scale games on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ai-upscaling-16gb-lpddr5x-16mb-mall/">rumored PlayStation handheld.</a></p>



<p>As is, however, the current Power Saver Mode shouldn't be considered as an early showcase of what the rumored PlayStation handheld will deliver, as a 115W power target is way too high for a device that will likely target between 15 and 25W, and the resolution of all the games currently supporting Power Saver Mode is way too high for a portable device, usually 1440p if not even higher in some instances. This further reinforces how supporting Power Save Mode is mostly preparation work for the rumored handheld.</p>

            <p>Workers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">soon to be under new ownership</a> Electronic Arts are reportedly struggling with a push from management towards trying to use AI for "just about everything". That's according to a new report, which claims staff are concerned about the likes of code mistakes they'll then have to clean up and the tech being trained to replace them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The report from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> asserts that the publishers have been pushing their around 15,000 employees to use AI for almost all of the daily tasks. According to anonymous staff, that includes having managers use it to script chats with colleagues about sensitive topics like pay and promotions. You know, the sort of thing that definitely requires and is improved by spending time asking a bot to do words.</p>
<p>The report cites prompts advising managers about "how to talk to a direct report whose performance is negatively affecting business results but who believes otherwise" and "how to phrase constructive questions when a sought-after promotion is denied" as examples.</p>
<p>Staff are also reportedly being made to train the tech to do bits of their jobs, naturally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-boss-boasts-of-being-able-to-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-but-says-itll-never-replace-the-human-aspect">fuelling fears</a> that doing so will be a factor in whether staff in certain roles will be among the next round of layoffs. A former senior QA worker at Respawn told Business Insider that he believes AI being used to review and summarise feedback from play testers contriubuted to him ending up among 100 people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">laid off by EA this spring</a>.</p>
<p>AI tools such as a chatbot dubbed ReefGPT are also reportedly being used to produce code, leading staff to have to go back and fix flaws or errors in what the machine spits out.</p>
<p>EA declined to respond to Business Insider's request for comment, but did discuss their approach to AI in a US financial filing earlier this year. "The use of artificial intelligence might present social and ethical issues that, if not managed appropriately, may result in legal and reputational harm, cause consumers to lose confidence in our business and brands and negatively impact our financial and operating results," they wrote.</p><p>Meanwhile, CEO Andrew Wilson said AI is "not merely a buzzword for us", but "the very core of our business" in a speech to investors last year. That sort of setting is the kind of place you'd expect to hear the Generative AI dream being pushed most heavy-handedly, something arguably borne out by the fact Wilson's comment looked to lump it in with playing a FIFA match against a computer-controlled opponent the devs have programmed.</p>

		<p><em>And Roger </em>opens as a horror game and concludes with transporting the player into a puddle of tears. It’s one of the best games I played all year. </p><p>It’s also impossible to discuss it without spoiling it. So let’s start there.</p><p><em>And Roger i</em>s a story about the decline of a loved one. Not their death, but their dying. It’s about the fairy tale we tell ourselves about what it will be like to die of old age alongside someone, as if we’ll wake up one day and go “well, that’s enough” and flip a switch while we hold hands in bed.</p><p>Reality is usually much more cruel. <em>And Roger </em>does not shy away from the cruelty, nor the frailties and failings of caregivers for people who may be losing their grasp on reality.</p><p>Sometimes, the change is swift. A person is here, until suddenly they’re not. Other times, it happens over days, weeks, years. The transition is quiet, perhaps hard to notice. But it’s happening. And over time, you come to realize the person you know is no longer fully there.</p><figure><figcaption><span>And Roger frequently plays with perspectives, an advantage of video game storytelling. Credit: TearyHand Studio</span></figcaption></figure><p>All of this happens in the midst of a game whose design can be reasonably described as a mashup of a visual novel and, of all things, Nintendo’s eccentric mini-game-centric <em>Wario Ware</em> series.&nbsp;</p><p>“I wanted the players to take away or feel something from the simple controls provided,” said the designer behind <em>And Roger</em>, who goes by Yona, in a brief email interview with <em>Remap</em> recently.</p><p>The game Yona most credits as inspiration, though, is the wonderful game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102130/Florence/?ref=remapradio.com"><em><u>Florence</u></em></a> from 2020, which tells the story and the intimate ups and downs of a relationship. It’s one of my favorite games, too.</p><p>“I think it’s the most wonderful game I’ve ever played,” said Yona. “It taught me the value of storytelling through games.”</p><blockquote>“Expressing the religious aspect of myself is directly tied to my purpose for living. That’s why I have such a strong desire to communicate this message. At the same time, I understand that simply expressing my beliefs as-is won’t necessarily resonate with everyone.”</blockquote><p>Other vital touchstones were 2019’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/349270/Mosaic/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>Mosaic</em></a> (“It was the first time I met a game that felt like ‘art.’") and 2020’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1392820/Milk_inside_a_bag_of_milk_inside_a_bag_of_milk/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>Milk inside a bag of milk inside a bag of milk</em></a> (“It left a deep impression with its clever use of meta elements and how it crafted a simple yet profound experience.”)</p><p>Yona’s last game was the 2D story puzzler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2361610/In_His_Time/?curator_clanid=45640489&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><em><u>In His Time</u></em></a>. It‘s thematically similar to <em>And Roger</em>. One Steam commenter said they were “teary eyed towards the end” and that it told a story where “people are imperfect but this game is brilliant.”</p><p>“I feel that when gameplay becomes a substitute for words or when gameplay itself begins to ‘speak,’ that’s the key to narrative in games,” said Yona. “That’s why I kept text to a minimum and aimed to make the story compelling through interaction.”</p><p>You can see an example of how the game handles this in the clip below, where the player moves items across the screen to represent having a conversation or putting on a ring. Some interactions are very game-like, with ways to win or lose, while others are merely participatory.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://remapradio.com/content/media/2025/10/edit_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://remapradio.com/content/media/2025/10/edit_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>Part of Yona’s process was drawing out scenes in “manga-style panels” and sketching each gameplay concept “on paper, one by one.”</p><p>“The text sets the direction of the story, and the gameplay expands on and propels it forward,” said Yona. “I think it’s somewhat similar to how musical films alternate between cinematic scenes and music scenes.”</p><p>Storytelling—more “traditional” storytelling, anyway—has not come easy to video games. It was only after the medium established itself as something wholly unique, aspiring beyond a premise to addictively munch quarters, that stories became more important to video games as a whole. That was decades ago. </p><p>Even now, the question remains: How? (Answer: Insert a sad Dad.)</p><p>Games and stories have come a long way, and yet, it’s not hard to wonder sometimes, did this story have to be told here? Could it have been a movie? A book? Why did it have to be a game?</p><p>“This might be a disappointing answer, but to be honest, the reason I chose to tell a story through a game is simply because creating a game was the only tool I had,” said Yona.</p><p><em>And Roger </em>feels very personal. You’d naturally wonder if it pulled from personal experiences, because the encounters and emotions are so specific. But Yona said that while his “own upbringing and family experiences had an influence” that “most of the scenes in the game are not direct reflections of my own life.” Perhaps the intimacy of a video game, where you’re pulling the strings set out by the designer, make one feel more susceptible to believing it’s real.&nbsp;</p><p>One aspect of the game that <em>is</em> very real, however, is its religious tone. Yona is Christian. The game doesn’t feel oppressively religious, but it does conclude with an excerpt from the Bible:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. – 1 Corinthians 13:13”</em></p><p>In the moment, I went “huh, you don’t see that very often.” I’m used to killing God—or some kind of god—in video games. It’s rare that you see religion, Christianity or otherwise, used as theme.</p><p>“Expressing the religious aspect of myself is directly tied to my purpose for living,” said Yona. “That’s why I have such a strong desire to communicate this message. At the same time, I understand that simply expressing my beliefs as-is won’t necessarily resonate with everyone.”</p><p>At its core, <em>And Roger</em> about another, more universal form of faith: love. And a belief that love, whatever comes, can break through.</p><p>“What’s important, I think, is not that I present the message directly,” he continued, “but that I create an experience where the player can come to understand or see it themselves through their own personal experience. While I can’t control how players interpret it, I believe that’s something I should entrust to the power of God.”</p>
