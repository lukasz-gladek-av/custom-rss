			<p>A Portal 2 RTX Remix mod is now available for download, introducing path tracing to the amazing puzzle game released by Valve over ten years ago.</p>
<p>Portal 2 RTX Remix Compatibility mod, developed by xoxor4d, greatly enhances the game's visuals with path tracing and works surprisingly well despite RTX Remix not being intended to support the game. There are some issues here and there, as the game's effects are rendered using shaders, and performance isn't the best, which isn't surprising considering how demanding path tracing is even in older games, but this mod is a perfectly viable way to experience one of the best games ever released by Valve.</p>
<p>In case you want to check out this Portal 2 RTX Remix mod before downloading it from <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx">here</a>, you can check it out in action in the video below shared by gabdeg on YouTube.</p>

<p>Portal 2 is the second entry in the series developed by Valve. Released in 2011, the game takes everything that made the original amazing and ups it to eleven, introducing a new set of puzzles as well as a two-player cooperative mode featuring a story, test chambers, and characters completely different from the single-player campaign. You can learn more about the game by heading over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/">Steam store page.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> has given players plenty of content to dig their teeth into. Not only are there two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-saug-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapons</a> and a variety of cosmetic rewards to unlock in the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a> for the game, but there’s more planned to release throughout Black Ops 6 Season 1’s duration.</p>



<p>The Hit List event will arrive in BO6 Season 1, and if you’re interested in the details, such as its release date, rewards, and more, here’s everything we know so far.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-when-is-black-ops-6-hit-list-event">When is Black Ops 6 Hit List event?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-what-is-hit-list-event-in-bo6">What is Hit List event in BO6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-black-ops-6-hit-list-event-rewards">Black Ops 6 Hit List event rewards</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-when-is-black-ops-6-hit-list-event">When is Black Ops 6 Hit List event?</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Hit List event will arrive on <strong>November 21, 2024, at around 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT</strong>. </p>



<p>The event tab is now in the game with a countdown to its release, so this is how we know exactly when the limited-time event will be arriving.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-hit-list-event-in-bo6">What is Hit List event in BO6?</h2>



<p>Hit List is a <strong>limited-time event</strong> coming to Black Ops 6 during Season 1 and it <strong>offers players a chance to earn rewards via in-game challenges</strong>. </p>



<p>We don’t yet know what these challenges are, but the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Citadelle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> revealed that the event will give players a “board of contracts” that they will need to take out. Taking out these hit list contracts in-game will grant players exclusive rewards. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-hit-list-event-rewards">Black Ops 6 Hit List event rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Call of Duty are yet to reveal the official rewards, but based on the promotional image for the Black Ops 6 Hit List event, we can assume that players will be working towards earning the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shadow Perk (Strategist)</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-sirin-9mm-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirin 9mm</a> Secondary</li>



<li>Power Drill Melee Weapon</li>



<li>CoD Points</li>
</ul>



<p>It seems players will be able to get the new weapons through this event, as well as the new Shadow Perk, which makes you undetectable by enemy traps and mines.</p>



<p>We expect more on top of this, but these are some of the rewards seen in the promotional image for the Hit List event. Previous Call of Duty events have also had cosmetic rewards like Calling Cards, Emblems, and more, so perhaps those will be up for grabs too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-players-react-to-developer-starbreeze-saying-it-will-make-a-significantly-lower-level-of-investment-in-year-2-content<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a> developer Starbreeze has sparked backlash after confirming plans to make a “significantly lower level of investment” in the game’s second year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starbreeze’s struggle with Payday 3 after last year’s disastrous launch is well-documented, but its recent series of year one anniversary updates were well-received by players who had hoped for similarly significant updates during the co-op shooter's second year. Indeed, Payday 3’s recent Steam user reviews are on ‘mostly positive’, with all reviews on ‘mixed.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, that goodwill may now be under threat after comments from Starbreeze acting CEO Mats Juhl in a <a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial report</a> caused some Payday 3 players to express concern that the studio was now prioritizing its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-announces-dungeons-dragons-co-op-multiplayer-game">Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a> instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The backlash revolves around Juhl’s comment on Payday 3’s level of investment for year two versus year one. It is below, reproduced in its entirety.</p><blockquote>During the quarter, both the third and fourth DLCs for Payday 3 – “Chapter 3: Houston Breakout” and “Chapter 4: Fear &amp; Greed” were released. In conjunction with both launches, a lot of free content was also released to all players, including a new free heist. Both DLCs received a very positive reception from the player base and the game's rating on Steam, among others, has taken significant steps upwards. The game's MAU (monthly active players) is holding steady considering that we in September left Xbox GamePass. The level of investment during Payday 3's first year on the market, both through launched DLCs and "Operation Medic Bag", has been at an elevated level. Ahead of year two, we are confident in being able to continue delivering amounts of value to our players with a significantly lower level of investment.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That last line (“significantly lower level of investment”) is the one causing all the damage here, and players are blaming it on Starbreeze shifting focus onto Project Baxter, its in-development Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. Elsewhere in the financial report, Juhl said production on Project Baxter had ramped up (along with the payment of licensing fees to Wizards of the Coast), and that as Payday 3’s game-saving Operation Medic Bag updates ramp down, the game will enter year two “with a smaller team focused on continuously updating the game with new content.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disgruntled players have taken to Steam reviews to let their feelings about this be known. “Dead game,” reads one negative review, “like this time for real.” “Dropping this game as soon as it started to show promise is insane,” said another. “Significantly lower,” another review reads. "I've tried defending this game for so long, but it is really frustrating seeing the company executives kill this game before it has a chance to fully recover just to fund their next project that will more than likely flop, just like Payday 3," another reviewer said. "Save your money and the headache; Payday 3's future is genuinely grim."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar outcry over on the Payday subreddit, where fans are already hitting out at Starbreeze and Project Baxter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, Starbreeze sounds like it still believes in Payday 3, even if some of its players do not. “Starbreeze remains financially strong, with a healthy balance sheet almost free of debt and a cash position to execute our strategy,” Juhl said. “Sales of Payday 3 still have great potential to improve, which is offset somewhat by continued relatively stable sales of Payday 2 and third-party publishing of, among other things, Roboquest. During the same period last year, we booked the revenue attributable to Payday 3's launch, which makes the revenue in the comparison period uniquely high.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Payday 2, significantly more people are playing that game on Steam (27,553 24 hour peak) than Payday 3 (1,314 24 hour peak), despite the former being over a decade old. In September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-director-steps-down-after-disastrous-first-year">Payday 3 director Miodrag Kovačević stepped down to work as a designer instead</a>. Lead producer Andreas Penninger and global brand director Almir Listo were put in place to act as the "creative force" behind the game "in the interim."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starbreeze is still hiring for Project Baxter, meanwhile, as work on the game “continues at full speed.” “Internally, we have weekly playtests of Baxter, and active discussions with a number of industry-leading players regarding potential collaborations around Baxter's development and launch,” Juhl said. Starbreeze said it has 191 total employees, most of which are based at its head office in Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>If you want to expand your Lego collection with some more Horizon-themed pieces, you are in luck.</p>
<p>Following on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-forbidden-west-tallneck-lego-revealed">the majestic Tallneck model</a>, Lego and Guerrilla are once again joining forces and releasing a set inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-teases-new-horizon-themed-set-on-the-way">teased last week</a>, this set is known as Aloy and Varl vs. Shell-Walker and Sawtooth, and it comprises much of what you would expect given the name.

<p>Consisting of 768 pieces, this set features Horizon's leading lady Aloy and her trusty pal Varl taking on bricky renditions of a Shell-Walker and a Sawtooth. Aloy has her bow and Varl has his spear, with options to switch bits up to allow for fire, shock or chill 'attacks'.</p><p>As for those hostile machines, both have joints which allow for different poses. The Shell-Walker has posable legs and arms, as well as opening claws. This chap also has a detachable cargo pod and energy shield. The Sawtooth, meanwhile, has jaws which open for a good bite, as well as a swivelling torso along with a posable neck, head and legs.</p>
<p>To give you a sense of scale, Lego said the Sawtooth measures over seven inches high. </p>

<p>"We're delighted to bring one of gaming's most beloved franchises to life in both physical and digital Lego brick form," said Kate Bryant, Product Lead, Branded Games at the Lego Group, reflecting on both this set and Lego Horizon Adventures itself. "We hope this latest set continues to fulfil our commitment to seamless play and empowers our fans to expand on their favourite games in their own, unique way."</p><p>"Lego  Horizon Adventures has brought Aloy and the acclaimed Horizon universe to a new audience and we've been very pleased with the title's launch," added Guerrilla art director Roy Postma. "This new set adds to that momentum by enabling players to build on the excitement of the adventures they experience in the game in true Lego fashion."</p>
<p>Those interested in purchasing the Aloy and Varl vs. Shell-Walker and Sawtooth set are able to pre-order it now <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/aloy-varl-vs-shell-walker-sawtooth-77037">via Lego</a>. It will be available on shelves from 1st March, next year, retailing at £39.99.</p>

<p>As for Lego Horizon Adventures the video game, we recently awarded it two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>. "I still don't know why it exists or who it's for, and there's little evidence to suggest that Guerrilla or Gobo know the answer either."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Despite being one of the games released this year, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is selling below CAPCOM's expectations, due to lacking marketing, among other reasons.</p>
<p>As reported by Japanese outlet <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/396057" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamebiz</a>, the publisher revealed in a Q&amp;A session held at the end of the second quarter financial results briefing that the game failed to reach the planned sales despite widespread acclaim from critics and players. According to CAPCOM, one of the reasons Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is not selling as expected is lacking marketing, which did not raise enough awareness of the game. As such, the Japanese publisher plans to continue promoting the game to make it achieve its sales target.</p>
<p>While Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess hasn't done well, the other titles CAPCOM released during the second quarter of the current fiscal year are doing much better. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-coming-back-to-life/">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> is selling as planned, with plans to continue promotion to support the sales of the retail release coming this month. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-review-taking-you-for-a-ride/">MARVEL vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a> and Ace Attorney Investigations Collection are also selling as planned.</p>
<p>It is a massive shame that Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is not selling as well as CAPCOM expected, as it's a very solid game that deserves to be experienced by more players.

<p>This weekend, the VCT Game Changers Championship unravelled in Berlin, with ten of the greatest teams in the VALORANT space battling it out for the lion’s share of a $500,000 prize pool. By the time the dust had settled, Shopify Rebellion stood victorious, claiming the trophy without dropping a single map in an epic upper-bracket run.</p>



<p>The team proved to be an unstoppable force, effortlessly walking through all comers to secure the $180,000 grand prize and beating MIBR GC in the grand final.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-epic-win">Epic Win</h2>



<p>This is Shopify Rebellion’s second VCT Game Changers Championship win in as many years. Last year, the team showed up strong in Sao Paolo, beating Team Liquid in the grand final and taking home one of the biggest prizes in VALORANT esports. The year before that, during the inaugural event, SR managed to pick up a second-place finish.</p>



<p>Now that SR has secured back-to-back championship wins, nobody can doubt that the organisation is a contender for the title of the best team in the Game Changers space. Only G2 Gozen comes close, but the European team finished in third place this time around.</p>



<p>According to Esports Charts, this year’s Game Changers Championship set a new viewership record, pulling in a peak concurrent viewer count of just over 460,000 users. By comparison, last year’s event secured just 293,000 peak viewers. </p>



<p>To put that into perspective, Rainbow Six Siege’s BLAST R6 Major Montreal took place this weekend, and viewership for that event peaked at around 169,000 viewers – and this is one of Rainbow Six’s best years on record.</p>



<p>Since being introduced not too long after VALORANT was released, the Game Changers tournament space has grown immeasurably. It’s arguably the finest representation of a female-led esports ecosystem in the industry, and it’s continuing to expand.</p>

<p>The BLAST R6 Major Montreal has wrapped, and at the end of all things sat a redemption story for Brazil’s w7m Esports. The team went up against BDS in the grand final in Canada, mere weeks after the EU side eliminated w7m at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh in the final series.</p>



<p>Fortunately, as the match unravelled, w7m Esports found immense traction against Team BDS, losing the first map but closing out the next three back-to-back-to-back without much fuss.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-brazil-wins-big">Brazil Wins Big</h2>



<p>It has been a mixy year for w7m Esports. In February, the organisation won the Six Invitational in Sao Paolo then promptly dropped the entire roster before starting over again. In August, the team finished in second place at the Esports World Cup but still managed to net a $350,000 prize after being knocked out at the final post by Team BDS.</p>



<p>This latest win was a revenge story for w7m Esports, but it also marked the third BLAST R6 Major in just over a year that the organisation has won. In May 2023, the org won in Copenhagen, and in November 2023, the BLAST R6 Major Atlanta was ripe for the taking for the Brazilian squad.</p>



<p>This weekend, the BLAST R6 Major in Montreal played out as most people predicted. Team BDS came hard and knocked out Team Secret and FaZe Clan to make it into the grand final, while w7m swept Spacestation and beat Virtus.pro to quality for the title shot.</p>



<p>The last match in the tournament was an intense one.</p>



<p>As the series opened on Consulate, Team BDS pushed for an early win, but w7m immediately fired back on Nighthaven with a retaliatory point. From there, it was effortless for the Brazilian squad, as the following two matches on Clubhouse and Kafe were tidied up without too much resistance.</p>



<p>The stunning set pieces put out by w7m’s DoDez earned him MVP of the grand final.</p>



<p>That marks the end of the 2024 competitive schedule for Rainbow Six Siege – what’s next is the Six Invitational 2025, which will be held in Boston in February.</p>

            <p>
Roblox has today announced further tools designed to improve the safety of its young audience, including the ability for parents to remotely manage their child's account, view their child's friends list and limit the amount of time made available to play.
</p>
<p>
In the coming months, further changes will be made to stop children under 13 from directly messaging others outside of games, and limit interactions within games to public messages only. Starting today, Roblox is also simplifying its content labels and limiting the games and experiences children under nine can see on the platform by default.
</p>
<p>
Today's announcements mark yet a third set of changes detailed by Roblox in the past month. Previously-announced policy tweaks were revealed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">now require parental access to be given for children to access some in-game chat features</a>. This was followed by the announcement of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-banning-social-hangouts-for-kids-under-13-due-to-user-behaviour-that-can-potentially-pose-a-risk">ban on social hangout experiences for kids under 13</a> due to "user behaviour that can potentially pose a risk". 
</p>
<p>
Roblox has long been criticised for not doing enough to ensure the safety of its enormous audience, the majority of which are kids. This summer, a Bloomberg report revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">Roblox itself had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation in 2023</a>, and that more than two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors following contact in-game.</p><p>All of the above announced changes by Roblox follow the publication of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">damning report last month</a> that again highlighted examples of inappropriate - and allegedly, illegal - content being shared on the platform, and that also claimed Roblox had not been transparent around its user activity metrics (a claim Roblox said it "rejected").
</p>
<p>
Despite the recent flurry of changes, Roblox says today's announcements were decided upon and would be implemented following "multiple rounds of internal research, including interviews, usability studies, international surveys with parents and children, and consultation with experts from child safety and media literacy organisations". 
</p>
<p>
A Roblox spokesperson claimed these updates, announced today, had already been "praised by partners, including the National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE) and the Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI)".
</p>
<p>
"We've spent nearly two decades building strong safety systems, but we know there's always more to be done," Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman said in a statement. "Last quarter saw a record average for daily active users on Roblox - over 88 million - and as our platform has grown in scale, we have always recognised that our approach to safety must evolve with it. Today's launch represents the next stage in that evolution."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-hit-dress-to-impress-removes-hotdog-outfit-after-players-use-it-to-dress-up-like-male-genitalia">Roblox hit Dress To Impress removed a hotdog outfit</a> after players used it to dress up like male genitalia.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-dark-souls-3-remaster-is-currently-in-the-works-%E2%80%93-rumor.1038252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-remaster/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Dark Souls 3 remaster is apparently in the works, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the XboxEra podcast, Nick "Shpeshal_Nick" Baker revealed that a remaster of the third entry in the series developed by FromSoftware is in the works. Sadly, the leaker confirmed that he knows more about this project but cannot say more at the time, so we have no idea who's developing it and how it will improve the original game, which, in my opinion, has aged rather well and is most definitely not in dire need of a remaster, especially since both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S run the original release quite well.</p>
<p><iframe title="South of Midnight looks great &amp; Phil Spencer talks Xbox's Future | The XboxEra Podcast | Episode 237" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mmo392kpNoA?start=14901&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Although Dark Souls 3 doesn't need to be remastered that badly, a remaster makes sense, considering the first two entries in the series got <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dark-souls-remastered-revisiting-lordran/">remastered</a> after their original release. Besides obvious image quality improvements and a potential release on the Nintendo Switch successor, it will be interesting to see in what other ways the game will be improved if this remaster is really in the works. Shpeshal_Nick has a decent track record, but we should still take this with a grain of salt until an official confirmation is made.</p>
<p>The original Dark Souls 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dark-souls-iii-review/">review.</a></p>

			<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, you will often need items to travel to new places and continue your adventure. One of these items is when you will need to get to Portoga to obtain a ship and become able to explore other continents on the map.</p>
<p>Due to the increasing number of monsters threatening the peace of the world, the kingdom of Romaria sealed the access to Portoga, which can only be opened with the magic key hidden inside the Pyramid in the desert. This dangerous location, filled with traps, can be found in the northern part of the desert, where Ibis is located.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241118122643_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Navigating the Pyramid in <a href="https://dragonquest.square-enix-games.com/games/en-us/dragon-quest-123-hd2d-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> is considerably easier than in other versions of the game, as you can use the map to pick the right path straight away, although you have plenty of reasons to explore since there's plenty of treasure to find including gold and a few useful items. Just make sure to avoid any decorated tile to not fall into the Pyramid's last level where you cannot use magic, which can be a problem if you rely primarily on it in battle.</p>
<p>After making your way through the Pyramid, you will find a locked stone door and four switches located inside some side chambers. To open the door, you will have to press the correct buttons according to a rhyme told by some children found in Isis Castle. The children can be found in the room to the right of the throne room on the castle's second floor. In case you want to know the solution to this puzzle straight away, you will have to press the switches to the "eastest of the East" and the "westest of the West", so, going from the left to the right, you will have to press switch 4 and 1 to open the door.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>



<p>Before entering the final room of the Pyramid, prepare for a challenging boss fight. Restore your HP and MP as much as you can, or return to town in case you are out of items, as this is a battle you don't want to take lightly.</p>

Beginning Monday, users younger than 13 won’t be able to DM players outside of games or experiences on Roblox. And they’ll need parental permission to be able to send in-game DMs — though this change won’t be fully implemented across the platform until the first quarter of 2025.</p><p>The changes follow recent reports highlighting instances of Roblox failing to protect children. A big article <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined">from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> described how predators on the platform use chat to communicate with kids. And a report from Hindenburg Research described Roblox as “an X-rated pedophile hellscape.” These new restrictions on chat will build on Roblox’s <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313120-Safety-Features-Chat-Privacy-Filtering">automatic chat filters</a> intended to block users from sharing personal information.</p><p>In addition to the changes to chat, Roblox is rolling out its previously-announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">accounts for parents and caregivers</a> that will let them remotely manage things like a child’s screen time limits. Previously, parents had to have physical access to their child’s account to set parental controls.</p><p>Roblox is also starting to use content labels to describe experiences instead of rating experiences for specific age groups. That means, for example, a “moderate” experience may contain things like moderate fear or crude humor. Users under the age of 9 will only be able to access experiences with “minimal” or “mild” content labels unless a parent gives permission. And Roblox will stop users under 13 from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289837/roblox-banning-preteens-social-hangout-spaces">accessing social hangout experiences</a> and experiences with free-form writing or drawing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A senator for the US government has urged Valve to answer complaints about the amount of racist, sexist and otherwise hateful posts and imagery shared by users on Steam. The digital store was the subject of a report by the Anti-Defamation League last week, which claimed to find millions of examples of "hateful or extremist" language and images hosted on Steam's community. These include things like Nazi symbols in profile pictures, white supremacist slogans in group names, and yet more discriminatory spew in user posts. The senator has noticed this report, and now writes directly to Gabe Newell, demanding that Valve "bring its content moderation practices in line with industry standards" or risk "intense scrutiny" from the government.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=958CB1AD-0C0D-4254-96B4-2C82494C0C5E">the letter</a>, Democrat senator Mark Warner argues that Valve's content moderation doesn't meet industry standards, and says he wants Valve to "crack down on the rampant proliferation of hate-based content".</p>
<p>The exact hateful stuff he's talking about was highlighted in that <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/millions-examples-extremist-and-antisemitic-content-found-steam-new">report by the Anti-Defamation League</a> last week. Its many findings include swastikas in profile pictures, antisemitic images such as the <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/hate-symbol/happy-merchant">"happy merchant"</a>, and instances of Pepe the frog, a meme appropriated by the far right that - let's be honest - has never washed the stink off. Steam is "inundated with hate" as a result of these findings, say the anti-discrimination group. 

</p><p>While the simmering bubbles of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">fascism</a> won't be news to the average Steam user (or average internet user, to be frank) that doesn't mean we ought to get complacent about them. It's proof, says senator Warner, that Valve is lacking good moderation.</p><p>"Until now, Steam has largely not received its due attention as a de facto major social network where its users engage in many of the same activities expected of a social media platform,” said Warner. "It is reasonable to question how committed Valve is to effectively implement and enforce Valve’s own, self-created Conduct Policy for its users," said the senator.</p>
<p>It's true that Steam does have a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/online_conduct/">conduct policy</a> but (as the original report from the ADL notes) it's limited to things like unlawful behaviour, sexually explicit content, copyright violations, and threatening or abusive language. The ADL make clear their desires, saying they want Steam to adopt an explicit anti-extremist and anti-hate policy of some kind, and to enforce that policy properly.</p>
<p>"The wide breadth and sheer volume of hateful and antisemitic content on Steam is mind-boggling," said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. "Steam’s parent company, Valve, needs to make significant changes in terms of policy and practice to address this shocking proliferation of hate."</p>
<p>The searching for hateful content was done using help from an AI tool called "HateVision", which scanned the groups and user profiles on Steam for specific hatestuff, including "39 key potentially extremist and antisemitic symbols". The ADL has written up <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">a methodology for how the findings were compiled</a>, if you like to read that sort of thing. </p><p>Meanwhile, the senator's letter claims that the US Senate has previously complained about this back in 2022, but says that Valve didn't respond adequately back then. According to Warner, the games company has continued with "a ‘hands off’-type approach to content moderation that favors allowing some users to engage in sustained bouts of disturbing and violent rhetoric..."</p>
<p>"As Black Friday and the holiday buying season approaches, the American public should know that not only is Steam an unsafe place for teens and young adults to purchase and play online games, but also that, absent a change in Valve’s approach to user moderation and the type of behavior that it welcomes on its platform, Steam is playing a clear role in allowing harmful ideologies to spread and take root among the next generation," says Warner.</p>
<p>His letter also includes a set of questions designed to hold Valve's feet to the fire about all this. He asks how many human content moderators work on the Steam community, for example. He also asks how many complaints Valve have received over the last ten years which fall under a breach of the conduct policy. And what the company intends to do over the next year to improve their moderation. He wants an answer by December 13th.</p>

<p>An actor’s resume has revealed that Back 4 Blood 2 by Turtle Rock Studios could be in active development.</p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-back-4-blood-2-in-development-with-codename-gobi-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mp1st</a>, the information was spotted on the <a href="https://www.istunt.com/jesse-hutch-4776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">resume of actor Jesse Hutch</a>, who lists ‘Gobi 2’ as a part of his motion capture performances. Gobi was the codename for the original Back 4 Blood, so it doesn’t take a genius to assume that a sequel under the name ‘Gobi 2’ could also be in development.</p>



<p>As spotted by mp1st, back4blood2.com was also registered by the developers in May 2023, suggesting that the company could be lining up for an announcement at some point.</p>



<p>In February 2023, the developers announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/back-4-blood-shelved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Back 4 Blood would cease further development</a> and post-launch content.</p>



<p>In the statement that was&nbsp;<a href="https://turtlerockstudios.com/news/b4b-2223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on the studio’s website</a>, the future of the firm was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Turtle Rock Studios is actually pretty small for a studio making AAA games. We don’t have quite enough folks to continue working on Back 4 Blood content while we spin up another game – yes, another game! Given this, it’s time for us to put our heads down, get back in the lab, and get to work on the next big thing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Turtle Rock Studios is the developer behind the game. Seven developers worked on the demo that would become Left 4 Dead. Back 4 Blood was announced in March 2019 and later revealed during The Game Awards in 2020. </p>



<p><span>Back 4 Blood w</span>as first released in October 2021 for&nbsp;PlayStation 4,&nbsp;PlayStation 5,&nbsp;Windows,&nbsp;Xbox One, and&nbsp;Xbox Series X/S. The game received mixed reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic, but in February 2022, Warner Bros. announced that the game had over 10 million players and was one of the fastest-selling original IPs in 2021.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>'s next events have been revealed following recent datamines.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gtp27i/new_event_is_coming_venusaur_pok%C3%A9mon_tcg_pocket/">leaked</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1goefhy/bulbasaur_magnemite_event/">reddit</a> (and reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-datamine-reveals-december-events/">The Gamer</a>), the next round of events due in December will include new battle, emblem, and Wonder Pick events.</p>
<p>And it looks like gen one starter Bulbasaur and its evolutions will be the focus.</p>
<figure>

<p>Currently, players can battle four Lapras ex decks for various rewards, including a special Lapras ex card.</p>
<p>It appears December will have a similar event but with players facing Bulbasaur, Ivysaur and Venusaur.</p>
<p>The rewards are as follows:</p>
<table data-mobile-mode="scroll">
<tbody><tr>
<th></th>
<th>First Clear Rewards</th>
<th>Drop Rewards</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ivysaur Deck</td>
<td>2 Pack Hourglass, 50 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket, 25 XP</td>
<td>Promo Pack A Series 2, 25 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket (39 percent chance)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Venusaur &amp; Scyther Deck</td>
<td>4 Pack Hourglass, 100 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket, 50 XP</td>
<td>Promo Pack A Series 2, 25 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket (39 percent chance)</td>

<tr>

<td>6 Pack Hourglass, 150 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket, 75 XP</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Venusaur ex &amp; Lilligant Deck</td>
<td>8 Pack Hourglass, 200 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket, 100 XP</td>
<td>Promo Pack A Series 2, 25 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket (39 percent chance)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The Wonder Pick event, meanwhile, will begin on 6th December and focus on both Bulbasaur and Magnemite - much like the current Meowth and Chansey event.</p>
<p>The third event will be another Genetic Apex Emblem Event and while the rewards were not part of the datamine, it seems likely more emblems will be awarded for players to display on their profiles. Considering the other events, my money's on Bulbasaur making another appearance.</p>
<p>More new items - coins, icons, backdrops, and sleeves - will also be added to the shop.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-new-booster-packs-available-before-end-of-year">The Pokémon Company revealed last week</a> that new booster packs will be added to the mobile game "by the end of the year", though it's unknown who the cover stars will be.</p>
<p>Trading will also begin in January 2025, though only with certain cards.</p>
<p>The card collecting and battling game has already proven incredibly popular, reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">earning $12m in its first four days</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It seems like Turtle Rock Studios may be working on Back 4 Blood 2. The rumor comes from MP1st, which spotted a project titled Gobi 2 under the resume of actor Jesse Hutch (who previously performed motion capture for JD Fenix in Gears of War 4). Gobi was the codename for the first Back 4 Blood, apparently named after the studio's mascot pet, a bearded dragon that has now passed away. A website for Back 4 Blood 2 was also registered last year.</p>
<p>Developer Turtle Rock <a href="https://wccftech.com/back-4-blood-no-new-content-turtle-rock-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it would move from the first installment in February 2023. Although its post-launch support only lasted a little over a year, the game seems to have <a href="https://wccftech.com/gotham-knights-and-back-4-blood-may-have-achieved-wb-games-sales-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achieved</a> the sales goals set by publisher Warner Bros. Games, making the likelihood of a sequel fairly high.</p>
<p>A spiritual successor to Turtle Rock's Left 4 Dead, Back 4 Blood launched on October 12, 2021. The game earned an 8 out of 10 score on Wccftech; here's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/back-4-blood-dont-alert-horde/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> summary from Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Back 4 Blood isn't Left 4 Dead, and it doesn't even try to be it, doing away with the classics' straightforward campaign in favor of a more modern experience that rewards progression and offers plenty of replayability. The excellent map and mission design, the huge variety of builds made possible by the card system, and satisfying gameplay make the game by Turtle Rock Studios the one to get for those who have a team of friends ready to take on hordes of undead, but those who are looking to play the game solo would do better to look elsewhere, as Back 4 Blood doesn't offer much for those not too keen on teamwork.</em></p>

<p>"Good grief, what fun," we wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rollerdrome-review-roll7-delivers-a-game-of-impossible-style">Eurogamer's Rollerdrome review</a> back in 2022, slapping it with a rare Essential badge. "Few games sing for you like this. Few systems compliment and combine so elegantly and relentlessly, with such small and simple moments of care for everything in it, from the little blipping noises for reloading and picking up health (straight out of Grand Theft Auto - Rollerdrome's full of ultimate video game sounds) to the booming pistols of Lara Croft. And no game has ever been so cool."</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a>, on the other hand, secured a recommended, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/conan-exiles-review-a-handsomely-sculpted-survival-game">Eurogamer's review</a> saying: "If Ark and Rust are the flaccid alpha males of survival gaming, Conan is the cocksure challenger angling for an advantage".</p>

            <p>
BioWare had the look of its excellent RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard nailed a decade ago, when early work first began right after Dragon Age Inquisition's launch. 
</p>
<p>
Artwork shared by BioWare veteran Matt Rhodes reveals a very familiar-looking Minrathous, capital of Tevinter and the location for The Veilguard's opening mission, created 10 years before The Veilguard finally arrived. 
</p>
<p>
It's fascinating to see this, as well as other early production art from Rhodes, and consider how much of what became The Veilguard was nailed down already - even before the launch of Inquisition's final expansion, Trespasser. Simultaneously, it's also a little unbelievable that fans still had so long to wait to finally play it!
</p>
<p>
"The first real piece of concept art I made for this project," Rhodes wrote, sharing artwork of Minrathous on social media. "We knew we were going to Tevinter, so this was the first attempt to flesh that out."

<p>
As described by Rhodes, the image shows: "a powerful magister being carried on a palanquin by her elven slaves, and scrappy adventurers trying to evade mage patrols and survive in an urban labyrinth".
</p>
<p>
Rhodes has been at BioWare for 20 years and served as art director on the Dragon Age franchise for the past six. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Rhodes showcased other Veilguard artwork created in 2014. There's some fascinating similarities to the final game here, including several images of Solas - and even one where he appears to be undertaking his ritual from Veilguard's opening.

The Veilguard finally launched last month, after a lengthy development which saw the project rebooted several times. At one point, the game would have included multiplayer elements. Ultimately, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-says-next-dragon-age-will-now-be-single-player-only-due-to-anthems-fortunes-reversing-eas-original-plans">these were dropped</a> - and the result is a single-player BioWare RPG that stands amongst the developer's best.
</p>
<p>
"A fantasy role-playing game of astonishing spectacle," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. "This is the best Dragon Age, and perhaps BioWare, has ever been."
</p>
<p>
It took a little while for me to find my groove, but the more of Dragon Age I play, the more I find myself enamoured with its vast world and wonderful characters. If you're playing, Eurogamer has a lengthy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard walkthrough, tips and tricks</a> to help with your playthrough - as well as a guide to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-how-to-get-the-best-ending-good">best Dragon Age: The Veilguard endings</a> when the time comes for you to finally step up and (hopefully) save the day.

Additionally, matches with a detected cheater will be automatically canceled with no impact on MMR. “These changes reflect Rainbow Six Siege’s ongoing commitment to player protection,” Ubisoft added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Related, Ubisoft has overhauled the Reputation Center to provide a clearer overview of how different actions affect player standing and thresholds for receiving warnings or penalties. Account-related information such as rank, reputation, and match replays will be concentrated in the new Career hub, with account stats coming soon, Ubisoft clarified.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Blackbeard now has an upgraded Adaptable Shield gadget, and the Siege Cup beta is available to all players above Clearance Level 50. Siege Cup is Siege’s most competitive playlist, where five-player squads compete in skill-based ladder tournaments for Competitive Coins that can be used to unlock exclusive skin collections every two weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, Season 4 makes changes to Ballistic Shields and balancing updates for Attacking Operators Ying and Sens. The number of bullets needed to suppress Shield Operators have been reduced to add value to suppressive fire and improve Shield Operator counterplay. This allows suppression to occur sooner and last for a longer duration, Ubisoft explained. Operators will not take damage from melee attacks while shielded, but guard break intensity from melee attacks will remain the same. Ying’s rush has been changed "to encourage more precise gameplay" in addition to Sens’ R.O.U. Projectors update "that allows for more flexible and creative play."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

It helps that Half-Life 2 also went ‘free to keep’ until today, November 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> launched on November 16, 2004, a year after Steam itself.

But we do know that at no point since September 2008 has Half-Life 2 been as popular on Steam as it is now. Half-Life 2's previous recorded best was 16,101 in August 2021 after a community event sparked a resurgence of interest.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The anniversary update means Half-Life 2 now includes the complete Episode One and Episode Two expansions along with the base game. They’re accessible from the main menu, and you automatically advance to the next expansion after completing each one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a new Developers Commentary for the Half-Life 2 base game, after Valve got the team back to record three-and-a-half hours of new behind-the-scenes commentary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most exciting is integrated Steam Workshop support, which lets players browse, install, and play user-created content for Half-Life 2 without ever leaving the game. Meanwhile, there are bug fixes and new graphics options that let players push the visual fidelity of Half-Life 2 further than was allowed in the original release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All these updates, the documentary and its associated headlines, and the ‘free to keep’ offer have combined to boost interest in all things Half-Life 2, and send thousands of players into City 17 to fight back against the Combine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, will Valve finally follow it up with Half-Life 3?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2024/11/lg-unveils-new-ultragear-oled-gaming-monitor-with-480hz-refresh-rate/">UltraGear 27GX790A</a> (or GX7 for short) is priced at $999.99 and is built around a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/3/24024042/lg-display-oled-480hz-oled-gaming-monitor">480Hz panel from LG Display</a> announced in early January with a 2560 x 1440 resolution and 0.03ms response time.</p><p>The base specs of the GX7 are on par with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253167/sony-inzone-gaming-monitor-m10s-480hz-oled">$1,100 InZone M10S that Sony released</a> in September.

            <p>Joining the rare but always brilliant category of “games that sound like someone scratched the high concept into their arm at pub closing time with the sharp corner of a Frazzles packet” is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/Assassinvisible">Assassinvisible</a> - a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game about an invisible assassin that’s so invisible the player doesn’t know where they are. True, games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/375750/Invisigun_Reloaded/">Invisigun</a> have experimented with this interesting concept before, but in Assassinvisible it's framed by another - the whole game exists as doodles in a bored student’s notebook. Here’s the Tres-tray:</p>

<p>This one’s going to be very quote-y, because I’m still trying to wrap my head around it myself. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207460/Assassinvisible/">Steam page</a> describes Assassinvisible thusly: “A cute bite-sized puzzle and stealth game that takes place in the margins of a bored pupil's notebook. You're an invisible assassin, sneak your way past the guards to reach your target and erase it!”</p>
<p>The idea, as far as I can tell, is that you’ll track your own movements through the hand-drawn puzzles one square at a time, trying to reach your target and take them out. Through the framing, you’ll also learn more about the student drawing you. Here are the features, which themselves feature the word ‘complexifying’:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hand-drawn levels (that the kid made, certainly not us) with ever complexifying, unique and interesting situations -absolutely no filler.</li>
<li>An original gameplay where the character is invisible for the enemies, but also for the players!</li>
<li>A touching story told through a pupil's notebook.</li>
<li>Your ultimate revenge for all those years spent being bored (and having fun) in class.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>It’s from French studio Zaatar Café, and it’s out on the 13th of December. Until then, the studio have a few smaller releases on Itch.io you can <a href="https://zaatarcafe.itch.io/">find here</a>. My favourite of these is ‘the elusive portal snake’, which Zaatar Café didn’t design, but recreated from memory after a previous mash up of Portal and Snake they played on Itch got deleted. Storied!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As per a recent update to their FAQ page, The Game Awards have confirmed that DLCs, new game seasons for live service games, and other such releases are eligible for their game of the year award.</p>
<p>The FAQ itself - which appears to have been accessible over the weekend but now links to a ‘coming soon’ page - says the following. Thanks <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/the-game-awards-will-now-consider-dlc-and-remasters-for-all-its-award-categories/">Neowin</a> for quoting it in its entirety:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p><strong>Are DLCs, expansion packs and remakes/ remasters eligible?</strong></p>
<p>The Game Awards aims to recognize the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content’s release. Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination. Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration.</p></blockquote>
<p>For this year, this means that releases like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">The Silent Hill 2</a> remake or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> would be eligible for the GOTY category. A win for either would mean the first time The Game Awards’ GOTY went to anything other than a full release. Previously, things like well loved expansions have factored into, for example, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> winning ‘Best Ongoing Game’ last year, no doubt in part to its excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty</a> DLC.<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake"> Resident Evil 4</a>’s remake was also nominated in the GOTY category last year.</p>

<p>Whether you feel this is an understandable decision given the quality of some expansions, or change that only further benefits a few obvious favourites at the expense of more interesting titles, I’ll leave that up to you. Whoever wins, I lose anyway: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a> will doubtless get no love. Plus, Alice Bell (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-dont-have-to-be-polite-about-the-game-awards-or-pretend-it-actually-cares">already summed up the Games Awards better than anybody</a>, imo. Hey ho! Reveals are nice at least! The nominees themselves are being announced later today at 9am PT/12pm ET/5pm GMT.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
