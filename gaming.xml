			<p>Last month, Wccftech was invited to join a small and exclusive number of outlets for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lead-architect-mark-cerny-unveils-codename-amethyst-ml-collaboration-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exclusive presentation</a> hosted by PS5 Pro Lead System Architect Mark Cerny. While the main topic was, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new console</a>, there was even an exciting announcement regarding a collaboration with AMD on a machine learning project called 'Codename Amethyst.'</p>
<p>Following the presentation, we had a one-on-one chat with the legendary programmer and game designer (in case you didn't know, he worked on the first Crash Bandicoot and Spyro installments, as well as the Jak &amp; Daxter franchise and, more recently, directed Knack and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/knack-2-demo-available-european-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>). Since this event took place ahead of the launch of the PlayStation 5 Pro, some of the topics discussed may have been revealed and/or confirmed by the publication of this article.</p>
<p>However, we also asked him a lot of future-facing questions, such as if PSSR would get a frame generation component, whether variable refresh rate on the console would be updated to support Low Framerate Compensation, and we also inquired about the feasibility of path tracing on PS5 Pro, among other things. Keep scrolling for the full transcription of our interview with Sony Interactive Entertainment's Mark Cerny.</p>

<p><strong>The main focus of your presentation was arguably PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), so let's kick off with that. You previously commented on when the PlayStation 5 Pro project started internally, but when did you begin working on PSSR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>We started on PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution at roughly the same time as we started on the hardware itself. Though, the neural network we are using today is something that we came up with, I believe, in late 2021.</p>
<p><strong>How has the development of the PlayStation 5 Pro hardware evolved over the past few years in tandem with PSSR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>The hardware definitely came first, because you can't know that your neural network is implementable unless you understand a bit about the hardware that it's going to be running on top of. So, simply put, in 2020 we did early hardware work. In 2021, we did more detailed hardware work and fully kicked off the PSSR project.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see PSSR evolving after the launch of the console?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>We're definitely going to continue our work in this space. There are so many ways that we can take that, though, right? We could continue to improve PSSR or start working on some of the other targets that I mentioned, like frame generation, frame extrapolation, ray tracing, denoising, and the like. I think it'll be interesting to see over the next few months what the full reaction from the development community is.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to maybe add a frame generation component to PSSR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Well, at the current moment, our focus is definitely on Super Resolution. I'm just saying that there are a number of other very attractive targets out there.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about Super Resolution, does it require per-game training as the first version of NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling, or is it more of a general model like DLSS 2.0 and later?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>It's generalized training.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about roughly how long it takes to implement PSSR compared to NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, or Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>It's almost a drop-in replacement for the other strategies. The difficulty is that game engines tend to evolve along with the Super Resolution or the upscaling strategy that they're using. So, if you're trying to add something in after the fact that the game was not developed with, then there's a bit of rejiggering of the game engine that may be needed. Much of the time I think the developers spent bringing it over was the logistics of where in their pipeline they're going to insert PSSR.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sony-PlayStation-5-Pro-_-AMD-SoC-_7.png"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Moving on from PSSR to the PlayStation 5 Pro hardware, the new SSD's size has obviously been greatly increased from the 768 GB of the PlayStation 5. Did the SSD's speed&nbsp;also improve in the PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>No, the speed of the SSD on PS5 Pro is the same as the speed of the SSD on PS5.</p>
<p><strong>OK. Did Sony ever consider expanding the RAM during the development of the PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Well, definitely more RAM is needed to implement those new features because PSSR needs a bit of RAM, and the ray tracing implementation definitely needs RAM. The question was just how much RAM is needed. We worked out that probably a gigabyte or so would be enough to support the big three that I was talking about.</p>
<p>We have GDDR 6, which is very fast memory—16 gigabytes of it. Then we added slow DDR5 RAM and started moving over to that from the fast RAM. That frees up fast RAM for the games, and that's the one or so GB I was talking about.</p>
<p><strong>I know that during Remote Play, the PlayStation 5 disables some of the video capture capabilities. Are those enabled on the PlayStation 5 Pro, or does it have the same limitations in this regard?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>The same limitations. There are many features that the gamer can use that require&nbsp;memory, and not all of them can be used simultaneously simply because there isn't enough memory on the system side. We want to get the bulk of the memory to the games, and the limitation set is the same on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Will Sony add Low Framerate Compensation or LFC to improve the Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) experience on PS5 and PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>There are ongoing discussions about where we should be taking VRR, and that's definitely part of those discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Another major advancement of the PlayStation 5 Pro is in the ray tracing capability. Will that enable the console to run full path tracing, like we see on PC with games like Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>One difficulty in answering your question is that there are so many strategies for doing ray tracing or path tracing. Just to give an example, the engine that drives Alan Wake 2 is very, very different from the engine that drives Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>There were talks on both of these at the Game Developers Conference that I went to. I really hesitate to say that PlayStation 5 Pro can or can't do path tracing, but you need to have a highly optimized strategy for doing it if you're going to do it on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Some PS5 Pro titles have implemented AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution Frame Generation. Have there been any complications with that running in tandem with PSSR?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>No, PSSR is Super Resolution, so whatever strategy a game has for frame generation should be completely orthogonal.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. This is something I was curious about. At the launch of PS5, there were some PlayStation 4 titles like Bloodborne and The Last Guardian that, throughout their life cycle, were patched to have a locked 30 frames per second mode. If you go back to the 1.0 version of the disk, they also feature an unlocked frame rate. Has Sony been in conversations to kind of revisit that to unlock those frame rates on the PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>I'm afraid I can't say anything about Bloodborne or that other title that you mentioned on PS5 Pro. Typically, the games on PS5 Pro are running in what we're calling Boost Mode. In this mode, we do give the game the entire GPU and faster memory to use, but whatever limitations it had are still there on the PS5 Pro version. So there's things that are definitely going to get better and things that will stay the same. I will say if your game has VRR, you should see substantially higher frame rates on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Will the PlayStation 5 Pro substantially boost PlayStation VR 2 games compared to the original console?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>PS VR 2 titles are definitely being boosted on PS5 Pro. There's a couple of different rendering strategies that VR titles take, depending on the strategy. PSSR is either something that works out of the box or something that needs a little bit more care and handling to be functional, and I think right now, we're at the point where we're getting pretty good uptake across the portfolio on PS VR2 for PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Forgive me if you have mentioned this before - is PSSR going to be a toggle in the system settings for players who may want to play the title as it was originally developed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>It's all whatever the developer would like to do. It's what they feel is best for their game. Some of the developers, like Naughty Dog, are offering the PS5 modes on PS5 Pro, so you can pick Performance Pro or you can pick the original Performance or Fidelity modes, but other developers decided that what is best is that you would have strictly Pro modes when playing their game on the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>

<p><strong>The big surprise of today's presentation was the Amethyst machine learning project with AMD. What are the first steps of that collaboration going to look like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Well, we've already started talking. Pretty much when PlayStation 5 Pro was wrapping up, we began discussions and development of those various aspects of Amethyst. To get more specific, I think we were getting pretty good momentum by the end of 2023. But as you know, it takes a phenomenally long amount of time to go from discussions and concepting to actually having a piece of hardware out in the marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>One thing you touched on during the presentation was the democratization and standard libraries between SIE and AMD, which would be developed in&nbsp;parallel. Can you talk about how that partnership is going to be built out?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Certainly. Well, for hardware first, really this is not about PlayStation proprietary hardware. We're looking to co-develop performant new AI architectures that can be used freely in any space that anybody chooses to use them, whether that is PC, console, or cloud.</p>
<p>For the software, if I look at it today, we have games that run on a TV and there's a certain set of developers that make them, and AMD for PC has games that run on PC monitors that have a somewhat overlapping set of developers that make games for them. There are different needs and different relationships there, so really what we're looking to do is to co-develop those network architectures and those training strategies that can then be freely used in both contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Another keyword from the presentation was discovering the holy grail of graphics through fully fused neural networks. What does that look like in your mind?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Ultimately, what you would see is really high quality libraries based on CNN's (convolutional neural networks) for game graphics. To me, that's a bit of a prerequisite. You need to have hardware that is capable of doing that.</p>
<p><strong>Game developers are using so many different engines to say the least, between Decima, Unreal, Frostbite, and many more. How does machine learning tie those together? Is there kind of a unified path for the architecture here, whether it's PSSR or the other features on the PS5 Pro, to kind of mold itself to the requirements of those different engines?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>I think we look out there globally, NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR are doing a pretty good job supporting a broad variety of game engines. So, yes, I believe that with sufficient care taken in meeting the needs of the individual game developers, it's definitely possible to create these broadly usable libraries,</p>
<p><strong>So much of the focus has been obviously on the graphics and the visual aspect of the new PS5 Pro console. Does it also feature any additional capabilities for the audio component or anything else in the hardware, though?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>Largely, the key improvements on the PS5 Pro are those big three. There are a few smaller features. The audio clock is a bit higher in case anybody wanted to use that. They can do a few more convolution reverbs; that is in there. Probably more significantly, you can run the CPU at a 10% higher frequency if you want to do so. By and large, though, the focus was on the big three key improvements.</p>
<p><strong>To wrap up our chat, is there one title that you feel is the standout centerpiece that shows players what the PS5 Pro can do at launch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny: </strong>There have been a number of pretty amazing titles on PlayStation 5 Pro, so I would really hate to pick one. I did personally enjoy seeing the eleven games we had at our hands-on event. On a personal note, that was really fun because I got to, in advance of that event, play and experience pretty much every game that was in development on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Wonderful. As always, thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of the PS5 Pro</a> last month, Sony invited Wccftech as part of a very select number of media outlets and analysts to get an early look at the console and a soon-to-be-released deep dive into the system architecture by none other than the Lead Architect of the console, Mark Cerny. The event also included an exclusive Q&amp;A with Mr. Cerny himself afterward, which you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Mark Cerny started off the presentation as a sort of ‘bits and bytes’ talk to principally focus on the GPU for the PlayStation 5 Pro and why it matters. As it’s been some seven years since the beginning of the PlayStation 5 journey, it’s been more than enough time for the technology advances to need that additional power to make the most of the console generation. With the PlayStation 5 already having been on the market for more than four years, Mark Cerny admitted that it’s taken time for game creators to get up to speed (unless you’re one of Sony’s first-party studios like Naughty Dog or Sony Santa Monica).</p>
<p>Much of the PS5 Pro presentation focused on what Mark Cerny called the Big Three: a larger GPU, advanced ray tracing features, and upscaling games through artificial intelligence and PlayStation Super Spectral Resolution, or PSSR.</p>
<p>The first focus was on the larger GPU present in the PlayStation 5 Pro which features a unique AMD architecture that Sony was branding as RDNA2.X. This was a hybrid variant of RDNA 2 while featuring both custom and future RDNA versions present in RDNA 3 and beyond. This is combined with a GPU that featured 66% more Work Group Processors, or WGP, compared to the graphics solution present in the existing PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Sony wanted to emphasize that they decided against fully upgrading the system architecture to RDNA 3 because they did not want to have two separate game packages or versions between the PlayStation 5's base and Pro models, not unlike Microsoft’s Xbox Series S and X solution.</p>
<p>Secondly, Sony made a point of refuting the 335 Teraflop number that was present in the lead-up to the PlayStation 5 Pro’s launch. Mark commented that it would have been a nice bonus to have twice the ‘flops,’ but it wouldn’t double the real-world performance and would have instead led to something he dubbed ‘Flopflation.’ He once again reiterated the increase from 18 WGPs (workgroup processors, or compute units) to 30 WGPs while also introducing 67% higher ‘flops’. In terms of real world gains, this meant upwards of a 45% improvement in performance.</p>
<p>One example given was how a frame taking 16 milliseconds to render on PlayStation 5 could instead be done in only 11 milliseconds on PlayStation 5 Pro, and those extra 5ms could instead be spent on adding ray tracing. These additional WGPs were primarily focused on ray calculations and the divergence associated. By improving the ease of use, Mark Cerny hoped that ray tracing would continue to be adopted at an increasing rate.</p>
<figure><figcaption>PS5 Pro's Big Three</figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, Sony made a point to touch on the machine learning or AI present in the PlayStation 5 Pro architecture. By utilizing ML, it’s possible to give games a graphical boost by having a game render fewer pixels and then using the PSSR neural network to fill in the gaps. This was bookended with the intent that this would not necessarily result in rendering a smaller resolution to begin with. By way of extrapolation and frame generation, the possibility exists to have PSSR insert frames between key frames and reduce the choppiness that’s commonly seen in games running at a reduced frame rate. This type of adjusted rendering would not necessarily be the be-all, end-all in terms of graphical processing. Sure, the possibility exists for developers to use the neural processing units to initially render a title at 540P or 720P, but ultimately, it comes down to the matrix math as Cerny called it and integer operations at play, namely the TOPS, or Trillions of integer Operations per Second. These TOPS are the real numbers that Sony wanted to focus on for rendering efficiency and the actual bandwidth of the PS5 Pro hardware.</p>
<p>Sony ended their presentation on the PlayStation 5 Pro deep dive by talking about the future potential for what the next PlayStation could achieve and also a unique collaboration with AMD that they’re calling Codename Amethyst. While much of the machine learning architecture on the PlayStation 5 Pro pushes the hardware to its limits, there is still a bottleneck at play in terms of system memory access. This is an opportunity for growth and perhaps to achieve a fully fused network with PSSR and the overall potential for growth with machine learning as a whole. Through the PlayStation 5 Pro, Mark Cerny and his team have developed a good understanding of what the current system architecture is capable of and what is to come in a future console.</p>
<p>While details are somewhat scarce compared to the rest of the PlayStation 5 Pro deep dive, Amethyst is the culmination of a unique collaboration with AMD to create a democratized library for machine learning, built upon multiple generations of RDNA and Sony Interactive Entertainment’s research and development. Mark Cerny likened the potential of this collaboration to developing a sort of neural network focused on graphics for gaming.</p>
<p>This is where future hardware architectures for both machine learning and AI would be integrated and allow developers to use these resources and perhaps guide the technology into unanticipated directions. Sony made a key point that this collaboration would be developed in parallel between the two companies, with developers having the ability to draw from libraries. Rather than this being some matter of proprietary technology solely for Sony, Amethyst is intended to bring broad machine learning across a variety of devices. It's definitely an intriguing initiative, though it's unclear when we'll see it bearing fruit in actual games.</p>

Whether he’s torching his own birthday cake with a flamethrower or dancing with himself through a field of lasers, it’s never easy to shake the sense that the movie was more focused on achieving GIF-able moments than telling any kind of coherent story.﻿<br></p></blockquote><p>In the end, Zilko’s assessment is that <em>Sonic 3</em> might be fun for young kids and diehard fans, but it can’t end soon enough for everyone else. He might be right. But as the perfect mark for a Sega nostalgia cash-in with Sonic-loving kids of his own, I’m ready to revel in the franchise brain rot no matter what. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And equipped with that knowledge, you <em>can </em>succeed in <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket </em>and even compete against the biggest whales in the game without spending money.,With that said, here’s what free-to-play players should expect out of their experience and how they can make the most of it.</p><figure id="" data-id="90fc8dd7e49fb28bb741ae79dcd6c74a" data-recommend-id="image://90fc8dd7e49fb28bb741ae79dcd6c74a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an incomplete collection in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows an incomplete collection in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="90fc8dd7e49fb28bb741ae79dcd6c74a" data-recommend-id="image://90fc8dd7e49fb28bb741ae79dcd6c74a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an incomplete collection in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h146253"><a id=""></a>Accept that you won’t get everything</h2><p>The first rule of every gacha game is to completely turn off any part of your brain that tells you you’re a completionist. While you do get free booster packs every day in <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, sheer economics will tell you that you won’t open enough booster packs to actually complete your card collection. After all, if you could get every card for free, what would you spend money on?</p><p>New cards will inevitably come out faster than you can collect them with the free resources the game provides. Naturally, this means you need to lower your expectations of what you should chase. Immersive three star cards have a paltry 0.222% chance of showing up in a pack. Crown rares only have a 0.040% chance! This doesn’t mean you’ll <em>never </em>get these cards, of course. It’s just that you shouldn’t necessarily choose which pack to open in hopes you’ll get a card that has a 1 in 2500 chance of appearing.</p><p>Instead, set your sight on cards that will help you win battles. This will help you get the most rewards during events, which will in turn help you collect even more cards. </p><h2 id="h146254"><a id=""></a>Chase cards that will help you build decks of each element</h2><p><em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em> doesn’t give you many options to chase down specific cards as of writing, but you can exert <em>some </em>control over which cards you can get. Right now, the three Genetic Apex card sets each contain distinct pools of cards. The fewer cards you own from a certain set, the greater the chance you’ll find a new card in your next pack.</p><p>As a free-to-play player, your first goal is to collect enough cards to build a competent deck of each element. You don’t need to make a <em>meta </em>deck of each element, mind you. Charizard EX and Moltres EX have great synergy, but if you played during the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pocket-tcg-mass-outbreak-fire-type-bonus-rare-1851706732&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pocket-tcg-mass-outbreak-fire-type-bonus-rare-1851706732">Fire Pokemon Mass Outbreak Event</a></span>, you already have a strong deck in Blaine, Ninetails, and Rapidash. Pick the packs you choose to pull strategically, with the goal of selecting packs that will most likely strengthen whichever elemental deck is weakest. For instance, if you can’t build a strong Dark deck, Genetic Apex Mewtwo has a strong core of Ekans, Grimer, Zubat, and Koffing evolution lines you can add to your collection.</p><figure id="" data-id="de7f9b869e45eb3d7f4ad24c090e6021" data-recommend-id="image://de7f9b869e45eb3d7f4ad24c090e6021" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a battle against the CPU in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket.

While online battling can feel intimidating at first, matches are mostly low-stakes in <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>, and there’s no way for your opponent to send you mean messages about how you’re a bad player for not using the mythical Dunsparce card. I typically stay far away from PvP modes myself, so I can assure you that online battling isn’t nearly as scary as it sounds.</p><p>Look at the cards you already have and figure out which deck you can realistically build that can win online battles. Sure, in the game’s current meta, cards like Mewtwo EX and Gardevoir rule the roost when used together. However, if you don’t have any copies of either card, you’ll need a lot of luck with your card pulls to make that deck work. However, if you already have, say, two Exeggutor EX cards, you might be close to putting together a strong Grass deck bolstered by the Erika trainer card. Maybe your deck won’t be “meta,” but at least you’ll have a solid foundation to work with as you continue to collect cards.</p><p>On the plus side, less popular decks can thrive online <em>because</em> they aren’t meta. After all, if everyone uses decks with Pikachu EXs, then most players will learn how to best counter them. However, if you roll up with a Marowak EX deck, you may leave your opponent scrambling to come up with a counterplay. Just remember that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195">success in <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em> battles often comes down to sheer luck</a></span>, so don’t feel like your deck is bad just because you’re struggling to win!</p><h2 id="h146256"><a id=""></a>Show up for the daily grind</h2><p>With solid decks to play the game under your belt, or at least enough cards to get your feet wet, it’s time to do what every free-to-play game devolves into: daily grinding. To the game’s credit, <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket </em>is light on this front. Your literal “daily missions” can be completed in about 10 minutes. That said, if you want to collect as many free resources as you can as you play, participate in the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Use your <strong>free booster packs</strong> when they become available.</li><li>Check your <strong>Wonder Picks</strong>, especially if your Wonder Stamina is almost full. Events may dish out free Wonder Picks throughout the day, so check in whenever you open the game.</li><li><strong>Participate in any ongoing single-player events</strong>, and don’t sit on a full Event Stamina bar. You can often repeat these battles to grind out bonus hourglasses and unique event cards.</li><li>Battle other players in Versus mode. <strong>You can get up to five shop tickets a day from players who press the “thanks” button after battle </strong>(make sure to return the favor and thank them too!). Remember, Shop Tickets can be used to buy Hourglasses, which means more cards.</li><li><strong>You can also give Shop Tickets to your friends by liking their Showcases</strong>. Thank all your friends and they might return the favor, as long as you’ve set up your own showcase!</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="fd1283c2be463c0d30fceee43b0d1469" data-recommend-id="image://fd1283c2be463c0d30fceee43b0d1469" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Pack Hourglass item in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Pack Hourglass item in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd1283c2be463c0d30fceee43b0d1469" data-recommend-id="image://fd1283c2be463c0d30fceee43b0d1469" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Pack Hourglass item in Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h146257"><a id=""></a>Stockpile your resources once you have enough</h2><p>Admittedly, stockpiling resources somewhat relies on assumptions, since there’s no way to predict the future in a live service game. While we know that some resources will eventually expire (such as Pack Points used to get a card of your choice), nothing indicates that hourglasses can’t be used for future expansions. So if you’ve collected all the cards you need to win battles and have fulfilled most of your collection-based missions, consider following the advice of your elders who grew up in a much better economy and start saving for the future.</p><p>At the end of the day, there’s no hard science to playing games like <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>. No one’s going to knock on your door and take your phone away because you didn’t manage your free-to-play account optimally. But when shiny new cards drop and players begin to rack up hundreds of dollars on their credit cards chasing them, you’ll be happy to have a handful of pulls in reserve so you can enjoy the new stuff too. You’ll never own as many cards as a hardcore spender does. But you can at least rest easy knowing that you worked for the cards you got..</p><p>Video games are meant to be fun, so hopefully using your resources to best fill out your collection will help you get the most out of <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>. And if you aren’t having fun… well, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinity-nikki-release-date-dress-up-rpg-ps5-register-1851699258&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinity-nikki-release-date-dress-up-rpg-ps5-register-1851699258"><em>Infinity Nikki</em></a></span> looks pretty good. </p><p><em>Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket </em>is available now for iOS and Android devices.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During a recent interview, CD Projekt Red revealed that Witcher 4 will have “more or less” the same map size and number of quests as The Witcher 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conversation with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiYBje1qeaA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Skill Up</a> podcast (via <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/521172/article/the-witcher-4-map-size-confirmed-to-be-similar-to-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>), CD Projekt RED VPs Sebastian Kalemba and Małgorzata Mitrega revealed new details about The Witcher 4’s map and quests. When asked whether they wanted to make the sequel larger in scale or more condensed than the previous title, the developers replied that the map is “more or less” similar in size to The Witcher 3, and the number of quests is “more or less the same,” too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the answer is not that simple. The developers revealed that The Witcher 4 will be a big game, and the team’s ambition with the title is “huge”. They want to “deliver a super compelling experience,” and they will prioritise quality over quantity. At the same time, they can promise that the game is “going to be pretty big.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, the developers also stated that The Witcher 4 will take place a few years after the events of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. With the sequel, they aim to create an inviting experience for newcomers while fulfilling the existing community’s expectations. Hence, they have asked the fans to trust the process, as they are trying to build a universal experience.</p>



<p>In other news, Geralt will be in The Witcher 4, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/geralt-witcher-4-nobody-say-how/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but nobody is allowed to say how</a>. Also, here is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-the-witcher-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything we know about the upcoming title</a>, including platforms, characters and more.

It started during a pandemic and resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-shortages-2021-microsoft-continue"><u>supply chain issues</u></a> that made the Xbox Series X hard to get for months, the potential-killer-app launch title (Halo Infinite) suffered an embarrassing but much needed yearlong <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-delayed-to-2021-for-xbox-series-x-pc-xbox-one"><u>delay</u></a>, Microsoft tried to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-activision-blizzard-buy-acquisition-acquired"><u>buy Activision-Blizzard for SIXTY-NINE BILLION DOLLARS</u></a> only to see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-verdict-has-been-reached-in-the-microsoft-vs-ftc-trial"><u>regulatory agencies</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-calls-cma-decision-disappointing-disputes-cloud-gaming-reasoning"><u>around the world</u></a> challenge it before the deal ultimately <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout-imminent-after-stock-halted-and-uk-clears-deal"><u>went through</u></a>, the company shipped one bona fide <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2021"><u>Game of the Year</u></a> (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-review"><u>Forza Horizon 5</u></a>) and also started <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-vision-of-the-future"><u>publishing its first-party games on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch</u></a>, and Xbox boss Phil Spencer even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-release-an-xbox-handheld-but-its-years-away"><u>confirmed</u></a> that a handheld Xbox is in the works, even if we might not see it during this hardware generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, outside of a kickass 2021 that saw the release of the aforementioned Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5 along with Psychonauts 2, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and Tunic, Xbox players have been waiting (and waiting) for a steady flow of first-party games. And it was looking a bit bleak this year – <em>again </em>– with Avowed getting pushed to February 2025 and the potential-packed pixel-art indie action-adventure exclusive Replaced slipping out of 2024. But Microsoft turned in all its homework right as the bell rang at the end of class, with STALKER 2, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle all landing in the final six weeks of the year – and all three getting A’s on the assignment. Let’s discuss the honorable mentions, runners-up, and Best Xbox Game of 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Xbox Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dungeons-of-hinterberg">Dungeons of Hinterberg</a> both just missed making the top of our list but are very worthy of honorable mentions. The psychologically focused sequel to Hellblade was the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/13/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-announced-for-xbox-series-x"><u>first-ever officially announced Xbox Series X game</u></a>, and when it finally shipped this year, it can lay claim to at least one title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review"><u>best-looking Xbox game ever made</u></a>. Ninja Theory’s Unreal Engine 5-powered narrative-driven adventure is a technical showpiece, a powerhouse of pixels that leverages all 10.2 teraflops of power that the Series X is packing. It’s a bit light in the gameplay department – more akin to a walking simulator than a proper action-adventure – but it is nevertheless beautifully acted and stunningly presented. It’s very much worth taking the time to go on this journey with Senua.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Dungeons of Hinterberg’s hooky concept – a European town becomes a hotspot for visitors to come and make friends and drink beers at night after a long day of monster slaying in the dungeons below – translates into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-of-hinterberg-the-final-preview"><u>a super enjoyable mix</u></a> of action-RPG and social sim gameplay. Its comic book-style visuals only enhanced the entire experience. This was a refreshing summer release in a season where we typically complain about the lack of interesting new games to play. But this year’s virtual summer trip to Europe to crush a bunch of monsters and collect loot while chatting with the locals about it at the pub afterwards proved to be just the kind of vacation we needed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/codblops6-1725926226920-1734501135279.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It may not be an Xbox exclusive, but Microsoft owns Call of Duty now, and the biggest first-person shooter franchise in the world bounced back in a big way this year. And Xbox owners did get to play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> on day one via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, so there’s that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More importantly, Treyarch, Raven, and the myriad Activision support studios that put in yeoman’s work on this series every year came together to craft the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review"><u>best single-player Call of Duty campaign</u></a> in years. Historically underrated developer Raven understood that the key to a great Call of Duty campaign is variety, and in Black Ops 6 you get to do all kinds of incredibly fun stuff, from going undercover at a casino to freely roaming an open-world desert to hobnobbing at a Bill Clinton fundraiser and so much more. Its story doesn’t quite punch you in the face with a twist as good as Black Ops 1’s JFK moment, but it’s a damn fine story nevertheless that positively reinforces the excellent and unpredictable campaign gameplay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Add in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review"><u>great, focused multiplayer mode</u></a> and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-review"><u>excellent return of Zombies</u></a>, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is one of the best overall gaming packages you can get in 2024.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/stalkerthumb-1723559698961-1734501135279.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> went through a literal version of Hell on Earth in order to get this deeply personal game about their home country of Ukraine made after Russia invaded it midway through development. That it got done at all is an incredible testament to their perseverance and human spirit, and how lucky we are that they did finish it, because <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review"><u>it is fantastic</u></a>. (Side note: the 90-minute documentary about the making of this game is an incredible human story that’s well worth watching. Find it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg620kmD6Dc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Xbox’s YouTube channel</u></a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This first-person shooter sequel mixes punishing survival gameplay with brutal combat in a brooding sci-fi atmosphere to create a gameplay loop that feels refreshingly old-school yet delightfully new and modern all at the same time. Though its initial launch was marred by a host of technical issues, its fixes and updates came so frequently that it’s impossible to hold its launch day against it. And if you’re just jumping in now, you’ll only ever see the current, more polished version of the Exclusion Zone. Enjoy playing in the world it creates, as its developers clearly did when building it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-blogroll-1732662931258-1734501135279.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-steam-reviews-collapse-to-overwhelmingly-negative-dev-admits-it-completely-underestimated-excitement-for-the-game"><u>rough takeoff put passengers in a sour mood</u></a>, but things quickly smoothed out as developer Asobo Studio reached cruising altitude with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review"><u>latest version</u></a> of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-review"><u>masterpiece</u></a> aviation simulator. The team somehow made Flight Simulator even more gorgeous, rendering an even more beautiful and realistic Earth than the one from 2021. They also added a lot more to do, from wildlife photo shoots to inconceivably dotting the in-game planet with every single helipad in the real world. Physics were improved, as were numerous other under-the-hood systems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In all, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> may not be a “game” for everyone (hence the “simulator” in the title), but what it sets out to do it does brilliantly. It is a love letter to anyone and everyone who loves aviation, in the same way that Forza Horizon 5 was a love letter to anyone who loved cars and driving.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/indianajones-xboxpc-performancereview-blogroll-1734193646590-1734501135278.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Lucasfilm chose wisely when partnering with MachineGames to make a AAA Indiana Jones video game. The talented studio revived and modernized Wolfenstein, and before that made one of the greatest licensed video games of all time and one of the best original Xbox games ever in The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. And so it is high praise when we say that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review"><u>best game</u></a> this group of developers has ever made – not to mention the best Indiana Jones <em>anything </em>since The Last Crusade, 35 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some gamers were skeptical when we found out back in January that Indy’s latest interactive adventure would be played primarily in first-person. But once everyone played it, MachineGames’s choice was quickly validated. The Great Circle completely immerses you as Indiana Jones, from the shadow of your fedora on a wall to the versatile whip in your hand to the leather jacket that squeaks as you walk – not to mention the absolutely S-tier performance of veteran voice actor Troy Baker, who completely disappears into the role of Indiana Jones and convinces your ears and brain that you’re somehow anachronistically listening to a 40-something Harrison Ford. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Great Circle has action, sure, but that action occurs as a complement to the real heart of it: adventure. Your whip can be used to stun enemies – or knock the gun out of their hands – but it’s mostly used for traversal as a makeshift rope to help you navigate the crypts, tombs, cities, and dig sites you’ll visit around the world. And the swelling orchestral score makes the big moments feel extra big, just as it did in the Indiana Jones movies. The writing is also spot-on, with humor being used to punctuate various scenes and make sure the tone always stays fun without ever getting too dark or serious. Oh, and you’ll be solving puzzles too. So, so many puzzles both big and small. And they’re all really enjoyable to figure out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle isn’t just the best Xbox game of the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-brings-back-the-magic-of-xbox-exclusives-unlocked-clips"><u>it’s the best game that Microsoft has shipped under any of its banners</u></a> since IGN’s 2021 overall Game of the Year winner, Forza Horizon 5. It’s a globe-trotting adventure-action romp that eschews shooting in favor of punching, puzzles, whips, quips, story, sidequests, and setpieces. It is brilliant, impossible to put down, and it plays unlike any other first-person game out there. It easily and deservedly wins IGN’s Best Xbox Game of 2024 award.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more discussion on all of your favorite Xbox games, don’t miss our weekly Xbox show, Podcast Unlocked.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-rpg-of-2024.1064421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout 2024, it felt as if a new amazin RPG was right around the corner at every moment. The year kicked off with a bang when Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth launched just before Persona 3 Reload showed us why the original is a timeless story. And we only had to wait until February to return to Final Fantasy VII when Rebirth expanded the horizons of a beloved classic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those may have been the headliners early in the year, but Unicorn Overlord worked its way into our hearts with its captivating art style and tactical depth, before Dragon’s Dogma 2 proved why the cult classic deserved a sequel. It was more than enough to hold us over until the big hitters like Metaphor: ReFantazio and Dragon Age: The Veilguard landed toward the end of the year, showing how two iconic RPG development teams can forge a new path in their own ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was an embarrassment of riches for the RPG sickos here at IGN, especially considering the aforementioned games weren’t the only RPGs that stuck with us throughout the year. We can only highlight a handful of them, however, so here’s our list of the best RPGs of 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best RPG of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Two RPGs from this year received an Honorable Mention, which we'd like to highlight before getting into our runner-up and winner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can spot a Vanillaware game from a mile away thanks to its painterly art style and expressive anime-inspired character designs. It's what gives Unicorn Overlord such a distinct fantasy aesthetic, but it’s the unique mix of real-time strategy and tactical gameplay that makes it stand out among a sea of great RPGs. Creating squads composed of different classes and deploying them strategically filled that Ogre Battle-sized void in our lives, and exploring the overworld to build up towns that join your cause brought all its mechanics together. Its story of political drama has intriguing twists and turns, but it’s the squad members we made along the way that left a lasting impression in Unicorn Overlord.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite it partly being a Hawaiian getaway for the crew from RGG Studio’s RPG debut Yakuza: Like A Dragon in 2020, the follow-up Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth was rather heavy. It’s an examination of family, legacy, and what you do with the time you have left. Series-long protagonist Kazuma Kiryu teaming up with his successor in Kasuga Ichiban made for a beautiful passing of the torch. I came for the detailed and nuanced recreation of Waikiki, but it’s the bittersweet and inspiring moments in Infinite Wealth that reminded us why there’s just nothing like the Yakuza franchise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Dragon’s Dogma 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/04/dd2-oo-ign-thumbnail-v1-1709594709352.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Many would consider the original Dragon’s Dogma from 2012 a cult classic for the ways it thrusts you into a harsh fantasy world with very little to guide you. And the sequel in Dragon's Dogma 2 did not forget that. Capcom didn’t sand off the edges, streamline systems, or make its dark world any more inviting, and that’s why it was able to stand out in 2024 despite being one of the biggest years for the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon’s Dogma 2 is all about its organic emergent moments. There is a main quest to follow, of course, but NPCs will tap you for sidequests and you never know what you run into along the way. Its mechanics may seem inelegant, but after giving it time, you realize how flexible and deep it is from a gameplay perspective, especially once you grasp how reactive the in-game physics are. The Pawn system adds another layer, letting you customize your own AI-controlled party members, or borrow members from others online to make the goofiest band of heroes. Dragon’s Dogma 2 is not a clean experience and it thrives off of a unique friction that’s tough to find in games these days. When you reflect on how much work you put into surviving in its massive and harsh world, the consequential world-altering events and its message are nothing short of awe-inspiring.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/05/ff7rebirth-vcms-1730774234294.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing Remake in 2020, it felt as if there were endless possibilities for what the rest of Final Fantasy VII would look like for a new generation. Stepping out into the Grasslands for the first time in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, when Aerith takes in the scenic view and shows excitement about a world worth fighting for, captures the exact feeling. The musical motifs played on our nostalgia and the recreation of its original world was undoubtedly impressive while evoking a sense of wistfulness – it felt like Final Fantasy VII grew up with us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have our qualms with how Rebirth ends and sets up part three in this remade trilogy, but that doesn’t necessarily define the entire game. Tucked within its reinvention of the existing story are moments that elevate beloved characters to feel like brand new heroes who’ve inspired us in new ways. Its open regions are a beautiful expansion of the original’s overworld, and they’re filled with things to do that are often more than just busy work – and don’t ask us about how many hours we sunk into the new card game Queen’s Blood. In many respects, Rebirth connected us to a world we thought we knew on a deeper level – it made for one of the year’s best RPGs and it has us incredibly eager for what’s next.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/da-1718021093156.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been 10 years since Dragon Age: Inquisition, and the way in which series fans were <em>thirsty </em>for anything related to Dragon Age in that time was wild to see. With a tumultuous development cycle, it’s kind of a miracle that The Veilguard exists at all, but it turned out to be a worthy successor and one of the best RPGs of the year. Through the lens of Rook, our new customizable protagonist, we get to pick up on the story of Solas that left us hanging from Inquisition and its DLC. Yet, The Veilguard was still able to establish a new direction that stayed true to the core concepts of a series so steeped in its own lore. Its warmer tone may not be what you remember from previous Dragon Age games, but you roll with a party full of bright personalities who create a sense of purpose reminiscent of the BioWare games of yore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat will be familiar for anyone who has played a modern action game without sacrificing the kind of depth you’d expect from an action-RPG. Every class feels great to play and retains a unique playstyle while being viable – which is important considering you only control Rook throughout the game. While your party members still play an important role in combat, it's their presence and where you stand with them that makes the journey worth seeing through. Either way, you’ll be treated to some great conclusions that show how The Veilguard carves its own path with confidence.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/metaphor-re-fantazio-key-art-1719595744252.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With a pedigree of the last three Persona games, I came into Metaphor: ReFantazio with high expectations, and even then, developer Atlus found a way to exceed them. To call it fantasy Persona isn’t necessarily inaccurate (and is a pretty good indication of what you’re getting into), but that would also undersell the nuances that make Metaphor the best RPG of the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using the context of a daily calendar system, Metaphor wields familiar mechanics to usher you through its fantasy political drama. Deciding how to spend your limited time makes those choices intriguing, whether it’s spending time with followers to level up bonds, explore dungeons for sidequests, or better yourself by increasing virtue stats – it’s the small moments like these that connect you to its world on the ground level. That’s the social sim element that leaves you naturally invested, and it gives its big moments more weight. So, when you see a character overcome their trauma or push themselves to do what’s right, it feels like it comes from a genuine place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than anything, Metaphor is the game of the moment. It doesn’t shy away from themes such as racism, inequality, religious extremism, and abuse of power and demonstrates an understanding of the material it's working with through a powerful story. Every character, every bond and follower, and every major story beat feeds into a thoughtful representation of our real world, showing us the ugliest parts of humanity but also what it takes to create a brighter future. Metaphor is very upfront about its message from beginning to end, and yet, what it says about the power of fiction might be the most inspiring part of it all. There’s just nothing like Metaphor: ReFantazio, and it represents the best of what games can offer, especially in 2024.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/alien-rogue-incursion-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the series most ripe for a virtual reality adaptation, few have greater potential than Alien. I mean, who aside from Ellen Ripley herself wouldn’t want to experience the thrill of being hunted by the perfect organism without that whole “risk of being dismembered” thing? Alien: Rogue Incursion is an admirable first attempt at delivering just that, with a compelling story, memorable characters, terrifying Xenomorphs, and a perfectly crafted world that couldn’t be mistaken for anything but the iconic Alien universe. There’s plenty of room to improve in its already-in-the-works sequel, however, especially when it comes to the simplistic combat, not-so-clever Xenomorphic foes, and occasional jankiness that could use some smoothing over. Even so, Rogue Incursion is a strong opening act for a series I’m already eager to play more of.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Alien: Rogue Incursion Gameplay Screenshots (PSVR 2)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve read the Alien comics, like Aliens: Defiance, then you’ll already be familiar with the badass protagonist whose boots you’ll be filling: Zula Hendricks. And if that name doesn’t ring a bell, Rogue Incursion does a great job of introducing you to her in short order so you don’t have to do any homework beforehand. An ex-colonial marine with a rough upbringing and chronic back problems, you’re sent to a classically deserted planet overrun by the most evil creatures imaginable, and accompanied by your trusty synthetic companion, Davis – don’t worry, he’s reformed, and not the type to betray you to please his corporate overlords… anymore. What follows is an extremely formulaic Alien tale that apes all the same beats for which the series is known, but thanks to interesting dialogue, great characters, and a relatively short runtime that doesn’t overstay its welcome, that familiarity doesn’t end up being such a bad thing. Zula and her relationship with her robot bestie is genuinely touching, oftentimes offsetting an otherwise relentlessly bleak situation, and the story has a few twists in store and an ending that sets up a sequel nicely.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zula's relationship with her robot bestie is genuinely touching.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the eight-hour story, you’ll tiptoe through the dark corridors and frozen wastes of a forgotten colony world while looking over your shoulder every few seconds for those eye-free freak shows that are never far off, and then painting the walls with their acidic blood whenever one pops out of a vent or sneaks up behind you. Going through each area slowly and doing your best to keep quiet can keep them off your back for slightly longer, but since ammo isn’t particularly scarce and Xenomorphs aren’t all that hard to kill on anything but the hardest difficulty, I found that running through areas and getting things done quickly could work just as well, so long as you’re up for a slightly more regular fight. And, of course, you’ll have to solve complicated engineering problems in a world where every piece of technology breaks as soon as a Xenomorph so much as looks at it, and then makes as much noise as possible anytime you try to troubleshoot, just in case those aliens in the next room over hadn’t heard you yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is rather simple, in that 95% of the time you’ll be attacked by Xenomorphs who climb out of vents seemingly installed for the explicit purpose of helping them get around, pull out one of your three weapons to make short work of them, and then move on. These encounters are divided nearly equally into either exciting sections that have some kind of unique tension or twist, and completely monotonous annoyances. For example, finding yourself cornered by a trio of Xenos and frantically trying to reload your weapon before you’re toast is extremely memorable, and setting traps as you hold off an onslaught of double-jawed monsters while performing IT support for some broken communications relays is an action-packed good time. But then you’ll go a long stretch of walking down some of the same hallways you’ve visited already, stopping every 30 seconds to kill a few monsters that run straight at you, completely devoid of any kind of intelligent attack strategy, then carefully reload your weapons before moving on and repeating the process moments later. These sections tend to make combat feel pretty mundane, and take away a lot of the initial fear when confronting a Xenomorph, which begin to feel quite commonplace after the first couple hours.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Initially scary Xenomorphs can soon begin to feel commonplace.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably the weakest part of combat is your limited and mostly unremarkable arsenal, which consists of a pulse rifle, a pump-action shotgun, and a six-shooter revolver. The pulse rifle, an automatic weapon that’s usually the most overall reliable choice for a variety of situations, is really the only weapon that feels recognizable in the Alien universe, while the shotgun and revolver seem oddly generic and low-tech for a sci-fi setting. Your only other tools are proximity grenades that can be set to go off when an alien draws near and a motion scanner that you won’t need to use very often, since Xenomorphs loudly scurry about and hiss at you to announce their presence most of the time. These items feel pretty par for the course for VR shooters, with little to set them apart. It’s also a bit weird that you don’t have a last resort melee weapon to fall back on, so if a facehugger jumps on your head, you’d better hope you can get your pistol pointed at an awkward angle to kill it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is an Alien game, so perhaps unsurprisingly, the enemy variety isn’t very strong either. You’ll go at least several hours before seeing a single enemy that isn’t a Xenomorph, and even when you do, it’ll be a facehugger or two before going right back to more Xenos. The good news is that these aliens can be pretty intimidating foes, killing in just a hit or two and rushing at you by crawling on walls, leaping great distances, and moving erratically to make them hard to pin down. Unfortunately, despite their best effort, their menacing appearance doesn’t always translate to them being particularly crafty foes, and after you’ve learned their small bag of tricks in the first hour or two, they begin to feel downright dim as they mozy on out through a vent before pausing in front of you for a few seconds, giving you ample time to score the kill while they stand in place helplessly. Between the first Alien movie’s depiction of the Xenomorph as an all-powerful monstrosity that can scarcely be beaten, and the second movie’s tendency to blast through dozens of the creatures within the span of a few minutes, Rogue Incursion certainly finds itself in the latter camp.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Alien Recommendations</h3><p>If you love Ridley Scott's pessimistic galaxy filled with things that want to kill you, here are my top recommendations!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It also suffers from minor, but noteworthy enough to be annoying, bugs. Sometimes characters will repeat the same lines of dialogue multiple times in a row, Xenomorphs will move through objects in bizarre ways, and your controls aren’t always as precise and responsive as you’d hope when you’re staring down a room full of facehuggers. None of these issues are particularly troublesome, but they do add a slight lack of polish that I hope they’ll work on for the sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And while this isn’t the fault of Alien: Rogue Incursion alone, one especially annoying PSVR 2 issue that felt like a particular problem here is that the little PlayStation logo buttons are a tad too easy to hit, especially when you’re clamoring for your handgun after a Xenomorph surprises you. Most of the times I died were due to a menu popping up at exactly the wrong moment, sending me scrambling to back out before I was killed, which I was rarely successful at. That added an extra level of stress in the wrong kind of way. Again, this is a controller design problem at the end of the day, but it came up enough here that there really ought to be some built-in protection against it – maybe make me hold the menu button down for a second or two before you cause me to get impaled on an alien’s tail, guys?</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Alien: Rogue Incursion is a faithful and entertaining stab at bringing Alien to virtual reality. The excellent story, spot-on Alien environments, and creepy Xenomorphs keep the horrifying times going throughout its eight-hour duration, even when repetitive combat, predictable AI, and the odd bug here and there make it clear this is the first attempt that it is. But while there’s plenty of room for this budding series to grow, I can already happily recommend Rogue Incursion as a strong proof of concept to Alien fans and newcomers alike – one that’s left me eagerly awaiting part two.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-and-killzone-crossover-seemingly-leaked/1100-6528503/" data-ref-id="1100-6528503">leaking earlier this week</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> is officially getting a crossover with PlayStation sci-fi shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killzone-2/" data-ref-id="5000-24443">Killzone 2</a>, with the first batch of cosmetics for the multiplayer shooter available today.</p><p>Helldivers 2 will feature two waves of Killzone 2 content, with the first featuring cosmetics including a Helghan uniform for your freedom-toting trooper, a StA-52 assault rifle, and an assortment of capes, banners, and player titles. This is the first crossover of this kind in Helldivers 2, after developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-devs-are-open-to-crossovers-but-only-if-they-make-sense/1100-6522756/" data-ref-id="1100-6522756">Arrowhead said it was open to the idea</a> if it "makes sense". Given the shared genres between the two games, Killzone seems like a good fit.</p><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>, developer Arrowhead stressed that this content belongs to a new premium tier of content. The new weapon costs 615 Super Credits, about $6-7, while the individual armor pieces are 310-500 Super Credits each.</p><p>With the release of the first wave of Killzone 2 cosmetics, Arrowhead also explained that it's testing out longer rotations in the game's Superstore. "Right now, many of you feel the items are in rotation for too short a time, and that you sometimes miss out on that killer look you had your eyes on," the post reads. "At the same time, the more things we add to the store the longer it takes to come back into rotation."</p><p>This means that this first wave of cosmetics will stick around for five days, while the second batch will arrive on December 23 for the same amount of time. Arrowhead says it'll then return to shorter rotation times as it determines whether or not the experiment has yield better results via feedback from players.</p><p>This Killzone 2 crossover comes hot on the heels of a big update to Helldivers 2 less than a week ago. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-crush-illuminate-invaders-in-under-a-week/1100-6528505/" data-ref-id="1100-6528505">The Omens of Tyranny</a> update introduced the zombie-like Illuminate faction to the shooter, as well as new urban environments to wage skirmishes in. It's capped off a big year for Arrowhead's sequel, which was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">fastest-selling PlayStation game ever</a> having sold over 12 million copies in its first three months on the market.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft is reportedly trying to break away from the typical open-world formula that the Far Cry series is known for with the next two entries.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>,  there are two Far Cry games in the works: a mainline game codenamed Blackbird and an extraction shooter spin-off codenamed Maverick. Ubisoft is also reportedly switching proprietary engines, now opting for the Snowdrop engine that was used for games like The Division instead of Dunia, the usual engine that the Far Cry series uses.</p><p>In Maverick, players reportedly are placed in the Alaskan wilderness where they have to fight against other players, animals, and weather. In Blackbird, the story reportedly revolves around the main character having to rescue his family from a cult. Apparently, players have 24 real-life hours, which translates to 72 in-game hours, to rescue the family and the time can be seen on the character's wristwatch.</p><p>The two games reportedly also have similar movement mechanics, such as tactical sprinting, sliding, and vaulting, due to both projects previously being part of the same game, which was codenamed Talisker. Internally, Ubisoft has reportedly pushed back the release dates for the games from 2025 to 2026 due to development complications.</p><p>Ubisoft has been in a tight spot recently. The founders, the Guillemot family, are reportedly trying to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-co-founders-want-to-maintain-control-as-talks-with-tencent-continue-report/1100-6528283/" data-ref-id="1100-6528283">retain control of the company</a> while seeking a buyout from others such as Tencent. Ubisoft also recently announced that it would be shutting down its Call of Duty competitor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">XDefiant in June 2025</a>, but will continue to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-still-dedicated-to-live-service-after-its-call-of-duty-competitor-came-up-short/1100-6528215/" data-ref-id="1100-6528215">pour resources into live-service games</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US industry analyst group Circana has released its gaming sales data for November, and it turns out that&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has earned itself a rather impressive accolade.</p>

<p>According to the indefatigable Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4czuc2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on social media platform Bluesky</a>,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>"became the best-selling sports video game in US history" in dollar sales terms in November.</p>

<p>That's perhaps not particularly surprising given that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana" rel="nofollow">scored the top spot</a>&nbsp;on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in the month of its release. <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>'s achievement is perhaps even more impressive when we consider that so far, it hasn't been released on PC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game-play.jpg?itok=YoRcFsNA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game-play.jpg?itok=bBB3chky 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has sold pretty well, and that's an understatement.</figcaption></figure><p>Piscatella goes on to point out that not only is&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>sitting pretty in the sports game hall of fame, but it also now "ranks among the top 50 best-selling tracked video games" of all time according to dollar sales.</p>

<p>While the game may have reached the lofty status outlined above in November (and topped the Xbox charts to boot), it wasn't actually the best-selling PlayStation game of the month; <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4dbok2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that honor</a> goes to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, which apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">enjoyed the franchise's biggest ever launch</a>.</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>didn't get a release on Switch, the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf7vf2c2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">best-selling game on Nintendo's console</a> for November was instead&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>MySims: Cozy Bundle&nbsp;</em>taking up second and third place.</p>

<p>Overall, consumer spending fell by 7% in November compared <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-sales-data-november-2023" rel="nofollow">to last year</a>, although subscription service spending was up by 8% on a year-on-year basis, which Piscatella attributes to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1" rel="nofollow">debut of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>on Game Pass</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-slightly-increase-in-november-2024-thanks-to-ps5-pro/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Video game hardware sales in the United States (US) slightly increased in November 2024. That’s according to the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4dap62o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>.</p>



<p>For November 2024, video game hardware spending increased by 0.3$ from $924 million (M) to $927M year-over-year. That’s a major change from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-fell-october-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October’s numbers</a> which saw a 23% year-over-year fall. </p>



<p>Unlike October 2024, where a decrease in sales was across the board, November was a bit different. Thanks to the launch of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro and its $700 price tag, the PS5 saw a 15% increase in overall spending. On the other side of things, however, the Nintendo Switch say a 3% year-over-year drop in sales while the Xbox fell 29%.</p>



<p>Going back to the PS5, the PS5 Pro made up 19% of the number of PS5 consoles sold in November while also accounting for 28% of the money. That’s a 12% decrease in launch month sales of the PS4 Pro, but a 50% increase in dollars. The PS4 Pro launched at $400 in 2016 compared to the aforementioned $700 of the PS5 Pro. </p>



<h6 id="h-related-college-football-25-remains-2024-s-best-selling-video-game">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-remains-2024s-best-selling-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">College Football 25 Remains 2024’s Best-Selling Video Game</a></h6>



<p>In total for 2024, hardware sales in the US have fallen 24% to $3.74 billion (B) from the $4.9B in 2023. In terms of general units, 2.4M consoles were sold in November 2024 compared to the 2.3M sold in November 2023. That brings the total number of consoles sold for 2024 up to 9.4M, down compared to the 11.7M sold by this time in 2023.</p>



<p>That said, accessories continue to perform better than a year ago. In total, accessory sales rose 4% in November year-over-year while the year-to-date numbers jumped 8%. According to the data, the PlayStation Portal remains the best-selling accessory both for November 2024 and the entire year.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Uncharted's Amy Hennig announced that her first title at Skydance New Media will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-featuring-captain-america-and-black-panther/1100-6521993/" data-ref-id="1100-6521993">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, a game that will bring Captain America face-to-face with the Black Panther of World War II, Azzuri, who is also the grandfather of the modern Black Panther, T'Challa. The early preview trailer suggested that the game would take place in Europe during the Nazi occupation, but apparently the story will also bring players to Wakanda and other locations.</p><p>"Wakanda and Occupied Paris are both key locations," Henning told <a href="https://ew.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-globe-trotting-wwii-epic-wakanda-setting-exclusive-8760326" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EW</a>. "We wanted to tell a globe-trotting story... There are yet-to-be-revealed locations in between... Wakanda at this point in time is hidden away from the outside world and protected by this impenetrable jungle. They are non-interventionist, but events transpire that pull them into the conflict. They have to protect their interests. The world is getting smaller... but how long can you stay in the shadows?"</p><p>Henning also teased that there's another super soldier in Paris during this story whom she did not name. However, EW's report did announce that one of the new characters created for the game is Julie (Lyne Renée), an ally in the French Resistance. As previously revealed, there are four playable characters in the game: </p><ul><li>Drew Moerlein as Captain America/Steve Rogers</li><li>Khary Payton as Black Panther/Azzuri</li><li>Marque Richardson as Gabriel Jones</li><li>Megalyn Echikunwoke as Nanali</li></ul><p>Cap's ally, Howard Stark--the father of future Iron Man, Tony Stark--will also be in the game, as voiced by Joel Johnstone. For now, Henning declined to reveal what sets the story in motion, but she hinted at a mystery that will unfold during the game's narrative.</p><p>"In these kinds of stories, particularly when you have this unfolding mystery, you always want your MacGuffin to pull the characters along," said Henning. "That there is this impending threat and a shared object of desire."</p><p>Marvel 1943: Rise Of Hydra will be released in 2025, but the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">If you're looking for a last-minute gift for a Nintendo fan who grew up during the Game Boy era, the newly released <a href="https://modretro.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ModRetro Chromatic</a> is one of the coolest retro gaming gadgets of 2024. The Chromatic is a modernized Game Boy Color that looks, plays, and feels like the real thing. Unlike most retro handhelds that aim to do a little bit of everything, the Chromatic is unabashedly committed to the singular goal of replicating the GBC experience as you fondly remember it. For the subset of retro gamers who crave authenticity, the Chromatic is an undeniable success. It's also one of the best-built portable devices I've ever used.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no shortage of retro gaming handhelds on the market today, including <em>many </em>that mimic Nintendo's iconic Game Boy family. Most are emulation devices that can offer solid experiences for budget prices. But whereas most of these devices resemble the general look of the Game Boy, the Chromatic is one of the few that truly replicates the experience of playing on one. It takes "paying homage" to the next level. If you prefer original hardware, whether stock or modded, the Chromatic is the closest approximation to the Game Boy I've ever played. But if you slapped a Nintendo logo on it and told me the Chromatic was Nintendo's jump into the premium retro hardware space, I wouldn't believe you. Not because it's inauthentic, but because Nintendo would never mass produce a handheld built with such pricey components.</p><p dir="ltr">ModRetro was founded by Palmer Luckey, who is best known as the creator of the Oculus Rift. He sold Oculus VR to Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion and went on to cofound Anduril Industries, a defense technology company, in 2017. Anduril Industries manufactures AI-powered military devices such as drones and sells them to the Department of Defense. It appears ModRetro is a passion project for Luckey, and based on the Chromatic's build, he spared no expense making it happen.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417521-modretrochromatic.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417521" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417521-modretrochromatic.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417521"></a><figcaption>ModRetro Chromatic</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417521-modretrochromatic.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Chromatic plays all Game Boy and Game Boy Color cartridges as well as Chromatic-branded carts. Because the Chromatic is an FPGA device, all of your original cartridges will run <em>exactly </em>as they did on the Atomic Purple Game Boy Color you wish you hadn't sold at that garage sale as a kid. This also means all Chromatic carts are simply Game Boy carts with different branding that work on original hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">While the Chromatic has a few modifiable display settings, including different levels of brightness for the backlit screen, Frame Blending, and Color Correction for streaming gameplay on computer monitors, it was intentionally designed to replicate, rather than improve, the visuals of the Game Boy Color. The backlit screen understandably makes a huge difference, but it looks very similar to a modded Game Boy Color with a nice backlit panel. The Chromatic has a 2.56-inch backlit IPS LCD made of sapphire crystal. The screen size is virtually identical to that of the Game Boy Pocket, which had a slightly larger screen than the GBC (2.3 inches).</p><p dir="ltr">For purists who refuse to play games on anything but original hardware, native resolution is one of the commonly cited explanations. The Chromatic retains the GBC's 160 x 144p resolution, so every pixel is the right size and in the right spot. This is a much different approach than the Analogue Pocket, which has a 3.5-inch Gorilla Glass display with a staggering 1600 x 1440p resolution and 650 pixels per inch. Games play the same on Pocket, but the greatly increased pixel density means they don't look exactly the same. Whether they look better or worse depends on who you ask--I think they look better--but there's no denying the Pocket's screen and internal tech are more advanced. It has display settings that replicate the look of various Game Boy models as well as its own filters that effectively upscale the visuals. This also means the Pocket can recreate the green background color of the original Game Boy DMG, which had a dot-matrix display. The Chromatic isn't capable of that; instead, it displays original Game Boy carts as they looked on the Game Boy Color.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417528-allthreesidebyside.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417528" data-ratio="0.627" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417528-allthreesidebyside.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417528"></a><figcaption>Game Boy Color | ModRetro Chromatic | Analogue Pocket</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417528-allthreesidebyside.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">So while both the Chromatic and Pocket both play GB and GBC carts--the Pocket also plays GBA carts and supports adapters for other platforms--they aren't doing exactly the same thing. The Chromatic is made for people who want the most authentic Game Boy Color experience possible without buying and modding one. The Pocket is an openFPGA handheld with support for a long list of retro platforms. It has the general Game Boy shape, but it's a larger device with an enhanced visual experience and tons of customization features.</p><p dir="ltr">I <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogue-pocket-review-the-best-way-to-play-game-boy-games/1100-6498917/">reviewed the Analogue Pocket</a> when it launched back in 2021 and called it the best way to play Game Boy games. I still feel that way today, but keep in mind that I am not someone who cares about playing games in their native resolution with the same pixel density, screen size, and form factor. While I prefer the Pocket due to its upscaled resolution, the $199 Chromatic has a more premium build than the base Pocket for $220. And if I was picking between the Chromatic and any of the modded Game Boys I've used, I'd pick the Chromatic. It's highly unlikely you could get a Game Boy Color and make it as nice as the Chromatic for less than its $199 launch price. The build quality is <em>seriously </em>impressive.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417532-chromaticpokemon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417532" data-ratio="0.85222222222222" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417532-chromaticpokemon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417532"></a><figcaption>ModRetro Chromatic Wave | Analogue Pocket Glow in the Dark</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417532-chromaticpokemon.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">From a feel perspective, the Chromatic's uncommonly used Sapphire Crystal panel is no different from glass, though the technology is typically viewed as even more resistant to scratches than tempered and Gorilla Glass. A quick Google search will tell you that Sapphire can cost 10 times as much as Gorilla Glass. A 144p display utilizing one of the priciest materials possible is a peculiar combo, but that's the theme with the Chromatic as a whole: ultra-premium.</p><p dir="ltr">The Chromatic's shell is 5.2 x 3 x 1.2 inches, a near-exact match to the Game Boy Color's 5.26 x 3.1 x 1.08-inch shell. But instead of plastic, ModRetro used injection molding to craft the Chromatic's magnesium alloy shell. Portable gaming devices with metal shells aren't unheard of, but, again, they aren't common due to cost. Analogue, for instance, released a limited-edition Pocket with an aluminum shell for $499 earlier this year. Boxy Pixel, a popular choice in the modding community, sells aluminum GBC sells for $72 and up. ModRetro built the Chromatic shells with the pricey injection molding process, which generally leads to more consistency and material strength. The Chromatic, unsurprisingly, is heavier than a Game Boy as a result. On the spec sheet, it's 6.2 ounces, whereas the Game Boy Color is 4.9 ounces with two batteries and the DMG is 7.8 ounces with four batteries. When you pop in three AA batteries, the Chromatic is closer to 9 ounces. I wouldn't say it's heavy, but for a handheld this small, it definitely has some heft to it. To be fair, magnesium alloy is the lightest structural metal, so the Chromatic is likely as light as it gets in this form factor. And the metal shell is important here--I definitely wouldn't trade it for plastic.</p><p dir="ltr">The Chromatic is without a doubt the sturdiest handheld I've ever used. It's extremely well-made, with no weak points, creaks, or inconsistencies of any kind. The remarkably premium feel does come with one caveat. As mentioned, it mirrors the Game Boy Color in size. If you haven't held a Game Boy as an adult, you may be surprised at how small it is. As an adult with average-sized hands, it took a little time for me to readjust to the form factor and screen size. The slight bit of added depth helps, and Nintendo's vertically oriented Game Boys have surprisingly solid ergonomics in general. The Chromatic is comfortable to hold--for me at least. The screen and shell size might be an issue for you, depending on your eyesight and hand size.</p><p dir="ltr">As with the rest of the build, the buttons are also made of premium materials. ModRetro built the D-pad and two face buttons with PBT, the same thermoplastic used for keycaps on some high-end mechanical keyboards. Like those keycaps, the D-pad has a slightly textured, matte finish, while the A and B buttons have a glossy coating. The D-pad is larger and softer than ones found on Game Boys, which certainly makes the Chromatic more comfortable to hold and control. It's a superb D-pad with fast action and consistent travel distances with each tap. The buttons are quieter than on many controllers, partly because they don't rattle or wobble in the slightest. I suspect the injection molding helped with getting the perfect fit.</p><p dir="ltr">The front layout is identical to the original Game Boy, with even the Start and Select buttons being positioned diagonally. It's neat that the Chromatic borrows a small piece from each of the Game Boys it pays homage to. Where the Chromatic's layout differs is on the sides and top. The power switch is located on the top-left corner. The IR sensor, which is used for limited multiplayer functions like trading Pokemon, is on the top-right corner. For more traditional competitive and cooperative multiplayer, the Chromatic has the Link Cable port on its left side and can be connected to other Chromatics, Game Boys, and Analogue Pockets. The volume rocker is on the right, and the 3.5mm headphone jack is (thankfully) on the bottom right corner.</p><p dir="ltr">The Chromatic, like basically every portable device, sounds better with headphones, but this little device has a very impressive speaker. It's pitched as a "custom ultra-loud speaker module," which is an accurate description. When I tested it at full volume with my office door closed, my family could hear it clearly in the other room. More importantly, the audio is crisp. Portable speaker technology has made huge strides since the '90s, and it's put to here, making for a pleasant listening experience, with or without headphones.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417534-chromaticwave.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417534" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417534-chromaticwave.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417534"></a><figcaption>ModRetro Chromatic Wave</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417534-chromaticwave.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417554-chromatic_gameplay_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417555-chromatic_gameplay_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417556-chromatic_gameplay_7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417557-chromatic_gameplay_8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417558-chromatic_gameplay_9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417559-chromatic_gameplay_10.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417554,1300-4417555,1300-4417556,1300-4417557,1300-4417558,1300-4417559" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4417554-chromatic_gameplay_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4417555-chromatic_gameplay_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4417556-chromatic_gameplay_7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4417557-chromatic_gameplay_8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4417558-chromatic_gameplay_9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4417559-chromatic_gameplay_10.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417554-chromatic_gameplay_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417555-chromatic_gameplay_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417556-chromatic_gameplay_7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417557-chromatic_gameplay_8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417558-chromatic_gameplay_9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417559-chromatic_gameplay_10.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Chromatic has one button you won't find on Game Boys. When you flick the power switch, you're booted right into the cartridge, just like old times. But there is a button on the right side that pulls up a small settings menu. This is where you can adjust display brightness, enter silent mode (disables the sound output), and alter display settings. As mentioned, there are only two settings here: Frame Blend and Color Correction. The former fixes issues with games that the Game Boy's screen couldn't keep up with due to the slow response times of older screen technology. The frames would, in essence, blend together. Color Correction is disabled by default, though it'll come in handy if you decide to utilize the Chromatic's USB-C port.</p><p dir="ltr">You can connect the Chromatic to your PC via USB-C to stream gameplay with OBS. It's not a traditional video-out function, so you aren't "docking" the Chromatic, but streamers can share gameplay and you can play on a larger screen without streaming by simply starting a local OBS stream. Modern monitors interfacing with retro hardware sometimes make color palettes look <em>off</em>, and that's where Color Correction comes in to clean things up.</p><p dir="ltr">Out of the box, the Chromatic is powered by three AA batteries. It comes with three Chromatic-branded batteries and is compatible with rechargeable AA batteries. Battery life will be highly dependent on brightness levels, but I averaged six to seven hours before needing to pop new ones in. I'd definitely recommend rechargeable Duracell or Energizer batteries to save money. It's not available yet, but ModRetro will have a custom lithium-ion battery for sale that can be charged through the USB-C port. If you do rely on swapping in AAs, the battery cover and clip feels like they will hold up a lot better than plastic covers and clips on original Game Boy hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">While the Chromatic is designed to play all of your old Game Boy and Game Boy Color cartridges, ModRetro has started its own line of Chromatic-branded cartridges. <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Seven games are available at launch</a>, with more in the pipeline for early 2025. ModRetro rebuilt two of the best puzzle games of the Game Boy era for the Chromatic's launch. Just like the original Game Boy in 1989, "first edition" Chromatic handhelds are bundled with Tetris at launch. Yes, actual, officially licensed Tetris. This enhanced version of the greatest puzzle game of all time is superb, with bright and colorful 8-bit visuals and numerous customization options, including the ability to toggle between modern or classic rules. ModRetro also revitalized the GBC puzzle-platformer Toki Tori, and much like Tetris, this is a better version of the game thanks to faster movement speed and auto-jump.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417535-modretrochromaticbox.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417535" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417535-modretrochromaticbox.png" data-ref-id="1300-4417535"></a><figcaption>ModRetro Chromatic packaging and release titles</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4417535-modretrochromaticbox.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The other launch games are indies from homebrew developers, including one of the most-anticipated titles in the Game Boy homebrew scene: Dragonyhm, previously known as Dragonborne DX. This sprawling top-down adventure is a fun mix of Pokemon and Zelda that's definitely worth checking out. In the Dark 2 is a story-based, exceedingly clever puzzler from the co-creators of <a href="https://krooltoys.itch.io/grimaces-birthday" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grimace's Birthday</a>, while the Chromatic-exclusive Patchy Matchy is a really enjoyable grid puzzle game that's a perfect pick-up-and-play experience. Traumatarium Penitent is a gorgeous first-person dungeon crawler that I had already played when the <a href="https://horatiunyc.itch.io/traumatarium-penitent" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">digital version</a> launched earlier this year (I'd also recommend its predecessor, <a href="https://horatiunyc.itch.io/traumatarium" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Traumatarium</a>). Finally, Tales of Monsterland DX is the enhanced and expanded version of one of the better homebrew Game Boy platformers I've played. If you like Wonder Boy, you'll probably like this.</p><p dir="ltr">With the exception of Tetris, which is packaged with the Chromatic, each game comes inside an old-school style cardboard box with key art on the front and facts on the back. Inside the box you'll find an instruction manual, a plastic insert to hold the cartridge, and a little charm that could be added to a charm bracelet (if you have one).</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/products" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chromatic costs $199 and is available in seven colors</a>: Inferno (orange), Leaf (green), Bubblegum (pink), Volt (yellow), Wave (blue), Midnight (black), and a Game Boy DMG-inspired gray. The gray bundle is exclusive to GameStop, while the rest of the colors are only available directly from ModRetro. The Chromatic looks just as good up close as it does in pictures. The packaging for the Chromatic might be the coolest I've seen for a handheld. It's designed to look like a school notebook, complete with a fold-out front cover and a wide assortment of colorful doodles surrounding pictures of the handheld and "Chromatic" in bubble letters.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The bottom line</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">ModRetro's Chromatic is a truly superb recreation of the Game Boy Color. If you want a near-exact replica of your childhood Game Boy with a backlit screen, this is the handheld for you. At $199, and even if you didn't get a great new spin on Tetris, I'd argue the Chromatic is a bargain due to its ridiculously premium build. But this is a bargain for a <em>very </em>specific type of retro gamer. If you've been considering modding a Game Boy or buying a pre-modded one from a reseller, the Chromatic is arguably the highest-end modded Game Boy Color around. It's not anywhere close to as versatile as the Analogue Pocket, but for those who want to play GB and GBC games as authentically as possible, the Chromatic is as real as it gets.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Price</strong> - $199 for first edition bundle with Tetris cart</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Compatibility</strong> - Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Chromatic cartridges</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Display</strong> - 2.56-inch sapphire crystal backlit IPS LCD</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resolution</strong> - 160 x 144p</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Size</strong> - 5.2 x 3 x 1.2-inch</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight:</strong> 6.2 ounces</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Shell</strong> - Magnesium alloy thixomolded shell</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Buttons</strong> - PBT face buttons and D-pad</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery</strong> - 6-7 hours with two AA batteries (from our testing)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Audio</strong> - internal speaker, 3.5mm headphones</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ports</strong> - link cable, 3.5mm audio, USB-C with video out for streaming with OBS</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Multiplayer</strong> - via backwards compatible link cable, IR sensor</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Colors</strong> - Inferno, Leaf, Bubblegum, Volt, Wave, Midnight, Gray</li></ul><hr><hr><p><em>ModRetro provided GameSpot with the Chromatic and game cartridges for the purpose of this review.</em></p>

            <p>Lost Soul Aside is set to launch in 2025, nine years after its solo developer first revealed the Devil May Cry and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a> inspired action game.</p>
<p>Chinese developer Yang Bing originally started the project alone, before founding his studio Ultizero Games. Now Sony will publish the game for PS5 and PC (Steam).</p>
<p>Alongside the launch news, a new trailer for the game has been released with fresh footage of its sword-wielding hero and dragon companion fighting an ice beast with spectacular combat.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUpfaHrR8Yk">PlayStation previously shared a trailer</a> for the game two years ago from the PlayStation China Hero Project launch event, which includes more of its character action and platforming across a world blending sci-fi and Chinese tradition.</p>
<p>Before that, eight years ago, it was an indie prototype developed by Bing alone using stock assets.</p>
<p>And if the protagonist looks a little like Noctis from Final Fantasy 15, that game directly inspired Bing's work, along with Devil May Cry.</p>

<p>"Chain lightning-fast combos, learn new abilities, and upgrade your weapons as you take on formidable enemies and colossal bosses in fast, dynamic combat."</p>
<p>Fans of Devil May Cry, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, and NieR: Automata will find plenty to enjoy here.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-killzone-crossover-out-now-more-coming-next-week.1064337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-killzone-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios has announced the very first&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>crossover, and it's with a classic Sony first-person shooter franchise we haven't heard from in some time.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam news post</a> earlier today,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s first ever collaboration is with none other than&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>. More specifically, the crossover introduces items inspired by&nbsp;<em>Killzone 2&nbsp;</em>to the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>arsenal.</p>

<p>Arrowhead says that this crossover represents the first foray into a "new tier of special Premium content reserved for collaborations and other uniquely-themed work", so it sounds like we'll be getting more crossovers later down the line.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-killzone-crossover-store.jpg?itok=HHrzynCK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-killzone-crossover-store.jpg?itok=JeIrzW0j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s first crossover is with none other than&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Killzone&nbsp;</em>crossover doesn't take the form of a Warbond along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">Truth Enforcers</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-chemical-agents-warbond" rel="nofollow">Chemical Agents</a>. Rather, it's a set of new gear and other goodies you can buy from the game's Superstore, which offers individual items for in-game Super Credits.</p>

<p>Given&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s theming, it'll probably come as no surprise that this crossover revolves heavily around&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>'s fascist Helghast, with an armor set, a cape, and other liveries available that echo the logos and visual aesthetic of the Helghan Empire.</p>

<p>Of course, the tones of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>are somewhat at odds.&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>takes a more&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em>-esque satirical view of fascism, while&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>plays things more seriously.</p>

<p>Still, it's interesting to see&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s first crossover emerge in this way. Could this also be Sony's stealthy way of trying to gauge interest for a potential&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>revival? We will have to wait and see.</p>




<p>This crossover comes shortly after the release of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Omens of Tyranny update, which introduces the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-cloaked-ships-rumor-update" rel="nofollow">long-awaited</a> (and apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-blue-beam-attacks-the-illuminate" rel="nofollow">previously-teased</a>) Illuminate faction into the mix.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The first part of the game's&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>crossover is live now, and a second part is apparently on its way on December 23rd.</p>

It’s been my primary gaming device ever since I became a parent, and I love being able to access the humongous library of games available on Steam from wherever I want, whether it’s at home or while the baby is taking a nap at grandma’s house. Valve keeps adding great features via software updates, too, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24289138/steam-game-recording-now-available-all-users">like game recording</a>.</p><p>If you’re just setting up a Steam Deck for the first time — perhaps you’re lucky enough to get one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24294106/valve-white-steam-deck">limited-edition white models</a> — or you’re dusting off your Deck after a little break, I’ve put together some recommendations of great games from this year, along with one update to a classic.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2379780%2FBalatro%2F"><em>Balatro</em></a></h3></p><p>Move over, <em>Slay the Spire</em> — there’s a new card-based roguelike king in town. Well, maybe a joker. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a>, the goal is to make familiar poker hands to earn increasingly higher amounts of chips. But between rounds, you’ll get to shop for new cards that make you more powerful, including jokers that can stack up to earn you mind-bogglingly high amounts of chips. When you get a good round going in <em>Balatro</em>, it’s a thrilling mix of planning, gambling, and watching numbers go up — and when your luck eventually runs out, it’s all too easy to hop back in for just one more round.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1845910%2FDragon_Age_The_Veilguard%2F"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></h3></p><p>BioWare’s latest fantasy RPG is an epic quest that’s especially well suited to the Steam Deck. It’s got all of the hallmarks of what’s expected from BioWare — dialogue trees, fun companions, and lots of ways to build your characters — and the game’s expansive story is broken up into several smaller quests, making it easy to take care of one in a short session before bed. While the game is verified for Steam Deck, you’ll have to tweak your graphics settings to make it run well. But I’ll take the imperfect performance to be able to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24281631/dragon-age-the-veilguard-early-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>The Veilguard</em></a> wherever I want.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1145350%2FHades_II%2F"><em>Hades II</em></a></h3></p><p>I wasn’t going to include early access games on this list, but I had to break my rule for <em>Hades II</em>. Even though it isn’t complete yet, it’s better than most of the games I’ve played this year. Supergiant’s sequel smartly builds upon the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc">action roguelike formula of the first game</a> with new weapons, <em>two</em> different routes to tackle (though one is unfinished), and a great new cast of hotties to hang out with (and some old ones returning). I’ve had to actually stop myself from playing this game as much as I want to — I don’t want to get tired of the game before its eventual 1.0 launch. And as my colleague Ash Parrish has already said, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance">it’s the perfect Steam Deck game</a>.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2679460%2FMetaphor_ReFantazio%2F"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a></h3></p><p>I’ve already written an entire article about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, the newest RPG from Atlus, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24266327/metaphor-refantazio-persona-handheld-heritage">continues <em>Persona</em>’s great handheld heritage</a>: battles are turn-based but quick; the game is broken down into easily digestible days; and it runs well enough on Steam Deck with some tweaking. It’s a huge game that I still haven’t finished, but because I have it on a portable device, I’m looking forward to chipping away at it when I get spare moments here and there.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2420660%2FNeva%2F"><em>Neva</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Neva</em> is a jaw-droppingly gorgeous game about a young woman and the fox that she cares for. There’s some combat, but much of the game is about solving light platforming puzzles and taking in the absolutely stunning art and music. (I can attest that it looks really good on a Steam Deck OLED.) The game tells a powerful story about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24267805/neva-nomada-studio-interview-gris-devolver">love and loss</a> that takes just a few hours to beat — it’s the perfect game to play over a couple of evenings on the couch next to a warm fire.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Playstack / Color Gray Games</cite></p></div><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2716400%2FThe_Rise_of_the_Golden_Idol%2F"><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em></a></h3></p><p>If you’re looking to solve some murder mysteries, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24295956/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc-playstation-xbox-netflix-mobile"><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em></a><em> </em>will probably cast its magic on you. The game is loaded with 20 point-and-click mysteries to solve by investigating scenes and people and figuring out the right words to explain exactly what’s going on.

However, that’s on default settings, and there’s a way to fix it—by disabling the AI-driven Game Filters setting.</p><p>The term “AI” now means so many different things, even just within the field of gaming, that it’s deeply unhelpful. It’s used to describe the programmed behavior of in-game characters and systems. It’s the name given to large language models that scrape other people’s work to generate derivative, plagiarized work. And it’s used to define any “learning” program that adapts itself based on experience. It’s the latter that’s relevant here, what Nvidia describes as “game enhancing filters, including innovative new AI-powered filters for RTX users.” It seems that, since the switch from GeForce Experience, it’s this feature that’s causing some serious issues.</p><p>Game Filters aren’t new—they were a feature in GeForce Experience and known as Nvidia Freestyle, and by all accounts <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-improve-pc-graphics-and-add-filters-with-nvidia-freestyle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-improve-pc-graphics-and-add-filters-with-nvidia-freestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was a suite of settings worth fiddling with</a></span> to get the most out of specific games. It’s just, with the new Nvidia App, the setting is set to on by default, and whatever fancy new “AI-powered” elements it includes are causing these significant hits to performance, even when it’s sitting idly in the background. Nvidia told <em>Tom’s Hardware</em> that they’re now aware of the issue, and in the meantime explain how to switch it off:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> You can turn off Game Filters from the NVIDIA App Settings &gt; Features &gt; Overlay &gt; Game Filters and Photo Mode, and then relaunch your game.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, there’s an even more effective means of avoiding the issues: you can just uninstall the app altogether. As someone who has become lazily reliant on GeForce Experience/Nvidia App to notify me when a new Nvidia driver is available (something you really do need to stay on top of if you want to avoid issues with the latest games), it’s become a default application on my PC. It’s a useful reminder that you don’t actually <em>need</em> it—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/drivers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can just visit Nvidia’s driver page</a></span> and download the latest drivers whenever you fancy. Like we all did in the Olden Days.</p><p>(Nvidia, despite wholly retiring Experience with the latest driver release, still hasn’t updated many of its web pages to acknowledge this, the driver site still suggesting you install it, while explanatory pages about the Game Filters all list it as an Experience feature.)</p><p>A 15-percent increase in dropped framerates is more significant than it might first sound. As <em>Tom’s Hardware </em>usefully explains, the difference in performance between the super-fancy RTX 4060 Ti and the $100-cheaper RTX 4060 is 18 percent.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Probably not.

Even a free-to-play title with a distinct lack of pay-to-win mechanics can still draw the ire of players. From irritating bugs, to poor matchmaking, to kernel-level anti-cheat issues, there’s something for everyone to gripe about!</p><p>But first, let’s quickly review the many positive reviews users have left on Steam. Perhaps the biggest boon <em>Delta Force</em> offers is allowing those who feel disassociated with the <em>Battlefield </em>franchise a chance at rekindling their love for large-scale first-person shooters. The game offers up a lot of freedom: Want to jump from a helicopter while firing a rocket launcher at ground troops? . <em>Delta Force</em> delivers that. But more importantly, players love the feel, the optimization, and the sheer amount of opportunity in the game’s weapons, maps, and modes.</p><p>It’s not all sunshine on the battlefield, though. Many players find they cannot enjoy the experience because it feels like a cheap knockoff of their beloved franchise. Some point toward gun recoil ruining the experience, the presence of too many useless gadgets, and the game’s anti-cheat system, which the developer had to rectify in a post-launch update.</p><p><br>No matter which side of the fence you inevitably fall on, there’s no reason not to try <em>Delta Force</em>. It’s a free-to-play game with no pay-to-win mechanics. Plus, the developer resolved the anti-cheat software woes. Here’s your look at <em>Delta Force</em>, as told by Steam reviews! <br></p><hr><figure id="" data-id="803fabb66c8887edb7d2957af5b0cbbc" data-recommend-id="image://803fabb66c8887edb7d2957af5b0cbbc"

                <p>Industry analysis firm DFC Intelligence has released its 2024 market report and forecast, and despite the past two years of uncertainty, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">sweeping layoffs</a>, and studio closures, the industry is set to rebound. After two years of major growth fueled by the pandemic, and its subsequent slump, DFC predicts the industry will return to growth in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>As of 2024, the number of gamers worldwide is around 3.8 billion, a figure DFC expects to reach 4 billion--around half the global population--by 2028. Of that number, 10% are considered core gamers and account for 65% of video game spending, while the rest are considered casual gamers, many of whom only game on mobile devices and don't own any dedicated hardware.</p><p>Nintendo is set to be a major winner in the next few years, with its next console (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">colloquially known as the Switch 2</a>) expected to release in 2025 with little competition from Sony or Microsoft. DFC predicts that the Switch 2 will sell 15-17 million units in 2025, and more than 80 million by 2028.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1029654130" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

and console software sales in 2023. The category includes not only video game consoles, but PC parts and accessories, and handheld devices like the Steam Deck. This trend is driven by the core gaming audience, especially PC players who see high-end gaming hardware as a status symbol. Despite the cost of some video game accessories and hardware, DFC points out that it is still far more affordable than other hobbies like "sports cars, arts/antique collecting, travel, skiing, golf etc."</p><p>Despite the favorable outlook for hardware sales, DFC is predicting that there will be a major loser in the next generation of console wars--which could be either Sony or Microsoft depending on a number of variables. Getting in early is likely to be the deciding factor, but DFC also says a portability feature, like the Switch's, could make a difference. At this point Sony has a slight advantage thanks to its loyal user base, while Microsoft could pivot to focus on software and distribution as the largest software publisher in the industry.</p><p>"Overall, 2025 is also shaping up to be one of the best years ever for new game releases," DFC adds, singling out the highly anticipated release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">GTA 6</a>, which is expected to break records. The firm also expects that new consoles from Microsoft and Sony will release sometime between 2026 and 2028, contributing to DFC's prediction that PC and console revenue will reach $200 billion a year by 2028.</p>
