              <p>Some of my favorite games ever are on sale for the Switch right now. You might already own most of these, but I promise most of you will find something worth picking up in the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/">eShop</a>‘s latest fire sale.</p> <p>Here’s just a sample:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Paradise Killer</em></strong> – $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>What The Golf?</em></strong> – $8 (60 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</em></strong> – $20 (50 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Moonlighter: Complete Edition</em></strong> – $4.34 (85 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>OlliOlli World</em> </strong>– $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Spiritfarer</em></strong> – $4.50 (85 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Disco Elysium</strong> – The Final Cut</em> – $12 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim </em></strong>– $15 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Inscryption</em> </strong>– $7 (65 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Death’s Door</em></strong> – $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition</em></strong> – $5 (90 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Unicorn Overlord</em></strong> – $24 (60 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Hotline Miami Collection</em></strong> – $5 (80 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Inside</em></strong> – $2 (90 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Risk of Rain 2</em></strong> – $6.24 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Slay the Spire</em> </strong>– $8.50 (66 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster</em></strong> – $15 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Sonic Frontiers</em></strong> – $18 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Civilization VI</em></strong> – $6 (80 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>A few special shout-outs. If you don’t have <em>Slay the Spire</em>, it’s a top-notch deck-building roguelike that you won’t be able to put down. <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>, a loot shooter roguelike, is a similarly irresistible timesink. <em>Inside</em>, meanwhile, is an excellent cinematic platformer adventure game and, in my opinion at least, one of the best games ever made. It doesn’t get enough credit. Only $2? A steal!</p> <p>Finally, <em>Digimon Cybersleuth</em> is an incredibly meaty JRPG for just $5 (the series latest entry <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341">came out this fall</a>), and $15 is a great price for <em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</em>, a wonderfully inventive and surprising visual novel/strategy game mash-up from Vanillaware.</p>

 <h2>The Switch 2 version of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> gets its biggest discount yet</h2> <p>There are actually some decent Switch 2 deals right now, too. They’re nowhere near as good as the ones for games on the OG hardware, but <em>Cyberpunk 2077: The Ultimate Edition</em> in particular is just $40 until November 1. That’s 43 percent off the list price, which isn’t bad at all for a port that only arrived in June. It runs surprisingly well on Switch 2 and is a decent way to catch up on the best sci-fi open-world RPG of the decade (it also supports cross-saves if you already started on another platform).</p> <p>What else is on sale on the Switch 2 at the moment?<em> Sonic X Shadow Generations</em> is just $30 right now (40 percent off) and GOTY contender <em>Split Fiction</em> is just $40 (20 percent off). The Switch 2 port of <em>EA Sports Madden NFL 26</em> isn’t the best but it’s currently $20 off the standard price. So is <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, a very solid lifestyle sim RPG that arrived back with the launch of the Switch 2 earlier this year.</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 has already set a world record, thanks to Xbox, helicopters, and a gigantic TV screen.</p>



<p>Releasing on October 21st, the newest entry in the Ninja Gaiden franchise is shaping up to be quite the title. With the help of PlatinumGames and Xbox, Team Ninja finally made <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new mainline entry</a> after almost thirteen years. The game, which features two protagonists, Ryu and newcomer Yakumo, plans to bring the epic 3D fights to the new generation. Luckily, thanks to Xbox and a few outliers, the title is already setting a pretty impressive world record.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQje3P-QW58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a video released by Xbox</a>, a world record attempt was made for the largest helicopter video game display flown in Miami Beach, Florida. With the help of Team Ninja’s community manager, Emmanuel “Master” Rodriguez, and rapper Swae Lee, they played Ninja Gaiden 4 in a helicopter. The 26-foot wide display was being flown by another helicopter piloted by Heli-D. It took place 20 m² (215 ft² 40 in²) in the air. Luckily, Guinness World Records bestowed Team Ninja and Xbox <a href="https://x.com/GWR/status/1980266739947499719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with the world record</a>.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4, set to launch on Xbox Game Pass, has shown a lot since it’s February reveal. With previews of the title calling it a return to form, fans may be in for quite the treat. While the world record isn’t for it’s sales or gameplay feats, it doesn’t make it any less impressive. On that note, Xbox also has a first-party title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-outer-worlds-2-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, releasing next week, making for two major titles for the company in October. Plus, both are playable on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asus ROG Xbox Ally</a>, so you can enjoy them on the go whereever you are.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/psn-fortnite-roblox-and-other-gaming-services-are-starting-to-recover-from-the-aws-outage.1329835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today's AWS Outage <a href="https://wccftech.com/aws-outage-snaps-chatgpt-fortnite-down/">took down about half of the internet</a>, with apps and services across industries suffering issues throughout the day. Thankfully, we're starting to see the service slowly crawl back to life, which means that major gaming services that were taken down, like Fortnite, Roblox, and PSN are starting to recover.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, Epic Games is reporting "<em>All Systems Operational</em>" <a href="https://status.epicgames.com/">on its service status website</a>, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-halloween-sale-2025/">Epic Games Store</a>, Fortnite, Rocket League, and Unreal Engine. Roblox is still reporting the issue as an "<em>Active Incident</em>" at the top of <a href="https://status.roblox.com/pages/history/59db90dbcdeb2f04dadcf16d">its service status page</a>, though the last update on the timeline of the issue does state that AWS has informed Roblox it is back online and operational.</p>



<p>Regarding the PlayStation Network (PSN), PlayStation is <a href="https://status.playstation.com/">also reporting that all of its services are up and running</a>, and EA is also reporting its services across all of its games, including Battlefield 6, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/server-status/">are back online</a>, after players were reporting issues seemingly caused by the AWS outage.</p>



<p>The actual <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">AWS Service page</a> is currently only reporting "<em>Impacted</em>" service in North Virginia, with other regions all listed as being operational. That said, if you do continue to encounter connection issues when trying to matchmaker in a game or even just connect to the PlayStation Store, and you've already ruled out your own internet as being the issue, then there might still be some lingering issues.</p>



<p>Hopefully, any outages will be cleared up soon, and these signs of recovery are already an indication that anyone looking to get some gaming time in today shouldn't have a problem, even if you're planning to play online.</p>

              <p>Canada’s Fan Expo is the nation’s largest geek-themed convention, attracting the crowds for its comics, sci-fi, horror, anime and gaming events, alongside big-name guests and their autograph-hunting acolytes. It also draws in a massive number of cosplayers, and where cosplay appears so does <em>Kotaku</em>‘s crack team of photographers from Mineralblu. We’ve put together a gallery of some of the best and most intriguing fits from the recent convention.</p> <p>2025’s Fan Expo was not short on big-name celebrities. Appearing at the event were the likes of <em>Star Wars’ </em>John Boyega, Tyler Hoechlin (aka the best Superman), the legendary Juliet Lewis, and <em>the</em> Michael J. Fox. (It’s worth noting that <a href="https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpocanada/celebrities/">next year’s event</a> has already managed to line up all four hobbits from the original&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em> movies.) But we push such famous people aside, uninterested in their shiny faces, because we want to see the people dressing up as other famous people: the cosplayers.</p> <p>Mineralblu have sent us over a great mix, with some (now) traditional appearances from&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, some classics like a great Princess Leia, and some old-school <em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>, along with the outright unusual such as a Dry Bowser. Click on to see the fully gallery of amazing outfits.</p>

              <p>I was hanging on for dear life this weekend. I spent about 13 hours in <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ “Server Slam,” a test of the game’s servers and overall game stability ahead of its release on October 30, and it’s clear that the game clicked with me so well, I might hardly leave my apartment anymore. Farewell social life and other hobbies; <i>Arc Raiders</i> is nearly here and I don’t know if I can resist its call.</p> <p>A PvPvE extraction shooter, <i>Arc Raiders</i> makes for a rough experience, but also a thrilling one. It is also, clearly, the multiplayer game I’ve been searching for ever since it was announced that <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-dmz-beta-warzone-dead-activision-1851066541"><i>Call of Duty</i>’s DMZ was headed for a slow, un-updated death</a>. So allow me to tell you of the unbelievable thrill that was <i>Arc Raiders</i> this weekend.</p>

 <h2><i>Arc Raiders</i> is a hostile game. That’s the point</h2>  <p>There’s no way around this: Extraction shooters are just mean. And <i>Arc Raiders</i> is <i>nasty</i>.</p> <p>The lone map provided during the Server Slam was replete with hiding spots from which you could plan an ambush. Though you can’t lay prone, it’s pretty easy to hide in bushes, and the interiors of buildings have their fair share of corners you can exploit. Survival is about keeping your head on a swivel and your ears perpetually open for random sounds that can signal the presence of a threat before you can see it.</p>

 <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>, like many other extraction shooters, sticks you right in the midst of a fight-or-flight response and exploits that tension for a one-of-a-kind dopamine rush if you make it out alive, and one hell of a come-down should you fail. No, it’s not fun when you lose all your shit from a kill you could never see coming; yet somehow you need to push past that to find “fun.” It’s not for everyone.</p>

   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9wwpk/when_your_best_isnt_good_enough/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><i>Arc Raiders</i> is mean</a> in a way that a simple battle royale or team deathmatch just isn’t. You can die so quickly and, true to the genre’s conventions, death puts you at risk of losing your best gear. It often doesn’t feel fair; that’s a tough pill to swallow. Don’t worry, though; plenty of mean people will eventually get what they deserve in a later round when they inevitably push their luck too far. That’s just what this game is about: The deep, crushing feeling of loss is why the feeling of winning is so exhilarating. The highs are so high <i>because </i>of the depths of the lows.</p>

 <p>This is what I love about the PvPvE extraction genre: Everything matters and punishment is swift. The distant clap of gunfire isn’t set design, it’s an actual firefight that could quickly become your problem if you’re too close. You can hear nearby enemy players break into various loot caches, digging around for supplies, and that becomes a signal that you need to either GTFO or draw your weapon and be prepared. Enemy Arc drones and other machines are an essential part of this experience: They’re an opportunity for good loot, an engaging gun battle, or the best distraction in the world from enemy players who have you outgunned. The PvPvE is a triangle you rotate around.</p>

    <p>Fleeing battles during the Server Slam was sometimes as exhilarating as participating in them. The experience of trading shots with enemy players down long corridors of an abandoned water treatment facility, only to need to race down the labyrinthine maze of hallways, tossing smoke grenades behind me and barely making it to a door I can shut, giving me a precious few seconds to heal up and continue my escape or make a stand taps into something so exhilaratingly primal in my brain that even thinking about it makes my skin tingle a bit.</p>

    <p>Perhaps because it’s October and I’ve been on a huge survival horror kick in general, it dawned on me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oalxph/straight_out_of_a_horror_movie/">extraction shooters and horror games</a> seem to poke at the same network of neurons in the human brain. Seeing another player can be a jumpscare; hell, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9khke/we_can_all_agree_that_this_is_scarier_than_arc/">the game’s tumbleweeds</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oa9ruw/every_signle_damn_time/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">random bits of garbage</a> that float around as set design often trigger a kind of PTSD response as, in order to survive, you do have to sort of assume anything that moves is a potential threat. I’ve shot a few tumbleweeds impulsively because surviving in this game means you have to close that distance between seeing a moving thing and shooting it.</p>    <p>And when things break out into full-on firefights with either human players or the game’s machines, it’s a spontaneous game of survival unlike anything else, given the real risk of dying and <i>not</i> respawning, losing your weapons and essential crafting loot. It’s a challenge to not let the lethality of the game consume you and turn your next run into a rage-filled revenge quest. The game is aware of this, as one of the post-death loading screens literally says “This could be an excellent start to your villain arc.”</p> <p>As one Redditor commented after suffering <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9zr2w/i_tried_i_really_tried/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a humiliating betrayal by another player</a>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>I will never trust a raider again. It’s dog eat dog out there, and now this dog is hungry.</p></blockquote> <p>“Sure,” one Redditor replied, “it wasn’t a happy ending, but it’s a far more unique experience.” The risk of betrayal, the tender nature of any temporary alliance, the risk and reward, it’s what makes this whole thing so damn entertaining. Success is in rare supply, so you are regularly chasing it.</p>   <p>Fighting other humans is a ton of brutal, mean fun. But I was very surprised to find the game’s computer-controlled enemies, the E of the PvPvE triangle, were also great sparring partners and, interestingly, helpful informants.</p>

Other human players were added after developer Embark realized that simply fighting the game’s robots, collectively referred to as “Arc,” over and over again <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvpve-extraction-division-dmz-2000631540">got old too fast</a>. And while I probably wouldn’t want to just play a game that pits me against these machines without human antagonistic forces, damn are they enjoyable pests to have roaming the skies.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvpve-extraction-division-dmz-2000631540"><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ 2-Year Delay Explained: Game Was Boring</a></p> <p>Upon stepping out into the game’s post-apocalyptic maps, you’ll regularly see drones flying out in the distance, always keeping an eye on what’s going on underneath them. They come in a few varieties: drones with guns, drones that can summon other drones with guns, and of course the big ones that shoot rockets at you and are a literal terror. They’re deadly, sure, but their presence can also indicate where other players are, which is essential knowledge for survival. Arc drone behavior, whether they’re actively engaged in a firefight with other players or are searching for players they’ve caught sight of, sends a clear message: Either there’s a situation up ahead that you want to <i>avoid </i>or there’s a possible opportunity that you want to <i>exploit</i>. After all, looting a downed player is likely to net you a healthy injection of supplies and a decent chance to find a good weapon.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000637363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637363"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637363">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Drones let you know what you’re potentially getting yourself into while you’re traversing the map. They also make for unlikely temporary allies. On more than one occasion, I fired off shots at drones to lure them to my position to try and shake off some enemy players who were on my tail. Arc can rapidly change the dynamics of a firefight between players as they swiftly dart through the air and ignore the ground-level cover that players are hiding behind.</p>

 <p>And it seems much of the community shares my fondness for these airborne pests. <i>Thank the goddess</i>.</p> <p>One of the most up-voted threads, sitting just shy of 5k up arrows, on r/ArcRaiders is a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oarm5m/please_dont_nerf_the_arc/"> plea to <i>not</i> nerf Arc</a> following the Server Slam. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oawvny/arc_are_not_overpowered_its_a_massive_skill_issue/">Arc’s lethality is the point</a>, others have argued, and they’re right.</p>   <p>Drones also offer a surprisingly fun test of marksmanship. They’re not just flying things for you to mindlessly pump bullets into for the sake of loot and experience points. You really have to place your shots well to come out alive. Shooting out the propellers on these machines can ground them faster than aiming at the core fuselage, but it also makes their flying behavior wildly erratic when a propeller or two is destroyed. Landing shots on them is as satisfying as nailing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_pigeon_shooting">clay pigeon</a> in real life–something I haven’t done since I was a kid, yet <i>Arc Raiders</i> tapped right into that old muscle memory. To top it off, drones carry pretty decent crafting supplies, so there’s good reason to fuck with them if you’re confident you can earn their loot unscathed.</p>  <p>Thanks to all the ways they make the action more dynamic, these airborne pests never frustrated me the way flying enemies in games usually do. They’re useful for dealing with other players and somehow exist in this Goldilocks zone of being a lethal challenge that’s surprisingly fun to take down.</p>

 <h2>Will <i>Arc Raiders</i> shatter the extraction shooter’s glass ceiling?</h2> <p>Extraction shooters have struggled to hit critical mass in the way that, say, battle royales have. At their most intense–when they incorporate rigid survival mechanics like hunger and thirst, deadly fall damage, and the need to keep track of specific calibers of ammo like you do in, say, <i>Escape From Tarkov</i>–they’re just too grueling to ever appeal to a mass audience.</p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> streamlines many of the genre’s survival trappings: There’s no hunger or thirst. You can move pretty fast for a “realistic” game and can survive some pretty steep falls if you jump off a ledge. And ammo is abstracted down to light, medium, heavy, and shotgun (at least as far as what was on offer in the Server Slam). It’s an easier game than many of its more hardcore peers, but it’s still punishing.</p>

 <p>The Server Slam also capped out at a certain level. The game has skill trees that you invest points into to up your survival skills, improving everything from how long you can sprint, to how quickly you can vault over objects, to how much noise you make while rummaging through the detritus of a fallen civilization.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000637362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637362"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637362">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Given the level cap of 15 in the Server Slam, this weekend saw the intensity only ratchet up to a certain point. Once players have the full game, I wonder how chaotic, or potentially unfair, some builds will be, and at what point <i>Arc Raiders</i> may struggle to sustain that Goldilocks zone of tension. The game could also use some more QOL features such as double or triple key bindings and maybe some better inventory management tools.</p>

 <p>Still, I haven’t been this optimistic about a multiplayer game all year and I’m hungering for this game to return in a way that worries me. When the servers went dark last night, I was quite sad.</p> <p>So if you don’t see me in real space after October 30 when this game launches, don’t be surprised. This game is going to be a problem for me, and I’m so here for it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Minnesota Rokkr in the Call of Duty League has rebranded as G2 Berlin, unveiling the brand in a short trailer posted on social media earlier today. This is the latest in a long line of rebrands that have shaken up the face of the CDL in recent months.</p>



<p>The pretty bizarre trailer revealed the G2 Berlin name but confirmed that the team will remain tied to Wisconsin. Per the team’s social bio, G2 Berlin is the home of G2 Esports in the Call of Duty space.</p>



<h2 id="h-enter-g2-berlin">Enter G2 Berlin</h2>



<p>Minnesota Rokkr’s rebrand is the latest to hit the CDL space in the last few months. We recently saw the Vegas Falcons rebrand to the Riyadh Falcons in recognition of the team’s ownership, and then Atlanta FaZe became <strong>FaZe Vegas</strong>, filling the slot.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Some teams have yet to reveal their rebrand, such as the LA Guerrillas M8, which is <strong>believed </strong>to be relocating to Paris for the 2026 CDL season. It has been rumored that a Paris Major will surface late into the new season, taking place just before the Call of Duty League Championship, set to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-champs-2026-hosted-faze-las-vegas/">hosted in Las Vegas by FaZe</a>.</p>



<p>It has been a wild off-season when it comes to ‘rostermania’. We saw aBeZy and Simp split for the first time in <strong>years</strong>, with the former sticking with FaZe while the latter took off to join a super team in LA Thieves. The LA Thieves now goes into the 2026 season with HyDra, Kenny, Scrap, and aBeZy on the roster.</p>



<p>FaZe, on the other hand, boasts Drazah, Simp, 04, and Abuzah, the latter two being young and hungry superstar competitors from Vancouver Surge who had a white-hot run through the 2025 season.</p>



<p>Cellium <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cellium-parts-ways-faze-seven-years-org/">also split from FaZe</a>, finding a home in the Riyadh Falcons.</p>



<p>What team do you think will rebrand next? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Could Launch a Week Early, It’s Suggested]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-launch-a-week-early/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-could-launch-a-week-early-it%E2%80%99s-suggested.1329820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In social circles, rumors are being passed around that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <strong>could be released a week early</strong>. It’s set to drop on November 14, but if the suggestions are true, it could launch around November 7. Before getting into this one, it must be stressed that Activision has said <strong>nothing </strong>about this and it’s based on some loose claims at present.</p>



<p>It doesn’t mean a whole lot if Black Ops 7 is released early. It wouldn’t be the first game to do it and it certainly won’t be the last, but it does mean that fans don’t have to wait <strong>as long </strong>to sink their teeth into it.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-7-coming-out-early">Is Black Ops 7 Coming Out Early?</h2>



<p>Black Ops 7 could be coming out early, if online claims are to be believed.</p>



<p>On social media, some prominent profiles have propagated the rumors, with some suggesting that evidence is leaning towards the earlier launch window for Black Ops 7, set to be released otherwise on November 14.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seems like there’s some evidence of a potential release date change for Black Ops 7 where it could move up a week. Not sure I buy it yet but would be a pleasant surprise if it happens.</p>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1980279695112319158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>It’s looser than loose right now and nothing is concrete until Activision confirms it. We’re not able to corroborate the rumors, either.</p>



<p>Some have suggested on social media that the game’s campaign should drop a week early, which it has done in the past, to allow users to get the single-player portion of the game finished before tackling multiplayer a week later.</p>



<p>Recently, the Black Ops 7 beta kicked off and had some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-beta-cheaters-disrupted/">issues with cheaters</a>, which were reportedly ironed out quickly enough by Activision, with Team RICOCHET stressing how successful the game’s anti-cheat measures were during the beta periods.</p>



<p>In other news, Glen Schofield, co-founder of Sledgehammer Games, suggested that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-call-of-duty-director-says-none-of-the-games-have-been-very-good-since-he-left/">quality of Call of Duty games</a> has dropped since he stopped making them years ago.</p>



<p>Do you think you’d benefit from Black Ops 7 launching early? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu has shared his thoughts on the rise of artificial intelligence in gaming, saying in an interview that AI has some potential for music in games, but he doesn't plan to use the technology personally.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.jasrac.or.jp/magazine/interview/25/251010.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow ">JASRAC Magazine</a>, Uematsu said it's possible AI could help with transitions in game music between sounds, but using generative AI to make new music for games is not something he is interested in pursuing.</p><p>"I've never used AI and probably never will.

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">That same "Chamber" codename appears on the resume of actor Jon McLaren, known for playing Star Lord in Square Enix's 2021 Guardians of the Galaxy game. His resume lists "Project Chamber" as his most recent video game project, labeling it as an upcoming AAA game in which he plays a lead character. He also lists the project as coming from the motion-capture company Beyond Capture Studios. It's that same motion capture studio that has worked with Capcom on games like Street Fighter 6 and the Resident Evil 4 remake.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's not confirmed who McLaren is playing in the remake, it's likely Billy Coen, the male lead in Resident Evil 0 who aids Chambers in her mission to uncover more about a zombie outbreak on the outskirts of Raccoon City.</p><p dir="ltr">Resident Evil 0's opening hours take place on a zombie-infested train, and according to MP1st, the remake will more fully flesh out various plot details and characters only alluded to in the original. That includes making the train's conductor a full-fledged character that interacts with Chambers and Coen rather than only being referenced like in the original.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when the Resident Evil 0 remake will arrive, it's likely still a few years away. A recent statement from frequent Capcom leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963192470768128362" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DuskGolem</a> points towards the Resident Evil 0 remake not releasing until 2028, with another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-are-the-next-remakes-for-the-franchise-report/1100-6523753/" data-ref-id="1100-6523753">rumored remake, Code Veronica,</a> set for 2027. Neither remake has been officially announced by Capcom.</p><p dir="ltr">The next mainline entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, is coming February 27, 2026. It stars the daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft, and will finally return the franchise to Raccoon City.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><i><span>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>has some of the best character customization in Game Freak’s monster-taming series. Lumiose City’s wide array of fashion choices are a welcome change after </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet </span></i><span>locked everyone into school uniforms, but the best addition is that none of these clothing items are gender-locked. So whether it’s skirts or long hair, whatever you see on the rack is yours to buy and wear as you please. The game is pretty fluid in how it lets players present themselves in the world, but even so, it’s got some gendered stuff in its story that some players aren’t thrilled about. However, the fashion freedom is helping people get around some of those limitations.</span></p> <p><span>When you pick your character’s initial appearance, you’re also picking whether the game will recognize them as male or female, regardless of what you’re wearing. However, you’re also picking who your rival is going to be. If you play as a male character, you’ll be greeted by a young girl named Taunie when you arrive in Lumiose City. Conversely, a female trainer will meet Urbain, a boy who has a similar role and aesthetic, but is otherwise a different person. At first, I kinda figured this split would be in service of some shoehorned, heterosexual romantic subplot, but thankfully it never came to that. I rolled credits last night and I’m still not a hundred percent sure what the point of having these two characters is, beyond giving the main cast an even gender divide. Maybe I’ll find out more as I make my way through the post-game. That said, some fans want to play as a girl and have Taunie on their team, or want to be a boy and hang out with Urbain. So while it’s not a perfect solution, some players are taking up crossdressing to present as one gender and still get their preferred rival.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ASUS Made The Xbox Ally X $1000, Not Microsoft]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/asus-made-xbox-ally-price-not-microsoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-made-the-xbox-ally-x-1000-not-microsoft.1329781/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X (and Ally) have just been released, and they’re turning heads on account of a) their processing power and capabilities, and b) their eye-watering price tags. The Xbox Ally X will break the bank at $1,000, which is a huge hurdle for adoption. In a recent interview, Xbox’s president revealed that Microsoft didn’t have any guidance when it comes to pricing.</p>



<p>It was stated that the Xbox Ally X at $1,000 and the Xbox Ally at $599 came straight from the head honchos and market analysts at ASUS, and neither Xbox nor Microsoft had a say in the price tag.</p>



<h2 id="h-this-is-why-the-xbox-ally-x-is-so-expensive">This is Why The Xbox Ally X is So Expensive</h2>



<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a phenomenal piece of equipment, offering cutting-edge handheld capabilities on a device that’s comfort redefined. It has a great battery life, neat cooling solutions, room for expansion, and a splash of RGB, all packaged alongside tactile buttons, a high-quality and durable screen, and punchy speakers.</p>



<p>That was all summed up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our review</a>, anyway.</p>



<p>What the Xbox Ally X also has is a $1,000 price tag, which is enough to put off first-time buyers. In a recent interview <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Variety</a>, Sarah Bond, the President of Xbox, confirmed that Microsoft had no input whne it came to pricing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We looked at, how do we create multiple options for people? And it really was Asus, because this is their hardware. That is all of their insight into the market, into the feature set, into what people want, to determine the ultimate prices of the devices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the staggering price point, Bond revealed that the Xbox Store sold out ‘really quickly’ and suggested that the value that’s being given to gamers for the price is more than worthwhile.</p>



<p>But she has to say that, right?</p>



<p>Bond used the current line of Xbox marketing spiel to further promote the Xbox Ally X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It should be something you can have with you anywhere. You should be able to play any game you want with anyone you want on any device.</p>



<p>We want to make sure that people have a choice.</p>



<p>We want to make sure there’s an option for the power players who want the latest innovations, that want to push the edge of what’s possible, the most demanding players. And then, if someone is looking for PC gaming on the go, they’re a casual gamer, they’re a gaming enthusiast, then there’s Xbox Allys for them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think the pricing point for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is fair, or are you waiting for a price cut before you make that investment? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-will-romance-every-character-in-hades-2-but-under-duress.1329775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My relationship with <em>Hades 2</em> is very much a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJb4tWfpcOg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fuck you and I’ll see you tomorrow</a>” situation. Do I endlessly complain about minor things that I don’t like about it, in its mechanics and its <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story</a>? Yes. Am I going to play another half dozen hours of it tonight? Also yes. As I continue to go deeper and deeper, as compelled as I am by essentially just getting more of <em>Hades</em>, it strikes me that so many of the returning features are basically the same, but just a little worse. Case in point: the romances.</p><p>I am a known dating game lover, and I found the romance options in the first <em>Hades</em> to be delightful, especially because of how unexpected they were. It’s already a narrative-heavy roguelike, stuffed to the brim with characters—being able to have a deeper connection to two of my favorites, Thanatos and Megaera, was a delight. <em>And</em> you could complete both of these romance arcs at the same time, and neither character would get mad at Zagreus!</p><p>In <em>Hades 2</em> you get double the romances, which I should love. The issue is that all these characters feel extremely similar to each other.</p><p>If you’re romancing women, you have the options of Nemesis and Eris. While they’re quite different from each other in terms of the way they talk and interact with the world, when it comes to player character Melinoe, the relationship is defined by high-key just hating her. Nemesis thinks that <em>she</em> should be the one to take down Chronos, who has taken over the underworld, and Eris is literally the goddess of strife and discord. So that’s my options for gay romance: two women who hate me.</p><p>The men aren’t much better. While I like both Moros and Icarus, they suffer from their personalities being too similar. Yes, they have different backstories and their stories with Melinoe play out differently, but they’re also both these sensitive, wilting men who leave me longing for a contrasting character. Like the women romances, their relationships with Melinoe are just too similar for me to have much of a motivation to seek them out. Like much of <em>Hades 2</em>, there’s more options, but it’s difference without distinction.</p><p>What’s so annoying is that there are other new characters who I would love to romance but pointedly cannot. Heracles and Odysseus are both probably too old for Melinoe, but they’re very different from each other, and from the existing romance options. Heracles, as you might imagine, is muscled and gruff, and while he also doesn’t like Melinoe on first blush, he respects her once he sees her in action. Odysseus is positioned as an older brother or uncle type, but he also spends the entire game calling Melinoe “goddess” in a way that makes me, the player, quite flustered—both in myth and in this game, Odysseus has rizz. Most importantly, they are just different types of guys. They are different from each other, and from the existing romances.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve also wanted to romance Artemis since the first <em>Hades</em>, where her Olympian siblings teased her for having a crush on Zagreus. In <em>Hades 2</em> Artemis is once again a close friend who aids you in your struggle, and she’s also still gentle and sweet. I would love to have a chance to romance a female character who actually likes talking to me and being around me.</p><p>Mostly I feel like I’ve lost out on characterization for Melinoe because all these romances are so similar. With both Nemesis and Eris, the main conflict in the romantic subplot is that they don’t like Melinoe, and they have to learn to get along. With Moros and Icarus, both these characters kind of already have a crush on Melinoe and have to learn to get over their shyness. With Zagreus, the romances expanded his character and allowed you to see him from different sides. With Melinoe, I feel like I’m just seeing the same aspects of her character explored over and over—the way she clashes with women, and the way that she doesn’t see how reverent men are of her power.</p><p>Oh well. I guess I just have to play this game for another hundred hours.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bluesky-resistance-bots"><h3>Why Are My Bluesky Bots So Into Irish</h3></a><p>If I have to have uncomfortable social interactions, they should at least be with real people</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/matt-leone-shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history-aftermath-hours"><h3>A History of Histories</h3></a><p>" I don't think there is always a canonical version of, like, the development story of a game."</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions"><h3>Battlefield 6’s Campaign Is An Act Of Narrative Cowardice</h3></a><p>The only thing worse than saying something stupid is saying nothing at all</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/imdb-review-scale-bad-broken"><h3>The Sweet Spot Of IMDb Is 6.3-7.6&nbsp;</h3></a><p>Please enjoy my arbitrary and unscientific system for accounting for IMDb's awful rating scale.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope"><h3>I Will Go Down Swinging Against Windows 11</h3></a><p>The end of support for Windows 10 is a mess</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hades-2-nemesis-eris-icarus-moros-romance]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This year has been an incredible year for gaming. From highly anticipated sequels like Hades 2 and Hollow Knight: Silksong to surprising hits like Blue Prince and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, 2025 proved to be one of the better years for games at every level in recent memory. But if 2025 was great, a quick look at upcoming games suggests that next year might be even better. These are the most anticipated games for 2026.</p>



<p>With this list, only games that are first release and available on multiple platforms are eligible. That means games currently in early access, but planned to launch in 2026, don’t count. Also, if you’re looking for the most anticipated exclusives for consoles like the PlayStation 5 (PS5) and Nintendo Switch 2, those will be posted separately. </p>



<p>As of now, all of these games below are currently scheduled for a release next year. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-most-anticipated-games-of-2026">What Are The Most Anticipated Games Of 2026?</h2>

<h3 id="h-phantom-blade-zero">Phantom Blade Zero</h3>

<p>First announced in 2023, Phantom Blade Zero is one of the most anticipated action RPG titles in some time.

He’s managed to get a cure for his injuries, but it only lasts 66 days. In that time, Soul needs to find out who actually killed the head of The Order.</p>

<p>Characters appearing in the game include a mix of old and new, such as M, Miss Moneypenny, Q, Dr. Selina Tan, and DGSE agent Miss Roth. The game launches on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Switch 2 on March 27, 2026.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1a93377be213f"><a title="Persona 3 Reload Opening Yukari" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1a93377be213f/persona-3-reload-opening-yukari.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA / Atlus</em></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been dreaming of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> port for Nintendo’s hybrid hardware long before the Switch 2 was even revealed. Having played through its lengthy campaign on my Xbox over the span of a month, I wished I was able to play more of this untethered from my couch. That clearly didn’t stop me from giving it all the time I had, and that desire to dive back in on flights and long <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/passenger-princess">Passenger Prince(ess)</a> drives has only gotten stronger since the announcement of a Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>While the best versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_4_golden">Persona 4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">5</a> have been playable on Switch for a few years, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_3_portable">Persona 3 Portable</a> — which arrived the same time as 4 — wasn’t always easy to recommend as it sacrifices some incredible animated cutscenes andthe 3D overworld is more like a 2D point-and-click. While you won’t find the option for a female playable protag in any version other than P3P, Reload is now regarded the essential way to experience the Dark Hour in the modern age. And later this week, it's available on Switch 2.</p>
<p>The original <strong>Persona 3</strong> and its revised <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/persona_3_fes">FES</a>. release have long been regarded as cult classics: Anyone who played the PS2 or PSP editions will likely have gone into Persona 3 Reload with a lot of nervous excitement. The game tackles a lot of heavy topics that a remake could have trouble reworking faithfully - hell, this is a game where chosen high schoolers fight demons at night by summoning more demons into the world by firing pistol-like 'Evokers' at their heads. Death is present in every part of Persona 3, but I think it’s handled eloquently.</p>
<p>With a remake, if you don’t have the right team behind a project to show it the unique kind of love it needs, you run the risk of losing the plot along the way. Thankfully, Persona 3 Reload was handled exceptionally from the leaders of the Persona series, P-Studio.</p>
<p>So, ahead of the remake's release on Switch 2, I was fortunate enough to chat with Kazuhisa Wada, P-Studio director and General Producer; Yoshihiro Komori, director of the Switch port; and Azusa Shimada, character artist on 3 Reload. I asked them about the performance of this Switch 2 edition, the difficulty of updating the S.E.E.S. uniform and their feelings on excluding the female protagonist from Reload.</p>
<p>You and I both have been waiting for this~</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Zion Grassl): Atlus has grown the Persona series into quite a behemoth in recent years, so what led the team to choose Persona 3 Reload as their first game to release on this new platform over a spruced up version of Persona 5 or even the new spin-off, The Phantom X?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kazuhisa Wada:</strong> The primary reason is that we wanted to release Persona 3 Reload on Nintendo hardware as early as possible, and the development and release for the Switch 2 proved to be the most suitable option. As a result, Persona 3 Reload became the first title for this platform.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our primary focus was on optimizing the graphics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Persona 5 Royal has already been released for the Nintendo Switch, and is playable on the Switch 2. Considering that Phantom X is positioned as a live-service title, we believe Persona 3 Reload offers the most value as the first title for the platform.</p>
<p><strong>How do you even begin the process of re-developing a game that’s this long for another console, like Switch 2? What sort of things needed to be adjusted with this project and where does most of the time go when developing for a new console like this? We can only imagine how long it takes to playtest a project like this!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yoshihiro Komori:</strong> The process of porting to the Switch 2 is broadly divided into two main tasks: 'porting the engine' and 'adjusting the game components.' Although this was the Persona Team’s first time developing for the Switch 2, the use of Unreal Engine made the engine porting process smooth overall.</p>
<p>By being able to create a build that would run on the Switch 2 relatively early in development, we were able to focus our efforts on adjusting the game's components.</p>
<p>Regarding the game itself, no new content was added. Instead, our primary focus was on optimizing the graphics. Given that the Switch 2 has differing hardware performance between TV mode and handheld mode, adjustments were required to ensure optimal visual quality for each mode.</p>
<p>We meticulously fine-tuned the graphics for specific scenes, such as the various floors of Tartarus and event sequences. Additionally, because this title features a very long gameplay duration, a significant amount of time was devoted to QA (quality assurance).</p>
<figure data-uuid="01dba5a28ceb0"><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/01dba5a28ceb0/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA / Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the Switch 2 version will release Episode Aigis simultaneously, we needed to conduct checks for this content in parallel, further extending the QA period.</p>
<p>Alongside the graphical optimizations, the QA team was tasked with carefully checking the processing load for each scene. This aspect added substantial effort to the development process.</p>
<p><strong>While playing on a home console or a PC often offers better visuals and performance, playing Persona games on the go on a handheld device is the way many of us here at Nintendo Life prefer to play! Grinding out a few floors of Tartarus feels perfectly suited for a long train ride or a long flight.</strong> <strong>Have you ever been able to pull any data to see what percentage of Persona users (hehe) prefer to play these games on a handheld device?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kazuhisa Wada:</strong> This is truly a game experience that you can enjoy for an extended period of time, we understand players will appreciate having ways to play in the style of their choice. We are genuinely delighted that the game can now be played on a portable device as well.</p>
<p>We hope you take the opportunity to enjoy Persona 3 Reload to the fullest, even while on the go!</p>
<p><strong>The demo that was recently released on the Switch 2 eShop shows the game running at 30FPS, but with some frame rate hiccups. Is the team hoping to have those problems worked out for the final release of the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yoshihiro Komori:</strong> We are currently taking steps to improve this. Since careful QA is required, it was difficult to address this in time for the main game’s release but will be in future patches.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c897dcafbaf35"><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c897dcafbaf35/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA / Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are you considering offering any graphical options to players to let them choose if they’d prefer better performance or better visuals? Choosing between 30fps and 60fps would be really nice to see! Persona 3 Reload looks great in still images on Switch 2, but we think some players would also take smoother performance over visual quality if they could choose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yoshihiro Komori:</strong> Thank you for your interest in our work and for giving us your request. We have also been positively considering increasing the frame rate; however, for this release, we prioritized delivering the Switch 2 version to everyone as quickly as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We aimed to create changes that would give players the impression of 'powered up and back better than ever!'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such, we regret to inform you that there are currently no plans to implement this kind of requested feature at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Implementing new designs into a well loved, pre-existing world like Persona 3 can be a tricky thing to get right. So we were so surprised to see how sharp and slick the new S.E.E.S. uniforms that are introduced in Reload! Do you remember at what point in development it was decided to change up their uniforms and do you have any original concept sketches you could share?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Azusa Shimada (Character Designer):</strong> The concept for the new S.E.E.S. uniforms was gradually developed starting in the early stages of development. Initially, the idea stemmed from the need for unique visuals that would be distinctive to this iteration of the game from a promotional perspective. This prompted discussions with Soejima-san (Shigenori Soejima, the original character designer) about what aspects could be refined.</p>
<p>We aimed to create changes that would give players the impression of 'powered up and back better than ever!' as a defining symbol of this evolution, leading to the adoption of the new combat gear design.</p>
<p>Around the same time, concept for the new mechanic, 'Theurgy,' was also being developed, and it turned out that the two elements worked well thematically. This fortunate alignment allowed everything to come together into its current form.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d06812386e53a"><a title="Persona 3 Reload Concept Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d06812386e53a/persona-3-reload-concept-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Concept art of the new S.E.E.S. uniforms — <em>Image: SEGA / Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Persona 3 Reload offers multiple romance paths, but since you need multiple playthroughs of the game to see them all, we're curious if there was a common choice amongst the development team for who to choose first? If we can only choose one, who would you say we choose?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kazuhisa Wada:</strong> That’s such a very difficult question to answer… For me personally, from all the Persona 3 related stories, my favorite was Fuuka. However, from Persona 3 Reload, I feel Yukari has become so much cuter. I might have to pick her.</p>
<p>Lotus Juice, who does the rap vocals for the soundtrack, was a Fuuka fan like myself, but last I heard, he’s switched over to Mitsuru.</p>
<p><strong>Yoshihiro Komori:</strong> If I were to choose one person to romance, I would choose Aigis. The questions she asks—What is life? What is love? What is the relationship between the heart and the body?—are all deeply fascinating.</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been engaging in dialogues about these topics at Philosophy Cafés (casual gatherings for philosophical dialogues). Exploring these questions with a partner—not just as abstract philosophical inquiries, but as real, tangible decisions on how I relate to someone important—would be a truly romantic and intimate experience.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1e29d91822b8b"><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e29d91822b8b/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA / Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How big is the development team that’s working on this Switch 2 edition and how has it felt being able to bring this beloved game to such a wide platform like Nintendo?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kazuhisa Wada:</strong> The porting process to the Switch 2 turned out to be unexpectedly smooth, allowing us to develop the project at a relatively compact scale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The questions she asks—What is life? What is love? What is the relationship between the heart and the body?—are all deeply fascinating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our hope, given that the Nintendo platform has such a broad user base, is for many players—particularly younger audiences who have not yet experienced Persona—to try the series for the first time. Since Persona hasn’t had many new releases on Nintendo hardware yet, we believe there are still a lot of potential players who haven’t had the chance to play it.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that this opportunity will help more people fall in love with 'Persona' and immerse themselves in the series!</p>
<p><strong>We’ve read in other interviews that the thought of adding the female protagonist into Persona 3 Reload would just be too costly of a task, but can you share any more insight into what those internal discussions were like and if you ever had any thoughts to pay homage to her in other ways within the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kazuhisa Wada:</strong> When it comes to whether we are able to represent her in this game, though it saddens me to have to say this, the answer for Persona 3 Reload would be 'no.'</p>
<p>As developers, we have absolutely no intention of neglecting her, but this heartbreaking decision was made after much deliberation. We have a mission to continue working on various new games as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Soejima-san] truly is a man with a heart of gold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If asked what we feel remains unfinished in the context of Persona 3, this would undoubtedly be one of those things. However, we are working together as a team to develop various initiatives for future endeavors, and we hope you will look forward to what lies ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p><strong>This last one isn't really a question, I just want to pass along my sincere thanks for bringing this game for Switch 2. Persona 3 is my personal favorite in the series, and I'm so excited for Nintendo fans to be able to experience the full package like this, with all of the new bells and whistles that Reload brings! It's such a delightful heart felt game, and it ranks amongst my favorite games of all time. I also had the chance to meet Soejima-san at Summer Game Fest in 2023 while demoing Metaphor, and it really is a memory I'll cherish forever. He was so kind, so please send my thanks!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kazuhisa Wada:</strong> I will make sure to convey this to Soejima-san. He truly is a man with a heart of gold.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for praising Persona 3 Reload. It means a lot to us! It is voices like yours that inspire us to dedicate our lives to game development and keep us going. Your support motivates us to deliver even more remarkable gaming experiences that meet your expectations.</p>
<p>We look forward to your continued support and encouragement!</p>

<p><em>Persona 3 Reload goes all out Nintendo Switch 2 on Thursday, October 23rd; a demo is already available on the eShop that lets you carry over all of your save data into the full release!</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks to Sega, Atlus and the team for helping coordinate this interview for us.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marathon-upset-was-to-arc-raiders-benefit-embark-studios/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Back in April, ARC Raiders and Marathon both hosted playtests that coincidentally overlapped with each other, and according to Embark Studios' technical director, while that was entirely a coincidence, it proved beneficial for ARC Raiders and for Embark Studios.</p>



<p>Embark Studios just got done hosting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/">'Server Slam Test' this past weekend</a>, where the game was available for free on all platforms (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S) for players to hop into from October 17-19. As far as we know, it went well, with the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2427520/charts/">game's Steam concurrent players peaking at 189,668</a>, and it'll be interesting to see what Embark Studios takes from this playtest to implement in the final game.</p>



<p>Some learnings however didn't come from feedback on ARC Raiders at all. When speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-designer-says-marathons-receptionwas-a-great-a-b-test-they-made-decisions-that-we-didnt-and-vice-versa-we-could-compare-and-contrast-how-some-of-those-things-shook-out/">PC Gamer</a>, technical director on ARC Raiders, Virgil Watkins, admitted that Marathon overlapping playtest worked as a good compare and contrast for what Embark Studios was doing with ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>"<em>It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen</em>," said Watkins. "<em>It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>[It] was quite interesting to follow in what players thought about those certain things, or what did work in their context and didn't, and what may have worked in ours</em>."</p>



<p>Watkins doesn't identify any concrete examples, or claim that he and the rest of Embark Studios have been watching over Marathon like hawks, but it makes perfect sense that both teams would be eying each other, if only because they're both making extraction shooters.</p>



<p>While this past weekend's server slam test was undoubtedly popular, it'll be interesting to see how ARC Raiders does when it's on shelves. Unlike Embark Studios other major title, The Finals, it is not a free-to-play experience, so it doesn't have that same appeal of players being able to just give the game a try to see how they like it.</p>



<p>And with regards to Marathon, we know that Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">is hosting a closed test later this month</a> that is invite-only and under an NDA, though the future for that game is far more uncertain than the future for ARC Raiders.</p>

            <p>
There should have been two major extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> launching in the last quarter of this year. One of them is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, which is in fact coming out later this month. The other is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, which, well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">you know</a>. Interestingly, though, with both games hosting tests earlier in the year, there was an opportunity for Arc Raiders' developers to learn something from Marathon.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-designer-says-marathons-receptionwas-a-great-a-b-test-they-made-decisions-that-we-didnt-and-vice-versa-we-could-compare-and-contrast-how-some-of-those-things-shook-out/">PC Gamer</a>, Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins said how it was "very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen. It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out."
</p>
<p>
In particular, Watkins notes how the Arc Raiders team was able to gauge how people responded to the pair of extraction shooters' differing takes on the genre. "[It] was quite interesting to follow in what players thought about those certain things, or what did work in their context and didn't, and what may have worked in ours," he explained.
</p>
<p>
It is worth pointing out that Watkins said he hasn't been deeply inspecting the game or anything, only a select few have been able to play Marathon. Bungie's shooter is obviously in troubled waters currently, but Watkins is curious to see what becomes of it, saying he "[found] the art style very evocative … I'm personally curious to see how that ends up. I hope to see more of that in the future."
</p><p>
Arc Raiders held its final playtest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-final-free-arc-raiders-open-playtest-is-rolling-out-now-showing-off-quests-progression-and-crafting">over the weekend</a> and it seems to have gone quite well, so I myself am curious to see whether the full release will be the one to bring extraction shooters out of its deep niche well. Marathon is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-shows-signs-of-life-with-a-closed-network-test-scheduled-for-later-this-month">set to hold another test this week</a>, but this one is under NDA, so don't necessarily expect to hear anything about it (even if you can probably bet on someone breaking said NDA for Reddit karma or whatever the kids are into these days).

Gameplay for this Futurama mod also feels familiar, as you run around as Fry and complete missions for characters such as Bender, Professor Farnsworth and Dr. Zoidberg. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="fr" dir="ltr">ANNONCE 📣 🎮 : La démo de Futurama Hit &amp; Run, sera disponible le 19 octobre ! Une idée juste parfaite ! 🚀 <a href="https://t.co/cy8WBhoLYL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/cy8WBhoLYL</a></p>— Mooonaa 💕 (@lycheemoona) <a href="https://twitter.com/lycheemoona/status/1979533450718716390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">There's driving too, of course — with Fry able to zoom around a section of New New York in a hover car. One particular mission has Fry escorting Bender back to the Planet Express headquarters while avoiding police in hover cop cars. But there's no sign yet of actual flying — perhaps in future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, the demo includes four story missions, plus a set of street races, vehicles, costumes and other Easter eggs to find and unlock. The demo also comes with an acknowledgement that it currently uses AI-generated dialogue as a "temporary placeholder." The mod team states: "Professional voice artists are already engaged, and their recordings will replace the placeholder content in a future update."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 25 Futurama Episodes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Response to the demo has been positive, not least from Joe McGinn, who worked on the original The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run over two decades ago. "As the lead designer of the original game, I can only say... this looks awesome!" McGinn wrote in a comment on the mod's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKPz3PE7_4s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a>. "I want to play it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/matt-selman-simpsons-hit-and-run-remake">Fans have long hoped for another Simpsons game</a>, and previously cheered on a separate unofficial Hit &amp; Run project that looked set to remake the entire title in Unreal Engine 5. Alas, that idea ran into legal issues with Disney, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/awesome-looking-the-simpsons-hit-and-run-fan-remake-is-complete-but-it-will-never-be-released">its creator has now said the finished version will never be released</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there may well be something new and official for The Simpsons fans to play in the not-too-distant future, as the franchise's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-simpsons-long-rumored-fortnite-mini-season-now-feels-imminent-as-kang-and-kodos-turn-up-in-game">long-awaited Fortnite mini-season now finally appears to be near</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p dir="ltr">Microsoft hasn't officially unveiled a PS5 port for Starfield, but a new report states that announcement will come next year. The RPG from Bethesda Game Studios has long been rumored for PS5 as more and more Xbox first-party games get ported to Sony's system.</p><p dir="ltr">Reliable leaker NateTheHate2 stated <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1980100112702660639" rel="nofollow ">on X</a> that Starfield will be revealed for PS5 in 2026 while responding to a question about the port. In August, a report noted that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-could-come-to-ps5-next-spring-report/1100-6533651/">RPG is set to launch on Sony's system in the spring</a>--possibly alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-getting-a-second-story-dlc-and-more/1100-6534318/">a second expansion</a>. In fact, Bethesda seemed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-starfield-expansion-potentially-teased-in-coded-message/1100-6534528/">tease the name Terran Armada</a> in a two-year-anniversary video for Starfield back in September.</p>

                <p>Absolum launched earlier this month to strong reviews from players and critics alike, thanks to its compelling blend of traditional beat-'em-up action with the replayability and unpredictability of roguelikes and its striking dark fantasy graphic novel art style.

The closest comparison is Vanillaware's Dragon's Crown, or the roguelike mode in Streets of Rage 4--which makes sense, considering Absolum was made by Guard Crush Games, which worked on Streets of Rage 4 alongside Lizard Cube.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/absolum-review-a-sleeper-hit/1900-6418419/" data-ref-id="1900-6418419">Absolum review</a> awarded the game an impressive 9/10, noting its fantastic fluid combat, compelling gameplay loop, and eye-catching visuals. "By tapping into a primordial part of gaming history, Absolum has created something that feels revelatory," wrote critic Steve Watts. "The beat-'em-up genre feels changed, now, and I don't know if there's any going back."</p><p>If you're looking to add more modern beat-'em-ups and side-scrolling action games to your collection, you can also grab Guard Crush Games' previous work with the physical edition of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Streets-Rage-4-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B088B42K9S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Streets of Rage 4</a>. As stated earlier, the game was developed by Guard Crush Games and Lizard Cube, and published by DotEmu, who has been leading the charge with the recent beat-'em-up renaissance. You can pick up the Switch version for $31 at Amazon (was $40).</p><p>DotEmu also recently published Lizard Cube's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Popular+Indie+Rogulite+Absolum+Is+Getting+A+Physical+Release+On+PS5+And+Switch&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-10-20+07%3A34%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-20+10%3A56%3A19&amp;fnarticle_id=6535558&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fshinobi-art-of-vengeance&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fabsolum-physical-edition-preorder-guide%2F1100-6535558%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</a> earlier this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Rumors have swirled for weeks now that the next <em>Fortnite</em> season would be a mini-season themed around Fox’s long-running animated series <em>The Simpsons.</em> Now we have new info from reliable leakers that claims the popular battle royale’s next big update will replace the game’s map with a virtual Springfield from the show.</p> <p>In September, reliable <em>Fortnite</em> insiders like HypeX and Shiina began reporting that the next season of<em> Fortnite</em> would be a <em>Simpsons</em> mini-season. Then, earlier this month, dataminers <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1976199725121716706">discovered Kang and Kodos inside <em>Fortnite’s</em> files</a>. Descriptions of the two characters mention them not being included in the battle pass, seemingly confirming that the rumors of a <em>Simpsons</em>-themed mini-season, complete with a battle pass, were true. Now those same insiders are reporting that the mini-season will replace <em>Fortnite</em>‘s current battle royale map with a Springfield-inspired battlefield.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">SIMPSONS x FORTNITE MAP IS FULLY SPRINGFIELD</p> <p>Also a Nuclear Plant POI — VIA <a href="https://twitter.com/NotPaloleaks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NotPaloleaks</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/SpushFNBR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SpushFNBR</a> <a href="https://t.co/s6H40GbEyK">pic.twitter.com/s6H40GbEyK</a></p> <p>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1979986181413622240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On October 19, multiple <em>Fortnite</em> leakers, including Hypex, <span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/NotPaloleaks">NotPaloleaks</a>, and </span><span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR">SpushFNBR,</a> began reporting that the mini-season’s map would arrive in November and will be “fully Springfield.” Previously, some had theorized that part of Springfield would be added to the current battle royale map, but it sounds like that’s not the case. Instead, it’s claimed that the entire <em>Fortnite</em> map will be replaced with Springfield for the reportedly month-long event. <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Battle">That’s similar to how past mini-seasons have worked</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>On Monday, <a href="https://x.com/NotPaloleaks/status/1980303035936165911">Paloleaks further reported that the map will be cel-shaded</a>, matching the look of the animated series. It’s also claimed that the new <em>Simpsons</em> season will include mash-up skins, likely mixing and matching <em>Simpsons</em> characters with <em>Fortnite</em> characters. I can’t wait to see what Epic does with Peely. Perhaps a Moleman x Peely skin that will make everyone question their sanity?&nbsp;</span></p> <p>As a giant <em>Simpsons</em> fan, I’m both excited about this <em>Fortnite</em> news and scared that I’m going to end up spending far too much money on a bunch of silly digital skins. <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">Yes, I know, I’m part of the problem and I’m sorry</a>. Epic hasn’t confirmed the new <em>Simpsons</em> season yet, and likely won’t until we get closer to November. Until then, I’ll just rewatch Treehouse of Horror episodes and mourn the loss of <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796"><em>Simpsons Tapped Out,</em> the last new <em>Simpsons</em> game released in over a decade</a>.</p>

The Outer Worlds 2 promises even more of that, with a new governing trio fighting for control of the colony of Arcadia, and your Earth Directorate hero somehow in the center of it all.&nbsp;</p><p>With The Outer Worlds 2 launching on October 29 (or as early as Thursday if you buy the more expensive Premium Edition), we spoke to developer Obsidian Entertainment to learn more about how the team tackled its second bout with space-faring capitalism and whether or not real life plays a role in how it crafts its messages.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Unfortunately, those things haven't fixed [themselves]. I'm shocked," creative director Leonard Boyarsky sarcastically tells <em>Game Informer </em>when asked about capitalism's role in The Outer Worlds 2. "These are kind of unfortunately timeless themes that we have to deal with, and we kind of always deal with it in our games. We've always been involved in themes of power and balance, and it has to do with people having power and what they're going to do with that power, and it's generally not good for the people who don't have power, whether it's the Protectorate, who is full authoritarian and makes no bones about being a complete dictatorship [or] it's Auntie's Choice, which is trying to find this better way of spinning things so you feel like you're working for yourself [...] but you're still basically just helping them out."</p><p>When asked whether The Outer Worlds 2 reflects changes in capitalistic thought in the six years since the launch of the first game, Boyarsky says Obsidian doesn't try to be that timely. "These are universal themes, and if we time it too close to something going on in the world at a specific time, it gets very dated quickly," he adds. "And again, unfortunately, the bigger themes don't seem to change all that much from recorded history to now. People who have power tend to abuse the people who don't."&nbsp;</p><p>Though Obsidian says the real-world acquisition it went through – joining Microsoft and Xbox Game Studios – had no effect on the messaging within The Outer Worlds 2, curiously, Moon Man-fronted Spacer's Choice and Auntie Cleo's have merged in this sequel to create Auntie's Choice. This new organization represents the merchants of the game's trio of power, which consists of the aforementioned Auntie's Choice, the monarchy (Protectorate), and the church (Order of the Ascendant).&nbsp;</p><p>Boyarsky says the idea of this merger actually happened relatively early in the sequel's development. Two narrative designers who worked on the first game &nbsp;– Boyarsky notes they aren't "at the company anymore unfortunately" – came up with the idea of merging Spacer's Choice and Auntie Cleo's.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was the natural way to go," he says. "To put them together, it made the most sense. They were the ones out of everybody in all of the corporations in the colony; they were the ones who seemed to have the most presence. Putting them together was a no-brainer."&nbsp;</p><p>He and game director Brandon Adler tease that players will have to see how Auntie's Choice handles its role in this trio of power in The Outer Worlds 2 when it launches this month.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/09/30/the-outer-worlds-2-cover-story"><em>Game Informer's </em>cover story for The Outer Worlds 2</a> is available to read right now if you're a subscriber (and this issue is shipping to mailboxes as we speak).
