			<p>Starfinder: Afterlight is a new turn-based RPG from developer and publisher Epictellers Entertainment, that's currently set to arrive on PC sometime in 2026 as an early access title on Steam. There's also a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight">Kickstarter campaign</a> players can register their interest in now, to be a part of the development journey for this new sci-fi fantasy adventure.</p>



<p>Set in the world of the popular tabletop role-playing game, Starfinder, this new adventure includes new characters, each with their own unique story lines, and brings Starfinder's second edition ruleset to the digital world for the first time.</p>



<p>Epictellers Entertainment will be working in collaboration with Starfinder's creators, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pathfinder-kingmaker-crpg-chris-avellone/">Paizo</a>, on the project, but Epictellers will be the ones both publishing and leading development on the game.</p>



<p>"<em>We’re thrilled to unveil Starfinder: Afterlight in partnership with Paizo,</em>" said Epictellers Entertainment co-founder and chief executive officer, Ricard Pillosu, in a press release. "<em>This marks the beginning of a journey we want to take alongside Starfinder fans everywhere. We can’t wait to share more about the ragtag crew navigating the Pact Worlds, full of danger and adventure."</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>For Paizo's part, publisher and chief creative officer, Erik Mona, added, "<em>Starfinder’s universe is rich, vast, and beloved</em>. <em>Epictellers Entertainment's vision aligns perfectly with the essence of our galaxy. We believe they’re the ideal team to bring this next chapter of the franchise to life.</em>"</p>

<p>Afterlight will have you assemble six companions for your journey, each fitting into one of six categories for the turn-based fights: soldier, envoy, operative, mystic, solarian, and witchwarper. You'll travel to multiple locations in the universe and engage in a narrative-focused adventure where the choices you make will impact the outcome of the game.</p>



<p>Another interesting tidbit is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-features-voice-acting-from-neil-newbon-astarion-in-baldurs-gate-3/">Neil Newbon</a>, the actor who many will know from <a href="https://wccftech.com/larians-final-major-game-patch-for-baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-is-out-now-on-all-platforms/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and most recently from Surgent Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/surgent-studios-dead-take-release-date/">Dead Take</a>, is directing the voice cast.</p>



<p>Today's announcement and screenshots have provided a good foundation for what Afterlight could become, but the real test is always the first view of live gameplay. Hopefully, we'll be able to check some gameplay footage before the end of the year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/improve-your-rimworld-odyssey-experience-with-these-excellent-quality-of-life-mods.1259820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i>RimWorld </i>has come a long way since its initial launch in November of 2013. Back then, a lot of what made the game great today was simple and barebones. Through regular content updates and multiple expansions, the team at Ludeon Studios has crafted one of the greatest story-generating colony sim games in this niche genre. But it’s the modding community that carries the torch forward. They’ve introduced the community to total overhauls, eyebrow-raising inclusions, and, of course, the ever-beloved quality of life mods. Let’s explore a few of those that many of us long-time players can’t do without!</p> <h2>Neat Storage</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614367"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614367">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / seobungzu</figcaption></figure> <p>One of the earliest rooms you’ll construct for your base—or, at the very least, that you should construct—is a storage room for everything you brought in the crash landing. If left outside in the weather and the fauna, your packaged food will quickly deteriorate. But no one wants to walk over junk on the floor, right?</p> <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3416243474&amp;searchtext=neat+storage">Neat Storage</a> enables clean, aesthetically pleasing storage solutions for everything from raw resources to clothing to weapons to body parts. The shelves are simply, <i>mwah</i>, gorgeous to look at.</p>

 <h2>Character Editor</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614368"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614368">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / VOID</figcaption></figure> <p>You’ll encounter a wide variety of pawns during the creation process, most of which feature an abundance of quirks, high and low skills, passions, and even injuries. It’s random, and you could very easily get screwed over by the in-game character generator.</p> <p>If you’d rather have a little more agency over your colony, a tool like <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1874644848&amp;searchtext=character+editor">Character Editor</a> will allow you to completely resculpt a pawn into anything you desire. From a pyromaniac god-like character with maxed out abilities to a child warrior turned scientist incapable of cleaning or menial labor, it’s all up to you now!</p>

 <h2>Smarter Construction</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614369"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614369">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / Hultis</figcaption></figure> <p>Let’s be honest with ourselves, pawns in <i>RimWorld </i>aren’t the sharpest tools in the shed. Sure, they’ll satiate their basic needs if left to their own devices, but for everything else, you need to take an active hand in ordering them about. If you want something built, it’s up to your planning expertise. Need a food source, yep, it’s up to you.</p> <p>Pawns tend to construct entire structures randomly, sometimes leading to roof collapses that wipe out whole colonies or trapping a pawn inside an airless room. With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2202185773&amp;searchtext=smarter+construction">Smarter Construction</a>, those mishaps are a thing of the past. They’ll build smart, leaving paths open for trapped pawns, and construct walls and supports in such a way that solidifies the building.</p>

 <h2>Filth Vanishes With Rain and Time</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614370"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614370">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / FrozenSnowFox</figcaption></figure> <p>Occasionally, as in rarely, I’ll play a peaceful colony that focuses on farming, ranching, or selling crafted resources like a merchant. But more often than not, <i>RimWorld </i>devolves into its usual dangerous, destructive planetary war as always. When a fight happens, all the blood, mud, and scorch marks remain until you send out your pawns to clean the place.</p> <p>But not anymore! With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1508341791&amp;searchtext=filth+vanishes+with+rain+and+time">Filth Vanishes With Rain and Time</a>, the next time those rain clouds appear overhead, they’ll help cleanse the land and leave your settlers feeling content and devoid of dirty, germ-ridden thoughts.</p> <h2>Color Coded Mood Bar</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614371" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614371"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614371">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / CrashM / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Every minor and major incident in the game affects your pawn’s disposition. From a lack of food to too few recreational devices to a raid to discovering an underground network of tunnels leading to the ultimate bug hive beneath your base, your pawns will either roll with the punches or roll on the floor. But you can’t take steps to help them overcome such challenges with a clear head if you don’t understand their mood better.</p>

 <p>Sure, you could just go into the mood tab of their character HUD, but who has time for that? With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2006605356">Color Coded Mood Bar</a>, a glance at the top of the screen will tell you everything you need to know. If your pawn’s portrait is red, look out!</p>  <hr> <p><i>RimWorld </i>is available now on Windows PCs, and its latest expansion, <i>Odyssey</i>, launched on July 11.</p>

		<p>Nintendo have announced that the price of the original Switch consoles and accessories will be changing this weekend in the United States. While they do not explicitly state that the price is going to increase, if the price was to be reduced they would be shouting about it, so it’s easy to read between the lines and this is a price hike.</p>
<p>Here’s the text from Nintendo.</p>


<p><em>“Pricing for the original Nintendo Switch™ family of systems and products will change in the United States based on market conditions, effective August 3, 2025. These include Nintendo Switch – OLED Model, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite and select Nintendo Switch accessories.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Other Nintendo products, including certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select amiibo, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo, will also see adjustments.”</em></p>
<p>I have been writing video games news for a very long and I think this is the first time a legacy console has had a price increase, rather than a decrease. Some US retailers have already changed their prices, adding $40-$50 to the price of a Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>As for why the prices are being increased, it’s fairly obvious. The consoles are made outside the US and that means <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cpqvdxzwv22t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tarrifs.</a></p>
<p>The price increase may have little impact as everyone seems to be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/01/nintendo-switch-2-set-a-huge-new-console-sales-record-in-its-first-month/">buying a Switch 2.&nbsp;</a>From its 5th June launch through to the end of the quarter on 30th June, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>&nbsp;sold a whopping 5.82 million consoles globally, completely outpacing the PS5 and PS4 in the process – they took seven weeks to ship 4.5 million consoles,</p>

<p>Onto hardware now, and it's a pretty familiar picture. The Switch 2 is once again head and shoulders above the competition, despite numbers falling a little since last week. Nintendo's latest put up an additional 92,013 sales this time, with the regional total edging ever closer to the big two milly.</p>
<p>The Switch OLED and Lite models have outsold the PS5 once again, though the numbers pale in comparison to those from the successor as more and more people decide to make the switch to Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it will be raising the prices of all of the original Nintendo Switch models, plus certain accessories for the console, this weekend.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on the official Nintendo website, prices for all three console models will be raised "based on market conditions". Just as a reminder, that includes the original Switch, the OLED model, and the Switch Lite, plus "select Nintendo Switch accessories", although Nintendo doesn't specify which ones.</p>

<p>Additionally, "certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select amiibo, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo" will also see price increases. Nintendo hasn't revealed by how much the prices for these products will rise, however.</p>

It's likely that since the console has just been released, Nintendo wants to build up a larger player base before it ratchets up the price of the new machine.</p>

<p>The company does, however, say that it may be necessary to adjust Switch 2 prices in future. I'd imagine that whether this happens or not is contingent on whether President Trump <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0l6g13rlwko" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">increases tariffs or introduces new ones</a>, and since these things can be unpredictable at the best of times, Nintendo is playing its cards close to its chest for now.</p>

<p>While Nintendo doesn't overtly state that it's raising Switch prices due to tariffs, it's almost certainly the reason behind the hike. Nintendo has moved a lot of its manufacturing to Vietnam, a country that's just had 20% tariffs imposed on its exports to the US, and (as is often the way of tariffs) the company is likely passing that cost on to the consumer for its older console.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the original announcement of sweeping tariffs on a number of countries delayed the Switch 2's pre-order date <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">a couple of months ago</a>. Various industry bodies, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments" rel="nofollow">the ESA</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/game-manufacturers-association-opposes-new-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow">Game Manufacturers Association</a> (on the tabletop side), have decried the introduction of tariffs, claiming that they'll have a hugely detrimental impact on the gaming industry.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Itch.io, the indie gaming store<a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-nsfw-porn-games-delisted-collective-shout-1851786841"> that recently pulled all NSFW games from its site</a>, is beginning the process of “re-indexing” adult games. At the moment, this is only affecting free games, and the site is still in discussions with payment providers over how it can return paid-for NSFW games without facing penalization.</p> <p>This all came about after an Australian anti-porn pressure group, Collective Shout, campaigned payment providers to stop working with gaming stores that sold games of which it did not approve. First, <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-valve-adult-content-sex-games-online-safety-act-1851786391">Valve removed hundreds of adult games from Steam</a>, while introducing new and incredibly ambiguous rules about what was acceptable. Then soon after, Itch followed suit, but in a far more dramatic fashion, de-listing any game marked as “adult” or “not safe for work” from the store’s searchable pages. In the process, large numbers of games that in no way contravened even the most broad notions of acceptability were caught in the crossfire, and inevitably many of them were representing LGBTQ+ subjects.</p> <p>Now, itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content">has released a statement</a> saying the store is bringing back free NSFW games, but is “still in ongoing discussions with payment processors,” meaning paid games will be reintroduced “slowly.”</p> <p>To get an NSFW game back on Itch today, developers must check the “No payments” box on their dashboard, making their game not only free, but also unable to accept optional payments from customers. Itch’s excellent systems usually allows customers to pay the asking price for a game, or opt to pay more if they wish. That allows developers to price their games as free but still receive payments from those who want to. That’s currently unavailable for any adult games.</p> <p>Leaf’s post explains that Itch spoke with its primary payment provider Stripe, with which it’s worked for a decade, and has been told they will “not be able to” take payments for “content designed for sexual gratification.” That ludicrously ambiguous phrase is helpful to precisely no one, given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_34">Rule 34</a> and the infinite reaches of kink. However, Stripe does seem to be making some progressive noises. The company asked Itch to share a statement:</p> <blockquote><p>“Stripe is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners, despite card networks generally supporting adult content (with the appropriate registrations). Stripe has indicated that they hope to be able to support adult content in the future.”</p></blockquote> <p>Itch says as a result of this it’s now speaking to other payment processors to try to find a company that can cover what Stripe will not. In the meantime, NSFW games that do not violate Stripe’s current definition of unacceptability will be reviewed and possibly re-listed.</p> <p>The situation, no matter anyone’s opinion on the nature of the games being disallowed, remains deeply concerning. We are seeing multiple stores explaining to customers that their actions are now dependent upon what payment processors will tolerate, given any online store can be held to ransom by these corporations. If you cannot process a payment, you can’t sell a game, and it’s all or nothing. Thanks to the efforts of these ideologically driven pressure groups, companies like Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and the rest fear being associated with controversial adult content, and will simply refuse to work with stores that don’t adhere to their unclear and ever-changing limits. In other words, the moralities of a pressure group dictate the nature of what can be sold on a gaming store, because of the pusillanimous nature of the corporations in the middle.</p>

<p>While this anti-cheat software has proven to be particularly effective, it's not foolproof and it's only a matter of time before cheat-makers find a way around it. Respawn Entertainment CEO and Battlefield Studios head Vince Zampella acknowledged this issue, comparing it to an "arms race" as developers are constantly working on improving their anti-cheat technology while cheat-makers continue to discover exploits in games.</p><p>"It's a weird one because you don't want to talk about what you're doing as it gives people who are trying to cheat a headstart against you," Zampella said to <a href="https://youtu.be/MAA7X9J-Y8Q" rel="nofollow ">Gaming Interviews</a>. "It's a huge thing in the industry; in gaming, it's a constant arms race that we're always putting a lot of effort into. It is something that we would stamp out completely if we could. To the day we die, we will be fighting it."</p><p>Players looking to try out an early slice of the game won't have to wait long, as the Battlefield 6 limited access open beta kicks off on August 7 and then opens up to everyone else starting August 9.

That's a lot of consoles in a short time. As such, the company noted that "demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers." Nintendo aims to "strengthen our production and supply systems" to address the issue.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In May, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-supply-should-be-ready-for-demand-in-us-says-nintendo-of-america-boss/1100-6531600/">believed Switch 2 supply would meet demand in the US</a>. This was obviously weeks before the console launched but echoed Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa's thoughts that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-could-affect-early-adoption-nintendo-says/1100-6531493/">price point would be a bigger factor in early hardware sales</a>. For comparison, Microsoft and Sony struggled with Xbox Series X and PS5 supply for almost a year after launch. However, those systems also came out in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p dir="ltr">But then, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">Switch 2 became the fastest-selling home console ever</a>, moving 3.5 million units in four days. The system helped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-helps-shatter-a-us-hardware-june-sales-record-that-stood-for-17-years-circana/1100-6533373/">shatter a US hardware June sales record</a> that stood for almost two decades, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/">original Switch family of systems will be seeing price increases</a> in the US in a matter of days. Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch Online memberships won't be affected at this time, but that could change in the future. Certain Switch 2 accessories will cost more, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo announced this morning that a number of its products' prices are changing beginning August 3. Specifically, the OLED Switch model, standard Switch model, Switch Lite, Switch accessories, certain Switch 2 accessories, some Amiibo, and Alarmo will be receiving price changes.</p><p>In its statement, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/">which you can read in full here</a>, Nintendo never specifically says prices will go up, but it is safe to assume that will be the case. If the prices were going down, the announcement would have been celebratory and probably appeared on the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/future-nintendo-and-switch-2-news-will-arrive-via-new-nintendo-today-app">Nintendo Today app</a>. It wouldn't have been a no-frills post buried on its news website.</p><p>However, the statement does specify that the Switch 2 console, physical and digital Switch and Switch 2 games, and Nintendo Switch Online memberships will all remain consistent "at this time." That's good news given that Nintendo had already <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-begin-april-24-in-us-with-updated-pricing-for-certain">raised the prices of Switch 2 accessories</a> before taking pre-orders in the US due to the economic environment stemming from US tariffs.&nbsp;</p><p>The price adjustment news comes on the heels of Nintendo sharing a separate <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html">three-month earnings report statement</a>. In it, Nintendo reiterated that it had sold 3.5 million Switch 2 units in the four days following the launch, and has reached over <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">6 million units</a> in the seven weeks after release day. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mario-kart-world/roam-if-you-want-to">Mario Kart World</a> has already sold 5.63 million units. Though mentioned in its report as one of Switch 2's launch games, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour/homework-the-video-game">Welcome Tour's</a> sales numbers were not specified.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/01/switch-accessories-alarmo-and-amiibo-prices-are-changing-but-not-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection is the latest retrospective compilation by <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration/a-half-century-of-gaming-history-stuffed-into-an">Atari 50</a> and The Making of Karateka developer, Digital Eclipse. Bundling the earliest MK titles across arcade, console, and handheld, it’s shaping up to be a robust offering for diehard fans. During EVO 2025, the fan-favorite Mortal Kombat Trilogy was also confirmed for the title.</p><p>Mortal Kombat Trilogy was released in 1996 and is the final version of Mortal Kombat 3 (following Ultimate MK 3) that boasted every character and stage from previous games up to that point. Trilogy introduced Brutalities, a combo-focused alternative to Fatalities that has only resurfaced in the modern MK games, and the short-lived Aggressor Bar, which grants fighters increased speed and damage when filled. Trilogy was available on PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, PC, and even Tiger's R-Zone headset/handheld, but Digital Eclipse has not yet confirmed which version(s) of the game will be included in Legacy Kollection.&nbsp;</p><p>Trilogy joins the growing list of games in the Kollection, which includes multiple versions of Mortal Kombat 1, 2, 3, and 4, as well as handheld entries, such as the Game Boy Advance titles. Several games now boast online multiplayer with rollback netcode. The Legacy Kollection also features a new interactive documentary (a Digital Eclipse trademark) detailing MK's history with over 25 interview subjects, including creators Ed Boon and John Tobias.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital Eclipse also announced that Legacy Kollection will be released in physical editions for consoles and PC. This will come in three forms: Standard, Deluxe, and Kollector’s Edition.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZZ_pJv5wk8?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZZ_pJv5wk8?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The <strong>Standard Edition</strong> ($59.99) consists of the base game. Those who pre-order also receive one of four exclusive ninja-themed slipcovers based on Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Smoke. The physical Standard Edition is available for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and Switch. It will ship on December 12.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>Deluxe Edition</strong> ($79.99) packs in a steelbook case, magnet, poster, lenticular card, arcade flyers, mini-marquees, and arcade cabinet cards. This edition is only available for PlayStation 5, Switch 2, and Switch and will ship on December 12.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, the <strong>Kollector’s Edition </strong>($149.99) includes all the previous goodies plus a Goro controller holder statue, a commemorative arcade token, a hardcover art and lore book, and a Scorpion/Sub-Zero pin set. This edition is available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC. There is currently no shipping date for the Kollector's Edition.&nbsp;</p><p>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection still doesn’t have a release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> fans won't have to worry about a deluge of out-of-place cosmetics and crossover skins, according to head of Respawn and Battlefield Studios Vince Zampelli and general manager Byron Beede.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Zampelli discussed the importance of sticking to the core visual identity of Battlefield as far as cosmetics are concerned.</p>
<p>"I think for us, that's what we've been focused on," he said. "We want to be true to Battlefield, we want this fantasy to feel like you'd expect of Battlefield, so that's what we've been focused on."</p>

<p>Beede, who previously led the Call of Duty franchise before jumping over to work as general manager for Battlefield, when asked about the "Fortnitifaction" of modern FPS games, stated: "That's a hard one to answer right? You kinda have to do things to let people differentiate themselves and be unique, so it's how you do that in a way that doesn't go too far. We don't have to worry about that right now."</p>
<p>When Eurogamer followed up by saying there was a distinct difference between different variations of military cosmetics and American Dad characters (as an example), Beede replied "there probably is a difference, yeah". Beede refused to speak on the topic further.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">having just revealed its multiplayer mode and a global release date</a>, is clearly looking to blast a big hole in the current AAA FPS ecosystem. Whereas other series - like Call of Duty - have been swamped with a deluge of crossover skins and promotional items, there is clearly an appetite for a shooter less eager to throw immersion out the window. Battlefield 6 is positioned to land large on most core FPS platforms. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-is-not-coming-to-the-switch-2-any-time-soon">Not the Switch 2 though, that's safe for now</a>.</p>

			<p>Starfield will reportedly launch on PlayStation 5 sometime next year, along with the game's second expansion and some quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>According to what unspecified sources have <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/starfield-ps5-release-planned-for-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told MP1st</a>, the Xbox Series X|S console exclusive from Bethesda will not launch this year on PlayStation 5 as previously rumored, but only in 2026, in part due to the low sales of the first expansion, Shattered Space. At this time, Microsoft is leaning toward releasing Starfield during Spring 2026, together with the second yet-to-be-revealed expansion and some quality of life improvements. The announcement timeline also doesn't seem to be clear, but it's unlikely the new version of the game will be revealed later this month during this year's Gamescom, nor will it be shadowdropped like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">Oblivion Remastered</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>It's not really surprising to learn that Starfield: Shattered Space isn't selling well. While the expansion's tight narrative elements and its atmosphere that borders space horror are very well done, the expansion doesn't offer anything different from the base game. The asking price also doesn't help, as it is too high for what the expansion has to offer, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review.</a></p>



<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide. Learn more about the base game in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 01/08/2025:</strong> Though Nintendo stated it would wait until Sunday, August 3, 2025, to unveil the new prices for the Nintendo Switch and a few specific Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, it seems that the US retailer Target has let the cat out of the bag early.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-increasing-the-price-of-switch-in-the-us-this-weekend/">VGC</a>, according to <a href="https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=nintendo+switch&amp;ignoreBrandExactness=true&amp;Nao=0&amp;facetedValue=551qz">Target's website</a>, the new prices for Nintendo Switch consoles have all increased by at least $30. The new prices are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $339.99 USD ($40 up from previous price)</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $229 USD ($30 up from previous price)</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $399 USD ($50 up from previous price)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Following a similar announcement at the end of June for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/?srsltid=AfmBOorKwcamh1Em9gwHD9rlcQ7-SZ-YwKnhp8OmOX208TEZnYW1R9bQ">Canada</a>, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/">announced </a>that it will change the price of the Nintendo Switch and its "<em>family of systems and products</em>," including the base Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch OLED, Switch Lite, and accessories. Pricing for the Nintendo Switch 2, however, will stay the same for now, as will pricing for its peripherals and Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions.</p>



<p>Nintendo announced the news on its official website, with a short message that doesn't specifically say how the prices will be altered, but it's unfortunately doubtful that the prices will be decreased. Just as Nintendo did for its Canada announcement, Nintendo says these changes are being made "<em>based on market conditions</em>."</p>



<p>It's also clearly a price increase because while the US price changes will be announced in just a few days on August 3, 2025, Canadians had to wait from June 30, 2025, until today, to find out what the new prices would be. To no one's surprise, they're all price increases.</p>



<p>Before today, the price of a Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED, and Switch Lite in Canada was:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $399 CAD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $259 CAD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $449 CAD</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, everything has been bumped up by at least $20, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/hardware/">the new prices are</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $419 CAD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $279 CAD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $489 CAD</li>
</ul>



<p>So expect the cost of getting a Nintendo Switch console in the US to be a little more expensive when these prices go live in a few days. As a reminder, here's what the Nintendo Switch family of systems costs in the US today, before the price increases:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $299 USD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $199 USD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $349 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>Nintendo also clarified that while the Nintendo Switch 2 console and most of its peripherals would not be getting a price alteration, some Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, like the Alarmo clock and certain Amiibo, will get price adjustments. </p>



<p>Even though the Nintendo Switch 2 isn't getting a price change now, it's a little concerning that the previous generation is getting a price bump. The Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-through-6-million-units/">selling extremely</a> well so far, but with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-president/">tariffs</a> potentially behind these price increases, and the Switch 2 proving that players are hungry to jump from their eight-year-old Nintendo Switch console, it makes you wonder when Nintendo will pull the lever on increasing prices for the Switch 2.</p>



<p>In its statement on price changes coming after this weekend, after stipulating that Switch 2 prices are not impacted in the changes announced today, Nintendo says, "<em>However, please note that price adjustments may be necessary in the future."</em></p>

            <p>With unofficial Oblivion remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-still-on-track-for-a-2025-release">aiming to arrive this year</a>, one of its developers has kicked off a new dev diary series documenting the work they've been doing to get the massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">Skyrim mod</a> ready to emerge through the release gates.</p>
<p>While the folks behind Skyblivion certainly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-skyblivion-still-looks-stunning-in-latest-development-update">haven't been shy</a> when it comes to regularly showing off their progress, it's always cool to see more of the blood, sweat, and tears that's going into finally getting such a gargantuan undertaking into players' hands. Then again, maybe I'm just partial to trippy glimpses at Uriel Septim's detached head floating in the development void.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Finishing Skyblivion is the name YouTuber and Skyblivion implementation lead Heavy Burns has given to this series they've just released the first episode of, and it certainly delivers on said trippy glimpses right off the bat. You see, among the various bits and bobs documented in the video is putting the final touches on exported NPC head models the mod's artists have developed, to ensure they look as detailed as the mod's character creator will allow.</p>
<p>Cue shots of severed heads with glowing purple eye holes sitting in the great grey unknown, ready to have their brows, beards, and trims retextured so they look a bit more presentable. Among the characters getting makeovers here are the likes of the Dark Brotherhood's Lucien Lachance and emperor Uriel Septim himself. The fact that the devs have made the latter look exactly like his bald acting man Patrick Stewart definitely adds to the weirdness of the floaty bodylessness.</p>

<p>There are also a couple of bits that'll likely be of interest to youm regardless of whether you get as much of a giggle from the bizarre visuals afforded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-devs-used-their-bethesda-visit-to-fight-the-good-fight-asking-todd-and-co-to-bring-back-skyrim-style-official-modding-tutorials">WIP mods</a> or games as I do. There are some nice looks at how Anvil and the Imperial City are shaping up, with Heavy Burns revealing that the latter's "the final part of the overworld that is yet to be finished" ahead of release.</p>
<p>There's also some statue installation in the realm of Oblivion you'll travel to as part of Boethiah's Daedric quest, and while it's still quite lava-filled, it's got plenty of nice touches to set it apart from Mehrunes Dagon's chambers of evil. Kerb-tweaking and sign-making are also covered, if you're interested in learning the ins-and-outs of some modding for yourself.</p>

            <p>
It's time for another bulletin from the exciting world of desexindexification. Itch.io have re-listed a bunch of free adult-themed games that were taken down as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">a recent massive cull of supposedly licentious materials</a> under pressure from payment processors. Itch are still, however, working out whether and how to restore paid NSFW projects that were removed from public channels as part of their efforts to stop the payment companies suspending store purchases in general. 
</p>
<p>
In a further mild twist, one of the firms behind Itch.io's delistings, Stripe, have now informed the site that they themselves are acting under pressure from one of their own banking partners, without naming names. They'd like "to support adult content in the future". Nonetheless, Itch are still looking for new payment partners who are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material">happier to process this kind of material</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Itch.io's owner, Leaf Corcoran, announced the return of free NSFW projects to search results, browse pages and recommendations in <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content">a blog post today</a>.
</p>
<p>
To be eligible for re-indexing, your game must have the "no payments" option checked under the "pricing" section of your project's editing page on your dashboard. Leaf cautions that any "individually priced files" on that game will become free in the process, as Itch doesn't currently support the ability to have "owners only" stuff on a page configured to be fully free. The site's management are looking at adding new developer dashboard options to address this.
</p>
<p>
As for the paid games, Leaf writes that "we are still in ongoing discussions with payment processors and will be re-introducing paid content slowly to ensure we can confidently support the widest range of creators in the long term."
</p>
<p>
According to Leaf, Itch have had some relatively positive conversations lately with Stripe, a $91 billion corporation and one of the world's largest privately owned financial tech companies. The bad news is that Stripe have told Itch.io that they can no longer support payments for any "content designed for sexual gratification", perhaps the baggiest of recent efforts to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">pin down the kind of adult content the payment processors object to</a>. They have also, however, passed along the below message to Itch.io's users:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Stripe is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners, despite card networks generally supporting adult content (with the appropriate registrations). Stripe has indicated that they hope to be able to support adult content in the future.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Itch are still looking for other partners to handle payments for "adult NSFW content". Leaf defines the latter as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p>pages that have both the "Contains sensitive material" option checked and a tag suggesting adult content (e.g., "porn," "mature," "lewd," "erotic," "hentai," "fetish"). 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Regarding the recent paid game takedowns, Leaf says that "now that we have a more specific definition of what Stripe won't process, we may review that initial list for potential re-introduction", but that the long-term plan remains "to implement one or more new processors to avoid putting the platform at risk".
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>It’s fair to say that Nintendo’s had a pretty good few months. After just four days, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293">the Switch 2 had sold 3.5 million units</a>, making it the most successful console launch of all time. <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801e.pdf">Nintendo is now reporting</a> it sold just shy of six million Switch 2s in the system’s first month, along with 8.6 million games. Of those, an incredible 5.63 million are copies of<em> Mario Kart World</em>. Alongside that, the console company still sold a million new Switch 1s in three months, and over 24 million games for that system. All told, from April to June, the company made sales of 572 billion yen, or $3.8 billion. It’s good to be Nintendo right now.</p> <p>All those numbers take us up to the end of June, meaning there’s actually a whole other month of as-yet unreported Switch 2 sales to take into account, meaning that number is likely closer (by our estimate) to eight million, ahead of Nintendo’s expectations, and well on the way to the company’s goal of 15 million units by March 2026. And don’t forget, they’ve got 2025’s holiday season to come before then.</p> <p>Interestingly, digital sales were down over 13 percent on the same quarter last year, which Nintendo attributes to, er, “a decrease in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software.” Well, yeah, selling fewer digital games would certain explain the lower sales of digital games. Piercing insight. There was also a drop in what Nintendo calls “IP related business,” down 4.4 percent, which is explained by “a decrease in movie-related revenue.” That’s actually a pretty impressively small drop, given it’s two years since&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> was released.</p>

 <p><em>Mario Kart World</em>‘s sales of almost six million, in large part a consequence of the game being offered as a bundle with the Switch 2 itself, make it the most successful <em>Mario Kart</em> launch ever–that’s pretty stunning given there was no previously established userbase for the console. For context,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart Wii</em> launched two years after the Wii came out, and sold an estimated 4.7 million copies in its first four months. <em>Mario Kart 7</em> was limited by the low sales of the 3DS, but <em>Mario Kart 8</em> had the reverse effect, causing people to finally buy the unloved Wii U, selling nearly 3 million copies in its first month. However, it only reached 8.5 million lifetime sales. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>on the Switch is still the big leader, with astonishing lifetime sales of over 64 million copies, but even that was slower out of the gates than <em>Mario Kart World</em>. That game took a year to get to nine million copies, meaning&nbsp;<em>World</em> is well on its way to smashing that number.</p> <p>It’s notable that given 5.82 million Switch 2s have been sold (and that’s sold to real people, rather than just shipped to stores), and 5.63 million copies of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, that the game is almost ubiquitous among the console owners. That means people who didn’t opt for–or were unable to buy–the bundle have been buying a separate copy anyway. Yes, fair enough, it’s not like people were spoiled for choice when the Switch 2 launched, but it remains a remarkable number. It’ll be fascinating to see how&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> has sold, and even more fascinating to visit the alternate reality where Nintendo had that game ready for launch.</p>

For anyone who loved the game or just wants a standout modern video game score on vinyl, this is the definitive way to own it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Clair Obscur Expedition 33 OST 2LP Vinyl</h2></div><div catalogid="cc6335df-3420-4768-b922-7b82882a2362" id="225963"><div id="225963" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Clair Obscur Expedition 33 OST 2LP Vinyl</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2LP version of the Clair Obscur Expedition 33 soundtrack is a more affordable option at $42 compared to the $145 6LP box set, but it includes only 20 specially mastered tracks instead of 63. It still features key pieces like Lumière, Une vie à peindre, and the main character themes, and it has the same artwork style and gold-foiled packaging. If you just want the highlights on vinyl without committing to a full collector’s box, this version covers the essentials while keeping the price and size down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

3 inches and opens up to reveal a game room with a sofa, a tiny arcade cabinet, a CRT TV, and numerous decorations often found in game rooms. The items on the display shelves are a nice touch. Above the couch, you can display three game console boxes and a pair of minifigure-style statues. On the other side of the room above the TV, there's a sword mounted to the wall and what we can only assume is this guy's prized Lego Star Wars starship he spent a dozen hours building.</p><p>The room belongs to the "Gamer Minifigure," who has a five o'clock and shaggy hair. The set also comes with a tiny game controller for the minifigure to hold.</p><p>The arcade machine you're building here is called Space, a vertical shoot'-em-up for two players. When closed, the red and black cabinet looks appropriately retro thanks to its chunky proportions and several stickers. The marquee sticker has those classic block letters that make it look like each letter is a spaceship entering lightspeed, and the screen sticker has pixelated graphics.</p><p>If you insert coins in the slots on the front, they will fly back out through the coin return--just like when you tried to trick arcade cabinets into accepting pennies instead of quarters.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4541957-legoarcademachine.png" data-ref-id="1300-4541957" data-ratio="0.426" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4541957-legoarcademachine.png" data-ref-id="1300-4541957"></a><figcaption>Lego Arcade Machine 40805</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4541957-legoarcademachine.png"></figure><h2>Lego Video Game Hardware Building Sets</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-PAC-Man-Building-Replica-Nostalgic/dp/B0CGYQ2WJC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Icons: Pac-Man Arcade (2,651 pieces)</a> -- $270</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Game Boy (421 pieces)</a> -- $60 | Releases October 1</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Nintendo Entertainment System (2,646 pieces)</a> -- $330 | Retired, $270 MSRP</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Atari-Building-Adults-Pieces/dp/B01N9DA98E?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Icons: Atari 2600 (2,532 pieces)</a> -- $240 | Retired</li></ul><hr><p>If you like the idea of building an arcade machine out of Lego bricks, it's worth noting that Lego partnered with Bandai Namco back in 2023 to add Pac-Man to its Icons lineup. The 2,651-piece display model measures 12.5 x 10 x 7 inches and has a lot of really impressive features, including a four-way joystick, an illuminated coin slot, adjustable game score display, and a mechanical maze to simulate a round of Pac-Man. Buildable Pac-Man, Blinky, and Clyde figures can be attached to the top of the cabinet. There's also a separate miniature arcade with a tiny Pac-Man cabinet and a minifigure. Just don't show Mr. Gamer Minifigure the tiny cabinet, as he might try to move it to his game room. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-PAC-Man-Building-Replica-Nostalgic/dp/B0CGYQ2WJC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Icons: Pac-Man Arcade</a> is in stock at Amazon for $270.</p><p>In case you missed it during San Diego Comic-Con, Lego fully unveiled the highly anticipated replica of Nintendo's Game Boy. The 421-piece display model comes with two buildable cartridges, three swappable lenticular screens, and two stands. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Game Boy is available to preorder for $60</a> and releases October 1.

Back in 2020, Lego created a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2,646-piece Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. Unfortunately, the Lego NES retired last year.

            <p>What a difference just a day or two can make. Earlier this week, indie developer Pere Albacar put out a social media post promising followers a free Steam code for his upcoming release Sands of Hope, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-hollow-knight-silksong-does-actually-get-an-announcement-today-this-dev-promises-to-give-away-at-least-32000-free-games">only if Team Cherry's highly anticipated sequel Hollow Knight: Silksong got an announcement during yesterday's Nintendo Direct</a>.</p>
<p>The post soon garnered a lot of attention online, attracting over 34k replies - which would have been a lot of free Steam codes! In the end, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">Silksong was once again a no show at yesterday's Direct</a>, but that didn't matter to Albacar. </p>
<p>"I was very nervous during the Direct... you can imagine," Albacar told Eurogamer with a laugh, adding his initial post "started as a joke and got out of control very quickly". The developer and Guateke Studios founder added he tried to answer comments for the first 20 or so minutes, but after that they very quickly "started coming in by the hundreds".</p>

<p>Things have calmed down a bit now, but even so, this week has done wonders for Albacar's own indie release, Sands of Hope, which in the last two days has been added to over 3000 wishlists and is now appearing on Steam's homepage in the Popular Upcoming list, all thanks to that one social media post.</p>

<p>Sands of Hope is set to release on 4th August, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2821450/Sands_of_Hope/">via Steam</a>. "Explore the sandy landscapes of Cydonia as you use your ancestral powers to build and attach magnetic cubes, find energy cores to restore the land's water flow and meet other villagers with the help of a loyal dog," reads the upcoming game's description (and, yes, you can pet the dog).</p>
<p>"I'm so grateful for the reception of Sands of Hope by the community," Albacar continued. "Some of the most repeated comments were 'Even if there's no Silksong, I will get Sands of Hope' and 'I didn't know about your game, but it looks great!'... We're a team of only two, with no publisher, so all this attention on our tiny game a few days before release could be game-changing."</p>
<p>Albacar has been developing games since 2018, and taught himself coding along with "all the dozens of skills needed to make a game solo or with a tiny team". Sands of Hope will be his commercial game, which he developed alongside his friend, Frankie. The duo has self-funded the project, with work on it starting in February last year.</p>
<p>"We had talks with many publishers, but the industry climate, and our plan to keep the development time short and release in 2025 made it very difficult to close a deal," Albacar said. "I believe that to survive as an indie in this time, you've to be very smart and efficient in the game you make and how long it takes to finish it with a good quality."</p>

<p>Albacar closed: "It's very risky to make an indie game, and we have to stand out with creative and innovative ideas that the big companies are not willing to make. And that's why I think we are seeing so many indie hits in recent years, gamers will always be waiting for new and fresh experiences."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3768120/Sands_of_Hope_Demo/">demo for Sands of Hope</a> was released earlier this year, and reviews for it are currently looking pretty good overall. "Lovely puzzle game, I like the visual style and the humour. Looking forward to the full release," reads one review from the demo. "This game is very promising," another added.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong">while we may not have Silksong just yet</a>, if you are looking for something to scratch that indie itch, Sands of Hope may be worth checking out.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/a-silksong-social-media-joke-could-be-game-changing-for-this-indie-developer-despite-direct-no-show]]></content:encoded>
