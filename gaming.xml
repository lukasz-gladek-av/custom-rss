            <p>
Blizzard has announced a livestream dedicated to all things Warcraft for the franchise's 30th anniversary next month. </p>
<p>
The <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24149105/save-the-date-for-warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-on-november-13">Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct</a> will broadcast on Wednesday, 13th November at 6pm UK time (that's 1pm Eastern, or 10am Pacific for our friends over the pond) and include announcements relating to various Blizzard games. 
</p>
<p>
"It's a big year for the Warcraft universe and whether you're a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> fan, you've joined the chaos in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warcraft-arclight-rumble">Warcraft Rumble</a>, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you're a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> player, there's something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream," Blizzard teased. "You won't want to miss a moment - or a single surprise."
</p>
<p>
The livestream sounds like it'll host Blizzard's biggest set of announcements this year, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzcon-is-cancelled-again-after-last-years-first-in-person-event-since-2019">the company's infamous BlizzCon event currently sits on hiatus</a>.
</p>
<p>So, what do we expect? Well, it seems likely Blizzard will use the event to shed more light on Midnight, its next World of Warcraft expansion following the launch of The War Within this summer. </p>
<p>Midnight is designed to be the middle chapter in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcrafts-the-war-within-expansion-kickstarts-worldsoul-saga-next-year">trilogy of expansions that commemorate the veteran MMO's first 20 years, and propel it forward into the future</a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to tune into the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, YouTube and TikTok, with as-yet unrevealed rewards for Blizzard fans simply for watching.</p>
<p>Earlier this month I spoke to Jason Schreier about his new book Play Nice, for a look <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/behind-the-scenes-at-blizzard-jason-schreier-talks-misconduct-swingers-parties-and-what-press-got-wrong">behind the scenes at Blizzard and to hear more about the developer's misconduct scandal</a>, swingers parties and much more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> have released an update to the third-person shooter that reverts a lot of tough difficulty changes made in a previous patch. Turns out upping the spawn rate of the vicious Tyrannid baddies across all difficulty modes was not welcome among the meathead murder boys of the Imperium. And this change wasn't the only one that caused enough ructions to justify hasty recalibrations from Saber Interactive. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Last week, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4538031058666780902?snr=1_5_9_">patch 4.0</a> for the action game introduced a "lethal" difficulty mode alongside a new Operations map (the shooter's replayable co-op multiplayer jaunts). It also created a modifier that forced players to stay close to one another, or face swift annihilation. By universally increasing the number of spawning enemies to bump up the hardcore difficulty settings, they also made all lower difficulties tougher. The new difficulty setting was meant to be punishing, but even at the time Saber were unsure about the changes they were implementing.</p>
<p>"Overall these changes are going to make Operations mode harder, but it is difficult to measure by how much," they said in the previous patch notes. "We will continue to monitor those changes and will continue to adjust the balance of Operations mode. This is not the last change."</p>
<p>They were not wrong to be wary. Following the patch, some players were annoyed enough to leave the gamer equivalent of dog poo in a bag on a doorstep, with over 2700 stinky Steam reviews piling up within a week of the patch hitting the game (compared to approximately 340 negative reviews the week before the patch). The general feeling was that Operations had become more frustrating, even on easier difficulties. </p><p>Today, the devs have rejigged things. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4530150757095178287">the notes for Patch 4.1</a>, the developer sets out their reasoning for the previous changes and give details on the roll back. Mainly, that enemy spawn rate has been reduced.  But armour has also been increased in "ruthless" difficulty, damage has been increased for bolt guns, and AI soldier buds will now do a lot more damage to bosses. On top of all that, the "tight formation" modifier that made it hard for players to wander far from co-op pals for solo sniping, has been entirely removed. A significant bug that made your roll distance shorter has also been squashed.</p>
<p>"Your feedback made it clear that the game had become more intense and stressful on lower difficulties, and this was never our intention," said game director Dmitriy Grigorenko in a message to players. "As I’ve personally emphasised in interviews, Space Marine 2 is all about the power fantasy, and Patch 4.0 negatively impacted it for many of you. This is why we’re rolling back these changes.</p>
<p>"The key takeaway for me, personally, is that I forgot that once the game comes out, it's no longer a dev's game. It's yours first and foremost."</p>
<p>When I wrote our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Space Marine 2 review</a>, my biggest gripe on normal difficulty wasn't the number of enemies per se (although it did sometimes get overwhelming). I just hated the Zoanthropes. These floating ranged attackers buff all other enemies around them and force you to fire into the sky ignoring the busy crowds at ground level. They are insect asshats. But would you believe it, even these are getting addressed in the latest patch.</p>
<p>"Fighting Zoanthropes is often reported as a source of frustration," said Grigorenko. "Alongside the changes to the AI Director, we’re taking away some of their shields’ effectiveness to alleviate some of that frustration."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director.1018059/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Ubisoft's long-awaited Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains in development, and now has a new creative director taking the project forward.
</p>
<p>
Despite a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-overtakes-guinness-record-holder-duke-nukem-forever-as-game-longest-in-development">record-breaking marathon on-again, off-again development cycle</a> stretching back <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bg-and-e-sequel-to-be-more-accessible">almost 20 years</a>, Ubisoft appears to be demonstrating its commitment to finally getting Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 done by appointing company veteran Fawzi Mesmar as the game's new creative lead. 
</p>
<p>
Mesmar has worked at Ubisoft for two decades - hey, that's nearly as long as Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has been in development! - and previously served as the company's overall boss of creative development. He's a senior and experienced pair of hands, for a project that has gone through numerous iterations and various senior staffing changes over the years - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-says-michel-ancel-left-ubisoft-amid-investigation-into-his-toxic-behaviour">departure of franchise creator Michel Ancel</a> in 2020 after accusations of toxic behaviour, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-2-creative-director-emile-morel-dies">the sad death in 2023 of Emile Morel</a>, the game's previous creative director.
</p>
<p>
"With more than 20 years as an award-winning game designer and creative director, Mesmar has been instrumental in the successful launch of over 20 video games," a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer today. 
</p>
<p>
"Mesmar previously collaborated with the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 team as VP of Editorial. In his new role, he's focused on continuing to build upon the vision set forth by our late friend and colleague, Emile Morel."
</p>
<p>
It's been well over a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-ubisoft-insists">Ubisoft last told Eurogamer that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remained in development</a> despite various shake-ups at the publisher, and nothing has been seen of it since.
</p>
<p>
Still, the franchise has been kept alive by a polished 20th Anniversary re-release of the original Beyond Good &amp; Evil, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-originally-featured-in-beyond-good-evil-and-other-development-secrets">a wealth of behind-the-scenes content</a> plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evils-new-anniversary-edition-content-demands-bge2-is-made">all-new story content that directly sets up Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a> (which, narratively, acts a prequel).
</p><p>
Discussion of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has bubbled up again this week in the wake of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/">Insider Gaming</a> report which stated some staff who previously worked on Prince of Persia: The Last Crown had since joined the project. 
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, Ubisoft also confirmed it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-new-rayman-project-currently-in-the-exploration-phase-following-reports-of-a-remake">tapped Michel Ancel to consult on its plans for the future of the Rayman franchise</a>.

            <p>Not content with just leaking details prior to the event, people are now streaming Nintendo's mysterious Switch Online playtest on the likes of YouTube and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo announced a mysterious playtest relating to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-playtesting-mystery-new-switch-online-feature-this-month-with-up-to-10k-people">new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service</a> earlier this month. It kept further details under wraps, but noted places would be limited, and only up to 10,000 people would be accepted to participate. At this time, Nintendo asked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-asks-switch-online-playtesters-not-to-disclose-any-information-but-how-long-will-that-last">successful applicants not to disclose details of the test publicly</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>But, what with people being people, they did. It began last week, when a number of participants shared screenshots from documentation sent to program participants on social media. These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/details-of-nintendos-mysterious-switch-online-playtest-leak">images spoke of an almost MMO-sounding Minecraft-like game</a>, featuring blocky worlds.</p><p>And now, people are once again ignoring Nintendo's request that the playtest be kept under wraps, and are streaming the playtest. Users on reddit have linked to streams of the test, and confirmed once again that the game has Minecraft-style elements featuring building. "Minecraft + WoW + Nintendo Mii games but very barbones at the moment [because] it's just a test," is how one user described it.</p>
<p>"It looks to be part Minecraft-like, part shared social hub(?), with persistent worlds supporting a <em>lot</em> of players at once," another added. One said from what they watched, the "vibes" of the playtest are "immaculate".</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch Online playtest kicked off earlier today, and is set to run for a little under two weeks, concluding on 6th November.</p>

<p>It is not just the playtest Nintendo is seeing its community bend the rules on, somewhat. There have also been reports of troublemakers at the Nintendo museum in Japan.</p>
<p>As noted by X user Genki, one recent visitor uploaded pictures of prototype consoles on social media, which were taken from an exhibit you are not allowed to take photos of. Meanwhile, another person reportedly tried to unplug controller cords to check for emulators during their visit to the museum. Sigh.</p>

		<p>New World: Aeternum is the biggest shake-up Amazon’s MMORPG has seen since it launched in 2021. Not only does it introduce new features and content, it also brings the game to consoles with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions now live, complete with cross-play servers, making this the best opportunity in a long time for new comers to jump in.</p>
<p><iframe title="New World: Aeternum - Gameplay Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qK8jtTMHCRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With New World: Aeternum, Amazon has set its sights firmly on a new audience, though there’s plenty for veterans to sink their teeth into, and a lure to bring lapsed players back to the game. Personally, I missed the boat back in 2021 – although I enjoyed playing the various alpha and beta tests for the game, I didn’t want an MMO in my life and it’s fair to say that the genre has an established track record for rough launch windows. Now, after spending a dozen or so hours with Aeternum, I understand why the game managed to maintain a small yet zealous fan base and why Amazon thought it deserved a second chance.</p>


<p>Set during the Age of Exploration, players find themselves aboard a ship headed for the New World and helmed by some less than savoury characters. The voyage doesn’t go entirely to plan, however. Upon approaching the uncharted realms of Aeternum, your ship and its crew are scattered by the mysterious Stormwall – not quite the welcome party you had anticipated.</p>


<p>Two of the biggest changes new players benefit from in New World: Aeternum are the introduction of Archetypes, as well as a more dynamic approach to story-telling, via cutscenes and character dialogue. Eschewing the normal MMO class system, characters in New World are defined by their choice of weapon – these determine the active and passive abilities available to you while influencing the core stats you focus on upgrading each time you level up. While you are free to experiment later on, Archetypes present a handful of weapon combos with a distinct playstyle and theme. For instance the Mystic dabbles with strange arcana, wielding the Life Staff and Void Gauntlet, and being the closest to a healer/support class. Meanwhile, the Musketeer is a nimble, flashy DPS fighter who favours the musket and rapier.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, story-telling is another big focus, New World’s tutorial feeling more like the intro to an open-world action RPG rather than an MMO. The cutscenes – a mix of pre-rendered, in-game, and animations – do a great job of setting the tone and establishing key characters and concepts straight off-the-bat. Within those first minutes you’re already duelling upon the deck of a burning ship, traversing overgrown ruins, and peeling back the first layer of Aeternum’s rich lore.</p>
<p>Instead of arriving on the shores of the Americas as we know them, New World asks what would happen if explorers were transported to a continent wreathed in magic and mystery. Its stories steer into fantasy territory rather than being a retelling of our own colonial history, weaving together myths and muskets.</p>

<p>Being an action RPG makes the gameplay a lot more palpable on console. Even if something like Final Fantasy XIV works remarkably well on PlayStation, New World’s combat system is a more natural fit with light, heavy, and ranged attacks as well as blocks, dodges, and a camera lock on akin to Dark Souls and Elden Ring. Each weapon has six unlockable active abilities, allowing you to equip a maximum of three at one time with the power to switch between your primary and secondary weapon in an instant. It doesn’t sound like much, especially compared to classic MMOs such as World of Warcraft that plaster every free pixel of the user interface with icons for countless class abilities. While some genre diehards will feel restricted, this paring back feels refreshingly accessible, especially if you’re looking to master more than just your two starter weapons. Additional loadout customisation comes via a catalogue of passive abilities as well as your gear stats and bonuses.</p>
<p>As someone who gravitates towards healer and support archetypes, there’s always the worry that the solo levelling experience in MMOs will suffer. However, almost 30 levels into New World (with the cap being 65) I’ve not had to respawn once with only a couple of nail-biting encounters. This, I hope, is something that will change as I progress further and start dipping my toes in group PvE content, though it’s largely a result of me being slightly over-leveled for my current zone and making sure my gear is as good as it can be.</p>

<p>Outside of combat, there’s plenty to see and do in New World with a plethora of craft-based skills that feed into the game’s economy. Hunting for resource nodes is one of those chore-like pursuits I’ve never really enjoyed in MMOs though it’s somehow more immersive in Aeternum. For example, when woodcutting you’ll actually see trees fall. Rare minerals and fauna are often found scattered around key landmarks, encouraging you to explore and soak in New World’s beautiful biomes.</p>
<p>The best thing about my first experience with New World: Aeternum is knowing that I’ve only just scratched the surface. So far it has been a fun and somewhat enthralling solo-levelling experience with more social, multiplayer features beginning to reveal themselves. From player housing, dungeons, and raids, to PvP arena battles and sweeping faction wars, I’m eager to see where Amazon’s MMO will take me.</p>

            <p>I know there's a lot of good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvanias</a> floating around, but I implore you to take a look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardust-demon">Stardust Demon</a>. Developed by two-person queer married team resnijars, it looks like a real charmer. All bright and fuzzy and with plenty of alien weirdness to hop over or battle, with lots of FMV cutscenes to bring those colourful characters closer to your eyeballs. It's also out now, which is good for people like me who crave bizzarovanias.</p>

<p>In Stardust Demon you play as Algol, a fuzzy demon bear (?) who explores alien planets. You'll solve puzzles, do some nice hopping, grind on neon rails, and hit baddies with your powers - of which, there are lots. You've got fire breathe, you've got sticky bombs, a reflect beam, and the best-sounding one? A pogo stick.</p>
<p>As for those planets, there's Wexia, replete with "dangerous flora and fauna" and home to "worm-like and quirky Wexoids". Klonix is the "ethereal planet" and actually home to <em>friendly</em> demons, while Purrafiny is an aquatic number and outpost for "nefarious poachers" and "animal collectors". There are more (some aren't even planets) and, honestly, they look 1000% more interesting and quirky than a lot of worlds I've seen in retro-fied platformers nowadays. The trailer really highlights their diversity. </p><p>Another thing I'd like to highlight is Algol's walk: a very good little plod that makes the physical act of pottering around those vicious planets lighter on the heart in general. Never underestimate the power of a good walk animation, I say.</p>
<p>You can find the game over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815500/Stardust_Demon/">on Steam</a> if you're keen.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It’s hard to pick out the highlights from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>’s latest SteamOS update, 3.6.19, just because its collection of tweaks and fixes seems to span the entire gamut of handheld PC hardware as a concept. Graphics driver improvements! Third-party <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-ssd-steam-deck">SSDs</a> working better! More balanced display colours! No more "spurious power LED blinking"! Brilliant, I hate spurious power LED blinking. The original LCD Deck also now gets the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>’s overclocking controls in the BIOS, which you’re welcome to try if you’re braver than I am about cranking up the temperatures of a already squished-in handheld chip.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4676514574283544995">Full patch notes are here</a>. If some of these amendments seem familiar to experienced Deck users, that’s because they’ve been knocking around the Preview and Beta branches of SteamOS <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4213757668851885208">since at least May</a>. Version 3.6.19 finally brings them all together on the Stable branch, the default and least bug-prone flavour of SteamOS that I’d suspect the majority of owners have never switched from.</p>
<p>Also, sod it, let’s pick out some of the best stuff. Improved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-microsd-cards-for-steam-deck">microSD card</a> reliability – especially for certain SanDisk models – sounds good, and I’ve actually bumped into the exact black screen issue when switching between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-enable-desktop-mode-on-the-steam-deck">Desktop Mode</a> and Gaming Mode that this updates banishes. The LCD Steam Deck getting up to 10% better battery life "in light load conditions" might be handy for lengthy download sessions as well, and it’s nice to see that the older model specifically getting more love.</p>
<p>Don’t get your hopes up too much about the suggested graphics performance improvements; I’ve ran a few quick benchmarks in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, and neither seem to run any faster. But you might still see better stability in certain RAM-heavy games, and at the very least, I’ll take the higher responsiveness when flicking through the UI. I’ve been testing out the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-the-computex-2024-pc-hardware-announcements-that-are-actually-interesting">Zotac Zone</a> this week (review forthcoming) and, like all Windows-based handhelds, it quickly made me pine for SteamOS’ snappiness.</p><p>Anyhoo, 3.6.19 is available to install right now for all Stable branch users; you can enable the installation in the System page of the Steam Deck’s settings. The only other thing I’d point out is that while the patch notes list some fixes for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-new-game-recording-beta-lets-you-instant-replay-all-those-elden-ring-deaths">Game Recording</a>, the video-clipping feature itself has still only got as far as the Beta branch. You can switch to that, from Stable, by selecting Beta in the System Update Channel section.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The God of War TV series will take longer than expected to reach your home screens. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> nearly two years ago, it would have featured Rafe Judkins (The Wheel of Time) as its showrunner and Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby as its producers. However, all three have recently left the project despite having prepared multiple scripts for the show's debut season. Amazon and Sony have decided to move in a different direction, though the scripts were reportedly praised regardless.</p>
<p>Now, Deadline has <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/god-of-war-ronald-d-moore-amazon-series-showrunner-1236122550/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the new head honcho: Ronald D. Moore. Veteran Star Trek fans will know him as the producer of Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, although more recently, he rose to fame for the Battlestar Galactica reboot series as well as Outlander and For All Mankind. According to the report, Moore will be at the same time writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the God of War TV series. Sony Santa Monica's God of War creative director Cory Barlog is still an executive producer alongside Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan from PlayStation Productions, Hermen Hulst from Sony Interactive Entertainment, and Roy Lee from Vertigo Entertainment. Last but not least, Sony Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is still listed as co-executive producer.</p>
<p>We don't really know a lot about the God of War TV series beyond the fact that it will adapt the Norse saga, starting with the 2018 game. Fans are already going wild with the actors they'd like to see in the key roles, such as Kratos, Atreus, Freya, Baldur, Mimir, Brok, Sindri, and Modi. As a reminder, the second and final installment in the Norse saga <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-launches-on-pc-in-september-with-dlss-3-7-and-fsr-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted on PC last month</a>, although it didn't quite reach the same concurrent player peak as the previous entry on Steam. The next game from Sony Santa Monica may not be a God of War at all, though, with Cory Barlog reportedly working on a brand new sci-fi IP.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fifa-ultimate-team-packs-arent-gambling-rules-austrian-court/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/key-austrian-court-finds-fifa-ultimate-team-packs-are-not-gambling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> today that the Higher Regional Court of Vienna has ruled in favor of Electronic Arts on the subject of FIFA Ultimate Team Packs being gambling or not.</p>
<p>According to the judge, players do not purchase FIFA Ultimate Team packs intending to make a profit but only to use them in the game. As such, according to Australian law,&nbsp; the lack of economic risk means they cannot be considered gambling. Moreover, FUT packs cannot be considered separately from the game itself, which is not a game of chance but a game of skill.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Electronic Arts was very happy with the outcome and is calling the ruling 'direction setting' in a statement:</p>
<p><em>This is a direction-setting decision from the Higher Regional Court of Vienna and follows similar first instance decisions from other Austrian courts in recent months. We design our games to bring choice, fairness, value, and fun, and we are pleased with the court’s findings that FIFA Ultimate Team packs are not gambling and that players generally do not acquire them to make a profit but simply as part of the game. EA continues to believe that optional in-game purchases, when done right, play an important role in giving players a choice in how they want to engage with a game. This ruling rightly recognizes that spending is always optional, and most players choose not to spend at all.</em></p>
<p>It's a big win for the publisher, which was recently forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-lootboxes-get-official-drop-rate-disclosure-from-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclose</a> the actual drop rate of lootboxes in Respawn's popular free-to-play Battle Royale game Apex Legends to comply with a new law in South Korea. As expected, it turned out to be very low - just 0.045%, to be precise. However, there's a safeguard in place to ensure a drop after opening 500 Apex Packs without any luck.</p>

            <p>To be fair, there are several, far more substantial additions teased in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3 </a>design director Mitchell Heastie’s <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/33-total-war-warhammer-iii-patch-5-3-dev-blog">latest blog</a> on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>’s upcoming Patch 5.3. There’s also some interesting insight regarding design decisions, and the systems CA are hoping to tweak in the future. We’ll talk about that in a moment, but first, I must draw your attention to this magical map. I’m very excited about it. Not so much for what it does on its own - more for what its design philosophy represents and could mean for future additions.</p>

<p>‘Maad’s Map’ is part of a planned ancillary rebalance - ancillaries being the magical items you can equip characters with. The actual rebalance itself (aiming to bring rarity more in line with power, among other things) isn’t coming with this patch, but 5.3 will include 18 new generic items, plus 6 new rare unique, including the map. Using it gives your chosen lord a massive 50% bonus to campaign movement range, but also has a 20% to warp them to a random nearby region at the end of their turn.</p>
<p>What I love about this map is its introduction of an element of dice-rolling, narrative chaos that’s otherwise noticeably absent from both the game and, honestly, contemporary Warhammer tabletop - at least compared to older editions. There are still a few examples - notably the chance for your spellcasters to singe their fingertips on the searing hobs of their own hubris by miscasting powerful spells. But I think this map is right on the money. It’s creative. It’s risky. Most of all, it’s weird! I can absolutely see why you wouldn’t want to use it, but it even existing suggests a willingness on the design team’s part to introduce other, stranger items down the line. Now buff all the Skaven weapons team and give them the opportunity to also miscast, and we’ll be in business.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the blog there’s some multiplayer rebalancing, a new unit in Grave Guard with halberds, and a rework for a couple of Ogre Kingdoms mechanics in the lead up to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greenskins-ogres-and-khorne-are-all-coming-in-the-next-dlc-for-total-war-warhammer-3">their presence in the next expansion</a>. Namely, more and better Ogre mercenaries you can hire from camps as other factions, and a new bounties system that makes them a bit more consistent.</p>
<p>I also found this part interesting, regarding Control and Corruption:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't have too much information to share just yet on what our plans are with these features, but the complexity of dealing with both of these mechanics is larger than you might think. They are both core game systems that affect every single race in the game, and each faction's relationship with these systems can be, and often is, unique.</p>
<p>They're long standing Total War features and I think they suffer from a legacy of being carried from game to game without a real deep dive into what their place in the game actually entails.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d like to pick the team’s brains at some point about how many of these legacy systems they feel are actually holding the game back in some way - or at least not contributing to the experience they envision. Either way, I appreciate the insight and transparency here.</p><p>There’s still no word on when exactly the next expansion - which features Ogres, Orcs, and Khorne - will arrive, but my money’s on early December. I, for one, look forward to curling up by my roaring space heater with a ‘winter fire 10 hours’ video on the second monitor, cracking open a cold can of Sugar Plum Monster Energy, and punching everything in the Old World to gore and gubbins.</p>
<p>In other, less Orc-y Creative Assembly news, Alien Isolation director Al Hope <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-isolation-is-getting-a-sequel-10-years-later">recently announced</a> that a sequel to Alien Isolation was in the works. What’s the Xenomorph’s charge bonus, Al? How viable is its missile block chance? Tell me!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-the-lake-house-dlc-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Remote Control.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Under any other circumstance, The Lake House would sound like a nice spot for a serene summer getaway. In this case, though, it’s the setting for the second and final installment of Alan Wake II DLC, so it is naturally anything but. There’s no rest and relaxation to be found here, only another double-fisted dose of flashlights and firepower in this tightly paced two-hour tour inside the cold, concrete walls of a remote Federal Bureau of Control facility. In raw gameplay terms, The Lake House is not as eccentric a departure as Night Springs was a few months’ back, but as far as closing the book on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II’s</a> story and providing a bridge to the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> goes, it’s yet another meta-storytelling slam dunk for the team at Remedy Entertainment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Alan Wake II: The Lake House Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You might remember The Lake House from the main <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II</a> campaign, or at the very least the exterior of its grounds since it’s found behind a locked gate in Cauldron Lake near where the murder victim is found at the start of Saga Anderson’s story. This FBC research facility was strictly off-limits to Saga, but in this new chapter we’re able to fully explore it as returning FBC Agent Kiran Estevez. I liked Estevez in the main campaign and was happy to spend some time in her shoes, but the real show-stealing performances here come from the husband and wife scientist team of Jules and Diana Marmont. Initially I was laughing out loud at the petty bickering between them that occurs in the facility’s welcome video, but their relationship evidently took a much darker turn as evidenced by the many memos and emails I pored over as I continued my engrossing investigation inside the sinister shapeshifting structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The facility itself is only five floors, but thanks to its proximity to the Altered World Event in Cauldron Lake and the disturbing research experiments conducted by the Marmonts, The Lake House is as consistently unsettling a space as anything from the main <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II</a> campaign. One floor finds Estevez caught in a disorientating loop, another has shifting canvases splashed in abstract Jackson Pollock-style sprays, while another still is just a near-never-ending room of ominously clattering typewriters, like a manifestation of the infinite monkey theorem minus the tiny simian scribes. It’s a superbly constructed bit of otherworldly office space that I delighted in exploring, whether I was thumbing through the chilling pages of another Alan Wake manuscript or having conversations with a possessed painting so angry it made Vigo the Carpathian from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/ghostbusters-2-1989">Ghostbusters II</a> seem like a portrait of a puppy dog.     </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Lake House is as consistently unsettling a space as anything from the main Alan Wake II campaign.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lake House is absolutely blanketed in an unnerving atmosphere, but it’s perhaps a little lacking as far as puzzles go. Aside from carrying battery cubes to electrical sockets, which stimulates the eye with its orange glow but isn’t particularly taxing on the brain, there are otherwise only a handful of computer passwords to figure out using calendar dates mentioned in memos and the like. These hackneyed hacking jobs are pretty easy to deduce, and it was a little disappointing that there was nothing new here to match the mind-bending magic tricks provided by Alan’s world-altering Angel Lamp in the main campaign.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Shadow Complex</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat against the shadow-cloaked staff of The Lake House is equally as straightforward for the most part, but it’s still extremely tense thanks to its typically claustrophobic close-quarters encounters. Estevez might be an FBC agent, but sadly she doesn’t possess the shapeshifting gun or superpowers that Jesse Faden wielded in 2019’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control">Control</a>. Instead, a pistol, shotgun, and a combination of flashlight, flares, and flashbangs are at her disposal, and I burned through every last round and spare battery as I desperately tried to illuminate and exterminate each sickle-slinging flanker and sledgehammer-swinging heavy that ambushed me along the way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of its main boss fight, there’s only one new enemy type to be found in The Lake House, but it’s a doozy. The long-limbed freaks that slither out of painted canvases seem like Remedy’s towering, tie-dyed take on the Slender Man, and since they seem immune to Estevez’s attacks I was going hard on the dodge button early on to frantically try and evade their outstretched clutches. Eventually Estevez gets her hands on a grenade launcher powerful enough to turn the tables on these paint-streaked Stretch Armstrongs, but that didn’t mean that dealing with them ever became too easy – grenade ammo is scarce, the painted shadows are slim enough that they’re somewhat easy to miss, and the fact you need to charge up each shot before you fire puts some added pressure into the timing of each takedown. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lake House’s challenge jumped up even further in its final boss fight – whose identity was a fun surprise from a story perspective – and it brought my brief return trip to the world of Alan Wake II to a dazzling and demanding denouement. My short stay in The Lake House was brutalist in its architecture and brutalising in its action, and although it’s bittersweet that my time with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II</a> has officially come to an end, the tantalising story teases of what comes next in the Remedy Connected Universe has me locked and loaded for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>.  </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The Lake House DLC is another spectacular and spooky slice of Alan Wake II action. It introduces some fantastic new supporting characters to the Remedy Connected Universe, as well as a terrifying new enemy type to overcome and some wonderfully eerie environments to explore. The challenge of its puzzles may be light, but its combat is still chillingly dark even despite the fact it’s not hugely different from that of the main game, and scouring for the many notes, videos, and audio recordings littered throughout its fear-inducing facility made for a genuinely gripping investigation. Funny, frightening, and full of surprises, The Lake House DLC is a tightly paced slice of psychological horror that serves as an absorbing addendum to Alan Wake II. </p></div></div><div><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Alan Wake II: The Lake House DLC Review</h3><div data-cy="review-content"><p>great</p><p>The Lake House DLC is a tightly paced slice of psychological horror that serves as an absorbing addendum to Alan Wake II.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a world of first-person shooters, Rainbow Six Siege reigns as one of the greatest. The popular multiplayer extraction shooter has been popular since its release back in 2015, continuing to keep a steady player base and competitive fanbase. The game’s Ranked system has gotten increasingly popular with players, too.</p>



<p>Here are all the ranks in Rainbow Six Siege.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-ranks-in-rainbow-six-siege">All Ranks in Rainbow Six Siege</h2>



<p>Like many other games, Rainbow Six Siege’s Ranked system follows an element system, with Bronze, Copper and so on. Here is a list of all the ranks in Rainbow Six Siege and the Matchmaking Rating (MMR) needed to progress forward:</p>



<ul>
<li>Copper: 0 – 1,599 MMR</li>



<li>Bronze: 1,600 – 2,099 MMR</li>



<li>Silver: 2,100 – 2,599 MMR</li>



<li>Gold: 2,600 – 3,100 MMR</li>



<li>Platinum: 3,200 – 4,099 MMR</li>



<li>Diamond: 4,100 – 4,999 MMR.</li>



<li>Champions: 5,000 MMR.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>From Copper to Champions, ranking up in Rainbow Six Siege is no easy feat. Many players tend to give up early on, so pat yourself on the back if you have made it to Champions.</p>



<p>So, what is MMR?</p>







<h2 id="h-explaining-matchmaking-ratings-mmr">Explaining Matchmaking Ratings (MMR)</h2>



<p>Like all other games, Rainbow Six Siege has its own competitive rank points. Just like Fortnite used to have Arena points, Rainbow Six utilizes MMR. </p>



<p>MMR is a system of numerical points that begin at 0 and allow players to hit Champions rank when they reach 5,000 MMR. The points do not stop there, however, and continue to rise if a player does well in Ranked.</p>



<p>The game has two MMR scores, though. Your MMR is tracked separately in Unranked modes while also tracked in Ranked modes. This system is quite different than a lot of other competitive games, as many only track points in Ranked modes.</p>

Not much is known about it save that it's an open world prequel to the original Beyond Good &amp; Evil and that it is being developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, with only a handful of early demos emerging over the years. The game's original director, Michel Ancel, departed Ubisoft in 2020, though he's now consulting on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-reportedly-moves-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-devs-to-beyond-good-and-evil-2-the-next-ghost-recon-and-a-rayman-remake">nascent Rayman game</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, it seems as if Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is starting to pick up steam.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/harpoon-97-micrporose-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I know this might be hard to believe from the comfort of 2024, but there used to be a big, competitive market for hardcore naval strategy games on the PC. <em>Harpoon </em>was the most popular of these games, and–I swear I am not making this up–back in the 90s it used to have prominent features in mainstream games mags, and even posters in video game stores.</p><p><em>Harpoon</em> was also a game that looked like this:</p><figure></figure><p>A series that has continued through the 2000s to look pretty much like this, <em>Harpoon </em>is a strategy franchise in the most traditional grognardy sense, forgoing any visual flair for the raw, weighty pleasures of math and authenticity. If other video games use graphics as a means of representing code and numbers, <em>Harpoon</em>--like other classics like <em>Gary Grigsby's War in the East</em>--only really cares about the numbers. If you have ever complained about a Paradox game being cold and unwieldy, you don't know shit. You are a small baby, a sweet child of summer.</p><p><em>Harpoon</em>, with its accounting software-like interface and myriad of systems it is trying to simulate, was a very tough nut to crack, but once a certain type of person willing to put in the work could crack it, it was by all accounts <em>great</em> (I tried, repeatedly, but was never that person.). Like I said, people still play the series today! So it's maybe not too surprising to hear that Microprose, exactly the kind of publisher who you would expect to bring <em>Harpoon</em> back in 2024, is bringing <em>Harpoon </em>back.</p><p>The publisher this week announced a re-release of a re-release of a re-release of the original 1989 <em>Harpoon</em>, which was remade in 1994 as <em>Harpoon Classic</em> then <em>again</em> in 1997 as this game, the one that's coming to Steam next month, <em>Harpoon 97</em>. The promo material says it features "new displays, updated scenarios, and a more intuitive interface", but I'm not sure if those are just the republished selling points from the 1997 press release, because take a look at <em>Harpoon 97's</em> trailer:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Harpoon Classic '97 - Publishing Announcement" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmop246H2kk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I must stress here that this is fine! Actually it's more than fine, it's expected: this is what this series and this genre looks like, whether you like it or not, and it would be really weird to play a <em>Harpoon </em>game and suddenly find yourself confronted with "graphics". Like 2023's <em>Rule The Waves 3</em> (see below), there's a certain throwback charm to this, and the people who will actually be spending money on this game wouldn't have it any other way.</p><div><figure><p>https://twitter.com/LukePlunkett/status/1659139438809870336</p></figure></div><p>(Besides, anyone who <em>does</em> want to play a modern naval combat game with graphics can just buy one of Microprose's <em>other </em>upcoming releases,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1286220/Sea_Power__Naval_Combat_in_the_Missile_Age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Sea Power</em></a>.)</p><p>I'm excited for this! At least I am, conceptually! I'm sure I will once again try to play this game and once again fail to understand or enjoy it, but for me, that's beside the point. The point here is that Microprose is about to release something that people under the age of 25 wouldn't even think qualifies as a video game, where modern ideas like "art style" and "user experience" are nowhere to be found, and loads of people will enjoy it regardless. I think that fucking rules.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Roblox Corporation has announced changes to its child-safety policies that'll impact the way pre-teen users can interact with its popular gaming platform. The move follows persitent accusations the company routinely fails to protect its predominantly young player base, and, more recently, a damning report calling Roblox an "X-rated paedophile hellscape" that exposes children to "grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech".
</p>
<p>
Back in July, Bloomberg revealed Roblox had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation last year</a>, and that more than two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors following contact in-game. That was followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">report in August from short-selling firm Hindenberg Research</a> that, as well as accusing Roblox of deliberately inflating player numbers to investors, shared numerous examples of Roblox's apparent failure to keep children safe.
</p>
<p>
In both cases, Roblox hit back at the accusations, calling the Hindenberg Research report "simply misleading" and insisting the Bloomberg article contained "glaring mischaracterisations". But despite Roblox's constant protestations, the company has now announced numerous changes to its child-safety policies.

<p>
As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">reported by The Verge</a>, Roblox sent out an email to parents this week announcing that children under the age of 13 will soon need parental permission to access "chat features" by default, while children under nine will additionally need permission to play experiences with a content maturity rating of "moderate", which can include "moderate violence or crude humour". Roblox says these restrictions will be automatically lifted as users reach certain age milestones, assuming parents and users haven't already made changes manually.
</p><p>
Addtionally, Roblox is introducing a new type of account for parents next month that, when linked to their child's account, will let them update parental controllers from their own device, and get insights into their child's online activity and friends. The company calls these changes - which follow updated guidelines introduced in July requiring creators to label in-game experiences based on content types rather than age - part of its "commitment to making the platform one of the safest online environments for our users, particularly the youngest users".
</p>
<p>
Roblox has long been a controversial presence in gaming, as exemplified by People Make Games' accusation in 2021 that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-exploiting-young-game-developers-new-investigation-reports">Roblox is "exploiting" young developers</a> on the platform, with many of those developers under the age of 18. And Roblox CEO Stefano Corazza raised eyebrows earlier this year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-studio-boss-children-making-money-on-the-platform-isnt-exploitation-its-a-gift">telling Eurogamer</a> the company had "hired some teenagers that had millions of players", following up with the suggestion children making money on the platform isn't exploitation, it's a "gift". A Roblox spokesperson later contacted Eurogamer to stress the company does not hire minors, despite Corazza's assertions.

Turkey blocked access to Roblox in August, saying it was a necessary measure <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216300/turkey-blocks-roblox-instagram">to protect its children</a>. (Roblox said <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/roblox-plans-open-office-turkey-if-access-platform-restored-2024-10-22/">this week</a> that it would open an office in the country if access was restored.) Earlier this month, a popular financial newsletter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262033/roblox-the-bear-cave-child-abuse">accused Roblox of enabling child abuse</a> and the investment firm Hindenburg Research <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265145/roblox-hindenburg-reseach-dau-child-safety-short-seller-report">alleged that</a> its “in-game research revealed an X-rated pedophile hellscape.”</p><p>As part of the changes, which <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-23/roblox-enacts-child-safety-changes-giving-parents-more-control?srnd=undefined">initially reported</a> on, users younger than 13 will have to get parent permission to access “certain chat features” while users that are younger than 9 will need their parents’ permission to play experiences that have a “moderate” content label. (That label means the experience may contain things like moderate violence or crude humor.) The company had already announced that it will be switching from <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8862768451604-Experience-Guidelines-and-Age-Recommendations">“experience guidelines,”</a> which rates experiences for specific ages, over to the new content label system <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/upcoming-changes-to-experience-guidelines/3070343">this fall</a>.</p><p>Roblox is also adding a new type of account that will let parents manage their kids on the platform. With the new parent accounts, parents can link their account to their child’s so they can update parental controls and access insights about their child’s Roblox usage, such as daily screen time and their Roblox friends. However, alongside these changes, Roblox won’t let parents set a PIN to <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000239523-Parent-PIN-General-Information">make changes to an account</a>, or use <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000375686-Account-Restrictions">account restrictions</a> to block a kid’s account from sending in-game chats or limit a kid’s account to only accessing experiences designed “for all ages.”</p><p>“The updates that were shared via email are part of Roblox’s commitment to making the platform one of the safest online environments for our users, particularly the youngest users,” Roblox’s Juliet Chaitin-Lefcourt tells <em>The Verge</em>. “We’re excited to share more information next month.”</p><div><blockquote><p><strong>New parental controls and insights are coming soon</strong></p><p>Dear parent,</p><p>We’ve been working on a series of important changes that we’ll be making to your child’s account, ____________, next month.</p><p><strong>About Roblox accounts with parent privileges</strong></p><p>Next month, we’re changing the way parents manage their child’s experience on Roblox by introducing Roblox accounts with parent privileges. After linking your account to your child’s, parents can view and update parental controls for their child all from their own device. Parents also get access to insights about their child’s Roblox usage, such as their daily screen time and on-platform friends.</p><p>Given these changes, starting next month, parents will no longer be able to set a parent PIN, use Account Restrictions, or receive account-related notifications to their parental email. Instead, you will need to use an account with parent privileges. Existing verified parental emails on child accounts will continue to be used for account recovery. Any settings previously set using a parent PIN will not change, but you will need an account with parent privileges to make updates going forward. </p><p>As always, if users are interested in an added layer of security on their account, you can set up <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/212459863-Add-2-Step-Verification-to-Your-Account">2-factor authentication</a>.</p><p><strong>Updated content maturity settings</strong></p><p>As we shared with the community in July, to help provide parents and users more clarity into the types of content available on Roblox, we’ll soon begin labeling experiences based on the type of content users can expect in an experience, rather than by age. Experience Guidelines will be renamed Content Labels, and you’ll be able to set limits on the type of content accessible to your child through the content maturity setting in parental controls.</p><p><strong>New default settings for users under the age of 13</strong></p><p>As part of Roblox’s commitment to safety, we are also updating certain default settings for our youngest users. Starting next month, users under the age of 13 will need parent permission to access certain chat features. Users under the age of 9 will also need parent permission to access experiences with content maturity “Moderate,” which may contain things like moderate violence or moderate crude humor.</p><p>Your child’s settings will be updated when they reach certain ages, if you and your child haven’t previously made changes to them. You and your child will be notified of these updates in advance.</p><p>We will share more information on these setting updates when the changes go into effect next month.</p><p><strong>Next steps</strong></p><p>To continue receiving notifications about your child’s account related to spending or other important activity, you’ll need to set up a Roblox account with parent privileges and link to your child’s account. When these changes take effect, your child will receive a notification inviting them to add a linked parent account, and we’ll send you an email with instructions.</p><p>Since day one, Roblox has been committed to building safety features and tools into the design of our products. We will always continue to explore different ways to update our parental controls to make them even more useful for parents.</p><p>Roblox</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And in a recent interview at Gamescom Asia conducted by <a href="https://jp.ign.com/" data-cy="styled-link">IGN Japan</a>, he reflected on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reportedly-downscales-sony-japan-studio">2021 reorganization</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-japan-studio-restructure-mass-exodus-playstation">subsequent mass exodus of talent from Sony Japan Studio</a>, giving a bit of context as to why he thinks the dissolution happened in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remnants of Japan Studio were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-asobi-official-playstation-studios-dev-new-logo">recentered around Astrobot developer Team Asobi</a>, which later that year was moved into PlayStation Studios. Though Layden was not involved in any of the aforementioned decisions, having departed Sony in 2019, he still had thoughts on why the studio was effectively disbanded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That was sad," he said. "It wasn't necessarily a surprise. I love Allan [Becker, former head of Japan Studio], and he worked really hard, but there was so much legacy malaise. It's tough when a studio hasn't had a hit for a while, then they forget how that feels. You know, if you have a hit once it's it's like a drug, man, you're chasing the next one, right? And then if you don't have that for a while, you forget what it felt like, and then you start to forget how to get there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There were probably two roads. One was the road they took. The other road was a real tough-love program. And maybe that's what the Team Asobi thing is. It's like pruning a bonsai, right? You get it back down to its nub and see if you can grow back out again."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden is referring to Japan Studio's struggles to produce a hit in the years leading up to its dissolution. Though Astro Bot Rescue Mission was considered a success (and likely factored into the decision to retain Team Asobi), Japan Studio had otherwise largely been relegated to support work after 2017's Knack 2 release. Layden doesn't think this problem was exclusive to Japan Studio, though:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And sadly, I think you can see that problem across the Japanese market," he continued. "Writ large, there's a lot of legacy, historically super talented teams that haven't tasted success for a while and are still struggling to get back to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But, you know, Capcom is prosecuting that problem fairly directly. I think Sega finds itself in a pretty good place. Bandai Namco has got some refactoring to do. Koei Tecmo has its market, owns that market, and they seem happy with that...How many different versions of FF7 have been made?! Square Enix. I think when they abandoned their overseas developer/publisher ambitions and brought it back to home truths, that was a good move for them, but it'll still take a while for them to get out of the woods."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trouble with Japanese development, said Layden, can be traced back to the PlayStation 3 generation. While Japanese teams like Square Enix, Namco, Konami, and Capcom owned the PlayStation 1 and 2 eras, the technical shift around the PS3 caused some legacy studios to struggle.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Writ large, there's a lot of legacy, historically super talented teams that haven't tasted success for a while and are still struggling to get back to it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the PlayStation 1 era, Takara Tomi was making money back then," he said. "They basically took their experience in the arcade business and translated it to the home, right? That was the selling point. PlayStation 1, Ridge Racer in your house, Tekken in your house. But the way you develop an arcade experience is completely different from how you develop a console experience. Now, PlayStation 1, they just translated it, and that seemed to be enough, because it was novel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[But] that skill set and expertise didn't really translate into the console experience. And then when you got to PS3, and you had the Cell processor, and how do you code for that? And it was no longer an upgraded arcade experience, it was a high-end PC experience you're offering at home. And I think that's where the disconnect came for a lot of Japanese developers. And Japanese developers have been struggling ever since to try to get back to the top of the top of Olympus."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The dissolution of Japan Studio was a sad affair.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/bernie-sanders-sykkuno-pokimane-valkyrae-austinshow-vtuber<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday evening, in a play that’s becoming increasingly common among both major American political parties, the Democrats once again leveraged the power of influencers in an attempt to reach young voters. This time, Bernie Sanders, the party’s favorite liaison for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these things</a>, to whom they refuse to listen where actual policy is concerned, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2282811318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined an all-star cast of left-leaning streamers</a>: Pokimane, Valkyrae, AustinShow, and Sykkuno, the latter of whom was using a vtuber avatar at the time. Senator Sanders, who is 83 years old, was not familiar with the concept.&nbsp;</p><p>Moments after Sanders joined the stream, Sykkuno decided to address the catboy-shaped elephant in the room.</p><p>"Normally I have a regular camera,” he said. “I have a skin condition, so I'm using this avatar."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Hah, OK," Sanders replied, clearly not having any idea what to do with this information.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Sykkuno Represents The Vtubers During Call with Bernie Sanders, Mark Hamill, Hank Green &amp; Mark Cuban" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4LkMeMOpXFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>"Do you know what a vtuber is? Have you heard of a vtuber before?" Sykkuno asked.</p><p>"Nope," said Sanders.</p><p>"I'm the first one [Sanders has encountered]!” Sykkuno proclaimed triumphantly. “Thank you so much for supporting vtubers."</p><p>The streamers went on to try to translate the concept of a vtuber for somebody who is old enough to at least hazily remember the end of World War 2.</p><p>"It's when they have this animated profile," said Pokimane, cosplaying as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/23/bernie-sanders-inauguration-meme-heres-the-story-behind-the-photo.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that one meme of Bernie Sanders sitting in a chair</a>.</p><p>AustinShow proceeded to stammer out an attempt at an apology, but Sanders found it within himself to play along.</p><p>"Well, there you are,” he said after a moment. “You're looking good. You're looking very good."</p><p>The rest of the appearance was more or less a standard Bernie stump speech. He talked about the threat Trump poses to democracy and took a harder-line stance on Israel than Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and others who are directly facilitating weapon sales to the genocidal rogue state, calling Biden “dead wrong” when it comes to Israel. He added, however, that Trump will almost certainly be worse on the issue. He also got to rant about healthcare, as is his way. It was a good showing from Bernie, albeit nothing remarkably new.&nbsp;</p><p>On YouTube, Valkyrae’s stream of the conversation pulled in over 10,000 concurrent viewers. On Twitch, AustinShow’s peaked at just under 7,000. It wasn’t much compared to <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adin Ross’ 580,000-viewer stream with Donald Trump</a> earlier this year, likely because Ross is an edgelord with a penchant for stunts like gifting Trump a Cybertruck emblazoned with a scene from his own attempted assassination while yesterday’s Sanders stream was about as safe as it gets. The Harris campaign has also <a href="https://aftermath.site/kamala-harris-twitch-stream-dnc-palestine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched its own Twitch channel</a> and, perplexingly, aired a Tim Walz speech alongside <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/10/10/kamala-harris-twitch-tim-walz-world-of-warcraft-preheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>World of Warcraft</em> gameplay from a basically-unheard-of streamer</a>, to mixed results. Outside of more traditional media appearances, Harris herself has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5144874/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper-howard-stern-60-minutes-colbert-the-view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largely stuck to podcasts</a> like <em>Call Her Daddy</em> and <em>All The Smoke</em>. The Democrats’ best showing in this arena arguably came when Sanders sat down for an interview with popular comedian and influencer Theo Von in August, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwED_Znc9XQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video</a> that pulled in nearly 3 million views. But even that is dwarfed by Trump’s own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">variation on the theme</a>, which sits at 14 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Toward the middle of yesterday’s stream, another celebrity guest, Mark Hamill – aka Luke Skywalker – showed up. Sykkuno reprised his bit from earlier in the broadcast, asking Hamill if he knew what a vtuber was, and Pokimane once again explained the basics.</p><p>“Like Sykkuno, who looks like a cat,” said Hamill after Pokimane finished her explanation.</p><p>Sykkuno later asked the same question to Mark Cuban, an old rich person who somehow already knew what a vtuber is. Cuban then tried to take credit for the creation of Twitch, at which point I decided I’d had enough and went to go do something else.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Digital consoles now comprise 18% of total life-to-date unit sales of PS5 hardware.”</p><p>Sony’s last reported sales figures for the PS5 as of August indicated 61.7 million total units sold. That means roughly 50.6 million of those were disc-capable models and only 11.1 were all-digital. Microsoft doesn’t release official numbers for Xbox sales, but data firm <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuZtbsSrdwo&amp;t=90s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuZtbsSrdwo&amp;t=90s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aldora Intelligence told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a></span> last month that it estimated about 28.3 million Xbox Series X and S consoles had sold so far, which is in line with other reports of the PS5 outselling them roughly two to one. Using Circana’s percentages, that comes out to roughly 13.9 million all-digital Series S consoles and 14.4 million of the Series X. By a narrow margin, both are still more prevalent than the disc-less PS5.</p><p>Why is that exactly? One reason could be that unlike the Series S, which is normally only $300 and frequently on sale for much less, the digital-only PS5 started at $400 and actually got a price <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803">hike to $450</a></span> when the new slim model replaced the launch edition. The console is even more expensive in Japan, where Sony recently raised the price even more. Sold separately, the optical drive is $80, making it more expensive than the $500 PS5 with a disc drive already installed for anyone who decides to upgrade later. </p><p>Another reason could be that even though most players are buying games digitally, many of them still own older games from the PS4 generation physically, or want to have the option of using their PS5 to watch Blu-rays. Even if they never actually pop a disc into their console, the habit of doing so in the past might be driving players to opt for consoles with disc drives, at least for now. It’s also worth noting that certain games, especially first-party Sony blockbusters like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842?_gl=1*6k2bly*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTcwNTkxOC4xNy4xLjE3Mjk3MTI0ODAuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842?_gl=1*6k2bly*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTcwNTkxOC4xNy4xLjE3Mjk3MTI0ODAuNjAuMC4w"><em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, sold more copies physically</a></span> than digitally. </p><p>Maybe this proves that even if players continue opting for the convenience of digital downloads, they’ll still keep the dream of physical games alive by continuing to opt for consoles with disc drives. Based on the numbers above, all-digital PS5s and Series S combined only make up 27 percent of the current high-end console install base, and we’re already approaching the end of the four-year mark of this generation. Then again, maybe the data is just a lagging indicator demonstrating a last gasp of old gaming habits rather than enduring preferences. That’s certainly the story the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-physical-game-low-sales-digital-1851218453&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-physical-game-low-sales-digital-1851218453">gaming section at your local big box store would tell you</a></span>. </p><p>There’s already fear that both Sony and Microsoft could move to all-digital consoles being the <em>only</em> option at some point in the future. Some analysts have predicted that Microsoft will make that jump with its next console, while Sony waits one more generation to do so. In the meantime, physical games make up an ever shrinking part of the market, but they still sell tens of millions of copies every year. As long as there are at least <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ask-kotaku-do-you-still-prefer-physical-games-1844822211&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ask-kotaku-do-you-still-prefer-physical-games-1844822211">some diehard fans</a></span> out there buying them, maybe console manufacturers will have an incentive to keep including disc-drive options. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>RLCS (Rocket League Championship Series) has officially announced its 2025 schedule, after a successful Championship event in Dallas last month. Here is everything we know now about the RLCS 2025 competitive schedule.</p>



<h2 id="h-official-2025-rlcs-schedule">Official 2025 RLCS Schedule</h2>



<p>Ready for another year of competitive Rocket League? Luckily, the 2025 RLCS season is just around the corner, and fans are already calling their picks for teams and players they foresee winning it all.</p>



<p>But what will the actual schedule look like?</p>



<h4 id="h-2025-rlcs-in-person-tournament-schedule">2025 RLCS In-Person Tournament Schedule:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>RLCS Major 1:</strong> Birmingham, United Kingdom from March 27-30</li>



<li><strong>RLCS Major 2:</strong> TBA from June 26-29</li>



<li><strong>Rocket League World Championship:</strong> TBA from September 16-21</li>
</ul>



<p>The 2024 Rocket League World Championship was held in Fort Worth, Texas just a week after the Fortnite Global Championship, which was held in the same arena. It will be interesting to see whether or not they host next year’s Championship in America or decide to host it overseas.</p>



<p>Those looking to attend the RLCS Major 1 will be able to purchase tickets as early as October 30, 2024, at <a href="https://www.theticketfactory.com/">theticketfactory.com.</a></p>







<h2 id="h-2025-rlcs-prize-pool">2025 RLCS Prize Pool</h2>



<p>While we do not know just what the official prize pool for the championship event will be, we do know that the entirety of the RLCS season will have $5,000,000 in prizing. How that prizing will be split up, however, is unknown.</p>



<p>The series will be made up of more than just the three in-person events, though. There will be plenty of online events for players to compete in, so get prepared.</p>



<p>Will you be watching or competing in the 2025 RLCS season? Let us know in the comments.</p>
