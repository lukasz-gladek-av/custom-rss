            <p>When you dive into the mess of folders on your PC, what do you find? Cobweb-plastered manuscripts for those twelve fantasy novels you started? Mouldy design documents for those nine games you never actually began coding? Perhaps dozens of little motheaten thumbnails of that masterpiece you're planning to someday paint? Relax, I'm not calling you out (I have my own groaning cybercabinet of neglect). Rather, I'm here to say don't worry. Everyone does it. Even famous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> character designer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> director Tetsuya Nomura, who has a “huge number of game proposals lying dormant” in a mish mash of folders on his PC. You're just like him!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Nomura made the comments in an interview with Famitsu (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enixs-tetsuya-nomura-has-a-huge-stock-of-game-proposals-lying-dormant/">translated by Automaton</a> - thanks!) where he spoke alongside Takumi Isobe, director of upcoming action RPG Reynatis. When asked about the number of projects he has, Nomura jokes that his computer is a "labyrinth" replete with scenarios and synopses. He's unsure if any of them "will ever see the light of day". A bunch of game ideas and proposals get plopped into a folder simply called "NEW".</p>
<p>The veteran Square Enix man talks some more about his creative habits in the interview. I'll let you delve deeper if you want. I just wanted to evoke some sense of common humanity to all those frantic souls with fifteen first drafts languishing in the dark corners of their desktop. Because reader, I am also he. In many ways, I too am the man who designed the characters of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-final-fantasy-games-pc">the best Final Fantasy game</a>. I too have been credited on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/33342/tetsuya-nomura/">103 video games</a>. We are the same. </p>
<p>I'm being silly. But I really do like it when the people we look upon so often as the legends of an industry reveal something mundane and ordinary about their working life, like the state of their folder hierarchy. All those people you admire, they do not only pee and poop, but they close the wrong tab by accident too. They get lost in their own sub-directories and have to quickly scribble down any idea that comes to mind into hasty documents so they don't "forget what the proposal is about", in Nomura's own words. If you spend a lot of time working on a PC, there is something genuinely unifying and levelling about the idea that even those we call the greats must click "remind me later" multiple times a day. Even Shigeru Miyamoto has probably typed his password with caps lock on and only realised it after hitting enter.</p>

            <p>
To celebrate today's launch of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Capcom has released a video performance of a traditional Japanese theatre show detailing its story.
</p>
<p>
It's performed by the National Bunraku Theatre, an Osaka-based company celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. Bunraku theatre combines narrative recitation, puppetry, and music, dating back to the Edo period from 1603 to 1868.
</p>
<p>
The performance is a tribute to the new game, which is steeped in Japanese folklore.

</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-demo-available-now-okami-collaboration-announced">demo from earlier this month is still available</a> to give the game a try. 

</p>
<p>
The game was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-reveals-path-of-the-goddess-at-xbox-games-showcase">revealed at the 2023 Xbox Games Showcase</a>, with a proper look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-reveals-first-gameplay-at-xbox-partner-direct">gameplay provided at the Xbox Partner Direct</a> earlier this year.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review-airbrushed-brochure</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review-airbrushed-brochure.930543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review-airbrushed-brochure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let me preface this review by stating that it was a weird experience. It’s been a while since I’ve been a spectator of so many peaks, valleys, troughs to trawl through, and clarity to connect the dots. If anything, I’ve left the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-of-hinterberg"><em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em></a> a changed individual, and whether that’s a good thing? Well, I guess we’ll see.</p>
<p>This is the debut title from Austrian-based developers Microbird, who’ve made <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em> as a love letter to their country of origin. You play as Luisa, a trainee for a law firm who is taking a hard-earned break to Hinterberg, based in the Austrian Alps. Not only is she using it as a chance to decompress, but to also master the new-found dungeons and magic that have cropped up in the area.</p>
<p>The game runs on a day-by-day basis. In the morning, you’ll get up, figure out where to go, and then decide whether it’s a day of dungeoneering, slaying beasts and looting up, or relaxing and taking in the sights. Both options have their benefits – the former more so than the latter – but once the evening clocks in, it’s time for a bit of shopping, socializing, and sleeping.</p>

<p>I will say that my first impressions weren’t great. When combat is introduced, you’ll quickly find how shallow it becomes, even in the later stages. You’re relegated to a light attack/heavy attack button layout, with a dodge roll and a rather meager stamina system added for good measure. There isn’t a combo system attached, so you’re largely just smacking your chosen attack until everything drops.</p>
<p><em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em> does try to make combat a bit more exciting and involving, in the form of “conduits”; massively powerful attacks that tend to devastate groups of enemies too easily. The game does know this and tries to limit how frequently you can use these conduits, but some might say not nearly enough, as energy for it drops all the time in battle.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the enemy variety is there, but visual design is not. All of the enemy designs are a murky brown with silver streaks running through them, and it makes readability a nightmare since a lot of enemy strategy boils down to clumping up together. Thankfully, there are the occasional bosses that break up the monotonous flow with some genuinely good combat design that makes the best out of <em>Hinterberg</em>’s gimmicks.</p>

<p>Of the 4 hub areas you’ll be looking for dungeons in, each one has a “skill shrine”. These offer you two magic spells exclusive to the area – one special attack, and a ranged attack – which not only can be used in combat but also in environmental puzzles <em>Hinterberg </em>offers inside and outside of the titular dungeons. This is where the game shows its hand a bit further.</p>
<p>They’re not complete brainbusters, but they’re a welcome break from just how dull <em>Hinterberg</em>’s combat can be, even in numbers. What does suck is that when I say the magic spells are exclusive to their specific hub areas, I mean it. The magical floating snowboard can only be used on the wintery peaks of Kolmstein, as the rest of the world cannot account for its special abilities.</p>
<p>Regardless, it makes for a better break than the rest of what the game has to offer, as the structure is largely obfuscated by its ludicrously fast pacing. The closest comparison one could make is with the eerily similar <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/boyfriend-dungeon-review"><em>Boyfriend Dungeon</em></a>, where the holiday appears to be on a time limit. <em>Hinterberg </em>offers several places where it treats the world as an actual spectacle, rightfully so but with rewards that are pitiful in comparison to what you can simply find and buy elsewhere.</p>

<p>There are also a lot of NPCs who are just downright unlikable. If you run into anybody who isn’t a local, they’re written with such a smug air of cynicism, that even the promise of a helpful character upgrade isn’t enough to spend a night with them. If you want to use the game's photo mode, you’ll have to spend a minimum of one night with a depressing and arrogant journalist who refuses to engage in even the smallest amount of whimsy, and that's before things turn sour.</p>
<p>Spend time with the locals however, and you’ll see <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em> switch from a middling dungeon crawler to an interesting and arresting commentary on privilege. I’m not even kidding, when you hear from the locals, the perspective changes, and suddenly it’s no longer a cutesy dungeon crawler with a charming cel-shaded aesthetic, but <em><span><span>Pokémon </span></span></em>by way of Alan Moore.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the energy is alive as you begin to realize just how much Microbird cares – not just about the game world they’ve created, but the world they inhabit outside of it. The amount of disdain it appears to host for “instagrammable” ideals, tourist traps, and theme parks built into decades of culture. Now I was playing to stop it, for the sake of a world that uses the town of Hinterberg as a perpetual name tag.</p>

<p>And then… I’m not going to say it drops the ball, but <em>Hinterberg</em>’s combat fails to make up for the spectacle the world starts to present. The final handful of bosses struggle with camera placement, legitimate strategy, and a narrative that doesn’t really know where to go from the conclusion it sets up. Without going into heavy spoilers, imagine if the goal of brushing your teeth was just cleaning the front set.</p>
<p>Sure, no one else can see the back row, but they're going to be thinking about it.</p>
<p>Still, there was an urge to return to the <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em>, even if it was for a short while. The game has a fantastic trick that nearly every player is going to gloss over on their first playthrough, so I was raring to go. However, trying to get through the combat a second time just wasn’t cutting it for me.</p>
<h2><em>Dungeons of Hinterberg </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>
<p>I love the world of <em>Hinterberg</em>, I love the people that inhabit it, and the soft characterizations Microbird applies to each and every one of them. It's just that the core combat can be so tedious, that it became an obstacle I had to contend with to get to the good stuff. Sure, I could use Hinterberg as a retreat, but I care about this world, and as the game goes on, it’s quite clear that a lack of action doesn't help anybody.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
A flowery, gorgeous world that is enthralling to listen to, but abrasive to interact with, to the point where its structure can confuse players with its intent. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

Here is an incomplete list of people, creatures or things that susceptible Terrans have glimpsed in the surface of the Moon: an old man, a rabbit, a crow, a moose, a toad, and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjqb44/moroccos-anti-colonial-moon-king-livesinside-this-artists-memory">King Mohamed V of Morocco</a>. The technical term for this is "lunar pareidolia", which would have been a good alternative title for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/to-the-stars">To The Stars</a>, a spooky and spry "planet-hopping" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game in which the planets pout and grimace at you constantly, like a nestful of horrible baby sparrows.

<p>
Going by the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073490/To_the_Stars/">Steam demo</a>, To The Stars could be one of those deceptively simple timesinks. Each round starts you off with a single planet, with a number denoting the size of its starfleet. Click and drag a starlane to a neighbouring planet within range, and your scowling, smiling homeworld will proceed to sweat spaceships in that direction, chewing away at the target's garrison till it takes possession. 
</p>
<p>
In the process, it will also swiftly and merrily consume its own mass, devouring its internal resources till at last it explodes, by which point you'll hopefully have conquered that neighbouring planet, and be making inroads on two others. Yes, this is a "planet-hopping" game in the sense of hopping over crumbling platforms in Sonic. The empire must grow, because it is forever munching away at its own foundations. Of possible relevance: this game has funding from Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.
</p>
<p>
Should two planets send ships to attack each other, the one with the higher garrison capacity will usually prevail, but you can sway the odds by having other planets reinforce the defending planet. Again, it might seem simple. But then a few of your reinforcing worlds go pop, and then a third faction mounts an assault on your homeworld, and the whole board swirls around into an unexpected configuration.
</p>
<p>
Swallowing all the planets and exterminating all the other races is one way to win. Another is colonising all of the local astral monuments. These lack ship construction facilities, however, making them a chore to Klingon to, but if the other civs in play have higher overall ship speed and power stats, it might be your only option.
</p>
<p>
Each race - they include a faction of villainous cats and a society of crystalline yoga instructors - has a couple of special abilities on a cooldown, such as laser defences or a mind control aura that flips the allegiance of approaching vessels. There are some fun, unannounced variables - for instance, exploding planets wipe out ships within the blast radius, potentially buying a civ on the ropes a short reprieve. Speaking of reprieves, you can pause the game at any point. You'll probably want to, because the fact that every planet is a ticking timebomb means that most rounds are over in moments.
</p>
<p>
I really like the little I've played of To The Stars, which hits <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073490/To_the_Stars/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/to-the-stars-80b18e">Epic Games Store</a> in August. It's an adult kid's game, if that makes sense, an Aardman take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slipways">Slipways</a> with a sickly undertow of Ren &amp; Stimpy. The soundtrack is great, too - it's as twitchy and sherberty and insidious as the visuals. The trouble is, planetary phantasmagoria of this sort can be contagious. When I next look at the moon, will I see one of this game's celestial ogres leering back at me?

            <p>
While the world waits for news on Switch 2, there's still life in Nintendo's current aging console yet - and money to be made - as evidenced by the reveal of a Joy-Con Charging Stand.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo made the announcement via social media this morning, with word the device was officially dubbed the Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way) accessory, and would be available to buy from 17th October. 
</p>
<p>
How much will it cost? For now, Nintendo is keeping that rather crucial detail to itself.

<p>Why now? Well, people are more likely to have additional Joy-Con rattling around now than they did back at the Switch's launch in 2017, and it's a bit of a faff to ensure they all remain charged. </p>
<p>
Also, well, it's the Switch 1's final Christmas - why not make a bit more money off the old girl while you still can?

Will original Switch Joy-Con work on Switch 2? Nintendo hasn't said, though this would probably make the charging stand more of an investment.

Nintendo has said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">it will lift the lid on Switch 2 properly before the end of its current financial year</a>, however - so before 1st April 2025. 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Nintendo has rustled up an array of games to see off the Switch 1 this Christmas. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-finally-playable-in-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> releases on 26th September, Super Mario Party Jamboree launches on 17th October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-luigi-brothership-bringing-the-action-rpg-series-to-switch-this-year">Mario and Luigi Brothership</a> arrives 7th November, while Donkey Kong Country Returns HD slips in on 16th January 2025. Later in 2025 - and almost certainly also on Switch 2 - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-might-not-release-in-2024-tom-henderson-appears-to-have-suggested.930501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony's rumored upgraded PlayStation 5 model, the PS5 Pro, might very well not release later this year.</p>
<p>At least, that's what reputable leakier Tom Henderson appears to have been suggesting on X some hours ago. When asked about a possible September announcement for the long-rumored Pro model, Henderson <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1813546361872347328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replied</a> - "If it releases this year!". While this doesn't directly confirm that the PS5 Pro model won't be launching this year (heck, Sony hasn't even commented on the model's existence), this reply is somewhat interesting as Henderson has long been saying that Sony is planning a holiday 2024 release for the Pro model.</p>
<p>Back in March of 2023, Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-is-in-the-works-for-a-late-2024-release-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Sony was working on a PS5 hardware revision with a release sometime in late 2024. Several months later, in July 2023, Henderson talked about the codename for the PS5 Pro model - Trinity - <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-rumored-to-launch-in-november-2024-with-accelerated-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a planned release date in November 202</a>4. "Whether or not a PlayStation 5 Pro console is desired enough in the current market remains to be seen, but as of writing, the PlayStation 5 Pro is in development and is targeting a November 2024 release date", Henderson wrote back then (via Keytogaming).</p>
<p>Some months ago, Henderson again talked about the Pro model, <a href="https://wccftech.com/latest-ps5-pro-specs-are-real-says-insider-sony-still-targeting-holiday-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying the then leaked specs of the console were the real deal</a>. In addition, he said that Sony still appeared to be targeting a Holiday 2024 launch for the beefed-up PS5 console. Whether internal plans at Sony have changed or not remains to be seen at this point. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the rumored PS5 Pro model. For now, check out the leaked specs of the console below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Larger GPU with faster memory, providing 45% improved performance in rasterized rendering;</li>
<li>Massively improved ray tracing architecture that should deliver 2-3x speedup over the regular PS5, with peaks of 4x;</li>
<li>Custom machine learning architecture that supports 300 TOPS (Trillions of Operations Per Second) at 8-bit;</li>
<li>The ML architecture was built to enable the so-called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaling technique. The leaked document describes it as Sony's version of Multi Frame Super Resolution based on the PlayStation Machine Learning (PSML) algorithm. According to the leaked info, PSSR currently supports up to 4K, but there are plans to add 8K support;</li>
<li>PSSR is an ML-enhanced version of Temporal Anti-aliasing Upscaling (TAAU) that requires similar inputs to NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR and fully supports High Dynamic Range (HDR) pipelines. Moreover, no per-game training is required, just like with the latest version of DLSS. The document goes on to say PSSR requires just 250MB of the PS5 Pro's memory, with a current rendering cost of 2 milliseconds to upscale from Full HD to 4K, although optimization is still ongoing;</li>
<li>The document also includes an image comparison with TAAU and AMD FSR 2, reportedly showing that PSSR offers superior image quality.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/graft-is-harebraineds-new-game-slated-for-2026/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Harebrained Schemes has started teasing their new game called Graft. The brief video appears to show a sci-fi setting, which may or may not be based in the Shadowrun universe. Gamers interested in following the development of Graft can register for the newsletter <a href="https://www.harebrained-schemes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>. Don't expect to play the game this year or the next, though: the LinkedIn profile of Executive Producer Mike McCain (who returned to Harebrained Schemes earlier this year after directing BATTLETECH and Shadowrun: Dragonfall) mentions an unannounced game launching in 2026.</p>
<p>Then again, it's an appropriate timeline if you know what the studio has been up to. HBS launched the turn-based tactics game The Lamplighters League last October. Unfortunately, the game's reception and sales performance were so weak that parent company Paradox Interactive quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/harebrained-schemes-splits-with-paradox-will-seek-new-funding-and-partnerships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parted ways with the developer</a>, causing Harebrained Schemes to lay off many developers. The studio was also forced to go indie and seek funding elsewhere for its new project, which we now know to be called Graft.</p>
<p>As for what it actually is, we know very little about it from the HBS blog. In January, they wrote:</p>
<p><em>It is audacious. It builds on the best of the studio’s history while still being something new and compelling in the strategy space. It’s narratively rich, and there are so many natural connections between the narrative themes and the gameplay systems.</em></p>
<p>The developers made a demo and showed it to publishers at GDC 2024, where it reportedly got a lot of attention, according to Mike McCain:</p>
<p><em>This indie band has been firing on all cylinders! Iterating daily, and making smart and pragmatic decisions with some big creative wind in our sails. We landed in San Francisco with a stronger prototype and vision for our next game than we could have imagined at the start of the year. We met with a whole bunch of potential partners at GDC, and got some fantastic reactions to both the world we’re crafting and the prototype we’ve built. A couple ideas in particular really got eyes lighting up and folks nodding along with enthusiasm. Now, we keep talking and see where that energy leads.</em></p>
<p>Following this teaser, we might learn some actual details about Graft in the near future. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

<p>Last year, Red Bull hosted ‘League of Its Own’, a unique tournament that saw some of the biggest and best League of Legends teams take to a stage in Berlin. It was one of the most successful show matches in esports history, bringing in a peak viewer count of more than 500,000 users. The event was dominated by T1, fresh off a win at the 2023 World Championship – and the squad is reportedly looking to pull off a second win this time around.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-biggest-names-in-the-game">Biggest Names in the Game</h2>



<p>Several days ago, T1 secured the top spot at the Esports World Cup, netting a $400,000 prize following an intense playoffs round that saw the squad defeat Bilibili, Team Liquid, and Top Esports without breaking a sweat. It comes as no surprise that the team is now considered the frontrunner for the Red Bull League of Its Own tournament surfacing in December 2024.</p>



<p>This one-day event will host six teams invited from around the world, and so far, we know that Karmine Corp and T1 have secured a spot in the running. It’s an innovative tournament, with Red Bull applying some unexpected twists to the ruling, making it even more entertaining for the viewers – and a little more challenging for the competitors.</p>



<p>This year’s event will take place in Paris at the Accor Arena, with tickets starting at 40 EUR and running up to 110 EUR for ‘Premium’ tickets. </p>



<p>Will you be tuning in to this highly anticipated event?</p>

<p>Here’s what you can expect in the beta.</p>

<p>“Throne and Liberty features several kinds of large-scale activities, with some events allowing thousands of players to engage in battle together at one time.

Additionally, Throne and Liberty enables robust armour customization, allowing players to apply skins and unique colour schemes to their character, and different style and patterns to their base armor sets.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-speaks-truth-streaming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-speaks-the-truth-about-the-state-of-streaming-and-%E2%80%98cancel-culture%E2%80%99.930447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-speaks-truth-streaming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Ninja, who isn’t immune to his fair share of controversies, addressed the recent trends in the streaming industry during a recent on-air rant. He suggested that ‘cancel culture’ has run wild and that ‘every day, it’s something new’ and that ‘someone else is getting cancelled’ with each new day.</p>



<p>These comments surfaced following the recent Sketch scandal that saw explicit images of the streamer posted on social media.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-are-all-the-funny-clips-bro">‘Where Are All The Funny Clips, Bro?’</h2>



<p>Tyler ‘Ninja’ Blevins has been caught making inflammatory statements several times over the years, but he hasn’t ever been ‘cancelled’ like other streamers. Typically, something is discovered about a streamer or they’ll make a controversial comment, and that’s it – they’re flamed incessantly online and forced to pull back from doing what they love because of the sentiments of the community. </p>



<p>That’s what Ninja alluded to during a recent stream.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It just seems like people are literally looking to cancel anyone and everyone at all times. Literally, it’s every day. Every day, it is something, it is someone… Someone’s getting cancelled, or trying to, for something. Social media and Twitch right now, it’s just so stupid, I’m so over it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He made the comment of a lifetime, saying ‘Remember when we used to just play video games?’</p>



<p>It’s a simple line that’s indicative of the way the streaming world is going. These days, the most popular streamers aren’t known for their gameplay but for their antics and constant presence in front of a camera. The likes of Speed, Kai Cenat, Adin Ross, and Sketch weren’t necessarily popularised because they play games remarkably well, after all.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>"Social media…and streaming, its just so stupid, I'm so over it…remember when we used to just fking play video games?" </p><p>Ninja spoke on how he feels about the current state of streaming <a href="https://t.co/mSydKuVDZJ">pic.twitter.com/mSydKuVDZJ</a></p></div>— Hunter (@HUN2R) <a href="https://twitter.com/HUN2R/status/1813561438184829185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Ninja also bagged on ‘drama channels’ that stoke or hunt these topics, adding fuel to the fire. He asked where the fun is in gaming and streaming these days, questioning the absence of ‘funny clips’ and suggesting he’s getting too old for it all. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-london-devs-will-%E2%80%98vanish-from-society%E2%80%99-if-the-launch-fails.930444/</guid>

<p>Following several years of development, trailers, and dev updates, Fallout: London, the super-sized mod, is assumedly mere weeks away from being released. It’s in the final testing stages now, and fans are preparing to get involved with the game-sized mod that has taken years to be put together. Many thought it would never arrive following an indefinite delay issued in April as a result of the Fallout 4 next-gen upgrade, but now, we’re closer than ever.</p>



<p>However, in a recent interview, the development team admitted that if the mod fails to launch well, they’ll ‘vanish from society’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fail-and-flee">Fail and Flee</h2>



<p>Fallout: London is an ambitious mod – even if it does play fast and loose with the established lore of the Fallout universe. Over the last few years, more than 100 developers of all shapes and sizes have worked on the mod, which will be more than 30 GB in size when it’s eventually released on GOG. </p>



<p>It might be a huge deliverable backed by solid investments and hundreds – if not thousands – of hours of development, but many have spent the last few months believing it would never be released.</p>



<p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/17/fallout-london-lead-if-awful-launch-just-go-sleep-21231769/?ico=metro-posts_gaming_whats-trending-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking to Metro recently</a>, the FOLON project lead, Dean Carter, said what’ll happen if Fallout: London is a flop:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If it’s an awful launch then we’ll probably all just go to sleep, and vanish from society.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also mentioned what the plan is post-launch, suggesting that the core team will move into indie development and create their own games rather than piggybacking off Fallout 4 and simply creating mods.</p>

<p>Valve is still dealing with an antitrust lawsuit raised against Steam by Wolfire in 2021, and recently, some documents came to light that were mostly redacted <strong>but </strong>contained enough information for a few juicy tidbits to be revealed. One thing that was noted was Valve’s employee counts and how they were spread around the company. In a staggering revelation, it was shown that fewer than 80 employees worked on Steam in 2021 – and the number isn’t expected to have changed much.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-ratio-though">That Ratio, Though</h2>



<p>Steam is maintained by a team of fewer than 80 people, which is pretty insane when you consider the traffic the platform gets. Every year, more than 10,000 games are released on the platform, and every day, millions of people use the popular PC storefront to buy and play games. By market share, it’s the biggest gaming platform on PC, and it’s well known for the regular and immense sales it holds.</p>



<p>In documentation revealed from the Valve vs. Wolfire lawsuit, which <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lawsuit-paperwork-reveals-valve-employs-around-350-people-and-less-than-100-work-for-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was detailed by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, it was revealed that in 2021, Valve employed 336 people, and just 79 of those were working on Steam. It was then noted that in 2021, 10,000 games were released on the platform – which means that the relatively small team must be using some insane operating model to keep on top of it all.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that means the 79 employees were (or are) split up between:</p>



<ul>
<li>Technical operations</li>



<li>UI</li>



<li>Networking</li>



<li>Sales and purchasing</li>



<li>Provider management</li>



<li>Security</li>



<li>CX</li>



<li>Onboarding</li>
</ul>



<p>And whatever else you might expect is required to run Steam. That’s a huge undertaking for such a small team, but Steam is number one, so I guess they’re not complaining.</p>

<p>In April, Amazon’s Prime Video service launched Fallout, a live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic series that debuted in 1997. It was a monumental success, boosting the profile of Fallout worldwide and bringing millions of players into the games. For me, the Fallout television show is nothing short of a masterpiece and it hit the nail firmly on the head when it came to the authenticity of its representation of the legendary franchise.</p>



<p>It was just revealed that Fallout has landed a whopping 16 Emmy nominations – but how many will it win?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everyone-liked-that">Everyone Liked That</h2>



<p>Fallout has legs – that’s no big secret. It was recently discussed by the showrunners driving the project that the surface has only just been scratched in terms of the universe and the storytelling that’s up for grabs. </p>



<p>In a beautifully poetic coincidence, Fallout has wound up securing 16 nominations at the 76th Emmy Awards (Fallout 76, right?) and it looks in good shape to bring home plenty of those trophies. Last year, The Last of Us – which is widely considered the best live-action adaptation ever made – picked up 24 nominations and then won eight of those awards. Can Fallout beat The Last of Us’ record?</p>



<p> Here’s the full list of awards with my predictions against them:</p>



<ul>
<li>Outstanding Fantasy/Sci-Fi Costumes – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Stunt Coordination for Drama Programming <strong>– Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Production Design For A Narrative Period Or Fantasy Program – <strong>Win</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Picture Editing For A Drama Series – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Picture Editing For A Drama Series – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Main Title Design <strong>– Win </strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Period Or Fantasy/Sci-Fi Makeup – <strong>Win</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup – <strong>Win</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series – Walton Goggins – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Drama Series – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Sound Editing For A Comedy Or Drama Series <strong>– Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Sound Mixing For A Comedy Or Drama Series – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Special Visual Effects In A Season Or A Movie – <strong>Win</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Stunt Performance <strong>– Win</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Writing For A Drama Series – <strong>Lose</strong></li>



<li>Outstanding Music Supervision – <strong>Win</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Most of the nominations are for ‘The End’, which is the opening episode of the show that pulled in so many viewers. </p>



<p>How do you think Fallout will perform at the Emmy Awards?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/england-euro-2024-harry-kane-ea-sports-fc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year<a href="https://aftermath.site/aston-villa-fifa-pes-pro-evo-efootball-avfc-ecl-champions-league" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote about singleplayer sports games</a>, and how they're more than just isolated matches and campaigns. They are, for long-suffering fans especially, a kind of Dream Factory. Video game as therapy.</p><p>In May I was writing that while celebrating my beloved Aston Villa returning to the Champions League for the first time since 1983. This week, I am writing under sadder, more pressing circumstances.</p><p>You probably know by now that I'm Australian, but what most people don't know about me and my sporting interests is that, when it comes to football, my heart belongs to England. Between my own English family (who have played for Villa!) and my wife's English family, I've spent more nights watching--and screaming at--England than I probably have my own Socceroos.</p><p>Australians of roughly my age (I was born in 1980) grew up in a world where the Socceroos just weren't players on the world stage. Australia went <em>32 years</em> without appearing at the World Cup, and as part of the terrible Oceania Football Confederation<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRH5u5lpArQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> didn't have a decent local tournament to take part in either</a>. So every two years, every time the Euros and World Cup rolled around and Australian football fans were stuck on the sidelines (to be fair we will <em>always </em>be on the sidelines for the Euros, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unless there's a Eurovision-style intervention</a>), we needed <em>some </em>kind of investment. Being an immigrant nation, the solution here for me, my friends and just about everyone I know from football was simple: just start supporting the place your family originally came from.</p><p>Got Italian grandparents? You'd support Italy. Dad's Greek? You're Greek. And so it went, for Croatians and Spaniards and Scots, Dutch, Germans and Portuguese. In daily life everyone was Australian, most of us born here or at least calling here home, but every two years our hearts would belong to a nation and a team half a world away.</p><p>For most of those guys, the last few decades have been pretty good! Italy, Germany, France and Spain have all won the World Cup and the Euros, while even the Greeks and Portuguese have won the latter. And in all that time, England have won...nothing.</p><p>The nation that invented the sport and gave it to the world, that is home to the Premier League, that has repeatedly fielded star-studded lineups featuring some of the world's best players, has won nothing. Not a fuckin thing. England hasn't won a major international trophy since 1966. Indeed things have been so grim for most of my life--my earliest memories of supporting the team are at Italia 90--that it took until 2021 for them to even <em>reach another final</em>.</p><p>Which they lost. Then they made another one this week! <a href="https://defector.com/spain-was-unstoppable-to-the-very-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">And lost it too</a>. The wait goes on.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqimlFcJsM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Thirty Years Of Hurt is itself about to turn 30</a>. I get that for the rest of the world this is something of a punchline, or at the very least a source of amusement, and I completely understand why that is, but I'm not the rest of the world. I'm just sitting here wondering, as the years and decades roll on, and heartbreak piles atop disappointment atop heartbreak,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRWAQ255qhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> when does Gil get a lick</a>?</p><p>Maybe never! Maybe this is England's destiny.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1e42ywh/in_1966_after_england_won_the_world_cup_nelson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> To wander the wilderness forever cursed</a>, always thirsty and never able to drink, reaching semis and finals only to come up short every single time. If so, then so be it. I've had 44 years of practice, I am hardened to it now, if England go the rest of my life without winning something that will simply be how the biscuit has crumbled.</p><p>Being a fan of a team like this is frustrating because you feel so helpless. Trapped in a room you can't get out of, bound to a set of events that continually upset you but which you can't escape. To support England is to know that every two years, as the World Cup and Euros rotate, you are going to get your heart broken.</p><p>Just because I'm helpless watching the actual team stumble, though, doesn't mean I can't do <em>anything </em>about it. There's always the Dream Factory. So this week I've been playing the shit out of the Euro 2024 expansion for <em>EA Sports FC 24</em>, giving me a window into an alternate timeline where instead of lumbering around for seven games and<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/euro-2024-golden-boot-standings-top-scorers-kane-b2579696.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> winning the most embarrassing Golden Boot of all time</a>, Harry Kane looked sharp as a thistle and scored seven goals leading England through the tournament, culminating in a crushing 3-0 win over Germany in the final in which he scored a brace. The real Harry Kane may have drudged off the field on Sunday night still somehow without a major trophy to his name, but <em>my </em>Harry Kane, the one inside my Dream Factory, lifted the Henri Delaunay Trophy without breaking a sweat.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FC 24 | Official UEFA EURO 2024 Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpTyOJL59N0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Did this make me feel&nbsp;<em>better</em>? No. Only the slow passage of time--and maybe some day an actual victory in a major tournament--will achieve that. But for a few moments this week it has made me feel&nbsp;<em>slightly&nbsp;</em>better, in the way that the Dream Factory has always (and hopefully will always) be able to. I know that the victorious Harry Kane, the jubilant captain breaking a&nbsp;<em>58-year trophy drought</em>, is not real. The fact EA's player models haven't been significantly updated in over a decade sees to that.</p><p>But it's something. A temporary indulgence, a flight of fancy that's fun in the same way any other kind of daydream can be. It's not real, it will never be real, but for the moment I allow myself to pretend it is and could be, it's close. Closer than England have got over the last 58 years, anyway.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="UEFA Euro 2024 - England Win The Euros Celebration - EA Sports FC 24 (PS5)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iivkf9sIg48?start=11&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legendary-metal-slug-returns-with-metal-slug-awakening.930348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legendary-metal-slug-returns-with-metal-slug-awakening<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Classic arcade gameplay with stylized graphics and innovative new features</h2></div><section><p>For those who spent their youth in the captive grip of arcade games, the name Metal Slug needs no introduction. The action-filled side scroller was a mainstay in arcades across the globe, and it's making a comeback with Metal Slug: Awakening, now accessible on PC and mobile.</p><p>Unfamiliar with the franchise? It all started in 1996, when Metal Slug first appeared as an arcade machine. Almost every laundry shop or pizza joint had a Metal Slug machine. For just 25 cents, you could enjoy top-tier fun. There’s something nostalgic about that wild yet joyful arcade era of the ’90s, when you’d get so hooked on a game that you’d forget what time you were supposed to go back home.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/11/new-contents-far-beyond-classic-4-1720740295130.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The story of Metal Slug was set in a dystopian 2028. You took on the role of a soldier, fighting a coup that threatened to shatter the peace and impose a new world order. You bombarded enemies with relentless gunfire and melee attacks, all the way to the boss showdowns in each level.</p><p>On the way through each level, you could find prisoners of war who would give you rewards when you freed them. You always started with a simple handgun, but as you progressed through levels, you picked up special weapons — like machine guns, rocket launchers, and shotguns. You could also jump in tanks called Metal Slugs (the series’ namesake, of course). As the series progressed, it added more heroes and more special weapons.</p><p>Awakening is built on the same foundation as its predecessors. It still features side-scrolling action, special weapons, and Slugs. Even the iconic “mission start” and “mission complete” announcements from the original game are still present. But it's not all old-school — graphical updates breathe new life into characters, weapons, and vehicles; fresh characters with unique abilities debut; and innovative features and game modes offer a refreshing twist to the gameplay.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/11/metal-slug-mission-start-1-1720740354067.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Speaking of characters, that’s an area where Metal Slug: Awakening has expanded. While previous games had a maximum of six characters, Awakening has more than 20 — with more still on the way. You can unlock characters in the Treasure Dig mode, and each character has unique skills and an ultimate ability that can range from slowing down time to summoning a battleship.</p><p>Awakening introduces a mix of classic weapon types as well as unique, new-to-the-series armaments like sniper rifles, saw launchers, and a boxing gun (a literal firearm with a spring-loaded punching glove attachment). Additionally, all weapons come in different varieties, some of which can apply distinct status effects, such as freezing or burning enemies.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/11/diverse-missions-showcase-exquisite-skill-3-1720740384291.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Joint Operation is another one of the major innovations in Metal Slug: Awakening. In contrast to traditional arcade games where you might face bosses alone, you can now join forces with two additional players for those epic showdowns. You can do this by getting together with your friends or teaming up with strangers the game pairs you with. You’ll each choose your own character and pack your most potent weapons before hitting the battlefield to claim victory.</p><p>Looking for a change of pace? You can dive into the PvP mode for a different experience. Face off against real players, controlling three characters and switching them in and out to demonstrate your unique combat style. With three characters and three weapons at your disposal, the combinations you can come up with offer countless possibilities.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/11/team-up-fight-with-friends-2-1720740405635.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Now, time for play! Metal Slug: Awakening is available to download for free right now on PC, iOS, and Android, and you can play it with a controller. Your progress is linked to an account that can be used across all platforms, so you’ll never have to start over from scratch. Enjoy your time revisiting a classic series.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[College Football 25 Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/college-football-25-review-in-progress.930333/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>About a week before College Football 25’s play-early-if-you-give-EA-more-money release, I found myself at a friend’s wedding in Texas, overhearing someone with plans to buy a brand new console <em>just</em> to be able to get this game. I knew the long-awaited return of an NCAA video game was going to be popular, but I didn’t realize it was going to be system-selling levels of enticing. I’ve thought about that guy a lot as I’ve played College Football 25 over the last week, and about how excited he was – I wonder if he’s bought it yet, and if he’s having a good time, because so far my own experience as a longtime Madden player has been… mixed. The on-field action and visuals are generally stellar, but the barebones modes, awful UI, lack of tutorials, and slew of other annoyances and poor design choices have made everything else about it a pretty joyless slog so far. </p><p>Let’s get the good stuff out of the way first: College Football 25’s presentation is light-years beyond what developer EA Orlando has been doing with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-24-review">Madden</a>. You can see sweat on individual players, the lighting is exceptional, and everything pops visually in a way that Madden just doesn’t. There’s also just a lot more stuff to enjoy, from the unique intros for each team as they take the field to mascots dancing around when their school pulls off a big play. There’s even performances from cheerleaders, school-specific cheers, and live cuts to the crowd reacting to what’s happening in real time. College Football 25 captures a lot of the pageantry and tradition that makes college football unique, and that makes it feel unique, too. I hope some of this added focus on presentation will make it over to Madden in the next few years.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>College Football 25 Sights and Sounds Deep Dive</h3></div></output><p>The other major difference is that it just feels <em>faster</em> and a whole lot more fluid. Plays happen more quickly, there’s less delay between them, and players feel like they’re moving more nimbly, too. When real-life players make the transition from college to the NFL, you’ll often hear them talk about having to adapt to the faster speed of the NFL game – here, though, it’s the other way around, and it makes College Football 25 feel dynamic in a way that Madden doesn’t.</p><p>There are also a lot of nice little touches throughout. I like how selecting your favorite team (which you do by choosing their helmet, not a name from a list) decorates the main menu with photos of their mascot, stadium, and other cool, team-specific things like ticket stubs, or how the loading screens and on-field play art looks like they’ve been drawn by hand. College Football 25 has <em>personality</em>. Oh, and unlike Madden 24, there’s no menu lag. It’s the little things.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As far as modes go, things are a little barebones. </p></div><p>As far as modes go, though, things are a little barebones. You’ve got your standard Play Now feature for jumping into a quick game; Road to the College Football playoffs, which is an online ranked mode where you’ll pick a team and try to guide them to a National Championship; Road to Glory, which lets you create your own player and pilot them through their college career; Dynasty, where you’ll helm one of College Football 25’s 134 (!) teams as either a head coach or an offensive or defensive coordinator; Practice and Mini-Games modes; and finally, College Ultimate Team (CUT), the college version of Madden Ultimate Team, which is still a slot machine masquerading as a trading card game that will almost assuredly make EA hundreds of millions of dollars and eventually earn the ire of the player base as it gets more updates on a yearly basis than every other mode combined. Cynical? Maybe, but we’ve seen this movie before.</p><p>EA’s servers have been something of a mess since launch, so I haven’t really gotten to play much Dynasty yet – whenever I try to make a Dynasty league, it always fails to download the latest rosters from EA’s servers or sign my coach’s contract) – but I have messed around with the other modes, and so far, I’m pretty whelmed. I’ve spent the most time in Road to Glory, so let’s start there.</p><p>Disappointingly, there are no high school games to play in Road to Glory as there were in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/05/ncaa-football-14-review">NCAA Football 14</a>. Instead, you spawn your player from the ether, choose a position (you can play as a QB, HB, WR, MLB, or CB), and determine whether you want to start as a 5-star, 4-star, 3-star, or 2-star recruit. The better you are as a prospect, the sooner you’ll see the field, and the better you’ll play when you do, but starting off as a less desirable recruit is more challenging, and ultimately, more rewarding if you manage to make it to a starting position. (After all, everyone loves an underdog story.) I started as a 5-star QB named Joe Throw who got picked up by 5-star Michigan because I already work hard enough at my day job, thank you very much, and it’s been… not great.</p><p>Each week, you’ll allocate Rest Points to stats like Academics, Health, Training, Leadership, Brand, and so on. You only have so many, and sometimes you’ll get a text from a sponsor offering you an endorsement deal or from your academic advisor offering some extra study time, which will take up a good chunk of your weekly allotment. Spending points the right way is important because you have to maintain a certain GPA and don’t want to be so tired you open yourself up to injury. So far, however, it’s pretty basic resource management and the lack of any cutscenes means you’re mostly just navigating menus. Think of a somehow more barebones version of Madden’s already barebones Superstar mode, and you’re on the right track.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>My Road to Glory player is undefeated, but I’m not having much fun winning.</p></div><p>What’s really frustrating, though, is the on-field Road to Glory experience. As a quarterback, you’re only given one play call option each down, and you’’ll have to run that play unless you spend limited Play Change points to unlock two other choices. Earn more of your coach’s trust by playing well and spend your Rest Points wisely throughout the week, and you’ll get more plays to choose from. Makes sense, right? The issue is that even with maximum trust, you seemingly can’t audible, so if the plays you are given look like a bad fit against what the defense is showing you, there’s nothing you can do besides hot route your receivers on passing plays and hope it works out. On running plays? You’re out of luck, Jack. </p><p>And even if you spent the Play Change points, you’re still limited in what you can call, and sometimes it barely makes a difference anyway. If you don’t want a running play and spend a Play Change point, there’s no guarantee you won’t get two more running plays. Spending a point and getting what are essentially two more versions of the same play feels <em>bad</em> because you don’t earn more points as a game goes on. I get that this restriction is meant to simulate building your coach’s trust, and that’s all well and good, but at least let me have one or two pre-approved audibles. Give me <em>something</em>. Don’t get me wrong: Michigan is, as of now, undefeated; Joe Throw is almighty. But I’m not having that much fun winning.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>College Ultimate Team is… Ultimate Team. The Challenges you have to do to progress are boring, and it’s designed to take annoyingly long so that even decent players start to think opening their wallets isn’t a bad idea. College Football 25’s real sin, however, is locking all of the tutorial content inside Ultimate Team. Madden’s excellent Skills Trainer, which will walk you through everything from basic gameplay to identifying and beating certain defensive coverages? Not here. Instead, it’s been replaced with Ultimate Team Challenges, and the change is as bad as it sounds. One early one put me inside the red zone and tasked me with throwing a lob pass. You know, the kind you throw on deep balls after your receiver beats their corner and is running free down the field. And because it’s Ultimate Team and not the Skills Trainer, you have to choose the right play from your playbook, and make the pass in a single try. Otherwise, you’re staring at the “Challenge Failed” message over and over and over again. Remember, this is meant to be a tutorial.</p><p>It’s hard not to be deeply cynical about this design choice. Surely EA Orlando could have taken the Skills Trainer, which has existed in Madden for several years, and put another version of it into College Football 25. The only reason to do it this way is to encourage new players to go into CUT – of course, they’d have to realize that the tutorials are in CUT in the first place, which is something College Football 25 doesn’t advertise at all. As someone who doesn’t play Ultimate Team beyond the review period for obvious reasons, I just assumed that there were no tutorials at all and EA simply wanted college football-loving folk who don’t regularly play Madden to suffer. In actuality, however, they want them to get hooked on CUT and spend lots and lots of money. I’m not sure which is worse.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While the visuals generally look wonderful, the UI is atrocious.</p></div><p>And then there are things that just don’t make sense. Every CPU team I’ve played so far loves to run a no-huddle offense, but College Football 25 does not simulate the time between plays unless you turn on the accelerated clock option in the menus. Teams otherwise come to the line instantaneously, which, aside from being annoying and making everyone on your defense very tired very quickly, means games last far longer than they should. The mini-games, which are generally more fun and varied than Madden’s (though some, like WR Battle, are one-to-one recreations), have a scoring system so strict they are impossible to get gold medals on unless you play perfectly. Bafflingly, there’s also no option to restart a mini-game if you finish it and don’t like your score, as there is in Madden, so I’ve found myself picking easy ones like Option Attack and just running them over and over again to spend as little time with them as possible. If you want to restart a mini-game to try and hit a higher score after you’ve completed it, you have to close and reopen the entire game.</p><p>And while College Football 25’s visuals are generally wonderful, the UI is, to put it kindly, atrocious. Madden has an automated hat count, which will show you how many defenders are lined up in both sides of the box on running plays and whether or not you have an advantage in blockers on either side. It’s not there in College Football, so you’d better know how to do that yourself. (I hope you like playing the CUT tutorials!) The “previous play” arts showing you the last play the offense and defense ran are hidden unless you flick the right stick to bring up that menu, which isn’t immediately obvious. It’s hard to see how much stamina defensive linemen have because, unlike the bar used in Madden, stamina in College Football 25 is represented by small blue circles over their heads that are hard to see, especially if you’re zoomed out. There are no on-screen notifications telling you what type of pass you just threw, whether you landed a hit stick, whether that pick you just got was perfectly timed, or anything else. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Will's Favorite Football Games</h3></p></div><p>God help you if you’d like to actually see what abilities your players have mid-match because the icons were made for ants. And while play arts look great on the field, the ones in your playbook are a step down from what recent Maddens have offered. Oh, and then there’s the genuinely embarrassing things, like certain schools having outdated logos – EA has publicly admitted to Stanford, Western Michigan, and Jacksonville State already – and certain player likenesses being inaccurate. I understand that College Football 25 is a massive undertaking, and EA hasn’t made a game like this in a long time, but the whole thing feels rushed, incomplete, and in a lot of ways, not up to par with Madden, much less <em>the other sports games</em> <em>that Madden already wasn’t up to par with</em>, which is basically all of them.</p><p>I still find myself thinking a lot about that guy I overheard at my friend’s wedding, a person who is buying a $500 console just to play this game. I wonder if he, as someone who doesn’t play a lot of video games, is having fun – because despite the NCAA’s wider appeal, so far it feels like anyone who doesn’t already know how to play EA’s football games is going to have a <em>really</em> bad time with College Football 25. Even as someone who plays way too much Madden, the stuff that’s not here is both baffling and infuriating. It’s barebones, sports poor UI design, has tutorials that range from “bad” to “non-existent,” and features a number of other frustrations that simply shouldn’t be here. Oh, and I really don’t appreciate seeing an Ultimate Team pop-up every time I exit every other game mode. I know it’s there, EA. We all do. I just don’t want to play it.</p><p>Maybe Dynasty will change things once the servers get sorted out and I can finally play it. Maybe that’s what makes everything click. I have a lot more to see and a lot more to play. The on-field game is fun! The presentation is excellent! But everything, and I do mean <em>everything</em>, surrounding those things makes me want to go lie down in a dark room for a few hours and think about the choices I’ve made to reach this moment. Maybe, by the time I have my final thoughts ready sometime next week, everything will click. But right now, EA College Football 25 feels like a college quarterback who left school for the NFL too soon, got drafted way higher than he should have because a team was desperate, started under intense scrutiny from a fanbase and an owner who are tired of losing all the time, and then flamed out of the league  because he just wasn’t ready for prime time. You always wonder what might have been with a player like that. Sometimes, it’s better not to rush, and instead spend an extra year honing your skills. You’d think the publisher behind Madden, of all things, would understand that.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

EA was ordered to stop creating college football games after a lawsuit between the company and former college football players arose over name, image, and likeness (NIL). This prevented any new games until 2021, when the NCAA created rules to compensate players based on NIL. Three years later, College Football 25 is here, with player names available in game for the very first time.<output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>College Football 25 Official Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Many of the older modes have returned to College Football 25, including Dynasty, Team Builder, and Road to Glory. Of course, dozens of new features have been added, including Stadium Pulse, which creates challenging road environments in college football's biggest stadiums. Over 10,000 athletes have opted into the NIL program for the game, with roster updates periodically planned as more players transfer or opt into the game.</p><p>While this Best Buy deal is great for console owners, <strong>Amazon has an ongoing promotion where you can save $30 off a new PlayStation 5</strong> by purchasing the College Football 25 game. Simply add both to your cart from <a href="https://zdcs.link/Lblxb?object_uuid=843cfc7c-a7fd-47b0-96bf-609e74451c49&amp;t=article" target="_blank">this link</a> and you can save on a new console!</p><p><em>Looking for more deals?

                <p>There have been numerous layoffs and studio closures in 2024, but one of the most-surprising was Microsoft's decision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">shut down Tango Gameworks</a>, the studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hi-fi-rush-review-good-vibes-only/1900-6418023/" data-ref-id="1900-6418023">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, The Evil Within, and more. Now, Silent Hill creator and Bokeh Game Studio founder Keiichiro Toyama has shared his thoughts about why Tango Gameworks didn't survive.</p><p>Tango Gameworks was founded Shinji Mikami, who made his name in the survival horror genre with Resident Evil just as Toyama established himself with Silent Hill. Mikami stayed true to his survival horror roots with Tango's first two games, The Evil Within and The Evil Within 2. According to Toyama, the decision to branch out from that genre may have harmed Tango's long-term prospects.</p><p>"I don't feel it's my place to give them advice, but I think going back to what I said earlier about the balance of routine and preserving the style of your games is relevant," said Toyama while speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/slitterhead-how-silent-hills-creator-is-building-2024s-craziest-horror-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "<span>You look at an example like From Software: They keep making different games but certain styles and aspects of their games stay the same. That's an obvious example of how a studio is successful. Not changing everything every time might be the key to life and surviving."</span></p><p><span>Mikami actually explained Tango's shift from survival horror <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-wants-to-be-known-for-more-than-just-survival-horror-games/1100-6501856/" data-ref-id="1100-6501856">in a 2022 interview</a> where he expressed his desire to expand beyond that familiar genre. "Of course, it's nice to have fans think of us as a studio with a reputation for developing survival-horror games," said Mikami. "But we also want to be viewed as a studio that can create a wider variety of games."</span></p><p><span>Toyama's comments didn't take into account the way that Xbox Game Pass has also taken away the incentive for many players to buy when they can sample instead. Microsoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-exclusive-hi-fi-rush-hits-2-million-players" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">touted Hi-Fi Rush as a success</a> when it netted 2 million players, and that still wasn't enough save the studio. </span>Mikami <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-founder-shinji-mikami-finally-speaks-out-about-his-departure/1100-6522985/" data-ref-id="1100-6522985">left Tango Gameworks in 2023</a>, months before the decision to shut down the studio was made by Microsoft.</p><p>While Tango Gameworks has been shuttered, fans of Hi-Fi Rush can still look forward to Limited Run's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-is-still-getting-a-physical-edition-by-limited-run/1100-6523334/" data-ref-id="1100-6523334">upcoming physical edition of the game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200819/microsoft-nvidia-geforce-now-integration-xbox-store-pages<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is integrating Nvidia’s GeForce Now service into its store pages for Xbox games. The integration will allow you to pick between either Xbox Cloud Gaming or Nvidia’s GeForce Now service when you view a game listing on the web.</p><p>Currently, Microsoft only lists its own Xbox Cloud Gaming service under “play with cloud gaming” on game listings, so it’s surprising to see the company add Nvidia’s GeForce Now service. At the time of publication, the new “play with cloud” button isn’t available just yet, so it’s not clear whether this is simply a link to the main homepage of GeForce Now or whether this deep links and launches the game directly on Nvidia’s cloud gaming service. </p><p>Nvidia’s GeForce Now RTX 4080 tier is the most impressive cloud gaming service available right now, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23537161/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-4080-tier-pricing-release-date">Nvidia even claiming</a> the end-to-end latency beats an Xbox Series X running locally on a 60Hz TV. </p><p>Microsoft and Nvidia are no strangers when it comes to cloud gaming partnerships, though.   Both companies signed a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/21/23608930/microsoft-nvidia-geforce-now-xbox-games-announcement">10-year deal</a> to allow Nvidia to license Xbox PC games for GeForce Now, including Activision Blizzard titles. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23963718/nvidia-geforce-now-pc-game-pass-xbox-account-sync">Nvidia also rolled out an update</a> to GeForce Now earlier this year that allows members to sync their Xbox accounts and Microsoft Store purchases to the cloud gaming service. You can even stream Xbox PC games through PC Game Pass on GeForce Now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
