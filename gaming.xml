Midsummer Studios announced their existence in May 2024 with a promise to “revitalise the life sim genre”, but now, they’re closing down. Co-founder and former XCOM developer Jake Solomon announced the news on social media this week, saying goodbye with some brief pre-alpha footage of Burbank - a build-your-own-TV-series project with a lot of generative AI in it.
</p>
<p>
“We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both,” Solomon writes. “Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into.”
</p><!--more-->
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-xcom-and-civilization-devs-team-up-to-launch-a-next-gen-lifesim-inspired-by-stephen-king-and-gilmore-girls">Everything I knew</a> up to this point about Midsummer’s activities came from Katharine Castle’s (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-superheroes-to-soap-operas-xcoms-jake-solomon-unveils-first-details-of-his-new-studio-and-next-gen-life-sim">write-up for Eurogamer in May 2024</a>. Back then, the studio’s debut project was billed as a small town life sim with inspirations ranging from Stephen King to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gilmore-girls">Gilmore Girls</a>. You’d have been able to create a character and choose a story theme, like seducing the local hottie. The town itself was billed as an endlessly evolving simulation, with new scenarios arising over time.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure whether they’re the same game, but Burbank appears to have sprung from a similar narrative sandbox ambitions.  Solomon describes Burbank as “’Life Sims + The Truman Show’, but it’s more than that”.
</p>
<p>
“I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up,” he continues in this week’s closure announcement. “Burbank let's you do that [sic]. We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we've never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that's special. What you're about to see is definitely pre-alpha. But this game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us.”
</p>
<p>
Here’s an embed of Solomon's post with the Burbank clip. Apologies, Xitter haters - I can't find it on another platform.
</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote data-media-max-width="560"><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both.

</span></p><p>
As you can probably tell from the Wonkaverse voice-acting, the game’s characters were to “use AI for memory, reasoning and speech”, though Solomon doesn’t explain what form of generative AI or machine learning the game would have called upon. “That’s what let's you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write,” He goes on. “But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing *any* developers with AI.” 
</p><p>
Except for the writers and performers you presumably didn’t hire to create stories and dialogue, I guess? I’d like Solomon to go into more depth here. I’d also like to hear more about why exactly Midsummer are going under, and whether Burbank will live on in some guise, as Solomon's present-tense framing sort of suggests it might.</p>
<p>The studio launched with $6 million in funding raised by Krafton, TV and film company Day Zero Productions, and a brace of venture capitalist firms - Transcend Fund, Tirta Ventures, Betaworks Ventures, 1Up Ventures, and F4 Fund. $6 million is a lot of money to me, but I am not a Money Scientist, and I don’t understand the workings of venture capital beyond a general sense that VCs are leopard seals in humanskin suits.</p>
<p>As of writing, Midsummer have 12 members of staff listed on LinkedIn, including Solomon himself. Best of luck to all affected.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Day is right around the corner, and a flood of news is expected to mark the 30th anniversary of the franchise, so there’s a long line of things on our wishlist.</p>



<p>Taking place on February 27, 30 years since the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Red and Green in Japan, a special Pokémon Day Presents showcase is being aired. While the precise contents are unknown, there’s plenty that could be on the agenda.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has curated a wishlist of the biggest things we want to see announced on Pokémon Day, which you can see below.</p>







<h2 id="h-7-things-we-want-to-see-at-pokemon-day-2026">7 Things We Want to See at Pokémon Day 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-gen-10-teaser">Gen 10 Teaser</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Successor. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Undoubtedly, the biggest drop that could be revealed on Pokémon Day is the full reveal, or first teaser, for the 10th generation of the franchise.</p>



<p>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were initially released in November 2022, so it’s already been longer than the standard three-year cycle between Pokémon generations. As such, there is a huge expectation that Gen 10 will be officially teased or revealed during Pokémon Day.</p>



<p>Even a short teaser would set the internet alight, and a likely release window of Fall 2026 means there’s still ample time for a detailed reveal later this year.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-dlc">Pokopia DLC</h3>



<p>Pokopia is the newest game released by Pokémon, landing on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-countdown-exact-release-date-start-times/" id="177262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 5</a>, and there’s plenty to be excited about as the franchise delves into the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/life-simulation/" id="2994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-simulation</a> genre for the first time.</p>



<p>There has already been a host of reveals for Pokopia, but the game is surely set to appear in the presentation in some capacity. It could well be just more details of what to expect, but there could be a reveal of DLC or a post-launch update.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/" id="176556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia Hands-On Preview</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Pokopia has the potential to launch an entirely new series of games for Pokémon, so there is plenty that could shine.</p>



<h3 id="h-johto-love">Johto Love</h3>



<p>Last year marked the 25th anniversary of Pokémon Gold and Silver, but the anniversary was largely overlooked, apart from Chikorita and Totodile being starter choices in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a-2/" id="3627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>



<p>A relaunch of Heart Gold and Soul Silver would be the dream, but is unlikely to follow on from the Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green announcements; there are other options, however. For the past few years, persistent speculation has surrounded a potential sequel to Pokémon Let’s Go.</p>



<p>Whether it’s a new game or a big feature in an existing game, Johto deserves some love and shouldn’t be forgotten.</p>



<h3 id="h-black-white-remake">Black/White Remake</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Return? Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Pokémon remake schedule was hit hard by the disappointment of Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, but remakes haven’t been wiped from the schedule entirely.</p>



<p>Gen 5 is the next in line for a remake, and there is a chance that a teaser for remakes of Black and White appear. Though it would be a surprise to see the titles squeezed in before Gen 10 releases, it’s not entirely out of the question.</p>



<p>Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl were released in November 2021, just two months before the drop of Pokémon Legends: Arceus and a year before Scarlet and Violet, so there’s certainly room in the schedule.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-spin-off-game">New Spin-Off Game</h3>



<p>Pokémon already has one spin-off title on the schedule with Pokopia, but there could be more to appear before Gen 10, and there are some options.</p>



<p>Pokémon Champions’ release date announcement is surely inevitable, with the World Championships in August being competed on the title, but there could be something else. Over the years, the likes of Pokémon Snap have appeared, and there’s a long line of fan favourites that could be revived.</p>

</ul>



<p>It might be too early for a new Mystery Dungeon title, but I’m not giving up hope just yet.</p>



<h3 id="h-30th-anniversary-tcg-set">30th Anniversary TCG Set</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Big reveals. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>A 30th anniversary TCG set is a certainty this year and the first reveal should take place on Pokémon Day. As usual, expect it to be released in Japan first, before then seeing an international year.</p>



<p>The Japanese TCG schedule is now set until June, with Abyss Eye in May and Storm Emeralda in July, which leaves the perfect spot for an anniversary release. Trademarks for Celebration Collection have already been uncovered, and a full reveal on Pokémon Day makes too much sense.</p>



<h3 id="h-netflix-live-action-news">Netflix Live Action News</h3>



<p>A live-action Netflix series has been reported for years, first emerging in 2021, and it’s surely time for the first teaser or official confirmation to be shown.</p>



<p>Pokémon has expanded much deeper into TV series in recent years, with the likes of Pokémon Concierge released, and the live-action series would be an instant hint for fans. Partnering with Netflix is also a smart move, opening the doors to an entirely new audience.</p>



<p>There are murmurs of a Detective Pikachu sequel, which would be great, but a live-action Netflix series would certainly be better.</p>

<p>Pokémon collecting will never die from now until forever, whether it’s cards, games, movies, or novelty Gengar slippers. Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green are coming back, but there are questions over physical copies and how much these modern-day remakes will cost.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-release-for-switch-next-week/" id="178067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green</a> are re-releasing in 2026, and it’s a good year to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> fan—to be fair, it normally is. </p>



<p>If you’re already wishlisting either game, you need to know if they’re digital-only and how many Nuggets you need to sell to buy them.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At launch, the 2026 Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green games will be available online-only as a Nintendo eShop digital purchase.</strong></p>



<p>You can’t have it all, sadly. If you love collecting Pokémon games, then (for now at least) Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green will need to be in your intangible collection, as neither <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a> nor The Pokémon Company has revealed a physical edition.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>They were both on Game Boy Advance cartridges when they came out in 2004—we feel your pain if you’re a 90s kid. This time around, the purchase is tied to a digital download with no physical media.</p>



<p>The official Pokémon site had this to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“These classic remakes of&nbsp;Pokémon Red&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pokémon Green&nbsp;will be available to download from&nbsp;Nintendo eShop&nbsp;after the conclusion of the Pokémon Presents.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nintendo is exceptional when it comes to business, which is why you shouldn’t rule out a physical edition. Many publishers opt to go digital first and then release a physical copy later on. That could easily be the case for Pokémon Fire Red or Pokémon Leaf Green, and there might come a time when you can catch ’em all AND a case!</p>



<p>As always, Insider Gaming will update you if this proves to be the…case.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-pokemon-fire-red-amp-pokemon-leaf-green-cost">How Much Does Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green cost $19.99 or £16.99 each, and there’s currently no bundle to buy them together, or promotion to reduce the price.</strong></p>



<p>As we said, Nintendo is a smart business company, and people are going to flock to these releases like Pidgeys to a Caterpie, regardless of the $20 price tag.</p>

</ul>



<p>Should both games have been released as freebies for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers as part of the Game Boy Advance library offering? That’s a debate for another day, and it’s sure to go on.</p>



<p>Is this a fair price for what is an updated port? Should it have been included with Nintendo Switch Online?

            <p>Ubisoft has not one, but two Far Cry games currently in development.</p>
<p>That's coming from Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot, who was interviewed by <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">Variety</a> about various goings on at the company, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">such as its recent 'restructuring'</a> which will see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">including the already launched subsidiary with Tencent known as Vantage Studios</a>.</p>

<p>Here, the publication asked Guillemot if this new company model will see development on its biggest franchises such as Far Cry and Assassin's Creed speed up, to which the exec replied:</p>
<p>"We have a solid pipeline underway across Vantage Studios. Under the Assassin's Creed brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year.</p>
<p>"On Far Cry, anticipation is high, and we currently have two very promising projects in development."</p>
<p>It was previously reported that Ubisoft had two new Far Cry releases on the way, but this is now official confirmation that this indeed the case. As for those previous reports, it has been said that one release - codenamed Project Blackbird - will be the next mainline Far Cry entry. This chap will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-7-will-reportedly-see-players-attempting-to-rescue-their-kidnapped-family-against-the-clock">allegedly feature a "non-linear" story based around the kidnapping of the protagonist's family</a>, that plays out over - and seemingly must be completed within - 72 in-game hours, equating to 24 hours in real-time.</p><p>The second game previously reported to be in the works is a standalone Far Cry multiplayer game, known as Project Maverick. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-reportedly-in-development-at-ubisoft">sources claimed Maverick would be an extraction-based shooter pitched as being based in "the Alaskan wilderness"</a>. At this time, it was said Maverick would allegedly include "mechanics such as permadeath, a backpack system, contracts, and more". The "and more" here could likely refer to lootable chests and extraction zones.</p>

<figcaption>The latest mainline Far Cry entry - Far Cry 6 - took players to the fictional Caribbean island of Yara. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for Assassin's Creed, we already know about some of its upcoming games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-project-hexe">such as Project Hexe</a> and of course <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-finally-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-rumours-with-a-gta-meme">its Black Flag remake</a>. However, a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/">Insider Gaming</a> has said that as part of Ubisoft's recent restructuring, two upcoming Assassin's Creed titles were cancelled, including one said to be called Assassin's Creed Singularity.</p>
<p>According to the publication's sources, Singularity was intended to be a virtual trading card game with Web3 and blockchain integration, and it would have been released across PC and mobile platforms. While I do have my - ahem - thoughts about what Ubisoft has done to its studios and games over the past few months, this is one game I don't feel especially sad to see gone.</p>
<figure>

<p>Elsewhere at the company, as well as these two Far Cry games, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-anthology-series-in-the-works-with-always-sunny-in-philadelphias-rob-mac">anthology series is also in the works with Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob Mac (née McElhenney) and Alien Earth creator Noah Hawley</a>. In addition to a producer role, Mac - who also played Ian Grimm on comedy series Mythic Quest - will star in the Far Cry series, but as who remains for now unknown.</p>
<p>As for Ubisoft more generally, earlier today it was announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-laying-off-40-devs-at-studio-working-on-splinter-cell-remake-but-confirms-the-game-is-still-in-production">company was laying off 40 developers at the studio working on its Splinter Cell remake</a>, but the game itself remains in production.</p>

<p>We're covering a generation a day until we've ticked off all nine, leading up to the ultimate showdown. <strong>Each poll will be open for five days</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Started 2026 as January’s Best-Selling Game in the US, While Subscriptions Drove 3% Spending Growth]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-best-selling-game-in-us-january-2026/</link>
            <guid>1441873</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Circana</strong> executive director <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> has shared his first monthly sales report of 2026 for video game sales in the US, and it's <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</strong> taking the top spot on the premium sales charts for January 2026. Overall spending in the video game industry in the US was up <strong>3%</strong> compared to last year, with subscription services and hardware sales driving that growth.</p>



<p>It's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's second month in a row sitting atop the US premium game sales charts, though finishing 2025 as the best-selling game of December was not enough to beat <strong>Battlefield 6</strong>, which was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-best-selling-game-in-us-2025/">best-selling game of 2025 in the US.</a> That said, the lack of content coming to Battlefield 6 (its second season <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-now-live-drives-highest-steam-concurrent-count-this-month/">only arrived earlier this week</a>) did not help its January 2026 sales, as the game fell out of the top three to <strong>fifth</strong> place on the sales charts.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <strong>NBA 2K26</strong> kept its second-place spot, <strong>Minecraft</strong> moved up to fourth place from eighth, and <strong>Madden NFL 26</strong> went from fourth to third. Overall, not a whole lot of shuffle in the top five, but in the top ten, there was one very notable entry that moved up from <strong>225th</strong> place all the way to <strong>ninth</strong> place. </p>



<p>That game was <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong>, which made its massive jump into the top ten thanks to its release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong> last month.</a> Technically, even though <strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong> sits between FFVII and the only new release on the charts, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-ii-ps5-review-bonds-across-time-and-wasted-space/">Code Vein 2</a></strong>, it's probable that Code Vein 2 missed the top ten because of FFVII Remake.</p>



<p>That said, at least when looking solely at PC game sales in the US, Code Vein 2 sat at the top of the charts.</p>







<p>The only other game included in the top 20 for January 2026 that wasn't already one of the top 30 best-selling games in the US for December 2025 was <strong>Fallout 4</strong>, which just eeks in at the number 20 spot after being in <strong>68th</strong> place in December 2025. </p>



<p>As we move deeper into the year, it'll be interesting to see how long Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 can hold a spot above Battlefield 6 in the charts, and which upcoming games are able to keep both of them out of first place.</p>



<p>Moving away from the sales charts, while January isn't known for being a major period in the year for players spending a lot on games, especially since it arrives just after the holiday craze, overall spending in the US video games industry was up <strong>3% </strong>compared to January 2025, driven by hardware and subscription spending. </p>







<p>A sign that people were probably using their monetary holiday gifts to grab a new console, specifically the <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, which were the number one and two best-selling hardware units for January 2026. Looking at hardware spending alone, January 2026 was a <strong>16% increase</strong> compared to January 2025.</p>



<p>With the January 2026 report in the books, it'll be interesting to see where the charts line up for February 2026, especially since there are more than a few major releases from this month, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-sells-1m-copies-fastest-selling-game-series/">one-million unit seller <strong>Nioh 3</strong></a> and the upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong>.</p>

<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6">Wordle games are <strong>updated daily at 12 am or Midnight in your respective time zone</strong>.

<h2 id="block-96ac6df0-5b63-4788-9eff-98ceece739ee">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <guid>1441864</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Lorcana has just launched its 11th new set, Winterspell, and there's a whole lot to like about it already. The new frost-themed card art is sublime, and it's undeniably a particularly cosy expansion before we look ahead to the highly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-full-release-schedule-2026">Wilds Unknown expansion in May</a>, featuring fan favorite Pixar characters for the first time.</p><p id="winterspells-10-top-chase-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Winterspell's 10 Top Chase Cards">Lorcana: Winterspell - 10 Best Chase Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But enough on that, let's take a look at what's really rocking for single card collectors in Winterspell, including two brand new iconic rares that are already demanding a mighty high price (we're talking thousands of dollars), and unsurprisingly, feature some of the finest art I've ever seen in a trading card game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56qVx?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">data from our friends at TCGplayer</a>, here are the 10 most valuable Disney Lorcana cards to come out of the new Winterspell expansion.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">10 - Tod - Knows All the Tricks (Enchanted)</h3><div id="235529"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235529" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tod - Knows All the Tricks (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another absolutely adorable card that I can't get enough of from Winterspell, is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLp3k0?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tod - Knows All the Tricks</a>. The Enchanted variant is looking fairly valuable as well, currently sitting at around $190 market price, while its <a href="https://zdcs.link/QW6qMl?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary is fetching around $6-$8 right now as well</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His ability to ready up again twice per turn when chosen for an action or an item's ability seems fairly good to me as well, with a high ceiling for shenanigans, from my initial impressions at least. I'm certainly going to be chasing after Tod, and I suspect plenty of fans will be as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">9 - The Cold Never Bothered Me (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235519"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235519" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Cold Never Bothered Me (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course we're getting some delightful Frozen themed cards in the Winterspell set, it would be crime not to. And, 'The Cold Never Bothered Me' (anyway?) is one for collectors to absolutely keep a sharp eye out for, especially its delightful Enchanted version. Market price highs are reaching around $171.49 right now, and I've got a funny feeling this valuation will continue to rise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It features some incredible card art of Elsa, funnily enough from an artist also named Elsa (Elsa Chang, to be exact). It reads: "Look at the top 4 cards of your deck. You may reveal a location card and put it into your hand. Put the rest into your discard. You pay 3 Ink less for the next location you play this turn."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">8 - Raging Storm (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235530"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235530" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Raging Storm (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Enchanted card demanding a high price is Raging Storm, featuring Nani, Lilo, and Stitch with some wonderful card art from Jane Pica.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's demanding a fairly high price right now at <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yPj7O?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$126.26 at TCGplayer</a>, but if you really want this card, you can also just pick up its <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoJxlL?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Super Rare variant for around $4</a> instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, it's another Winterspell card that Collectors are bound to be all over, and chasing as for it as hard as they can. Keep an eye on this one, as I think it's got a whole lot of value potential even further into the future as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">7 - Eeyore - In the Way (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235525"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235525" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Eeyore - In the Way (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This might be one of my favorite ever cards to come out of Disney Lorcana. This full card art of Eeyore - In the Way, by Gabby Zapata, is absolutely stunning, and worth the high price of the card alone. If I get lucky and manage to pull this sweetheart, then even better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Running for around $130 at market on TCGplayer right now, this is still a hot card to come by, even if it just misses out on a top ten ranking by value. And while it doesn't reach the eye watering values of the rest of the cards coming up on this list, at $130+, it's still a unbelievably good pull if you manage to score it. It's a card I'm absolutely on the look out for right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">6 - Belle - Snowfield Strategist (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235566"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235566" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Belle - Snowfield Strategist (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring some wonderful art from Jane Pica, this enchanted variant of Beauty and the Beast's "Belle - Snowfield Strategist" has got all the makings of an increasingly valuable card, in the short and long term. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It reads: "[Winter Stockpile] Whenever one of your characters is banished, you may put that card from your discard into your inkwell facedown and exerted."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting at around $145.48 on TCGplayer right now, I can only seeing it going up in value over the next few months. Let's wait and see.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"> 5 - Angel - Experiment 624 (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235565"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235565" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Angel - Experiment 624 (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Angel - Experiment 624 is just an incredible well rounded card, and a great addition to the Winterspell expansion, so I'm not surprised that it's fetching a tidy price at launch. The Legendary card is sitting at around $24.76 right now on TCGplayer, while the stunning Enchanted variant is at $177.84, and there's no surprise why. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Community sentiment around Angel, who features heavily on Winterspell key art across its marketing and sealed product selection, has been incredibly positive so far. Prices could come down a little bit as we get further away from launch, but I've got a funny feeling it's going to hold out for a while longer. If you manage to find this one, I'd avoid selling and hold on, at least that's what I'll be doing.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">4 - Ohana Means Family (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235528"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235528" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ohana Means Family (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring both Lilo and Stitch, this Enchanted action card is already hovering just shy of the $200 market mark, and it boasts some genuinely charming artwork from Kei Yotsuba. Its Legendary card version has decent value right now as well, sitting at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN3xky?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$27.19 at TCGplayer's market price</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mechanically, it is more or less a rework of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l8nqr?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rapunzel - Gifted with Healing from The First Chapter</a>, carrying almost the exact same effect, but as an action card, and being potentially slightly less flexible in real play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather than capping the effect, like Rapunzel did at three damage, Ohana Means Family instead removes all damage from one of your characters and lets you draw a card for each point healed in the process. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">3 - Anna - Soothing Sister (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235517"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235517" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anna - Soothing Sister (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Frozen-themed card from Winterspell, this time focusing on Anna. Soothing Sister's Enchanted card art is another beautiful example from the new set. It's currently worth just over $200 at TCGplayer, and it's easy to see why. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can see this as another card from the latest set that will continue to rise in value over the next few weeks. If you manage to pull it, hold on for a bit longer. And if you fancy a solid investment, well look no further.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2 - Pocahontas - Peacekeeper (Iconic)</h3></div><div id="235526"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235526" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pocahontas - Peacekeeper (Iconic)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of two Iconics from the Winterspell expansion, and I can already see why this is going to be a huge chase card for both players and collectors. Sitting at just over $400, I'm hardly surprised that Pocahontas - Peacekeeper is demanding such a high price already. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, there's a whole lot of potential in the card itself, even if you want to just opt for the equally as beautiful, if a little less expensive, <a href="https://zdcs.link/ae8PWw?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary variant (which is valued at just under $6 right now)</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Easily paired with <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3OvWM?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pocahontas - Following the Wind</a>, also featured in Winterspell, this puts you on a one way train to locking down the board for a full turn and completely shutting off your opponent's ability to challenge. That is not a small effect, and just the tiniest bit mad, all things considered. I love it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">1 - Moana - Curious Explorer (Iconic)</h3></div><div id="235527"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235527" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Moana - Curious Explorer (Iconic)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The demand on this card is honestly mind-boggling. But, I can also get behind it. The card art by Leslie Strock is to die for, and it's probably one of my favorite designs I've ever seen in a trading card game, let alone Lorcana itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, <em>the price</em> is eye-wateringly high. There's something to be said about never having to ink a card from your hand again, which is why the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yPj1P?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary variant</a> we mentioned earlier is also spiking at decent value since launch (sitting at around $26), but the Iconic rare is just on another planet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like, come on, $550 - that's nuts? That's playing ball with some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-top-10-most-valuable-cards-from-last-year-2025">rarest Pokémon</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-most-valuable-cards-2025-updated">Magic: The Gathering cards</a>. Let's go, Lorcana, I guess, making its very own economy with every release is as impressive as it sounds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm skeptical that it can maintain such a high demand going forward, but since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-fabled-most-expensive-cards">Fabled introduced Iconic</a> rarity, it has certainly introduced the perfect height of card chasing for what is a TCG somewhat still in its infancy. Best to just see where things go next, cross your fingers, and then throw an enormous party if you manage to pull such a rare card when ripping packs. </p></div><p id="where-to-buy-winterspell"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to Buy - Winterspell">Where to Buy - Disney Lorcana: Winterspell</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some quick honorable mentions before I finished up, as it's also worth keeping an eye on several other Winterspell cards that look like they have plenty of potential. That includes <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7RbLE?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lilo - Rock Star</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QG8VvV?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Darkwing Duck - Cool Under Pressure</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wBGrR?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mulan - Resourceful Recruit</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to find any of these cards, rather than buying them outright as singles, then you'll want to pick up some Winterspell boosters ASAP. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-tcg-winterspell-where-to-buy">Winterspell is now available to buy</a> at most major retailers, but I'd recommend at least picking up the Booster Display Pack for $144 at Amazon to really get you started with the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The booster display comes with 24 packs, with each booster packs setting you up with 12 cards, including six Common cards, three Uncommon cards, two cards of either Rare, Super Rare, or Legendary rarity, and one random foil card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a little bit of everything, I'd recommend checking out the Illumineer's Trove for $50, which comes with a card storage box, six card dividers, eight booster packs, six damage-counter dice, and a lore counter. Perfect for any newcomers to Lorcana, or as a tidy gift for any Disney fans in your life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is IGN's Senior Commerce Editor and resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

Previous reporting has suggested that the next entry will offer a more radical upgrade to the series' usual formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Assassin's Creed, Guillemot noted the company had "several titles" in development, comprised of both single-player and multiplayer experiences. Back in 2022, Ubisoft announced a raft of upcoming games including the now-launched Assassin's Creed Shadows, the witchcraft-inspired <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-hexe">Assassin's Creed: Hexe</a> (another single-player blockbuster) and Invictus (a multiplayer game).

Guillemot was also asked for a response to calls for him to resign — something he did not directly address. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ubisoft is going through a major phase of transformation, affecting our organization, operations, and culture. Changes of this scale naturally raise questions and create tension, particularly when they impact people's routines, and I recognize that.

Delivering at the level of quality and ambition our players expect requires strong alignment, speed of execution, and close collaboration.

			<p><strong>Ubisoft </strong>chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong> has finally spoken outside of the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-third-quarter-growth-thanks-to-assassins-creed-overperformance/">financial earnings reports</a> after kicking off 2026 by confirming a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>"<em>major reset</em></strong>"</a> that involved huge structural changes to Ubisoft and saw hundreds of developers get laid off, either <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">through cuts</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/">different branches</a> or just <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">full studio shutdowns</a>. </p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">Variety</a>, Guillemot didn't offer any meaningful comments in response to questions about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/1200-ubisoft-employees-kick-off-three-day-international-strike/">strikes across different studios within the company</a> or provide any further comment as to why projects like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong> were cancelled that we hadn't heard before. But he did at least provide an update as to what's happening with a couple of the company's major franchises.</p>



<p>In terms of the <strong>Far Cry</strong> series, Guillemot confirmed that <strong>two new games</strong> are in development, one of which we can likely assume to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-far-cry/">Far Cry 7</a>,</strong> while the other is likely to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-7-far-cry-multiplayer-2025-alaska/">Project Maverick</a></strong>, the multiplayer Far Cry game we first heard about more than three years ago.</p>



<p>The other series Guillemot provided a bit of an update on is, unsurprisingly, <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong>. Guillemot confirmed there are "<em>several</em>" Assassin's Creed titles in the works, <a href="https://wccftech.com/9-assassins-creed-games-are-reportedly-in-development/">which isn't exactly news</a>, but he did add that the projects include both <strong>single-player</strong> and <strong>multiplayer</strong> games. </p>



<p>"<em>We have a solid pipeline underway across <strong>Vantage Studios</strong>. Under the 'Assassin's Creed' brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year</em>," Guillemot said. "<em>On 'Far Cry,' anticipation is high, and we currently have <strong>two very promising projects in development</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, in relation to what both franchises are doing outside of video games, Guillemot gave a shout-out to the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-tv-series-fx-now-official-produced-fargo-creator-noah-hawley/">Far Cry TV series coming from <strong>FX</strong></a> and confirmed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-dogs-film-is-in-development-and-already-has-its-protagonist/"><strong>Watch Dogs</strong> film has completed production.</a> He also shared his excitement about the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-netflix-adaptation-finds-director-johan-renck/">Assassin's Creed <strong>Netflix </strong>TV series</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-premiere-netflix-ubisoft/"><strong>Splinter Cell Deathwatch</strong> series getting renewed</a> for a second season.  </p>



<p>Overall, if you were hoping for a candid explanation as to what has happened with the company over the last few years, and what Guillemot and the rest of its top brass are doing to turn things around for the better, to say you'll be left wanting is an understatement.</p>



<p>Especially when it comes to Guillemot's response to questions about nepotism with regard to installing his son, <strong>Charlie Guillemot</strong>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/">one of the two co-leaders of Vantage Studios.</a></p>



<p>"<em>Ubisoft was created as a family company, and our strong heritage helps us take a long-term view, prioritizing sustainable growth, creative ambition, and continuity over short-term cycles. This perspective guides our decisions and helps us build franchises, teams, and strategies that endure for decades</em>," Guillemot said.</p>



<p>"<em>I <strong>strongly believe </strong>that Christophe Derennes and Charlie are the right leaders as co-CEOs of Vantage Studios. They bring complementary strengths and experience that make them well-suited for the role. Their appointment was based on their skills, track record, and fit for the role</em>."</p>



<p>As a reminder, Derennes steps into the role after previously leading Ubisoft's North American studios under the company's old structure. Charlie Guillemot's track record, however, includes being given a studio head position at Ubisoft right out of college, with the sole game that studio put out getting cancelled after one year and a major controversy. It also includes leaving Ubisoft to start an NFT-focused company, and one other role within Ubisoft before being given the keys to its biggest franchises.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/supreme-court-strikes-down-trump-tariffs-that-hiked-prices-on-switch-xbox-and-ps5-2000671987</link>
            <guid>1441822</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Friday, the Supreme Court of the United States of America ruled against the majority of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, including those enacted using a decades-old law reserved for a national emergency. These 2025 tariffs led to a last-minute Switch 2 pre-order delay as well as increased video game console and accessory prices. It’s a major setback for the president, and it could help alleviate rising gaming costs, but it also might all be for nothing as Trump will likely move to reactivate the tariffs using different legal methods.</p> <p>In 2025, President Trump used the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/">1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA</a>) to enact tariffs against a large list of countries. No previous president had ever used the law to impose tariffs against other nations. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-strikes-trumps-tariffs-major-blow-president-rcna244827">The court was split 6-3 in its decision</a> to rule that Trump’s unprecedented use of the IEEPA was illegal, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing the majority opinion.</p>

 <p>“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration and scope,” wrote Roberts. But the Chief wrote that Congress has never said the language in the IEEPA applied to tariffs, adding: “We hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.” Roberts was joined by the three liberal justices as well as two conservatives, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. It should be noted that not all of Trump’s tariffs are now gone, as not all of them were enacted using the IEEPA, but many of his so-called reciprocal taxes have now been ruled illegal.</p> <p>Last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/president-trump-tariffs-switch-2-pre-orders-delay-us-1851774828">Trump’s reciprocal tariffs</a> and his <a href="https://kotaku.com/tariffs-trump-games-digital-consoles-price-increase-ps5-1851767919?">trade war against countries like China and Canada</a> directly led to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-price-tariff-trump-nintendo-1851774764">Nintendo delaying pre-orders for the Switch 2 in April.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start on April 9, 2025, in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged,” said the company.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471">In August</a>, the company quietly raised the prices on many Switch accessories and on various models of the original console. Other companies like Sony and Microsoft followed suit with <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">similar price increases on hardware and accessories</a> as a result of tariffs against countries that produce many of the parts needed to manufacture gaming hardware.</p> <p>In a better, less horrible timeline, most of Trump’s trade war tariffs being deemed illegal would lead to video game hardware prices going down. But we don’t live in that timeline. President Trump has many different legal avenues for reinstating many of the now-illegal tariffs, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianplatt.bsky.social/post/3mfcfvbtvds2m">as helpfully pointed out by <em>Bloomberg</em> in this chart.</a></p>

 <p>Even if all of these legal backup plans fail and he’s unable to get all or most of his precious tariffs made legal again, console and gaming PC prices are likely to keep going up and up and up due to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/ram">ongoing memory shortage</a> caused by AI hyperscalers racing to build massive datacenters. But at least you can take comfort in knowing that Trump is having a bad day today. That’s something, right?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-remake-bluepoint-demons-souls-ps5-sony-playstation-2000671988</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, the news broke that Bluepoint Games, the first-party PlayStation studio responsible for celebrated remakes of </span><i><span>Shadow of the Colossus</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Demon’s Souls</span></i><span>, has been shut down. According to a Sony spokesperson, the decision to shutter the developer was made “following a recent business review.” It’s terrible news however you look at it, but it’s perhaps especially painful for </span><i><span>Bloodborne </span></i><span>fans, as Bluepoint Games were the fan-favorite front-runners to helm a potential remake of FromSoftware’s 2015 PlayStation 4 game.</span></p> <p><span>The bad news doesn’t stop there, however, as Maxime Foulquier, a solo developer from France, followed up the announcement of Bluepoint Games’ closure with an unfortunately timed announcement of his own. As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Sony-shut-down-Bloodborne-remake-fan-project-before-scrutinized-Bluepoint-Games-closure.1230824.0.html"><i><span>Notebook Check</span></i></a><span>, Sony served Foulquier with a </span><a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/2024582839295950868"><span>cease and desist letter</span></a><span> in March 2025, due to his announcement on X some months prior that he was working on a game called </span><i><span>Bloodborne Top Down Arena.</span></i><span> Several clips of the game, which was actually Foulquier’s second </span><i><span>Bloodborne </span></i><span>remake project, can still be found in separate posts on his X profile, but the video featured in </span><a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1629098568928600066"><span>the original announcement post</span></a><span> has since been removed “in response to a report by the copyright owner.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Although the letter is almost a year old at this point, Foulquier noted that he’s only revealing this information now due to his “immense” disappointment with Sony following their decision to shut down Bluepoint Games. “I’d rather speak about it now, as my disappointment is immense. The disappearance of Bluepoint is a tremendous loss for the industry and for the dream of a </span><i><span>Bloodborne </span></i><span>remake. Why are you making such absurd decisions, Sony?”</span></p> <p><span>Not all is lost, thankfully, as Foulquier noted that he started to “repurpose all the assets” from </span><i><span>Bloodborne Top Down Arena</span></i><span> into a currently untitled, legally distinct project of his own. He also </span><a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/2024850777861136694?s=20"><span>shared a snippet</span></a><span> of the newly repurposed project in a follow-up post, referring to it as “a tribute to </span><i><span>Bloodborne</span></i><span>, set in a medical gothic world inspired by Paris.”</span></p>

<p>If you’re mulling over where to pre-order <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a> and want to know what bonuses are available, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-pokemon-pokopia">How Much is Pokémon Pokopia?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Bonuses. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia is priced at $69.99, with the price the same for both the digital and the physical version. </strong></p>



<p>However, the physical version of Pokopia does not include much physical content, and instead provides a virtual Game Card. Rather than a download code, which cannot be re-used, the Key Card can be resold or shared with friends or family.</p>

</ul>



<p>There are no special editions of Pokopia offering extra incentives or paid-for pre-order bonuses. However, it remains to be seen whether Pokopia will have paid-for DLC releasing in the future.</p>



<p>Both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a-2/" id="3627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> and Scarlet &amp; Violet had post-launch DLC, which is becoming more commonplace for the Pokémon franchise, so there is every chance Pokopia follows suit.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-pokopia-pre-order-bonuses">All Pokémon Pokopia Pre-Order Bonuses</h2>



<p><strong>There are several pre-order bonuses available for Pokopia, which vary based on where you purchase the game from.</strong></p>



<p>Bonuses range from physical rewards, like a Ditto Sitting Cuties plush or a wooden tray, to in-game rewards, including a Ditto rug and Flat Leaf Plant Decoration. In-game rewards are not exclusive and can be earned through gameplay progression.</p>

            <p>We are just a matter of days away from the release of Resident Evil Requiem, but already leaks are running rampant, causing Capcom to ask its community to 'please, cut it out!'.</p>
<p>As our Connor reported yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-out-resident-evil-requiems-ending-is-being-spoiled-online-as-capcom-fights-to-clean-up-leaks">physical copies of Resident Evil Requiem were obtained ahead of schedule by some members of the public earlier this week</a>. And thanks to this, gameplay and story leaks started making the rounds on the likes of reddit. Sigh.</p>

<p>Capcom did its best to curtail the problem by removing unauthorised videos and whatnot, but it did feel a bit like that man sticking a bit of sellotape over a massive leaking vat of liquid. So, now, the studio is appealing to any potential leaker's better nature, with a firm but fair 'stop it'.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2024835538251923590/photo/1">social media post</a> shared this afternoon, Capcom wrote: "Please don't post or share pre-release leaks and spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem. We really want everyone to enjoy the game's story and experience as much as possible."</p>
<p>It added its legal department "will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices for leaks in order to preserve your day-one experience". It then said very reasonably that we don't exactly have much longer to wait until we can all experience what horrors are in store first hand.</p>
<p>"We look forward to seeing all your reactions after release!" Capcom closed.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to launch across PS5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in one week's time, on 27th February.</p>
<p>Our Alex is one of the many here at Eurogamer very keen to play the latest series entry, but unlike the rest of us, he has been able to go hands-on with it already  (what, no I am not jealous <em>at all</em>…). "I left it far more excited for RE9 than I went in," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">Eurogamer's Resident Evil Requiem preview earlier this year</a>.</p><p>"I think that mad lot might just do it again. And certainly, with its varying modes of play and dizzying pendulum tempo, it feels like a fitting tribute to thirty years of Resident Evil's brand of survival horror. I am properly desperate to get my hands on the final thing."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Arkheron Preview – The glorious battle royale lovechild of Diablo and Hades]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/20/arkheron-preview-the-glorious-battle-royale-lovechild-of-diablo-and-hades/</link>
            <guid>1441798</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Arkheron is doing something we all love in gaming, putting a fresh twist on something familiar. Coming from Bonfire Studios, a team founded by ex-Blizzard Creative Officer Rob Pardo, and whose influence runs through World of Warcraft, Diablo III and Overwatch, Arkheron is a PvP multiplayer dungeon crawler, with teams of three attempting to make it to the top of the tower, slicing their way through enemies and opposing teams, as the playable space shrinks. A team-based, dungeon-crawling battle royale? It’s a brilliant mix.</p>
<p><iframe title="Arkheron Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aouQE7ZzcDE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Arkheron centres around the relics. Each player has four empty slots: two weapons, a Crown and an Amulet, and you fill these by looting treasure chests as you climb the tower. Each relic has its own unique powers, or individual weapon types, and while there are common-level versions, what you’re really looking for are Relics that belong to an Eternal.</p>


<p>There are eight Eternals in the game right now, each with four unique Relics and corresponding abilities. If you collect all four from the same Eternal, you can transform into them, gaining a fifth, ultra-powerful special move as well, giving you a distinct advantage, and, as an added bonus, making you look incredibly cool too.</p>
<p>What it does mean, however, is that you’re stuck as that Eternal for the rest of the match, and that might not be the best choice. There are literally thousands of possible combinations for the gear here, and that includes further bonuses for carrying a split pair of same-type equipment. It’s a dizzying level of customisation, and I can see players really digging into the swirling range of possibilities when Arkheron launches.</p>


<p>You have to get to the top of the Tower first. Every team is dropped into the bottom floor with an expanding field of view letting you see other team drops and enemies, giving you a decent picture of where you want to join the battle. Our team – led by the exceptionally cool Bonfire Studios team member, Raph, – was consistently patient, waiting to see how the map was panning out before making the leap, and that seemed to work well in terms of giving us time to start building up an armoury.</p>
<p>Each floor of the tower is filled with CPU-controlled enemies for you to work your way through, clearing areas so that you’re free to ransack the heady assortment of treasure chests. There’s different levels of chest, so you’ll find plenty of mundane, run-of-the-mill weapons, amulets and crowns, in the lowest level, while the Eternal gear tends to be tucked away in the rare ones that you’ve really had to work for.</p>
<p>As you’re decimating the various enemies on each floor, you’re earning currency to use in the shop. These contain consumables and a selection of gear, too, but they’re also focal points for all of the other teams, and you can suddenly find yourself embroiled in a melee, just because you wanted to pick up some health. We found that a hasty retreat wasn’t so much cowardly as efficient, and we repeatedly lived to fight through another few floors after spying an enemy team and legging it in the other direction.</p>

<p>You can hear enemy footsteps ringing out through the gothic halls, so there’s a nice and clear audible indicator of which way you want to go, much like in other Battle Royales. Running and hiding remains my favourite tactic in PUBG, and I can do that here too, so I was well at home.</p>
<p>I loved the hack-and-slash combat here, though. A mix of Diablo and Hades-esque weaponry and movesets, makes this feel like a multiplayer version of those incredible games, and that is as enjoyable as it sounds. The weight and variety of different weapons and abilities has been tuned really well, and while things definitely become chaotic when you’re facing off against an enemy team, it never felt unwieldy. There’s a few quirks to playing with a controller – there’s not quite the expected level of control, with the controller replicating the way you move with a mouse and keyboard – but I still found myself having a whale of a time.</p>
<p>The battle royale element really comes into play when it starts funnelling the fifteen teams together. At points you have to retreat to the safety of a nearby Beacon, the only thing that will protect you from the Abyssal Storm. Lower floors have plenty of Beacons, but as you climb higher, there are fewer and fewer, leading to an inevitable brawl at the top with a final remaining team.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of customisation too, though thanks to the isometric view during each round, the best view you’ll have of your character, and your teammates, is on the prep screen before you head to the tower. Still, the art direction is really strong throughout, and the Eternals in particular are particularly characterful.</p>
<p>Our hands-on time gave a tantalising glimpse of Arkheron’s possibilities. If you’ve got a steady team of friends to party up with, enjoy the action of games like Hades and Diablo, and love the competition and gameplay loop of a battle royale, you should definitely keep an eye on Bonfire Studios’ first game.</p>

            <p>
Nightsoil is a sombre little top-down narrative adventure about a gong farmer – that is, a collector of human waste – in 1854 London, at the height of the cholera epidemic. Gong farmers were, I understand, required to work after sunset, to avoid causing revulsion among the decent folk. In this case, you’re a gong farmer at the end his tenure, working his final shift alongside his trusty carthorse Ol’ Boy, while reminiscing about his bygone youth and the happier days that might have been.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
This would seem to be an original and moving testament to a despised profession at a very grim time. Except that it’s from the developers of the self-explanatory Top Steed and the “cozy puzzler” Back to Stables, which features a horse called “mischievous George” who looks like he never took a shit in his life. Say what you like about Miniscule Mayhem, but they’re committed to <a href="https://minusculemayhem.com/">the full palette of equine emotions</a>. They’re also fond of turd emojis on social media. Remember when Ben Stiller decided he could do heavyweight drama? Similar vibes.
</p>
<p>
I like that Nightsoil exists, and genuinely admire Miniscule Mayhem for embracing subject matter that is probably as uncommercial as you can get without inflicting stigmata on the player, but after half an hour with it, this game does often feel like a parody of games that propose to undertake Serious Themes. It has hand-drawn flashback sequences featuring lines like “He knew, at that moment, that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.” It also has a Horse Comfort gauge, decreased by the sight of rat swarms. 
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to do gauges in games of this demeanour without looking silly, and while I’ve yet to complete Nightsoil (see below), I’m not convinced it sticks the landing. You’ll need to manage the Comfort gauge as you explore a small urban layout, shovelling shit into barrels by hitting E when you’re told to, unless you’re too nauseated or need to empty your can. You’ll also need to feed Ol’ Boy hay from a sack to keep him calm while you’re off gong farming, and periodically draw water from a well to quench his Thirst.
</p><p>
The horse-and-cart mechanics themselves are a bit simulation-y. To get Ol’ Boy trotting, you tap A and D rhythmically; to back up, you hold both keys at once. Ol’ Boy’s turning circle ain’t great, so it’s hard to gallop around corners without snagging a doorstep and wasting precious seconds putting Ol' Boy into reverse. This is unfortunate, because Ol’ Boy really loves dying of thirst. Ol’ Boy holds water like a sieve made of cobwebs on the surface of Mercury. At such times, one thinks wistfully of Mischievous George, who always appears fully hydrated and also gets to open treasure chests, and wear hats.
</p>
<p>
Serious Games definitely need to be wary of quick-time events, whatever David Cage might tell you. QTEs are innately daft. Nightsoil did not get this memo, though again, I wonder if they're being satirical here. If Ol’ Boy becomes too Discomforted, he’ll refuse to move, and you’ll need to hop off the cart and make soothing noises. If he’s super-stressed out, possibly because you keep galloping him into rat swarms, you must complete a potentially lethal waveform QTE in which you pat his nose or murmur reassurances on cue.
</p>
<p>
My playthrough ended with one of these QTEs. Alas, my fumbling ministrations only further rattled the noble creature (the controls are a bit janky, in my defence). After a few rounds of button-bashing, his poor heart gave out. “’Ol Boy, no!” wailed the gong farmer in despair, as the screen faded to black. I couldn’t stop laughing. Was this the aim, Miniscule Mayhem?
</p>
<p>
Had I managed to play more of Nightsoil before writing this up, I might have discovered one of the following: a) Nightsoil is, in hindsight, a heartbreaking interactive work of period scholarship, whose initial awkwardness soon fades from the mind, b) Nightsoil is a camouflaged Mischievous George spin-off, guest directed by David Cage c) some secret third thing. If you fancy a go, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4341390/Nightsoil/">it’s on Steam right now</a>.
