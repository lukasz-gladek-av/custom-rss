As such, Blizzard is using a new survey to gauge fan reaction to a whole host of brands it could potentially bring to <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and there are some wild picks in the mix.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,197589" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A lot of these properties aren’t that surprising. Blizzard has collaborated with anime, video games, and even K-pop groups, ranging from fairly modern to “nostalgia bait for people of a different demographic than me,” so nothing’s really off the table. However, I do look at some of these hypotheticals and wonder, “Do we need this?” Crucially, just because a brand shows up on a survey doesn’t mean that Blizzard is actively considering an <em>Overwatch 2</em> crossover event. It’s all just vibes right now, and if we’re feeling those out, I’ve got some thoughts. While my preference is that <em>Overwatch </em>stop <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-skin-collaboration-crossover-1851779908&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-skin-collaboration-crossover-1851779908">becoming <em>Fortnite</em></a></span>, I don’t think that’s going to happen. So here’s my ranking of every hypothetical <em>Overwatch 2 </em>crossover Blizzard is proposing, ranked from “hell yeah” to “fuck no.”</p><h2 id="h330042"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Pokémon</strong></em></h2><p>What can I say? I’m a mark. If Soldier: 76 acknowledges that Pikachu exists in some way, I’ll clap like an absolute clown.</p><h2 id="h330043"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Batman</strong></em></h2><p>The survey says <em>Batman</em>, but I’m choosing to believe this hypothetical crossover would include all the DC heroes, so Echo can be a Green Lantern, and her transforming ultimate could be her using her ring. Reaper could be Batman since they’re both broody and wear black.</p><h2 id="h330044"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Evangelion</strong></em></h2><p>Unit-01 Ramattra. Enough said.</p><h2 id="h330045"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Baldur’s Gate</strong></em></h2><p>So many of the characters in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>map so well onto <em>Overwatch 2 </em>heroes that the collab writes itself. Junker Queen as Karlach? Widowmaker as Lae’zel? Lifeweaver as Astarion? Somebody call Larian.</p><h2 id="h330046"><a id=""></a><em><strong>One Piece</strong></em></h2><p>After 1000+ episodes, there’s quite a few <em>One Piece</em> characters to pull from, and fans have been making <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/54fsk4/one_piece_x_overwatch_crossover_post_from/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/54fsk4/one_piece_x_overwatch_crossover_post_from/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mock-ups of this for nearly a decade</a></span>.</p><h2 id="h330047"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Monsters Inc.</strong></em></h2><p>The only reason this extremely odd and not-timely choice is so high is because I need to see Winston in Sulley’s blue-and-purple fur.</p><h2 id="h330048"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Digimon</strong></em></h2><p>While the uninitiated probably look at this and think, “Wouldn’t this just be <em>Pokémon </em>again?” I’m here to say, “No, you absolute ninny.” <em>Digimon</em>’s character designs are so much more varied than those in Game Freak’s monster-catching series, and a lot of them even look human. Lifeweaver as Angemon and Mercy as Angewomon? Brigitte could be carrying Gallantmon’s shield? <em>Digimon </em>deserves such a spotlight.</p><h2 id="h330049"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Chrono Trigger</strong></em></h2><p>Square Enix’s classic fantasy RPG definitely caters best to characters like Reinhardt, Brigitte, and Genji who utilize fantasy-like weaponry, but also, Bastion as Robo would be sick.</p><h2 id="h330050"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Mortal Kombat</strong></em></h2><p>With the new movie coming out, I could see Blizzard trying to strike while the iron is hot with a <em>Mortal Kombat </em>collab. Doomfist as Jax is such an easy pull, but an inspired choice would be to make Roadhog Scorpion, as they both use chains to pull in their foes.</p><h2 id="h330051"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Alice in Wonderland</strong></em></h2><p>Blizzard has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/OWCavalry/status/1732308995036295405&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/OWCavalry/status/1732308995036295405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already shown concept art of this hypothetical</a></span>, so we’ll probably get an <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>-themed season somewhere down the line. Tracer as the white rabbit is such a good pick.</p><h2 id="h330052"><a id=""></a><em><strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong></em></h2><p>This is another franchise that feels most geared towards <em>Overwatch</em>’s knights, but Hanzo can also be Legolas, so at least there’s something there.</p><h2 id="h330053"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Adventure Time</strong></em></h2><p>I just want Junkrat in Jake the Dog onesie.</p><h2 id="h330054"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Akira</strong></em></h2><p>How many characters do you think will get the motorcycle slide highlight intro?</p><h2 id="h330055"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Dragon Ball</strong></em></h2><p>The <em>Street Fighter </em>collaboration got a lot of the martial arts vibes down, so a few of the more obvious picks are kind of taken if Blizzard doesn’t want to do a repeat. Genji as Trunks would work well, though.</p><h2 id="h330056"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Toy Story</strong></em></h2><p>Mercy as Bo Peep with her staff as her crook? I guess that could be okay.</p><h2 id="h330057"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em></h2><p><em>Star Wars </em>has a lot of iconography to pull from, but there was also a point where <em>Overwatch 2 </em>did a legally distinct event <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-starwatch-star-wars-event-mode-pve-story-1850421313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-starwatch-star-wars-event-mode-pve-story-1850421313">inspired by the films</a></span>, so I’m not too thrilled about a double dip.</p><h2 id="h330058"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Godzilla</strong></em></h2><p>I’m having trouble envisioning this one, considering there’s not much in <em>Overwatch </em>that cleanly mirrors the classic kaiju characters. But I guess I’m at least somewhat curious what Blizzard might decide to do.</p><h2 id="h330059"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Fallout</strong></em></h2><p>Just say you want to give Cassidy a skin based on The Ghoul and move on.</p><h2 id="h330060"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Hollow Knight</strong></em></h2><p>Another blade-wielding hero for Genji to cosplay.</p><h2 id="h330061"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Masters of the Universe</strong></em></h2><p>The monkey’s paw curls as Soldier: 76 gets a skimpy outfit but has…that haircut.</p><h2 id="h330062"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Shrek</strong></em></h2><p>…Starting to feel like we’re just throwing spaghetti at a wall here, Blizzard.</p><h2 id="h330063"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Tamagotchi</strong></em></h2><p>Maybe we could have one of the devices as a weapon charm, I guess?</p><h2 id="h330064"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Resident Evil</strong></em></h2><p>We don’t need any more cop skins, thank you.</p><h2 id="h330065"><a id=""></a><em><strong>How to Train Your Dragon</strong></em></h2><p>Reinhardt and Brigitte are eating in this survey.</p><h2 id="h330066"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Zenless Zone Zero</strong></em></h2><p>Kiriko bait.</p><h2 id="h330067"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</strong></em></h2><p>This could be interesting if you draw from a lot of the villains, but I’m having trouble imagining what you would do with the turtles themselves.</p><h2 id="h330068"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Warhammer</strong></em></h2><p>Give me miniatures as weapon charms.</p><h2 id="h330069"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Power Rangers</strong></em></h2><p>Same as <em>Star Wars,</em> we already had a season themed around legally distinct <em>Power Rangers</em>. We’re good.</p><h2 id="h330070"><a id=""></a><strong>Twice</strong></h2><p>We’ve already had two events based on a K-pop group, but I’d be more interested in a different group being the theme.</p><h2 id="h330071"><a id=""></a><strong>Le Sserafim</strong></h2><p>Le Sserafim has collaborated with <em>Overwatch 2 </em>twice already, but if the boys actually get skins and dance emotes this time around, I’m listening.</p><h2 id="h330072"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Candy Crush</strong></em></h2><p>Damn, that sure was crazy when Activision had the <em>Candy Crush </em>developers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/candy-crush-ai-king-microsoft-layoffs-xbox-farm-saga-1851786283&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/candy-crush-ai-king-microsoft-layoffs-xbox-farm-saga-1851786283">train their AI replacements</a></span> before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">laying them off</a></span>.</p><h2 id="h330073"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Cowboy Bebop</strong></em></h2><p>Again, we already did this.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clues-by-sam-is-my-favorite-daily-puzzle-game.1256562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I could never get into Wordle or any of its derivatives—I just hate guessing games. <a href="https://cluesbysam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clues By Sam</a>, which turns the once-a-day puzzle format into a logic puzzle, is more my speed.</p><p>Wordle is a game about knowing five-letter words. Unfortunately for me, as soon as someone prompts me to name a five-letter word, I forget every word in the English language. I could not be worse at Wordle if I tried, which is unfortunate because many of the group chats I’m in are sustained by posting Wordle scores—or scores of the many, many derivatives of Wordle. It turns out “guess something until you run out of guesses” is a pretty solid framework for a game, and my friends enjoy versions like <a href="https://oec.world/en/games/tradle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tradle</a>, where you guess the country based on their exports, or <a href="https://framed.wtf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Framed</a>, where you guess movies with just one frame.</p><p>The only game of this genre that has tickled my fancy even a little bit has been Clues By Sam, developed by <a href="https://adartis.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Finnish developer Ad Artis Oy</a>, who may or may not be named Sam. The game presents you with a five-by-five grid of characters with professions. The goal is to guess which characters are innocents and which are criminals. You’re given one clue to start, and each time you correctly guess whether a character is innocent or guilty you’re given another clue. A key feature of Clues By Sam is that the game doesn’t let you guess–if you mark someone criminal or innocent before the game’s designer thinks you’d be able to know that from what’s in front of you, a pop-up appears to stop you from entering your answer.</p><p>Weirdly, Clues By Sam reminds me of SAT prep questions, which are worded extremely specifically so that you can divine the correct answer even if you’re not especially well versed in the topic. And after you’re done, just like Wordle, you’re given a little emoji grid you can copy and paste to share with your friends.</p><p>I got Riley hooked on the game almost immediately after mentioning it at a meeting (Luke took one look at it and said he’d never touch it, based solely on the font it uses.). It’s a nice little thing to do as my last thing before falling asleep. It’s easy enough that I can complete it every day—it helps that you can ask for basically as many hints as you want, which will point you toward a relevant clue on the grid and then, if you ask again, which character you want to be focusing on—but also just tough enough to get my brain moving.</p><p>“I think it's a really interesting game, even though I find it a little hard to wrap my head around,” Riley told me. “Some of that is the ways it doesn't let you make notes (if I know one person is innocent and another is guilty, I can't indicate that on the game board somehow, like you would in an online sudoku or something) and the way that you sometimes have to keep a lot of clues in your head at once. I really like the way it prevents you from guessing, but I think sometimes that makes it feel like the thing you're solving is the creator's logic rather than the puzzle itself. It feels really constrained to me in a way that I think is ultimately good and necessary, but that as a newcomer to it I definitely find myself clashing with as I learn it.”</p><p>As Riley later said—it’s Clues <em>By</em> Sam, not Sam’s Generic Clues. Still, the personal nature of the game is what makes me like it. Wordle took off because it was so clearly one dude’s project; famously, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wardle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he developed it as a word game for his wife</a>. Clues By Sam has that same level of specificity. I wonder if Sam would be proud of how quickly I can solve his puzzles.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/peak-multiplayer-streamers"><h3>Peak Is A Playground For Slapstick Comedy</h3></a><p>Peak creates space for players to really fuck around, punctuated by a swift emphasis on finding out</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/new-york-times-video-games-ai-nyt"><h3>The New York Times Will Never Learn</h3></a><p>We kept getting fed the same bullshit, and it’s being laundered in the same kind of stories</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/spice-girls-anime-production-ig"><h3>I’m Mad We Didn’t Get A Spice Girls Anime</h3></a><p>Look I'm not saying it would have been good, but just look at how cool it looks!</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/clues-by-sam-wordle-daily-puzzle-game]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Renegade Game Studios has announced they are bringing back <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords</em>. The tabletop publisher is working alongside Avalon Hill to bring an <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords 40th Anniversary</em> board game via a crowdfunding campaign this Fall.</p>



<p>In an official post, Renegade Game Studios stated that both they and Avalon Hill will bring the <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords 40th Anniversary</em> board game to players around the world by a crowdfunding campaign on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo-greatly-expanding-tabletop-crowdfunding-platform" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamefound</a>. This new version of the classic board game, known as <em>Shogun</em> to its most ardent fans, will feature new artwork, updated components, and more modern production values.</p>

If one wishes to gain the title of shogun, they will need to strategically deploy, manage, and command all armies and mercenaries at their command.</p>

<p>The post does confirm that the <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords 40th Anniversary</em> board game Gamefound campaign will be packed with features and materials for dedicated fans and board game enthusiasts. This will include behind-the-scenes content, sneak peeks at the game's updated components, as well as giveaways.</p>

<p>This edition of the game will only be available via the Gamefound campaign. While a retail reprint isn't out of the question, if you want the most pristine version of this title, you will want to make time.</p>

When you have multiple campaigns, multiplayer modes, and regular updates to live-service games like <em>Warzone </em>to manage, sure, you could convince me that a one-stop shop where I can find the specific experiences I want at any given moment is the best course of action. That convenience evaporates, though, when you realize you’ll have to download hundreds of gigabytes in order to <em>do</em> that very thing. Thankfully, after trying to convince us that a 200-to-300-gigabyte install was necessary to get in a few rounds of <em>CoD</em> with friends, Activision is now letting us access older games without its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-launcher-sucks-bad-awful-review-1851684502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-launcher-sucks-bad-awful-review-1851684502">bloated mess of a launcher</a></span>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,197582,196909" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As announced today on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1949968296121344261&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1949968296121344261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <em>Call of Duty</em> Updates X account</a></span>, 2022’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-ii-infinity-ward-campaign-1849695247&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-ii-infinity-ward-campaign-1849695247">kinda boring <em>Modern Warfare II</em></a></span> and 2023’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005">very boring <em>Modern Warfare III</em></a></span> are getting spun off on their own so you can download them à la carte and avoid the D.

                <p dir="ltr">It might be called Grounded 2, but the new game is flying high so far on launch day. That's because the sequel has already topped the all-time peak of Steam concurrent players for the original. In fact, it didn't even take a full hour to break the record.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/klobrille/status/1950267658240401667" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, Xbox commentator Klobrille pointed out Grounded 2's strong start on Steam. The open-world survival game has over 49,500 concurrent players on Valve's platform at the time of publication, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2661300/charts/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. That easily clears the all-time peak of 32,012 concurrent players in 2021 for Grounded, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/962130/charts/#max" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. Keep in mind that Grounded 2 is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-8-more-games-soon-including-multiple-day-one-new-releases/2900-6766/#9">available on Game Pass Ultimate for Xbox Series X|S and PC Game Pass</a>--as well as available to buy for $30.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grounded-2-announced-launching-very-soon/1100-6532251/">Grounded 2 was announced</a> not even two months ago during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. The survival game basically mixes the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids movie with the Rust video game. Developer Obsidian is once again behind the sequel, though this time Eidos-Montreal is assisting with the title.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the biggest new features with Grounded 2 is buggies--basically vehicles to utilize. While buggies were considered for the original game, starting fresh with a sequel was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-grounded-2-was-the-only-way-obsidian-could-introduce-this-key-feature/1100-6532318/">the only way to actually introduce them</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grounded-2-guides-hub/1100-6533467/">Grounded 2 guides hub</a>.</p>

The pro-style <strong>DualSense Edge</strong> is worth considering, especially now since it’s currently down to $170 ($29.99 off) on the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fdualsense-edge-wireless-controller" rel="sponsored">PlayStation website</a> with the code <strong>EVO2025</strong> through August 4th. The same code can be used on a variety of PS5 accessories, including the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2Fpulse-elite-wireless-headset-ps5" rel="sponsored">Pulse Elite wireless headphones</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->170</span></p><div><p>Sony’s pro-style controller, the DualSense Edge, might suffer from shorter battery life than the standard DualSense model, but it features great software integration with the PlayStation 5 and plenty of customizable components.</p></div></div><p>While the DualSense Edge looks and feels similar to the DualSense controller, it offers a number of notable upgrades. For starters, its deep software integration with the PS5 allows you to create up to four profiles, each offering customization for button mapping, stick sensitivity, and assigning commands to the rear buttons. You can swap between these profiles on the fly without having to leave your game. Sony makes it just as easy to swap out stick modules, too, in case one ever stops working.</p><p>Additionally, the DualSense Edge features toggle switches that give you the option to shorten the pull distance of either trigger. This is great if you prefer a hair-trigger feel for shooters and other fast-paced competitive games. These features can, if you’ll excuse the pun, give you an edge when playing your favorite titles. However, the controller isn’t without its faults, some of which are easier to forgive considering this temporary price drop.</p><p>Despite its high price, the DualSense Edge has worse battery life compared to the standard DualSense controller. In his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">review</a>, <em>The Verge’s</em> Cameron Faulkner confirmed that its battery life lasts only about eight hours on a full charge. It’s a small consolation that Sony includes a lengthy USB charging cable, which also has a handy locking mechanism so it doesn’t accidentally come unplugged (very handy during tournaments when disconnecting is unacceptable). With games like <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, <em>Silent Hill f</em>, and <em>Ghost of Yōtei </em>all on the horizon, there will be no shortage of games to use this controller with this year. And, thanks to the $30 discount, it’s a good excuse to start getting used to the controller’s features.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/715427/sony-dualsense-edge-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Two of the biggest digital games stores have stopped selling thousands of titles following pressure from a coalition of anti-porn advocates and the world’s biggest payment processing companies. It’s happened before, will likely happen again, and is suppressing art, free expression, and marginalized creators.</p><p>Last week, the indie gaming storefront <a href="http://itch.io/">itch.io</a> <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">sent out a sudden notice</a> to the creators that use the site to sell their games, books, art, and other media; it had “deindexed” all content with the NSFW (not safe for work) tag, meaning works with that tag would no longer turn up in itch.io searches, effectively making it impossible to discover or purchase them. Last week, Steam did similarly, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-pulls-adult-only-games-from-steam-as-it-tightens-rules-to-appease-payment-partners">removing a swath of games from its platform</a> after implementing stricter policies related to adult content.</p><p>In its announcement, itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran explained that the reason for this drastic action was pressure applied to the company’s payment processors by Collective Shout — an Australian nonprofit organization that describes itself as “a grassroots campaigns movement against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls.”</p><p>“Due to a game titled <em>No Mercy, </em>which was temporarily available on itch.io before being banned back in April, the organization Collective Shout <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors">launched a campaign against Steam and itch.io</a>, directing concerns to our payment processors about the nature of certain content found on both platforms,” Corcoran said. Released in March before being delisted by both Steam and itch.io in April, <em>No Mercy</em> was described by Collective Shout as a “rape simulator.” Its developer, Zerat Games, denied this, describing it as a “3D choice-driven adult visual novel with a huge focus on blackmail and male domination.”</p><p>As a result of Collective Shout’s actions, in tandem with the payment processors, over 20,000 games, books, comics, and other creative works — confirmed via the Internet Archive — functionally ceased to exist on the site (though purchased content remains in users’ libraries so long as it doesn’t violate itch.io’s new guidelines), imperiling the creators who depend on sales from itch.io. In addition to NSFW content, notable projects that didn’t have the tag were caught up in the purge as well. One example is <em>Consume Me</em>, a game about disordered eating and the recent recipient of the <a href="https://igf.com/article/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-2025-igf-awards">Seumas McNally Grand Prize at the 2025 Independent Games Festival</a>, which was delisted.</p><p>There’s also concern that this deindexing event will have a disproportionate impact on queer creators, and in the immediate aftermath there has been confusion about the distinction between “NSFW” and “adult” content, with a lot of LGBTQ+ stories and games falling under the umbrella of the former. “My SFW sci-fi comic that’s no worse than a standard Marvel movie also got deindexed... but it had the LGBT tag,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yukiclarke.com/post/3luprt3bwxs2z">wrote Yuki Clarke, a comic artist</a>, on Bluesky.</p><div><p>Whenever a platform announces a blanket ban on adult content, LGBTQ+ creators are almost always disproportionately affected, harming queer artists <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-tumblrs-ban-on-adult-content-is-bad-for-lgbtq-youth-108215">and invariably queer people</a>. In 2021, eBay’s removal of its “Adult Only” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535109/ebay-sex-ban-adult-only-queer-collectors">section eliminated a popular storefront for LGBTQ+ erotica artists and collectors</a>. In 2022, Tumblr settled with the New York City Commission on Human Rights because its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode">2018 ban of “adult content”</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22949293/tumblr-nycchr-settlement-adult-content-ban-algorithmic-bias-lgbtq">had a discriminatory impact on queer creators</a>.</p></div><p>Several itch.io creators have said that their SFW content with the LGBT tag have been deindexed. Itch.io <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/itch.io/post/3luq6dqqmsc23">has responded to some of these claims on social media</a>, saying, “The deindexing was determined by how creators classified their pages: specifically if the page was tagged as NSFW and as having adult content.”</p><p>However, there have also been reports that content with the LGBT tag but not the NSFW or Adult tags <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/duckprintspress.com/post/3luplr44s5s2y">were still getting delisted</a>, creating confusion about just what kind of works itch.io was pulling from its store and why. <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to itch.io for clarification. On Bluesky, in response to a creator claiming their LGBT books were delisted despite not having any adult or NSFW tags, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/itch.io/post/3lv3aqhupjs2o">the itch.io account answered</a>, “We have a series of automated heuristics that can flag pages for review based on account behavior to help prevent abuse.” It further explained that the LGBT or queer tags wouldn’t affect that system.</p><p>Itch.io acknowledged that the blanket delisting of all its adult content wasn’t ideal and has created concern among its users. But the threat of losing its payment processors required emergency action. “The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure,” Corcoran wrote. Typically, payment processors take actions like this to ensure their products aren’t being used to purchase illegal content. In Steam’s case, it <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding?language=english#5">updated its guidelines</a> to include a rule that prohibits publishing material that “may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors.”</p><p>In an email, Casey Becker, spokesperson for Stripe, responded that it does not comment on users directly but, “generally speaking, we take action when we conclude that users violate our terms of service. We do not support adult content.” Payoneer, one of itch.io’s other payment processors, declined to comment. <em>The Verge </em>has also reached out to PayPal, the last of itch.io’s listed payment processors, for comment.</p><p>Payment processors have frequently been the reason behind content bans. Though Collective Shout was the inciting agent, it’s companies like Visa, Stripe, and others that are responsible for these kinds of acts of mass censorship. In 2014, PayPal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-02-paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry.html">threatened to remove all its services from Patreon</a> because the site hosted adult content creators. (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/patreon-supports-6073549">PayPal would reverse this decision two years later</a>, but Patreon still makes it difficult for sex workers and porn creators to do business on the website.) In 2021, OnlyFans, a website synonymous with porn, announced that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638310/onlyfans-ban-explicit-content-payment-processing-visa">would ban all sexually explicit content</a> to “comply with the requests of [the platform’s] banking partners and payout provider.” Six days later, OnlyFans <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22640988/onlyfans-no-ban-porn-sexually-explicit-content-creators">would reverse the decision</a>, citing assurances from its banking partners. Scratch a porn ban, and you’ll find a PayPal.</p><p>These processors have enormous power over their clients, and that influence can be used to achieve goals that have nothing to do with consumer choice or safety. Itch.io is forced to comply with their demands or risk being unable to function entirely. “To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance,” Corcoran wrote in itch.io’s announcement.</p><p>Itch.io says that it is in the process of reviewing and removing NSFW and adult-tagged content that violates its terms of service, while also updating those terms. “For NSFW pages, this will include a new step where creators must confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account,” the announcement read. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/715134/we-have-limited-ability-to-push-back">It has also updated its July 24th announcement</a> to include answers to commonly asked questions that had been circulating social media, debunking rumors surrounding whether itch.io was withholding payments and addressing why such drastic action had to be taken so disruptively. The company also says it’s working on finding new payment processors.</p><p>Players and itch.io users are fighting back, flooding Visa and Mastercard customer service lines with complaints. A <a href="https://airtable.com/appsH84vZqnSAFJA0/shrgzMscvSL2c0srr/tblvmP9p8NeZnldyB">database has been created</a> where <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/boneyhag.bsky.social/post/3lusmyas6i22i">creators can list their deindexed work</a> for people to browse and purchase on alternative sites. Some creators are also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ela-bambust.bsky.social/post/3luv4pkjs4s2i">removing their work from itch.io</a> and are threatening to leave it altogether, as itch.io’s updated NSFW policy makes bans permanent and irreversible while explicitly threatening subversive art.</p><p>“Our policy is not an invitation to push the boundaries of what is acceptable. Violations that result in administrative action are permanent with no chance of appeal,” <a href="https://itch.io/docs/creators/faq#is-adult-content-allowed">the creator FAQ reads</a>. “Any funds on the account will not be eligible for payout. There is no second chance.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/715299/itchio-games-delisting-payment-processor-paypal]]></content:encoded>

Activision has announced that the stadium is opening up to become a new playable space.</p><p>Activision is also debuting a new mode, Stadium Resurgence. A 36-player mode, Stadium Resurgence is described as a "rapid action mode" where the skirmishes come fast on a smaller section of the overall map focused on the stadium itself.

For this contract, players must breach the stadium in the "most impressively explosive way possible." Activision's blog post about this contract contains redacted sections that suggests the contract has some narrative ramifications that Activision does not want people to know about ahead of time.

<p>After announcing an artbook earlier this year, Lost In Cult has lifted the lid on two lovely little physicals on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/toadsanime.lostincult.co.uk/post/3lv4lutgv3f2y">social media</a> — one standard edition, and one exclusive edition designed by <strong>UFO 50</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spelunky">Spelunky</a> creator Derek Yu. Both versions cost <strong>£29.99</strong> and will be shipping in Q4 2025.</p>
<p>The physical version will come with all recent patches on the cartridge, including the brand new Switch 2 compatibility update.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4aGvRTLyifg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aGvRTLyifg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4aGvRTLyifg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aGvRTLyifg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f17ajoywsr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aGvRTLyifg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>We love the art for <em>both</em> versions, to be honest — the clay animal statues on the general release are adorable and creepy, while Derek Yu's artwork is charming and manages to capture the limited neon colourscape of the game.</p>
<p>This is the second physical release for Shared Memory's acclaimed game following <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/animal-well?srsltid=AfmBOop1jpU2PyPb2WWhCsw4kkSVya_J3Ij0rW6udD1NkJFrbsyRXAL6">Limited Run Games' release last year</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grounded-2-is-out-now-in-early-access-on-steam-and-xbox-game-preview-on-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc.1256496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Grounded 2 was officially announced and revealed last month as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Xbox's Summer Game Fest 2025</a> showcase, and a little more than a month later as of the time of this writing, it is out on Xbox Series X/S consoles as a Game Preview title and on PC on Steam as an Early Access game. It's also, of course, available through Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>Obsidian Entertainment's sequel to its 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'-esque survival game changes a great deal from the first game, including some significant changes to inventory management simply by removing the need for players to carry multiple key tools like a shovel, axe, and hammer in their backpack at all times, since all three have been replaced by the multi-facted omni-tool.</p>



<p>Inventory management has also improved by the simple fact that you can now raise an ant or spider from birth to be your mount and companion, allowing you to travel with more on you and travel across the map far faster than you ever could in the first game.</p>



<p>Currently, only two mounts are available, though since Grounded 2 is launching as an early access title, there's plenty of time for more mounts to be added and improvements to be made to the game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Grounded 2 - Early Access Story Trailer AVAILABLE NOW" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RcUeK3xv17k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As part of Xbox celebrating Grounded 2's launch, Xbox and Microsoft are also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/24/grounded-2-red-ant-plush-giant-sweepstakes/">giving away a not-so-ant-sized Red Ant plush</a> that players can sit on as if they're riding it while they ride a Red Ant in the game. </p>



<p>When Grounded finally launched out of early access two years after its initial early access launch in 2020, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grounded-honey-conquered-genre/">Wccftech's Chris Wray said in his review</a> that "<em>Grounded is undoubtedly one of the best survival games around. While it falls into some of the same traps, getting very grindy and gatekeeping progression while not signposting as well as it should do, there's little doubt that it's a very engaging game. Where many games will give you a world to play around in, Grounded places you in a living, breathing world and has you engage with every element in interesting ways."</em></p>



<p>While Grounded 2's early access launch is unlikely to hit those same heights, it'll be interesting to see how it develops between community feedback and Obsidian, and if it can surpass the standards set by its predecessor.</p>

So I decided to check out what is easily one of the biggest games around in 2025 and try to find out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/616251/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-explainer-what-is&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/616251/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-explainer-what-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why it’s leading to kids crying on TikTok. </a></span>What I experienced was both awful and fascinating, and while I’m not sure I ever want to play <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> again, I think I get why it’s hooked so many kids and teens. </p><h2 id="h339000"><a id=""></a>What is <em>Steal A Brainrot?</em></h2><p>The gameplay loop in <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> seems remarkably simple...at first. However, there’s more going on than you might initially expect. When you begin, you spawn in with a small amount of money and a large storage area. Around you are other storage areas owned by other players. And in the middle is a conveyor belt constantly offering up new “Brainrot Meme” characters to buy. (This is a very popular series of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494">AI-generated creatures with fake Italian names that are hot online right now</a></span>. Don’t worry about it.) </p><p>These characters come in different rarities and have varying prices. Some are very cheap and affordable for new players, while others take millions of in-game dollars to buy. You buy some and they waddle over to your storage area where, every few seconds or so, they earn you money, with rarer ones earning a lot more per second. As you earn more money, you buy more and better characters. </p><figure id="" data-id="33575f47b00609acd694fa14f1125bd9" data-recommend-id="image://33575f47b00609acd694fa14f1125bd9" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Roblox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33575f47b00609acd694fa14f1125bd9" data-recommend-id="image://33575f47b00609acd694fa14f1125bd9" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.roblox.com/games/109983668079237/Steal-a-Brainrot&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/109983668079237/Steal-a-Brainrot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">If that was all <em>Steal A Brainrot</em></a></span><em> </em>was, I doubt it would have become popular enough to attract my attention. The real fun of the game lies in how you can steal from and screw over other players. For example, when you buy a character, someone else can run up and buy it before it gets to your storage area, effectively stealing it from you. You can then buy it back again, assuming you have the money, but back-and-forths like this can quickly leave you drained. You can also just run into someone’s storage area and steal one of their characters and bring it back to your place. And at any point, you can lock down your storage area for 60 seconds, keeping out thieves or trapping intruders. And then you can just walk out of your locked storage facility and go ransack their characters as they helplessly watch from afar. Complicating all this, you can pay real money via Robux to escape sooner, which feels like the cruelest way to squeeze money out of kids.</p><p>I have to admit, there is something very satisfying about running into an open storage room and stealing a high-priced character before the owner can come back and slap you with a baseball bat. This is why <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> has hooked so many people. </p><p>That was also one of the first things I did. </p><h2 id="h339001"><a id=""></a>The rise and fall of my meme empire</h2><p>Someone with a solid collection of brainrot characters went AFK for a bit, leaving their storage area unguarded and open. A few other players and I swarmed like locusts and robbed the poor person of everything. I snagged some alligator airplane hybrid thing that started earning me a thousand dollars a second. Soon, I had a sizeable fortune. I used it to buy a few more rare characters, and soon I had an empire.</p><p>However, this became a problem. It didn’t take long for other players to start hovering around my storage area. They were waiting for me to slip up. To leave without locking up or to stay out too long and leave my trophies for the taking. I’d smack them away, like swatting flies away from your food. But they would return.</p><p>Eventually, as my empire grew larger, I had to regularly deal with thieves. One entered and begged me for one of my rarest characters. They claimed they needed it for a special achievement and promised to give it back. I simply told them, “One does not keep an empire if they give it away.” They replied, “Bro, come on, be cool.” I would not be cool. I was building my future, one dumb meme character at a time. And I wasn’t going to give it up. </p><figure id="" data-id="308df047eda70fecd52884f4b337e8a6" data-recommend-id="image://308df047eda70fecd52884f4b337e8a6" data-format="png" data-width="1321" data-height="644" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Roblox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="308df047eda70fecd52884f4b337e8a6" data-recommend-id="image://308df047eda70fecd52884f4b337e8a6" data-format="png" data-width="1321" data-height="644" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After about 40 minutes of saving carefully, buying only the rarest characters, and keeping my storage area locked down tight, I had become extremely rich. I could buy practically any meme I wanted. I was a king, and my storage room showed it. </p><p>Then came the fall. That person who tried to talk me into giving them a rare character snuck in while I got greedy. I spotted a very rare dog-banana-thing and went after it, forgetting to lock up. When I returned, the locusts were swarming my empire. My riches were gone. I tried to stop them. I failed. </p><p>And so ended my short-lived but grand empire in <em>Steal A Brainrot</em>. For a moment I thought about rebuilding, but then I realized that in that 40-minute span, I had done everything the game offered. </p><p>I’d stolen a few characters, racked up riches, got into a few fights, and found a couple of super rare memes. I had no reason to keep playing <em>Steal A Brainrot</em>, a very ugly and boring-looking game. I can imagine a younger kid developing favorite memes and holding onto them tightly. And I’ll admit that when that bastard stole one of my rarest brainrots, I felt a flash of anger. I see why some children are crying and throwing tantrums after losing beloved memes. I’m not excited to play more of it, but yeah, I get why this thing has over 1 million players and a ton of clones. </p><p>I’m not a fan of one of the most popular games among kids being all about grinding forever to make more money and betraying people to win big, but who can deny the allure of building up something bigger than yourself? Even if it’s just a collection of Italian brainrot memes.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-empire-review-popular-memes-1851787027]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s that time of the month again where we get to look ahead to another batch of bundled games with PlayStation Plus. Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for August 2025, with the letters of the month being P and Z.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus August 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>There’s a solid trio of titles for PS Plus this month, available from Tuesday, 5th August:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lies of P</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>DayZ</strong> | PS4</li>
<li><strong>My Hero One’s Justice 2</strong> | PS4</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/13/lies-of-p-review/"><strong>Lies of P</strong></a> is a standout soulslike, taking inspiration from the classic puppet turned real boy tale of Pinocchio. We gave it a glowing review back in 2023, saying “Smooth combat, seamless exploration and a set of well-executed mechanics makes Lies of P an excellent Soulslike. When you add in the gorgeous visuals, desolate world design, stark sound design and engrossing story, it raises the experience above a lot of its contemporaries. All in all, although Lies of P is essentially Bloodborne featuring Timothée Chalamet, it does more than enough to mark itself out as a unique title worth your time – and I’m not lying.”</p>
<p>Oh, and there’s also the recently released Overture DLC to sink into if you enjoy this freebie enough.</p>


<p>That might be a hard act to follow, but the online survival action of DayZ provides a major change of pace. The game has grown and improved a lot since its original release in 2018, with last year seeing the release of a third major map with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/dayz-update-1-25-live-as-major-dlc-goes-free/">the DayZ Frostline expansion</a>, putting more emphasis on world temperature, clothing, food, and even letting you catch a cold. At the same time, the previous Livonia DLC was bundled into the game, and we now have the Badlands DLC to look forward to in 2026.</p>

<p>And finally, My Hero One’s Justice is a 3D brawler based on the hit anime superhero show. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/04/my-hero-ones-justice-2-review/">our review</a>, we said “It carries on the fine work put in on the first game, wraps the more recent story beats into a playable form, and buffs the already excellent visuals up to a new Shonen shine. It’s not a great jumping on point for newcomers, at least story-wise, but it remains a fun, approachable fighter based on one of the best anime shows of recent years.”</p>
<h2>Can you still get the July 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 4th August to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diablo IV</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>King of Fighters XV</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>Jusant</strong> | PS5</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/25/the-july-2025s-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-diablo-4-celebrates-15th-anniversary/">Head here for the full skinny</a> on that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Slime Rancher 2 1.0 Release Date Set for September]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-release-date-september</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slime-rancher-2-1-0-release-date-set-for-september.1256454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Monomi Park has announced that its cozy critter-rearing sim&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>is leaving Early Access this September, gaining new story content, new gameplay features, and more in the process.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2</em>&nbsp;will be exiting Early Access and hitting its 1.0 release on September 23rd. By the time it launches in full, it will have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">been in Early Access for three years</a>.</p>

<p>When the 1.0 version arrives, Monomi Park says you can expect plenty of extras for the cute farming sim, first among them being new Labyrinth sections that you can explore in order to "solve the [game's] ongoing mysteries and save the Far, Far Range".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slime-rancher-2-1.0-release-date-slimes_0.jpg?itok=D81n1cqc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slime-rancher-2-1.0-release-date-slimes_0.jpg?itok=Cmk__xk7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>is finally exiting Early Access in September.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also be able to enjoy the new Quantum Drones, which can both "help automate your ranch" and "roam the island to find resources", as well as more blueprints featuring "decor variants, gadgets, and upgrades".</p>

<p>All in all, Monomi Park is calling 1.0 "the best and most complete version of the&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>experience to date", so if you've been holding off until the game is done, September is the date you're going to want to aim for.</p>

<p>As well as announcing the 1.0 release, Monomi Park has also revealed physical versions of&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2</em>&nbsp;for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, which will launch in January. They'll sport artwork from&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>artist Yusuke Naora, as well as a fold-out poster.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>release date, as well as a sneak preview of the artwork created by Naora for the physical releases of the game, right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2</em>, it is, as you've probably guessed, the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher</em>, which left its Early Access period <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-leaving-early-access-this-august" rel="nofollow">all the way back in August 2017</a>.</p>

As such, any UK-based player who indicates their account age as 18 and over will begin seeing notifications encouraging them to verify their age.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Age verification will be required to retain full access to social features on Xbox, including voice and text chat, as well as game invites. That being said, the restrictions won't take effect until early 2026, so people won't be mandated to go through the verification until then.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This one-time process for players in the UK ensures we can continue to provide all players on our platform with age-appropriate experiences," Kunes wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for methods for online verification, these include proof of government-issued ID, age estimation, or either a mobile provider or credit card check. "The information players provide during the age verification process is protected with industry-standard encryption and is not stored or used for any other purpose," the statement reads.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, Kunes said that Microsoft expects to "roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future," clarifying that there is "no one-size-fits-all solution to player safety," so these methods may look different across regions and experiences. "We'll work with local communities, publishing partners and regulators to determine the right approach that both respects player privacy and doesn’t take away from the Xbox gameplay experience."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-igda-calls-wave-of-adult-game-delistings-a-form-of-creative-suppression-" target="_self" data-discover="true">The IGDA calls wave of adult game delistings a form of 'creative suppression'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eligible players who don't verify their age will only be able to use social features on Xbox with friends only until they do so.

<p><strong>Play!

Pokémon</a> website from their phone.</p>
<p>Not <em>only</em> that, but the app becomes a one-stop tracker for players who are taking part in these events. You can check into competitive events using a QR code, keep track of your record in-game, look for car images, and register your current TCG deck.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>You can also use it to search for events and earn badges in the app for competing.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of the app from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/play-pok%C3%A9mon-access/id6738208583?platform=iphone">iOS</a>/<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pokemon.play.access&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a> store:</p>

<p>Admittedly, we're a bit surprised this wasn't teased or announced during last week's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-july-2025-every-announcement-full-livestream">Pokémon Presents</a>, same with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">TCG Pocket</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-much-needed-trading-update-and-a-new-expansion-next-week">expansion</a>; but hey, what do we know?</p>

            <p>There are at least two ways to write about parrying mechanics. On the one hand, you have people like me who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/va-proxy-is-a-nier-automata-like-thats-on-a-mission-to-parry-everything-and-now-it-has-a-demo">compose farking ridiculous intros</a> such as "a good parry mechanic is a kind of redemption", then spend hundreds of words overegging the pudding. On the other, you have Nic, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/parry-like-youre-sekiro-with-this-one-weird-trick-that-shadow-of-the-erdtree-bosses-hate">sums parrying up far more elegantly</a> as "a pleasingly low-effort method to make your opponent look very silly". I hope that both Nic and I will be at home in Memoria Wake, a new isometric action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in which you can parry giant black cats with an umbrella. There's now a demo on Steam.</p><!--more-->

<p>If you're partial to Soulslikes, Memoria Wake's setting might bewilder you. There are no ghastly cloven dragons or cathedrals full of maggots, or not so far, anyway. Instead, the game's smashed dreamworld is full of talking rubber ducks, wind-up toy monkeys, jack-in-the-boxes, and jigsaw pieces. It's sinister, yet soothing.</p>
<p>"Traverse hand-crafted dreamscapes where beauty and horror intertwine," the official site comments. "Uncover long buried truths, face twisted memories, and piece together the fragments of a broken past." Whose past? Presumably that of your character, Nilo - a titchy feline adventurer with huge eyes and a cute raincoat. </p>
<p>There's a touch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tunic">Tunic</a> to those musty, sun-pierced dollhouse environments, but the handling reminds me much more of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deaths-door">Death's Door</a>. There is certainly a bunch of parrying. Catch the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3240610/Memoria_Wake/">Steam</a>. Release date? Let me dextrously deflect your wildest hopes with a scornful "coming soon".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/parrying-has-never-seemed-more-whimsical-than-in-dollhouse-soulslike-memoria-wake]]></content:encoded>

Weber replied, "I'm like, 'Yeah, how are we going to do that?'"</p><p>Weber went on to tell <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/senior-the-witcher-4-dev-admits-hes-a-little-worried-about-making-an-rpg-better-than-the-witcher-3-but-he-knows-that-this-stuff-is-subjective-and-doesnt-see-video-games-as-mathematical/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that a video game, like any creative endeavor, is "subjective," so instead of trying to outdo The Witcher 3, the team is trying to do justice to The Witcher 3 by embracing the vibes of how the game was made. He said the studio wants to "take the philosophy we had during The Witcher 3--how to make a game, how to really care about these things, how to tell stories--and keep that philosophy."</p><p>The Witcher 4 is a "true sequel," so CD Projekt Red will also trying to answer "new questions." Otherwise, The Witcher 4 runs the risk of "just redoing what we did before," Weber said.</p><p>"I think it's really trying to have that healthy mix of really moving forward and also trying out some new things, but doing justice to what was there, not trying to beat it," he said.</p><p>Before this, Weber said when the team was making The Witcher 3, there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-wants-studio-to-harness-the-scrappy-energy-that-made-witcher-3-so-successful/1100-6532438/" data-ref-id="1100-6532438">"good creative chaos"</a> going on at the studio. In practice, what this meant was that developers were working in a "vibe-based" manner and getting stuff done even if it was outside of their specific job remit.</p><p>"Sometimes I like to just say, 'Get it done. Do it dirty. Do it the way we used to do it!'" Weber said.</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't have a release date yet, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/" data-ref-id="1100-6530369">not expected to launch until 2027 at the soonest.</a> It's one of multiple games in development now at CD Projekt. Some of the others include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-partners-with-pokemon-go-owner-for-a-new-game-based-on-its-ip/1100-6530370/" data-ref-id="1100-6530370">a game produced in partnership with Saudi Arabia.</a></p><p>The Witcher 4 focuses its story on Ciri, and this has generated some amount of debate and controversy. Some people are calling the game "woke," but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-woke-for-starring-ciri-geralt-voice-actor-says/1100-6531680/" data-ref-id="1100-6531680">Geralt's voice actor has slammed these critics.</a> In other news, a new tech demo for the game debuted earlier this year, and while it looked very impressive, the developers want people to know <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">it wasn't actually the game.</a></p>

The restructuring, which includes workforce reductions within its game development studios and publishing arm (as well as reductions within other group-wide services), is expect to result in cost reductions of SEK 6-8 million (around $622,000-$829,000) during the second half of 2025, and SEK 40-45 million (around $4.1 to $4.6 million) for the full year 2026.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company said that the publishing business has had "a challenging quarter," pointing out its over-dependency on individual game releases as a problem.

It's not just the cost of paying, it's the fact that I've paid a cost and am now having to give up an opportunity. Those [acquisitions] will make sense, but they're few and far between.
