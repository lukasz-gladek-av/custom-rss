            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But he has a three-point plan to fix it.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In an impassioned end to his keynote address on the opening day of Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show in Bangkok, Dead Space creator and industry veteran Glen Schofield has declared that the games industry is in dire need of fixing, and he believes he knows just how to go about it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We need to fix the gaming industry right now,” said Schofield to a room of games industry professionals. “It's broken. It's beaten, it's battered, our developers are battered, they've been taking it on the chin for the last couple of years. We need to bring it back to what it was, right? Instead of all this negativity.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first and arguably most controversial step to take in Schofield’s opinion, is for the games industry to widely embrace the use of generative AI as a standard part of their development tool set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“AI isn’t here to replace us,” continued Schofield. “It’s here to make us faster, better, and more efficient. And AI is for all of us, it really is. It’s not just for directors and artists, it’s for writers and marketing execs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, I think [games industry] executives, owners, founders… Let's start training our people on AI. Start it as soon as you can. Who cares if I’m EA or Activision or Namco or whatever, we should be working together at least in training and training our people up. That would be a huge help because I know we’re going to start hiring people back again.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, Schofield believes that investors need to loosen their purse strings and start spending more on games development, as well as putting the right people in charge of each studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Come on, investors and execs, let’s stop this madness,” said Schofield. “You want to make a AAA game for like eight million dollars? You gotta get your guts back again. If we start putting money into the industry again, we know it's going to make money.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To me, you picked the wrong people to run the teams, to run the games, right? In my opinion [you need] a big, creative person who’s running it. And then you put people around to help with this and that. That's the way I work these days, right? I still run my studio in ways but I have people to help now so I can be 100% or 98% on that. That’s what these games need. I saw some of the people that were chosen and they were really good people, but there's no way they were ready to direct a game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I said, let's start putting money in, do due diligence a little better on that. We know we're going to make money. But we have to make quality games, and you have to give them to the right people.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, and perhaps most strangely given that he was presenting the opening keynote address at a rival games industry show, Schofield wished for the return of E3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bring back E3,” said Schofield to soft applause. “I mean, come on. E3 is the granddaddy of them all. And I will tell you every single E3 that I went to made my games better. And I know there's no formula to show a [return on investment] on that, [but] every game got better when you went there. You talked with your friends, you talked with colleagues, everybody's thrilled to help you with the next technologies, or showing you mechanics. When the companies started going outside of E3 I knew this was the end, and I started boycotting those because [that] was not an industry that was working together, this is an industry that’s fragmented. And so now there’s no E3.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Schofield concluded his address by reiterating that while he’s fully onboard with AI, the most important aspect of games development were the people making them, not the machines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Remember, ideas are the lifeblood of the industry,” said Schofield, speaking to the developers in attendance. “And those ideas? They come from you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How do you feel about Schofield’s plan to “fix” the games industry?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new offline mode for Ubisoft’s The Crew 2 is available now, which will allow owners to play the racing MMO offline if desired. The functionality – dubbed Hybrid Mode – has been explained in full on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/the-crew-2/news-updates/zs6ZFyLEQvKbFskEJZolR/the-crew-2-hybrid-mode-is-now-available" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>publisher’s website</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Ubisoft, Hybrid Mode gives us the “freedom to choose” how we want to play The Crew 2. That is, online mode (which is “the original experience as it was designed from the start, complete with multiplayer features, leaderboards, summits, and community sharing”) or offline mode (which the publisher describes as “a new experience”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Whether you’re looking to preserve your progression for the future or simply enjoy the freedom of playing without a connection, Hybrid Mode ensures The Crew 2 remains accessible for years to come,” explains the publisher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To transfer progression into offline mode, players can simply select “Export to Offline Save” after a session online. Doing so will create a copy of current progression in the game’s multiplayer world stored locally on a personal PC or console. Ubisoft notes online and offline saves are separate, however, so progress made offline will not carry back over into online saves. Players will be able to re-export online saves to update offline files at any time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Custom liveries will not transfer to offline saves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An offline mode for The Crew 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-but-the-original-is-gone-for-good"><u>was announced last year</u></a> in the wake of the the shutdown of the original game in March 2024. Disappointed players of The Crew (which was not a free-to-play game, but became inaccessible for its owners to play after its shutdown – even solo) were justifiably concerned about The Crew 2 suffering the same fate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We heard your concerns about access to The Crew games,” Ubisoft said at the time. “Today, we want to express our commitment to the future of The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. We can confirm an offline mode to ensure long term access to both titles.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft was subsequently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-sued-after-shutting-down-the-crew"><u>sued after the shutdown</u></a>, a lawsuit the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-the-crew-lawsuit-insists-we-do-not-own-the-games-we-buy"><u>publisher responded to</u></a> by insisting that buying a game doesn’t give players “unfettered ownership rights” to it, but rather only a “limited license to access the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

        <blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Maid Cafe on Electric Street</em> is a leisurely maid cafe <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,632 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> set in the otaku haven of Nipponbashi, Osaka.</p><p>The protagonist of our story quits his job at an extremely toxic workplace and finds himself at a run-down maid cafe tucked away in a quiet part of Nipponbashi. There, he meets the maid Shiro. One thing leads to another, and he eventually gets appointed as the temporary cafe manager and put in charge of the <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> of the maid cafe. As the new manager, his first task is to scout cute girls to work at the cafe. Time to explore Nipponbashi and all the otaku stuff it has to offer!</p><ul><li>Get to know the four unique main girls: Shiro, Miyu, Favna, and Honoka, all voiced.</li><li>Immerse yourself in lighthearted stories about everyday life with the cute maids.</li><li>Enjoy the modern and gorgeous pixel art graphics depicting even the finest details, including the meat buns next to the convenience store cashier and the figures on the shelves of an anime shop.</li><li>Go on fun dates at Nipponbashi, from anime shops to <a title="Platforms > Arcade [379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/arcade">arcades</a> to the cinema!</li></ul><p><strong>The Four Main Girls of Fuwa Fuwa</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shiro</strong> – <em>“Um, please be the new manager of the cafe!”</em> A maid who loves Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. A huge otaku for anime and video games, she talks really fast when she’s gushing about the things she loves, and often splurges on merch without thinking whenever she visits an anime shop. A little clumsy, but works hard every day to become the cute maid she’s always wanted to be.</li><li><strong>Miyu</strong> – <em>“Hey Mr. <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger, thanks a bunch for hanging out with me today~☆”</em> A game otaku and gyaru with a big appetite. Loves both eating and <a title="Genres > Cooking [16 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>, and apparently really enjoys serving her cooking to customers at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. Is actually Shiro’s friend on the online game Magic Angel, so they knew each other before actually meeting in real life.</li><li><strong>Favna</strong> – <em>“I am the Slayer of the False God, the Queen of the Kingdom of Darkness, the All-Seeing Oracle, the Guardian of the Dream of All Things—“</em> A mysterious girl dressed in gothic Lolita fashion. Speaks in riddles and demands the protagonist become her familiar. She sometimes accidentally drops the edgy act when she’s taken by surprise though, so maybe she’s just got a serious case of chuunibyou…?</li><li><strong>Honoka</strong> – <em>“Ya want a thrivin’ business? That there sounds like a job for our shrine!”</em> A girl with a Kansaiben dialect who works as a shrine maiden at her family shrine. Practically in charge of the shrine, she is reliable and very good at handling money, and has a strong sense of responsibility to boot. On top of that, she’s also the only glasses girl at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe!</li></ul><p><strong>Support Your Maid Cafe Employees as the Manager</strong></p><p>As the cafe manager, it’s your job to allocate work to your maids. Make sure to give the right girl the right job! For example, Shiro is always enthusiastic to serve customers, and Miyu is great in the kitchen.</p><p>Of course, you can’t just sit there while they work. During opening hours, you’ll also have to make coffee and help out on the floor, so it’s not as easy as it sounds!<br><strong>The Stunning Sights of Nipponbashi</strong></p><p>In order to recreate the atmosphere of the real Nipponbashi, the game features several real stores you can find there, such as Surugaya, Sofmap, Dragon Star, Super Potato, and Karaoke Rainbow, among many others. Don’t forget to pay them a visit when you’re shopping or taking one of your maids on a date!</p><p><strong>Collectable Capsule Toys</strong></p><p>If you’ve been to the real Nipponbashi, you’ll know that there are capsule toy machines all over the area. In this game, you can also try your hand at collecting your favorite capsule toy series and experience that unique gacha thrill of not knowing what you’re getting. As you collect more toys, you can even bring them up in conversations with the girls. Keep cranking those machines until you’ve collected them all!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="『電気街の喫茶店』Nintendo Switch版 発売日＆パッケージ版情報公開【ハイプで応援してね♪】" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbrY6r7hSQA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/maid-cafe-on-electric-street-coming-to-switch-on-february-26-2026]]></content:encoded>

It's possible that Amazon received a new shipment thanks to the release of Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles, which takes place in the same world as Final Fantasy XII.</p><div title="[Various] Final Fantasy X|X-2 and Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age for Nintendo Switch" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4713" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Final Fantasy X|X-2 and Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age for Nintendo Switch" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo\/dp\/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Final Fantasy X|X-2 HD Remaster for Nintendo Switch</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo\/dp\/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$25 at Amazon | $50 on eShop</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Final Fantasy X|X-2 HD Remaster comes with enhanced editions of both PS2-era hits. Final Fantasy X is widely regarded as one of the best games in the series. The Conditional Turn-Based Battle System was arguably the pinnacle of the franchise's turn-based era, as it added new wrinkles to the decision-making process. Final Fantasy X also placed a greater emphasis on summoning with the new Aeon creatures, and players had greater control over character upgrades thanks to the dynamic Sphere Grid system.</p><p>The world of Spira remains one of the most well-realized Final Fantasy settings, and the main cast, led by Tidus and Yuna, includes some of the best playable characters.</p><p>Final Fantasy X's 3D graphics showed off the power of the PlayStation 2 when it debuted in 2001. It proved to be such a big success that Square developed the first-ever sequel to a mainline game. Final Fantasy X-2 isn't nearly as highly regarded as its predecessor, but it's still a solid RPG that's worth playing.</p><p>Both games hold up well, and the HD Remaster looks great on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. Final Fantasy X is on the cartridge, but Final Fantasy X-2 is downloaded from the eShop using the voucher inside the box. Both games are 30-plus hours without including all the side content. You could easily spend well over 100 hours with the remasters.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo\/dp\/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age for Nintendo Switch</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo\/dp\/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$25 at Amazon | $50 on eShop</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Final Fantasy XII ushered in a new era of experimentation for the mainline franchise. Square Enix took a big risk by ditching turn-based battles in favor of a real-time, tactical system that was closer to Final Fantasy XI Online than previous single-player entries in the series. Unsurprisingly, FFXII received a wide range of reactions from fans when it launched in 2006.</p><p>These days, however, Final Fantasy XII is regarded as one of the high points in the series. As mentioned, Final Fantasy XII takes place Ivalice, and the sheer scope of the open world is still impressive today. In many ways, Final Fantasy XII is basically a single-player MMO. It has an excellent quest system, a bevy of secrets to uncover, and massive cast of NPCs to interact with.</p><p>Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is the definitive version, as it has improved visuals, quality-of-life improvements, and the job system from earlier games in the series. The average playthrough of Final Fantasy XII is roughly 40 hours, but there's so much side content that this number can easily double or even triple.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B07JB4ZR2Y,B07HCT37ZV,B0FBZYSJXM,B0FVGBTNHF,B08LB3XQ64,B0FVGG3TBR,B0C3DMTX14,B0DCKFWW1V,B0FQXHSWXS,B0BF7MXQKN,B0B5B1864Z,B09R5JM9RD&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy Games for Nintendo Switch 1/2</a></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4586553-finalfantasygamesfornintendoswitch.png" data-ref-id="1300-4586553" data-ratio="0.32075471698113" data-width="1325" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4586553-finalfantasygamesfornintendoswitch.png" data-ref-id="1300-4586553"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy games for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4586553-finalfantasygamesfornintendoswitch.png"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection: Anniversary Edition</a> -- $65 (<del>$75</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGBTNHF?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII + VIII Remastered</a> -- $40 | <em>December 9</em><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-VIII-Remastered-Nintendo/dp/B08LB3XQ64?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UK Edition</a> -- $35.24</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGG3TBR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy IX</a> -- $40 | <em>December 9</em><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-IX-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C3DMTX14?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asia Edition </a>-- $48</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy X|X-2 HD Remaster</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FANTASY-TACTICS-Chronicles-Exclusive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FBZYSJXM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> -- $50  <ul><li><em>Amazon Exclusive Edition includes free poster.</em></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-Gathering-FINAL/dp/B0FQXHSWXS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch 2)</a> -- $40 | <em>Jan. 22, 2026</em><ul><li><em>Preorder includes Magic: The Gathering Booster Pack</em></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theatrhythm-Final-Bar-Line-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0BF7MXQKN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Theatrhythm Final Bar Line</a> -- $29 (<del>$40</del>)</li></ul><hr><p>Final Fantasy fans can get every mainline <em>single-player </em>game through Final Fantasy 12 on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 in physical format. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</a> includes Pixel Remasters of the first six entries in the series.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-8-and-9-are-finally-getting-physical-switch-releases-in-america/1100-6535353/" data-ref-id="1100-6535353">Square Enix announced US physical edition releases</a> for three classic Final Fantasy games that were previously only available as imports: Final Fantasy VII and VIII Remastered Twin Pack is available to preorder for $40 at Amazon; Final Fantasy IX is also available to preorder for $40.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was expected that Pokémon TCG Pocket was going to celebrate its first anniversary in a big way, and it appears it will be delivering on that promise. Here comes the incoming Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising Pack.</p>



<p>We already knew that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-year-one-anniversary-update-includes-huge-wonder-pick-buff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shares, an upgrade to trades, and improving wonder picks</a> were going to be on the way, but now we know that the next pack will focus on mega evolutions.</p>



<p>Here is everything we know about the next Pokémon TCG Pocket expansion, Mega Rising.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-releases">Do We Know When Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising Releases?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One of the three headlines in the new packs. Image by The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>While there is no official announcement for Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising as of this writing, it is expected that the new packs will release on October 30. The release times for updates for these games are very early in the morning for the United States at 2 AM ET.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising">What to Expect in Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising</h2>



<p><strong>While we don’t know a ton of what to expect from the Mega Rising packs, you can definitely expect mega evolutions to be heavily featured.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vS2fnu49pw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Back in August</a>, the mobile game released a trailer saying that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-debut-mega-evolution-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mega evolution was going to be coming to the game this fall</a>. As of this writing, there are only three mega-evolved Pokémon we know for sure will be in the Mega Rising packs: Mega Altaria EX, Mega Blaziken EX, and Mega Gyarados EX. The packs that can be opened are split between the three cover Pokémon and should feature over 200 new cards.</p>



<p>When a mega evolution is in play, it will definitely be a big weapon for the player in control. They can be directly evolved from their previous form and give a nice boost in power. However, if the opposition takes down the card in battle, they will instantly win the battle, so be sure you are ready for the fight if you are bringing it in, as that is quite the balance of risk and reward.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shinies-dont-disappear-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> just releasing, mega evolutions are on everyone’s minds. That game brought back the feature in a console game for the first time since Pokémon X and Y were released on the Nintendo 3DS. Of course, Pokémon Go has had mega evolutions for a bit now, so Pokémon TCG Pocket will not be the lone mobile game to feature the mega popular power-up creatures.</p>

<p>Did you know that Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-removes-artwork-from-new-set-after-plagiarism-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed artwork due to some plagiarism claims</a>?

It will run from now until 4th November 2025, and gives trainers who reach 'Rank K' a special reward of <strong>Greninjite</strong>. This item can be used to Mega Evolve Greninja into Mega Greninja, and "can't be obtained through normal gameplay".</p>
<p>The official Pokémon website further explains the three types of rewards for Ranked Battles. You'll get rewards at the end of the battle (regardless of your performance), and promotion rewards are gained when you advance to the next rank (this includes items for training such as Mega Shards). The last type of reward is a seasonal reward, which is based on your ranking at the end of a season.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59kpuqto&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>The Apex Legends live service wagon just keeps rolling along, consistently bringing out new battle passes and content to keep players coming back time and time again. Up next is Apex Legends Season 27.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-apex-legends-season-26-fuse-mad-maggie-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 26, titled Showdown</a>, Apex Legends brought in a new permanent game mode called Wildcard, focusing on faster gameplay and chaos. It also added amps, which make a new way to augment your team in tough situations. Now, it’s time to look to the future.</p>



<p>Here is everything we know about Apex Legends Season 27.</p>







<figure><figcaption>This place may look very different soon. Image by Electronic Arts</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>While there is not an official release date announced for Apex Legends 27 as of this writing, leaks are suggesting that the update will happen on November 5.</strong></p>



<p>Of course, things can easily change between the information that leakers get and an official announcement, but typically, this does line up with the usual release for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-expected-decline-further-few-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a> seasons, which last about three months.</p>







<p><strong>You should expect the update for Apex Legends Season 27 to go live around 10 AM PT / 12 PM CT / 1 PM ET / 7 PM GMT on November 5.</strong></p>



<p>This is the usual time that seasons go live in the game, unless, of course, there are setbacks in the server maintenance or possibly delays.</p>



<h2 id="h-leaked-content-in-apex-legends-season-27">Leaked Content in Apex Legends Season 27</h2>



<p>The biggest leaked content that people are talking about in the upcoming Apex Legends Season 27 is a second Olympus. According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KptWKFHZI3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apex Legends leaker HYPERMYST</a>, there will soon be new screens displayed around the Olympus map that say, “Discovery on Pagos: Another Olympus?” If you ping that screen, your character will have a unique voiceline mentioning the scary prospect of a second copied city appearing out of nowhere.</p>



<p>So what does the second Olympus mean for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-launches-on-nintendo-switch-2-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a>? We highly doubt that this will be an additional map added to the rotation. Instead, the current version of Olympus might be getting a significant rework, this time receiving a lot of ice theming considering the mention of Pagos. A potential in-game event could follow it.</p>



<p>Outside of the second Olympus, HYPERMYST also says that the Sentinel will be getting a reactive skin, and Bangalore, Lifeline, and the Hemlock will be getting legendaries in the battle pass. There is also <a href="https://x.com/Osatou_Apex/status/1976969684949074254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">footage of dual-wield blades</a> coming to the game alongside the new season.</p>



<p>As of this writing, that is all we know about the Apex Legends Season 27 update. Expect some official announcements to be coming very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ask any gamer who travels or shares a living space: <strong>one screen is rarely enough</strong>. Whether you’re running a Switch on the go, playing Xbox in another room, or extending your gaming laptop setup, a secondary display changes everything. The <em>KYY</em> 15.6-inch portable monitor delivers that upgrade without the bulk or the cost. It’s slim, lightweight, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/">and now sitting at an all‑time low on Amazon at $69, down from $99.99</a>. At this price, it’s one of the most affordable full HD portable gaming monitors you can grab right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Convert Any Console or Laptop into a Dual-Screen System</h2>
<p>The <em>KYY</em> monitor <strong>houses a 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) IPS panel with clear detail, deep color capture, and generous 178-degree viewing angles</strong>. In other words, sharp images regardless if you’re gaming on the Switch, connecting a PS5 or extending your PC setup for extra workspace. Its <strong>HDR</strong> technology ramps up contrast so things can feel more vivid, blacks get deeper, and motion remains fluid even in swift action scenes.</p>



<p>The screen boasts <strong>two full-function USB-C ports and a Mini-HDMI connector</strong> and you get plug-and-play convenience with laptops, game consoles and phones with video output. One cable more often than not does everything and you get power and display that is a big advantage if you’re flying light or hate dealing with multiple adapters. Plug it into your console and you’re good in an instant for big-screen console gaming in a hotel room.</p>
<p>Weighing a light 1.7 pounds and a slim 0.3 inches in thickness, the monitor can fit easily into any backpack or laptop sleeve. You’re able to game in landscape orientation for hardcore gaming, switch it up into portrait orientation for livestream conversations, coding sessions, or reading files. It’s the type of display that transitions from gaming into productivity and does so without losing anything. The <em>KYY</em> also features practical add-ons which add up in the long run: You get a high-grade PU leather smart protective cover which also functions as a collapsible stand.</p>



<p>The stereo speakers built into the display provide respectable audio for everyday use, though headphones or an external speaker can always be plugged in through the <strong>3.5mm jack if more complete audio is desired</strong>. Along with the matte anti-glare coating, the eye-care mode and blue light reduction, the screen itself seems comfortable enough to gaze at for extended periods.</p>
<p><span>With the price cut all the way down to $69 from Amazon, it’s in a clearance range that’s difficult to resist.</span></p>

                <p>If you've been hanging around in a field hoping for the Great Pumpkin to appear, then you're going to be waiting a long time. The only spooky pumpkins coming your way this year are in Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival, the pumpkin-carving MMO that's back online after its planned hiatus</p><p>Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival was created by Whippoorwill Ltd aka Adam R. &amp; Dawn B., and the game sends players into a literal ghost town where they can take part in the in-game Halloween festival and pumpkin-carving contest. Players can win prize ribbons from other players who dole out awards to their favorite pumpkins. The game also encourages players to wander around the small town and customize their ghost avatar.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dROr2wZ6FDA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dROr2wZ6FDA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Previously, Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival was limited to 200 players at a time. This year, the game has added support for 800 simultaneous players. There are also new areas to find, including the Ghost Town Cinema, which plays classic silent movies. Some of the other activities in town include exploring a haunted and a hayride.</p><p>Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival can be <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">downloaded at its official site</a> for PC, Mac, and Linux. Players can name their own price, but if they choose to pay $2 or more, they get a version of the game that includes hats for ghosts. According to Adam R., the game has already set a record this year with 24,000 pumpkins created by players since the game's return earlier this month.</p><p>The team behind the game has also said that Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival will be taken down a week or two after Halloween, presumably before its inevitable return in 2026.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-campaign-is-an-act-of-narrative-cowardice.1327228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> features the series' first singleplayer campaign since 2018, which as a fan of both <em>Battlefield</em> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-modern-warfare-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumb AAA shooters</a> had me pretty excited! After rolling credits yesterday following roughly five hours of action, I should have known not to get my hopes up.</p><p>Unlike the last few games, which shipped with either glorified tutorials or no campaign at all, <em>Battlefield 6's</em> singleplayer harks back to entries in the series like <em>Battlefield 3</em> &amp; <em>4</em>, which tried their best to mimic <em>Call of Duty</em> and craft an actual story around a singular campaign. While there's still a whiff of tutorial here--you're introduced to a number of multiplayer maps, and slowly taught how to use the game's various weapons, gadgets and vehicles--for the most part <em>Battlefield 6's</em> campaign plays like it's earnestly trying to be a proper, singleplayer shooter.</p><p>If you are interested in those solely for the big explosions and bits where you drive a tank around, you're in luck here. This game blows a lot of stuff up in quite spectacular fashion, with buildings and sometimes entire streets frequently collapsing around you, while also presenting you with loads of ways to fight bad guys in big and interesting ways. In just the most superficial, sensory way, this is very much a modern military shooter.</p><figure></figure><p>While you're doing all that stuff though, you'll be interrupted frequently by cutscenes that attempt to tell you a story, to provide some context to all your jet-setting and cross-border destruction, to give you a reason to kill all those guys you need to kill. And honestly, I'd skip every single one of them.</p><p>I'm as aware as anyone that military shooters can feature questionable politics, that they struggle to squeeze coherent plots full of intrigue and international realpolitik into their limited runtime. Those are issues <em>Call of Duty</em>, and even previous <em>Battlefield </em>games, have struggled with for decades. But man, even with that bar set as low as I thought it could go, <em>Battlefield 6's</em> campaign <em>still</em> sails comfortably under it.</p><p>In its opening 30 minutes it clears its throat, opens its mouth then says...nothing. Nothing at all. Or rather, nothing that could upset anyone. Like so much other AAA stuff these days, it’s paralysed, caught between the desire to have a point to it all and the reality that having a point can sometimes be bad for business. You can see the bones here, buried under what could have been months of meetings and strategy and input across DICE and EA, of a story that wanted to say something about the times we're all currently living through. <em>Battlefield 6</em> is set in a near-future world where alliances are breaking up, where NATO is divided and new, sinister forces stand ready to challenge the world order.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 - Intro Scene" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhLzMPfQojo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>This is the campaign's intro, which seems pretty interesting given <em>everything going on right now</em>. But that guy's murder is completely forgotten about within the hour. Nothing this says ever means anything.</figcaption></figure></div><p>That, uh, sounds pretty familiar to anyone alive in 2025. Or 2022, or whenever serious narrative work on this game started. And could have been the perfect introduction to a campaign that went through with that, to put some boots on the ground in a story about Russia taking advantage of European division and civil unrest to destroy their Cold War foes, or of nefarious authoritarians seizing power in the United States. None of which happens in this game.</p><p>Of course <em>Battlefield </em>has no <em>obligation</em> to put forth its take on modern politics, no remit to provide commentary on the rise of fascism in the United States or the fracturing of international diplomacy. The problem here is that it starts down that road! It could have been a game about anything, from historical conflicts to big wars against Russia and China--all things <em>Battlefield </em>has done in the past with no hesitation!--but nope, within minutes of firing it up we see this game walk right up to some very contemporary issues, size them up then swiftly walk away, abandoning them in favour of some bullshit that even after finishing I'm still not quite sure I fully understand.</p><p>There's some kind of tale here about a wronged soldier fronting a global paramilitary force that is somehow able to take on the combined forces of the USA and Europe, with some shadowy CIA stuff thrown in for good measure, but from beginning to end the whole thing is simply ridiculous. A company amassing the manpower to fight whole continents--or at least doing so under the context provided here--is comedic, and the idea that its soldiers would fight to the last man, as though they were conscripts clinging to the ruins of Stalingrad instead of random dudes dressing up like NAVY Seals for a paycheck, is even dumber.</p><p>It all means so little, and is explained so poorly, that I was actively forgetting things while I was still playing through it.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Even by <em>Call of Duty</em> or <em>Battlefield's</em> standards, this is a stupid game. And not the <em>good </em>kind of stupid. Half the appeal of these shooters is that they're Hollywood explosions, that like an action movie you just start them up, disconnect for a few hours then get back to life. <em>Battlefield 6's</em> campaign would have been fine if it had tried to be that kind of stupid, to just pick a convincing bad guy, make them threaten something we care about and let us have at it. <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's</em> plot isn't too far from <em>Battlefield 6's</em>, and for all the ways we've collectively moved on and mostly forgotten it, it at least knew what it was and had the confidence to revel in it.</p><p>This game instead sets its sights on a weightier topic then falls miles short of it, leaving us with something even more forgettable, because the only thing worse than a game saying "press F to pay respects" is a game that says nothing at all.</p><p>I guess I'm just particularly frustrated here--shaking my head at the story of a five-hour singleplayer campaign for a game people only play for the multiplayer, I know, it's weird--because like I've said, it feels like someone at some point was trying to say <em>something</em>. Maybe those foundations were the only parts of a story the writers were allowed to get into the game before other departments and cowards sanded everything else smooth. Maybe years ago, when work first began on <em>Battlefield 6</em>, DICE could see the direction the world was headed in, just like they had with <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, a game about climate disasters.</p><p>For all I know--and if you were involved, I'd love to know--there was a more substantial exploration of the theme planned here at some point, a campaign that tried to say something about the world we've living in, before someone more concerned with shifting units than telling stories stepped in to say no, we can't alienate the fascists who will be buying this video game, or no, we probably shouldn't paint a target on the Nazis currently running the United States government, or the millions of Twitter users (potential customers!) whose knowledge of the war in Ukraine has been entirely decoupled from reality.</p><p>And hey, as far as EA is concerned that would be a prudent move. This game has already sold millions, and there are hundreds of thousands of people playing it right now at any given moment, all around the world. Huge swathes of that fanbase wouldn't have cared what the story was, so long as they got to shoot some shit in it. But surely <em>somebody </em>cared, I cared, that if you're going to start trying to tell a very modern story about a dying world order and a military conflict that could reposition it, you could have at least tried to go through with it.</p><figure><figcaption>One last thing: this game's coffee machines are weird</figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/imdb-review-scale-bad-broken"><h3>The Sweet Spot Of IMDb Is 6.3-7.6&nbsp;</h3></a><p>Please enjoy my arbitrary and unscientific system for accounting for IMDb's awful rating scale.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope"><h3>I Will Go Down Swinging Against Windows 11</h3></a><p>The end of support for Windows 10 is a mess</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa"><h3>Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires</h3></a><p>Nearly 400 workers formed two units under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bus-bound-demo"><h3>Look Out, I’m The Bus</h3></a><p>The Bus Bound demo is pretty fun</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch"><h3>I Can’t Believe We’re Still Talking About This</h3></a><p>CollarGate is one of the internet's dumbest psychosis events yet</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Like many other live service games, everyone is always looking forward to the next season of content, so we continue the cycle with Marvel Rivals Season 5.</p>



<p>In Season 4, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-showcases-daredevils-duelist-moves-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daredevil</a> and Angela were both added to the playable roster, adding to the already expansive set of heroes in the duelist and vanguard classes.</p>



<p>Here is when you can expect Marvel Rivals Season 5 to begin.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-5-release-date-and-time">Marvel Rivals Season 5 Release Date and Time</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Wolverine is ready for some old friends to join the party. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals Season 5 will begin on November 14 at the usual start time of 2 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>The date has been confirmed by <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1974142618360570254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NetEase as of the release of the Season 4.5 roadmap</a>, which notches that day as&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below is a table that goes over the release in major time zones.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-coming-in-marvel-rivals-season-5">What is Coming in Marvel Rivals Season 5?</h2>



<p><strong>As of this writing, there is no official announcement of the new content coming in Marvel Rivals Season 5, but various leaks, rumors, and in-game references point to Gambit and Rogue being added to the hero roster. Leaks suggest Gambit is a duelist and Rogue is a specialist.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Additionally, </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cross-progression-season-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>cross-progression</strong></a><strong> is making its full debut for all players after some have been able to test it in Season 4.5.</strong></p>



<p>With Gambit and Rogue being such a powerhouse couple being added to the game, the theme for Season 5 is rumored to be focused on romance and love. An interesting theme to take considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> had the Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman wedding day skins and event, which was held earlier this year.</p>



<p>The Season 4 Gallery Card also teases an upcoming tournament being held by Shou-Lou, who is directly linked to the new K’un-Lun map. With this map just recently being added, we would be surprised for another to be added so soon, so this tournament might be a new in-game mode, potentially something similar to Overwatch 2’s Stadium Mode, which was introduced in that game earlier this year.</p>



<p>That is just about all we have heard for possible content coming to Season 5, but knowing NetEase, there will be some surprises in store, including new skins, especially themed around romance.</p>

		<p>It’s been a while since we heard a peep out of Quantic Dream. While they’re now publishing titles, as well as developing their own, most people are waiting on tenterhooks for more news about Star Wars Eclipse, the game they’re working on for Lucasfilm/Disney. However, they’ve clearly got time to work on other things as well, with today’s announcement of Spellcasters Chronicles, a free-to-play, 3v3 online multiplayer title.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPELLCASTERS CHRONICLES | REVEAL TEASER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmI8nzNHR8k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Based on the reveal trailer, Spellcasters Chronicles has plenty going for it. It looks like it merges MOBA-style gameplay with a more direct, third-person viewpoint, and it’s definitely looking the part, utilising an anime-inspired art style to bring its world to life. I’m a sucker for this sort of thing, and the fact that it’s free-to-play will mean there’s very little reason not to check it out.</p>
<p>“We are honoured and excited to introduce Spellcasters Chronicles to players today, developed in our Paris and Montreal studios,” said David Cage, Founder and President of Quantic Dream. “Stepping into a new genre with a fresh artistic approach has been both a challenge and a source of growth, allowing us to evolve as a team. We now look forward to shaping the game further with players’ feedback and to perfecting this journey together.</p>
<p>This project reflects the creative spirit and technical ambitions guiding Quantic Dream for nearly three decades. With Spellcasters Chronicles, we sought to bring a new form of gaming experience blending action and strategy to life, while exploring community-driven narrative. It has been an exploration of bold ideas, a chance to expand into social and multiplayer experiences, and an adventure shared by a new talented team of experts within our studios in Paris and Montreal who brought this original universe to life and are continuing to develop new experiences including Star Wars Eclipse.”</p>


<p>If this sounds like your sort of thing, there’s a closed beta coming up that you can sign up for now, with dates due to be announced soon. You can find more information here: <a href="https://www.spellcasterschronicles.com/beta">https://www.SpellcastersChronicles.com/beta</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-offloads-the-delta-2-for-pennies-clearing-out-leftover-stock-following-the-delta-3-release-2000636090</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecoflow-offloads-the-delta-2-for-pennies-clearing-out-leftover-stock-following-the-delta-3-release.1327192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>EcoFlow built its reputation on one device: the Delta 2. It became the go‑to power station for campers and anyone who needed quick and reliable energy without the fumes or noise of a gas generator. Now that the newer Delta 3 is out, EcoFlow is clearing out stock and Amazon has dropped the 1800W Delta 2 to its lowest price ever: This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/">&nbsp;best‑seller is down to $429, from its original $699, a record low 39% discount that makes it hands‑down the smartest buy</a> of the season if you’ve been considering portable power for home backup or outdoor adventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Similar Performance Than Delta 3</h2>
<p>Although the Delta 3 has some improvements, the Delta 2 still meets the same sweet spot in terms of power, speed, and reliability all at a significantly lower price. With a<strong> 1024Wh capacity and peak output of 1800W</strong>, the station can power most household devices, tools, or entertainment equipment. Consider mini-fridges, coffee machines, gaming stations, and even hairdryers – <strong>this little hulk powers up to 90% of the things we all use daily</strong>.</p>



<p>The outdoors enthusiast also relishes the dual purpose of the Delta 2 as a solar generator with up to 500W solar input capability: You can pair it with matching panels (sold separately) and charge green while camping or off-grid. It’s the perfect configuration for RV power, work anywhere, or charging devices in an environmentally friendly manner. What’s more, its minimum base level 1kWh capacity can be increased easily with add‑on batteries up to 3kWh: That versatility converts the Delta 2 from a weekend camping friend into a serious residential backup solution.</p>
<p>If you’ve been waiting to commit to the EcoFlow ecosystem, this deal can’t be missed. The Delta 2 still houses the same high-end performance that brought the brand into the spotlight and for $429, it’s darn close to a steal. Once inventory dies off, the price isn’t returning this low at least for some time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’re into anime, chances are you’ve watched Solo Levelling. It’s been one of the best shows of recent years – albeit one that’s a massive power fantasy, but then, aren’t they all? One of the most anticipated RPGs of next year, Solo Levelling: Arise Overdrive, looks to bring that power fantasy to life in stellar fashion, and publisher Netmarble will certainly be pinning a lot of their hopes on its success. Things are definitely looking good though, and in preparation for the game’s appearance at TwtichCon San Diego in the US, the developers have dropped a brand new gameplay trailer showing off some of the game’s combat features.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE] Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DbLH3OKvBc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Solo Levelling centres on Sung Jin-Woo, the weakest hunter in a world where hunters fight off otherworldly threats. After an encounter in a mysterious dungeon, Sung Jin-Woo discovers that he’s become a ‘player’, experiencing the world like a video game, and able to grind and improve his hunter level – something that should be impossible. What’s great about the series is that he spends the first couple of series hiding these newfound abilities, but there’s definitely the sensation that things might take a turn for the worse in the near future, as he gets more and more powerful.</p>
<p>There’s lots of levelling up and fighting off fantastical creatures in Solo Levelling, so it’s little surprise to see Arise Overdrive focusing on that. As it’s a series based on the idea of a world that’s being experienced like a video game, it’s a perfect match, and one which I can see Netmarble doing a good job with. Combat looks swift and flashy, and there’s definitely some similarities to be found with Square Enix’s Final Fantasy XVI, taking on huge creatures with melee weaponry and visually impressive special moves. </p>


<p>Solo Levelling: Arise Overdrive is due to launch on November the 17th for PC via Steam and Xbox Series consoles. If you fancy checking the game out before that at Twitchcon San Diego, that’s going to run over this weekend, from the 17th to the 19th of October. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modiphius has announced a new campaign book for their WWII pulp action TTRPG. <em>Achtung Cthulhu The Norway Projekt</em> continues the war between the Allies and the Axis powers, with the latter delving into dark occult works, shifting the venue to the icy regions of Norway.</p>

<h2>The Achtung Cthulhu The Norway Projekt Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p><em>Achtung Cthulhu The Norway Projekt</em> is a 156-page hardcover campaign book. The campaign is divided into three parts and features nine linked missions across the Norwegian front of the game's alternate history of WWII. The campaign builds on Modiphius' 2d20 RPG system, which has powered other TTRPGs such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallout-royal-flush-ttrpg-adventure-set-in-new-vegas-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dishonored-role-playing-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dishonored</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-star-trek-adventures-second-edition-starter-sets-now-available" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Trek Adventures</em></a>.</p>

The Nazis are desperate to turn to the tide of the war and look to developing atomic weapons. To prevent this, the Allies launch Operation: Grouse, Freshman, and Gunnerside, where they race to prevent the Axis from acquiring the Norwegian heavy water plant at Vemork.</p>

<p>But, since this is <em>Achtung Cthulhu</em>, the threat of nuclear devastation isn't the only danger to contend with. Enter the little-known Norwegian cult the Flokk of the Allfather, whose arcane knowledge may provide a darker, and faster, source of atomic power than conventional science.</p>

<p>The mission is a race against the clock where the players must rescue resistance fighters, uncover a vast conspiracy threatening to rain atomic fire on Allied cities, and fighting tooth and nail against horrors beyond mortal ken such as the Daemon Sultan Azathoth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re delighted to finally give fans a chance to get their hands on The Norway Projekt. If you’re looking to take your agents on an epic campaign through the coldest of fronts, with a chance to foil eldritch cults, battle Nazi super science and change the course of the Secret War, then this will be a perfect addition to your collection!’ - Achtung Cthulhu Line Editor John Houlihan</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Achtung Cthulhu The Norway Projekt</em> is available for pre-order now on Modiphius' store at an MSRP of $55. The book is expected to ship January 2026.</p>

              <p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> has some tough-as-nails fights, especially if you’re coming to the strategy RPG formula for the first time. <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster</a> ups the ante with a new Tactician difficulty mode that stacks the odds even more against your burgeoning squad of heretical recruits. As someone who’s played the game a dozen times before, I love the new layer of challenge even if some of the encounters kicked my ass.</p> <p>Importantly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228"><em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> adds</a> some helpful features for navigating the game’s underlying difficulty. Unlike in the original, it’s generous with auto-saves and lets you flee any battle at any time. No more getting trapped in multi-encounter missions with no other save files to escape to. You can also dial the difficulty up or down throughout the campaign and, like in the original, every story mission <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-guide-xp-jp-grind-tips-2000633724">lets you over-level</a> if you’re diligent enough.</p>

 <p>Even so, some of these fights get tricky! Here’s my ranking of the toughest battles in<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em> and some tips for how to beat them.</p> <h2>10. Dorter Slums</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636206" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636206"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636206">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> It’s early in the game, your characters are probably under-developed, and the map layout heavily advantages the enemy, which includes an Archer high up and two Black Mages. Most kick-ass battle music in the whole game, though.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> The easiest strategy is to have Ramza hang back and use Focus a couple of times until he’s able to move in and take out one of the Black Mages in a single hit. Make sure he has battle boots and Move +1 equipped. A fully outfitted Knight to tank damage is useful but you can really get away with just Chemists and Squires as long as you focus on staying healed until Ramza can go on a rampage.</p>

 <h2>9. Fovoham Windflats</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636209" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636209"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636209">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> Any fight against a character with Holy Knight abilities is bullshit, and the game throws this one at you super early. Wiegraf can immediately take your party down to critical HP if they stay bunched up, and his backup will start killing you from there.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it: </strong>This is the one battle I’ve never tried to beat without cheese. Just make sure you have at least a couple of ranged attackers and Ramza (preferably as a Monk) is able to get one hit on Wiegraf before dying. Focus exclusively on him until you get him to flee.</p>

 <h2>8. Finnath Creek</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636202" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636202"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636202">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> This is the first time you see a Red Chocobo. Cute, right? Not when they start one-shotting your party with ranged Meteor attacks. It doesn’t help that they already have incredible movement range and the river is hard to navigate. Give them even a moment to breathe and the Yellow Chocobos will have them all healed up.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> Put your party back as far as possible to try and prevent any of them from being hit in the first round. Then prioritize sniping them from afar with Holy, Flare, or actual guns. Have tanky characters move just far enough in front to act as decoys while using X-Potion to keep themselves alive.</p> <h2>7. Ziekden Fortress</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636207" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636207"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636207">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> This fight is great because you finally get to kill Argath. What sucks is he now has Auto-Potion at a point in the game where few of your attacks will be hitting for more than the 30 HP he gets healed. In addition, there are three tanky Knights and two Black Mages. Plus he will pick at you from afar with a crossbow.</p> <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> The battle has you start with characters split between the two sides of the fort but you should just immediately bring the group that doesn’t include Ramza over to the bottom corner of the map where he is. Have Ramza use Focus and hang back. Get an Archer with Jump+1 to climb the tower and use an Aim+3 on Argath and try to lure him in close so you can hit him with a magic attack. Ideally, you can get one of his own Black Mages to target one of your characters and then move them right next to him before it goes off. Once Argath is dead, the battle is over.</p>

 <h2>6. Walled City of Yardrow</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636203"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636203">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> You meet Rapha during this fight and if she dies you automatically lose. What makes that extra challenging is that it’s very easy for her to die before you even get a turn. Plus there are multiple Ninjas and Summoners to contend with, and a city wall that’s a pain to traverse.</p> <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> Assuming Rapha survives (there’s a chance the Ninja Throw attacks can miss her, so keep resetting if that doesn’t happen), have a Chemist or White Mage heal her up and then hope she runs to the corner and stays out of trouble. A Lancer is good for this fight to scale the walls and block the Ninjas’ attacks. A Summoner can also hit lots of targets as they bunch up near the entrance. Agrias is also clutch in this fight. Just plop her down in front of the entrance to keep the enemies inside and buy yourself some extra time.</p>

 <h2>5. Golgollada Gallows</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636210" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636210"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636210">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> It’s a trap! Not only do you have to fight Gaffgarion and his goddamn self-healing Night Sword attack, you also have to deal with being surrounded by a bunch of enemies including Knights and Archers. But mostly that Night Sword thing.</p> <p><strong>What to do about it:&nbsp;</strong>As with any Sword Magic-based enemy, you can try to burst them down as quickly as possible or just use the Knight’s Sword Break ability to try and destroy his weapon. If it doesn’t work, reset and try again. Eventually you’ll be able to neutralize him within the first few turns. If you don’t want to be a coward you can use Mustadio’s <span id="Arm_Shot">Arm Shot</span> ability to disable him, or the Mystic’s <span id="Hesitation">Hesitation</span> equivalent.</p> <h2>4. Lionel Castle Gate</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636208" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636208"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636208">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard: </strong>Gaffgarion’s back and this time he’s got Ramza trapped on the other side of the gate. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> loves these little duels but they completely subvert the normal strategies the game usually incentivizes. In addition to being stuck in a one-on-one, the rest of your team is thrust into a Summoner meat grinder with basically no cover.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> If you’re a try-hard you can teach Ramza Teleport and have him simply leave Gaffgarion behind to be dealt with last. You can also use that Weapon Break trick again. Personally, I like to have Ramza as a Monk keep himself healed with Chakra while a Time Mage on the other side of the gate casts Haste on him. Eventually you can either have him get down to open the gate and let everyone else through, or stack enough extra speed with Tailwind to just overpower him. A Summoner with Bahamut or Cyclops can make quick work of the rest of the enemies.</p> <h2>3. Riovanes Castle Roof</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636201" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636201"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636201">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> It’s time to keep Rapha from dying again, only this time she’s in the middle of a brawl with the most busted enemies in the whole game: Celia and Lettie. Before you even get a chance to move, she’ll be near death.</p> <p><strong>What to do about it:&nbsp;</strong>Hopefully you’ve had someone learn Teleport by now. The key is being able to act before she gets killed. Try to get as many of your characters in range to draw the enemy’s attention or use a skill that has a chance of casting Confuse on Celia, Lettie, or Elmdore. Characters with higher speeds get to act first, so having Ninja unlocked on someone helps, as does having a pair of Sprint Boots equipped.</p> <h2>2. Lost Halidom</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636205" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636205"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636205">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> Dragons. So many dragons. Plus they can fly and cast magic. Also two guys with magic guns. And a giant chasm through the middle of the map. RIP.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> I don’t have much good advice for this one. You can try to rely on Mustadio to keep Barich and his Chemist from being able to act. Dealing with the dragons is still a pain. You can roll a couple of Mediators to try and tame them which will not only absorb a lot of aggro but also dish it back out. One big plus is having a movement skill equipped on Orlandeau so that he can quickly get across the ravine and keep up the attack. Just make sure your characters stay on spots with adjacent squares of the same elevation. This will stop the dragon’s magic attacks from only targeting a single square and increase the chance they miss entirely. Otherwise you’ll be getting one-shot all across the map.</p> <h2>1. Wiegraf and Belias</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636204" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636204"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636204">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:&nbsp;</strong>Another one-on-one fight with Ramza, except this time you can’t escape. Wiegraf will kill most players in two turns, giving you little room to heal and attack him. Plus the fight goes directly into the Belias showdown and Ramza doesn’t get healed in between. Nasty!</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> Not to sound like a broken record but you can try to break Wiegraf’s sword. The Full Restore reactive ability also comes in handy here since he’ll almost always get you down to critical. This will effectively keep you at full health and free you up to just attack him. Ramza Monk is still the best option for this fight. Or if you want to play a game of Chicken, you can go the Thief or Ninja route and keep using the Tailwind Mettle ability plus Haste to slowly raise your speed and start stacking extra turns.</p> <p>Okay, but what about Belias? On Tactician, this is actually the harder part of this two-pronged encounter. It’s the one that gave me the most trouble in my recent playthrough, and I only finally beat it on my ninth try with a bit of luck. Mostly, it came down to a Summoner with Short Charge using Bahamut and wiping out all of Belias’ accompanying Demons in one turn. From there you’ll want to keep whaling on him but keep your party spread out. Once he’s out of magic he’ll start using Petrify so watch out. A Lancer with Jump comes in handy here, as long as the timing syncs up right.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Time to level up.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The November 17 release date on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373990/Solo_Leveling_ARISE_OVERDRIVE/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive/9mvhcq7cjx01" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Xbox PC</a> for action RPG Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE is quickly approaching, and to celebrate, it will have a booth at TwitchCon in San Diego this week where players can try out a new demo and win special merch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE lets you step into the world of the massively popular Solo Leveling franchise, centering on protagonist Sung Jinwoo. It’s been built for PC and console (it’s scheduled to release on consoles in 2026) and includes the original story along with new adventures that are exclusive to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with the series, it takes place in a world where people with supernatural abilities known as Hunters must protect mankind from a never-ending onslaught of monsters. Usually, Hunters’ abilities and strength level are determined when their powers first manifest. But Jinwoo gets a unique ability: he can level up. So even though he starts off as a low-tier Hunter, he can grow more powerful the more foes he defeats. And now he’s on a personal quest to become the world’s strongest Hunter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It should be pretty obvious why this premise lends itself to a game, it basically already has RPG progression systems baked in. Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE builds on that base with a skill tree that branches into eight different job advancements. Through the course of the webtoon, Jinwoo transforms into the Ultimate Monarch of Shadows, and now you can experience his evolution for yourself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can see in the video above, Jinwoo can switch between weapons and combine basic attacks with flashy special abilities to build up combos. But you can’t just mindlessly attack, you need to keep an eye on enemies and respond to their strikes and AoE attacks. You can execute perfectly timed parries or dodges to cancel out damage and unleash powerful counterattacks to keep the fast pace flowing and combo meter climbing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However you defeat enemies, they’ll drop loot that you can use to craft new weapons, including ones pulled directly from the original webtoon, like Kasaka’s Venom Fang and the Demon King’s Daggers. There are several weapon types available, and your combat style will be determined by your weapon and skill tree choices. That makes for a variety of styles, like in the original story, giving you the opportunity to try out different options and figure out what works best for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll face off against a ton of enemies and bosses solo, but some are too strong for even a leveled-up Jinwoo to deal with. That’s where multiplayer comes in. You can team up in four-player co-op raids to take on commanders that series veterans will recognize, and you can play as Jinwoo or one of the other available Hunters with their own set of unique skills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re interested in seeing more, don’t miss TwitchCon, which starts Friday, October 17 and will be open until Sunday, October 19. The Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE booth is open to the public, so any in-person attendees can come by and try out the demo. And there will be some popular streamers playing the game at the booth (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/iitztimmy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">iiTzTimmy</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/RDCGaming" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">RDCGaming</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/esfandtv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">EsfandTV</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/agent00" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Agent00</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/extraemily" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">ExtraEmily</a>, and more). The booth will also have activities available, and people who complete them can earn exclusive merch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not able to attend in person, no worries. There will also be streamers dropping by the in-booth streaming room to play the demo and share gameplay with their channels. The game releases November 17 on Steam and Xbox PC, with a planned release on consoles next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s available for pre-order now, and the story, boss raids, and multiplayer content are included.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-entire-yakuza-franchise-is-on-sale-on-steam-right-now.1327117/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Boy howdy, there sure are a lot of<a href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473"><em> Yakuza/Like A Dragon</em></a> games to play! Perhaps, like so many others, you’ve been wanting to hop into the elaborate and wild franchise all about Japanese gangsters and bizarre side characters. Well, a big ol’ <em>Yakuza</em> franchise sale, happening now on Steam, might help you finally check out this popular series.</p> <p>20 years ago, in 2005, the very first <em>Yakuza</em> game launched on PS2. Since then, there have been over a dozen entries in the franchise, including remasters, re-releases, spin-offs, and even a weird non-canonical entry featuring zombies. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/LikeaDragonFranchiseSale2025">And (almost) all of those games are currently on sale on Steam</a> as part of a big <em>Yakuza</em> franchise sale that ends on October 23.</p>

 <p>I say almost, because the zombies spin-off, <a href="https://kotaku.com/prepare-to-yakuza-in-2012-with-dead-souls-452566043"><em>Yakuza Dead Souls</em></a>, isn’t included as it has never been ported to PC. The other odd duck here is<em> Yakuza 3 Remastered</em>, which isn’t on sale despite being included in the sales event page. Perhaps Sega made a mistake, and it will be marked down to $11 like most of the other <em>Yakuza</em> games in the sale. Who can say? Regardless, if you’ve been waiting to hop into the <em>Yakuza</em> series, this is a great time to snag a few (or all!) of the games and start enjoying them. As former <em>Kotaku</em> writer Luke Plunkett recommended in the past, <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-yakuza-games-to-play-after-yakuza-0-1792025738">you should probably start with <em>Yakuza 0</em></a> if you’re hopping into the series for the very first time. After that, check out <em>Yakuza</em> <em>Kiwami</em> and <em>Kiwami 2</em>.</p> <p>Here are all the games currently on sale as part of the ongoing <em>Yakuza/Like A Dragon</em> sales event:</p> <ul> <li><em>Yakuza 0</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza Kiwami</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza Kiwami 2</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza 3 Remastered</em> – $20 – Not on sale… I guess??</li> <li><em>Yakuza 4 Remastered</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza 5 Remastered</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza 6: The Song of Life</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza Complete Series</em> Bundle (0-6) – $77 ($140)</li> <li><em>Yakuza: Like A Dragon</em> – $8 ($20)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> – $21 ($70)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</em> -$18 ($50)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon: Ishin!</em> – $12 ($60)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</em> – $33 ($60)</li> <li><em>Judgment</em> – $12 ($40)</li> <li><em>Lost Judgment</em> – $15 ($60)</li> </ul>

As I passed by, a citizen remarked that it had a showcase of artifacts from the Hisui region, which was enough to make me spin on my heel and beeline into the building. </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>players will know that Hisui is the previous name of the Sinnoh region from </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>, and the historical setting of the last </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game. Anyone who played </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>to the end knows </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-story-dlc-lucas-dawn-ingo-volo-1850415489"><span>it ended on a bittersweet cliffhanger</span></a><span> that seemingly doomed its isekai’d main character and others to a primitive point in history, even while they had friends, family, and Pokémon waiting for them in the present day. However, the Lumiose Museum’s exhibit may give us at least a few details about what happened after </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>’ conclusion.</span></p>

 <p><span>Once you’re there, head to the second floor and you’ll see several familiar artifacts from the Hisui region. There are hieroglyphics of legendary Sinnoh Pokémon, hand-crafted early Poké Balls, and a few outfits previously worn by characters like </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>’ protagonist, the surprise villain Volo, and Commander Kamado, an ancestor of Professor Rowan from </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>. While we don’t see anything belonging to him, one of the displays mentions a man named Ingo who would train people in Jubilife Village in the ways of Pokémon battles, but long-time fans will know that he was much more than that.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636162" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636162"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636162">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Ingo made his debut in </span><i><span>Pokémon Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>as an elite trainer at the Battle Subway alongside his brother Emmet. His appearance in </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span> indicated he’d been shot through time just as the protagonist had been, only to have gradually forgotten his previous life in the modern day. It was an incredibly dark and tragic fate for a Pokémon character, and because </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>ended without either of these displaced trainers going back home, fans have spent the past three years assuming they lived out the rest of their lives in Hisui and never saw their loved ones again. In the case of Ingo, at least, that doesn’t seem to be the case.</span></p>

 <p><span>The diagram of Ingo’s old training grounds has an accompanying text that says Ingo one day “simply vanished” after telling the people of Jubilife that it was “time for [him] to return.” Though we haven’t seen Ingo in any games since, it sounds like he did get to go home to his brother and friends eventually.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636161" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636161"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636161">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The long-lost time traveler isn’t the only character we get an update on in the exhibit. Volo, the ancestor of </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl </span></i><span>champion Cynthia and a surprise religious zealot intent on usurping Arceus’ power for himself, also gets an epilogue of sorts in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. You can find his final boss outfit in a glass case next to statues of legendary Pokémon Palkia and Dialga, and one of the museum’s patrons says that the person who wore it donated it to the exhibit personally. He also apparently looked at some of the sketches on display “with this nostalgic air,” implying that Volo has, somehow, persisted into the modern day. Is he time-traveling? Is he immortal? Will we see his crazy ass again? I have so many new questions.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever happened to Volo and Ingo, it also stands to reason that </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>’ protagonist was likely able to return to the modern day as well, though I haven’t been able to find any direct mention of their whereabouts. Their uniform is on display here, though. So one way or another, history has not forgotten them and what they accomplished in Hisui all those years ago.</span></p>

<p>If a new Nintendo patent is true, we may be seeing DS games on the Nintendo Switch 2 soon.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, the Nintendo Switch 2 has become one of Nintendo’s best-selling consoles. With its catalog growing each month, with the latest being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-preview-the-new-battle-system-could-become-the-new-standard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, there’s a lot to enjoy. For those who pine for the past, the Nintendo Switch Online brings a treasure trove of classic titles from the Game Boy and N64. Even with the most recent addition, Virtual Boy, being outside the box, it seems it may get ever crazier and cooler, thanks to a newly discovered patent.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo DS coming to NSO Confirmed! Patent Discovery of a lifetime! Breaking News! The following patent shows how Nintendo will manage the dual screen situation on Switch 2. You will have 3 options. <br>1. Dual Screen (Parent screen, child screen)<br>2.

<p>In a post from user <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1978839968895074613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MikeOdysseyYT</a>, they discovered a new patent from Nintendo. The images they provided show the Nintendo Switch drawn up to have a second screen show up during gameplay. What’s interesting is that each image correlates to one of the ways you could do a dual screen, like picture-in-picture and dual screen. While it could just be for new mechanics, it’s more than likely that it’s a possible way to bring Nintendo DS titles to the console. </p>



<p>For many, the Nintendo DS was home to dozens of amazing titles and one of the coolest ways to experience a game. If true, it’ll be interesting to see how it plays in action. Most games on the DS used the second screen for a map or, in Pokémon’s case, the action menu. Given it’ll likely be all Nintendo-branded titles, they’ll likely tweak some things here and there to make it look good, much like they did for the other NSO games. As it is a patent, nothing is yet confirmed by Nintendo, so be wary.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Microsoft announced a substantial price increase for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. If you're a subscriber in the US, you will now be charged $30/month, a $10 bump from the previous $20/month rate. The new price is effective immediately, so you may have already paid the increased rate if you were billed already this month. That said, there is a way to avoid the price increase: prepaid codes. The price of prepaid membership codes hasn't changed--at least not yet. Over at Amazon, you can <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3-Month Membership codes for $55</a></strong> (was $60), which breaks down to $18.33/month. Based on Microsoft's new subscription price, you're <strong>saving $35 across three months</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1-Month prepaid codes are sold for $20</a> at Amazon, so you're saving an additional five bucks every three months with Amazon's deal. Amazon's prepaid codes can be redeemed by existing and new subscribers with a US Xbox account. Once you enter a prepaid code, your next billing date is pushed. So if you redeem a 3-Month Membership in October, you won't be billed again by Microsoft until January.</p><p>The discount on prepaid codes becomes more glaring if you buy multiple. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate can be stacked up to 36 months. For instance, if you were to buy four prepaid 3-Month codes, you'd save $140 on a full year of Game Pass Ultimate. Here's a breakdown of the savings from buying Amazon's prepaid code deal versus subscribing directly through Microsoft. Note: The numbers in the Amazon column are based on the 3-Month Membership deal, but even if the price jumps back to $60, you're still saving a ton of cash.</p><h3>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: Microsoft Store vs. Prepaid Codes</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Duration:</th><th scope="col"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Xbox+Game+Pass+Ultimate+Deal+-+Save+%2435+On+3-Month+Membership&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-10-16+12%3A59%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-16+12%3A59%3A20&amp;fnarticle_id=6535504&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.xbox.com%252Fen-US%252Fxbox-game-pass%2523join&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now%2F1100-6535504%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft:</a></th><th scope="col"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Deal:</a></th><th scope="col">Savings:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3 Months</td><td>$90</td><td>$55</td><td>$35</td></tr><tr><td>6 Months</td><td>$180</td><td>$110</td><td>$70</td></tr><tr><td>9 Months</td><td>$270</td><td>$165</td><td>$105</td></tr><tr><td>1 Year</td><td>$360</td><td>$220</td><td>$140</td></tr><tr><td>2 Years</td><td>$720</td><td>$440</td><td>$280</td></tr><tr><td>3 Years</td><td>$1,080</td><td>$660</td><td>$420</td></tr></tbody></table><p>It's unclear how long retailers will stick with the old $20/month rate. Amazon's $55 deal is new this week; earlier this month, Amazon was charging $60. For what it's worth, Amazon has historically held out longer than other retailers when prices have changed in the past. The retailer was selling the 3-Month Membership code for $45 long after Microsoft increased the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $17/month. The latest price change for Game Pass Ultimate is by far the biggest of the three price hikes the service has experienced over the years. While this is a disappointing for subscribers, it also means it's more important than ever to take advantage of prepaid code discounts.</p><p>If you aren't a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, now's a pretty good time to become a member. Multiple AAA games are coming to Game Pass Ultimate on launch day in the coming weeks, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJYV9DY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> (October 21), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Outer Worlds 2</a> (October 29), and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FMC62NCK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> (November 14).</p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/" data-ref-id="1100-6535007">Microsoft and Asus just launched the first Xbox handheld</a>.
