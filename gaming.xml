            <p>I’ve moaned plenty about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">technical and performance woes</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> inflicted upon itself, and only seems committed to remedying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patches-will-keep-coming-if-almost-as-slowly-as-the-game-still-runs">at a glacial pace</a>. Yet on the possibility of future RE Engine-powered games suffering the same fate, even I haven’t been as worried as certain Capcom investors, who recently extracted an assurance from the developer-publisher that upcoming horror sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> will arrive in better shape.</p>
<p>During a conference call to discuss fiscal earnings and other businessy matters – the official transcript is <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf">here</a>, translated from the original Japanese – Capcom were asked if there was "a risk that Resident Evil Requiem will experience technical issues similar to those seen with Monster Hunter Wilds." The response: nah mates, probably not.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In as many words, anyway. The full answer reads: "Resident Evil Requiem differs from Monster Hunter Wilds in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features. At present, we do not anticipate similar risks. We are developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications."</p>

<p>While it’s a stretch to pin much of Wilds' crap framerates, popping textures, or complete misappropriation of frame gen tech on "network features," it is true that Requiem is a very different game. It’s also made by a separate team within Capcom, and has the benefit of following two previous RE Engine-built Resi games whose imperfections on PC didn’t come anywhere close a Wilds-level disaster. When Katharine (RPS in peace) was hardware ed, she declared <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> one of the "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-village-pc-performance-best-settings">best-looking PC games of the year</a>" that nonetheless ran "supremely well" provided you kept within your GPU’s expected limits.</p><p>More recently, in July 2025, I played Resident Evil Requiem itself on a PS5 Pro and it seemed pretty much fine. This was the same <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-has-its-own-version-of-lady-dimitrescu-but-i-doubt-youll-be-thirsting-for-this-hag">hag-dodging demo that Edwin tried</a> previously, though since we lost comms this morning after he disappeared down a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/morsels">Morsels</a> reviewing hole, I don’t know whether he played that on a PC or console. Or, indeed, if any of us will ever see him again.</p>

But despite stepping up to save the world — and collapsing in the process — Desmond's death scene apparently only clicked with North after he checked Twitter following the game's launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That technically was Desmond's death scene, and I didn't know it," North told <a href="https://youtu.be/eEipR4kRQIE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fall Damage</a>. "I found out on Twitter. 'Are you upset Desmond's dead?' And I'm thinking, what? Because there's no 'Argh!' There's nothing that you'd expect from a main character's death, although the good people at Ubisoft have told me that he's not technically dead."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, North is likely referring to the ending of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>, where the actor returned to the franchise as a mysterious character named The Reader. Valhalla makes it pretty clear that The Reader is Desmond — or his consciousness which now lives on inside the Animus, at least. And, seemingly, Ubisoft has confirmed this to North.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Desmond's death (or his physical body's demise, at any rate) came as a surprise to some fans who'd followed the character since the franchise's origins. But Ubisoft developers have said that as the Assassin's Creed series grew in scope, each game began to struggle to onboard new players. Following the end of Desmond's arc, the series experimented with other ideas for its modern day sections, and currently pushes players directly into the historical action instead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the original idea was eight or nine games with Desmond," North continued, referencing Ubisoft's ever-changing original plans for the Assassin's Creed series, "but, as it so often goes in the entertainment industry, different developers, different creative directors come in, and they have their own way of continuing the story — and it's done very, very well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was very sad to step away from the role of Desmond," he concluded, "because Assassin's Creed is one of my favorite stories I've ever been part of."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A recent report suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stop-removing-the-modern-day-assassins-creed-fans-react-as-black-flag-remake-reportedly-cuts-everything-outside-the-animus">Ubisoft was planning to remove the modern day section from its widely-rumored Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake</a>, and bolster the game's historical sections instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Over the summer, reports came to light that Subnautica 2's early access release was delayed to 2026 just months before Krafton was due to pay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus"><u>a $250 million bonus to the development team</u></a> "against the wishes of the studio’s former leadership."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/krafton-responds-to-ex-subnautica-2-leads-lawsuit-saying-they-resorted-to-litigation-to-demand-a-payday-they-havent-earned"><u>Krafton issued a response to the lawsuit filed by former leads of Subnautica 2</u></a>, Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, offering rebuttals to the developers' claims and alleging they "resorted to litigation to demand a multimillion-dollar payout they haven't earned." Then, last month, Unknown Worlds itself sued its founders Cleveland, former CEO Ted Gill, and studio co-founder Max McGuire for allegedly stealing game design files shortly before they were fired. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in new legal <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/950200391/Public-Version-Plaintiff-s-Pre-Trial-Brief" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>paperwork</u></a>, the founders allege Krafton CEO CH Kim and Unknown Worlds newly-appointed CFO Richard Yoon discussed a potential takeover over Slack, and allegedly used ChatGPT for ideas on how to get out of paying the bonus, and set up a "secret task force" to take over the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the lead-up to this decision, Krafton CEO CH Kim had become frustrated with the contract Krafton signed to acquire Unknown Worlds. From his seat, it had become a bad deal for Krafton — one 'under which [Krafton] can only be dragged around,'" the filing states.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Krafton created a secret task force called 'Project X' whose mandate was simple: either make a 'deal' with the Founders on the 'earnout' or execute a 'Take Over' of Unknown Worlds. When the Founders refused to accede to Krafton’s demands, Krafton pulled the trigger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> "[Maria Park, Krafton's global head of corporate development] told Kim that ‘it seems to be highly likely that the earn-out will still be paid if the sales goal is achieved regardless of the dismissal with cause,'” the new filing adds. “Kim turned to artificial intelligence to help him brainstorm ways to avoid paying the earnout. ChatGPT likewise advised that it would be ‘difficult to cancel the earn-out.'” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cofounders allege that Krafton refused to "produce the ChatGPT conversations," later claiming "they no longer exist.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The filing also seeks to bolster Unknown Worlds' claims that Subnautica 2 was indeed ready for its planned soft launch, stating that Unknown Worlds’ playtest data, presented to Krafton in May, "showed that the game met players’ expectations." Furthermore, Krafton’s "own internal expert declared that the planned 2025 release would be best (and that firing Ted Gill would result in a multi-year development delay)," and Maria Park wrote "the game was ready for an August launch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement to press, Krafton said: "There is nothing more important to us than ensuring the players get the best possible experience. We are looking forward to highlighting that all of our decisions have been focused on ensuring Subnautica 2 exceeds the high expectations that come from our players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were forced to make a change when the former leaders showed little interest in the development of Subnautica 2, which has always been our top priority. Now, this trial comes down to plaintiffs asking to be restored to jobs they were not doing, said they had no interest in doing, and had previously declined requests that they come back and do those jobs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game to Subnautica’s fans."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Subnautica 2 itself? Developer Unknown Worlds recently shared <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-legal-drama-over-250-million-bonus-new-developer-vlog-shows-work-on-subnautica-2-continues"><u>a behind-the-scenes look at an all-new deep-sea predator</u></a>, and "how the team has used Unreal Engine 5 AI for lifelike behavior, real-time reactions and tense encounters for player."

"I was informed that I will be given the Gayming Icon Award for all my work in LGBT+ issues over my career," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/burgerbecky.bsky.social/post/3lshnxmeo5k2h">Heineman wrote earlier this year</a>. "I'm deeply humbled at getting this news. I'm very happy and honored!"</p>
<p>Heineman also recently recalled how she'd <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/burgerbecky.bsky.social/post/3m5cfon7ajk24">won the National Atari 2600 Space Invaders Championship</a>, 45 years ago.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Rebecca, and thank you for all you've done.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, from developer Sandfall Interactive, has become the most nominated game in The Game Awards history, with a total 12 nominations to its name this year.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 released back in April, to widespread praise across the industry. It is now rounding out a monumental year with those 12 Game Award nominations, including Game of the Year and best performance nods for Ben Starr, Charlie Cox and Jennifer English.</p>

<p>Sharing word of its nominations, <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1990472251544633613?s=20">the Clair Obscur team wrote</a>: "What a privilege to be nominated, not only for 2025 GAME OF THE YEAR, but also TWELVE??!! TOTAL NOMINATIONS</p>
<p>"There are so many deserving, precious games from this year, and to be nominated among them makes us SO SO very whee... THANK YOU!!"</p>
<p>Earlier this year, nominated actor Charlie Cox - who voiced Gustave in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - said that even though the game has been met with critical acclaim, he personally feels "like a total fraud". Why? Because it turns out that the actor recorded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/daredevils-charlie-cox-feels-like-a-total-fraud-following-clair-obscur-expedition-33-praise">most of his lines in only about four hours as part of a voice over gig set up by his agent</a>. </p>

			<p>Rockstar Games is reportedly testing the possibility of bringing Grand Theft Auto VI to the Nintendo Switch 2, according to a reliable leaker.</p>



<p>Speaking on X, well-known leaker <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2">Nate the Hate</a>, who has proved to be extremely reliable in the past, commented on rumors saying that the next entry in the series is coming to Nintendo's current generation console, saying that an effort has been made by Rockstar Games to see if they can bring the game to the platform. The current state of this effort, however, remains unknown.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I said a while ago that R* was doing tests to bring it to Switch 2; but tests don't always equal release. I know an effort has been made to see if they can bring it to the platform. I don't know the current state of that effort.</p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990491837182980193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Rockstar Games exploring if Grand Theft Auto VI could be launched on Nintendo Switch 2, however, is not a guarantee that the game will indeed launch on the platform. In a second message, Nate the Hate added that experimenting doesn't mean the game is in development, as this is a standard procedure among developers to determine if a game is possible on any given platform.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Experimenting doesn't equal "in development" &amp; companies often test to see if a game is possible on hardware.</p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990546725535429023?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>Given the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">limited footage of Grand Theft Auto VI in action</a>, it is challenging to gauge how much it will push the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. The two trailers released so far, however, suggest <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/">the game will only target 30 FPS on both systems</a>, which would be a strong indication of how the new entry in the series could be pushing current-generation systems to their limits. With the game reportedly being <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-is-likely-to-be-unmatched-for-almost-two-decades/">so ambitious that it will be unmatched by other titles for decades</a>, featuring <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-patents-revolutionize-open-world-forever/">advanced simulation systems </a>that would be very taxing on the system's weak CPU, and the use of ray tracing, the outlook for a Nintendo Switch 2 port is looking dire.</p>



<p>Still, while the Nintendo Switch 2 isn't as powerful as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S, the system does have a few aces up its sleeve. The system has more available RAM than the Xbox Series S, which would definitely help Rockstar Games port over the Xbox Series S version, albeit with the obvious downgrades it will have compared to the other versions of the game. And most importantly, the Nintendo Switch 2 supports NVIDIA DLSS, which has already been utilized effectively in games such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-surpassing-xbox-series-s/">Street Fighter 6</a> to deliver exceptional experiences. </p>



<p>Given the complexity of all open-world games and what seems an already-strained performance on current-gen systems, a Nintendo Switch 2 port of Grand Theft Auto VI would undoubtedly be a challenging, yet potentially impressive, technical achievement. We will have to wait until late 2026 for <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">the game's initial release</a> to see if a port is truly feasible.</p>

            <p>Interplay co-founder and veteran game designer Rebecca Heineman has died at the age of 62 following a cancer diagnosis earlier this year. The news has been shared on social media by numerous friends and former colleagues of Heineman, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmcd.bsky.social/post/3m5u7i37gns2u">Heidi McDonald</a> and Brian Fargo, while the latest post to a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebecca-ann-heineman-fight-aggressive-cancer">GoFundMe</a> the developer set up to raise funds for treatment says that page's funds will now go towards Heineman's family making funeral arrangements.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It’s time," reads the latest update to the developer's GoFundMe page. "According to my doctors. All further treatments are pointless. So, please donate so my kids can create a funeral worthy of my keyboard, Pixelbreaker! So I can make a worthy entrance for reuniting with my one true love, Jennell Jaquays. My daughter Cynthia Elizabeth Heineman, will be making the arrangements."</p>
<p>Heineman has also posted a "last toast" message to BlueSky and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRLMgemDqbX/">Instagram</a>, which references her wife Jennell Jaquays, who <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/jennell-jaquays-legendary-designer-who-shaped-both-tabletop-and-videogames-has-died/">died in January 2024</a> of complications caused by Guillain–Barré syndrome: "Valhalla really really reeked of beer, but Jennell seems happy. The other angels are tired of me saying "fight for the other users" while throwing my halo around. I leave it up to you to go to lindken.com and look up Jennell Jaquays, now look at her job description, goddess of technology...and fuck cancer, fuck it in the ass."</p>

</span></p><p>Heineman won the Space Invaders US national championship in 1980, before going on to co-found Interplay in 1983, alongside fellow developers Brian Fargo, Jay Patel and Troy Worrell. That studio developed and/or published the opening works in several foundational series in PC gaming with the first two Fallouts and Baldur's Gates, alongside an array of other classic games. While at Interplay, Heineman designed and programmed games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bards-tale">The Bard's Tale</a> 3: Thief of Fate and Dragon Wars, before going on to found or co-found Logicware, Contraband Entertainment, and Olde Sküül.</p>
<p>A transgender woman, Heineman received a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL32W5ps7t1/">Gayming Icon award</a> from <a href="https://gaymingmag.com/awards/">Gayming Magazine</a> in 2025, with the site writing: "Her advocacy for LGBTQ+ inclusion, accessibility, and diversity in tech has inspired countless developers and players."</p>
<p>"Known her since the 80s when I'd drive her to work, one of the most brilliant programmers around," fellow Interplay co-founder Fargo wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/BrianFargo/status/1990561629080277499">tribute post</a>. "A real gut punch earlier today when she messaged me: 'We have gone on so many adventures together! But, into the great unknown! I go first!!!'."</p>
<p>Thanks to Heineman for all of her contributions to the medium and all the best to those she leaves behind.</p>

Each plushie--SpongeBob, Patrick, Plankton, and Sandy--has a cubic shape that will make them easier for the claw to grasp, and there are also six plastic prize capsule toys included here. Arcade1Up says the machine will offer three distinct modes of play, ranging from Easy Mode for kids or beginners to Normal Mode for a balanced challenge. Or if you feel like a dose of reality, Scam Mode will put your skills to the test.</p><p>The cabinet also features a light-up marquee, glowing control buttons, and an internal ceiling light alongside various images of SpongeBob and the main cast of the long-running cartoon series. The full cabinet measures over five feet tall, so you'll want to make certain you have some space at home for it.</p></div>                      </div><p>This isn't the first time that Arcade1Up has produced a claw machine, and if you'd like one that doesn't feature SpongeBob gleefully staring at you, you can grab a unit for $550 through Amazon. While you don't get any plushie toys included with it, it does have a more retro-inspired design, and it comes with 12 plastic capsules that you can add prizes to. Like the SpongeBob machine, you can set it to Easy, Normal, or Scam modes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4605769-rcade-claw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4605769" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4605769-rcade-claw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4605769"></a><figcaption>Arcade1Up Claw Machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4605769-rcade-claw.jpg"></figure><p>SpongeBob fans looking to revisit Bikini Bottom can also preorder <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKVQ3PR3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide</a> ahead of its release on November 18 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X, Switch 2, and PC.

			<p>Konami’s latest punt at reviving <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-online">Metal Gear Online</a> marks one of the publisher’s best multiplayer offerings to date, but its timing couldn’t be worse. Released as a free update for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> on October 30th, some two months after the base game’s launch, Fox Hunt has found itself wedged between military shooter sequels <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. As if that wasn’t enough to contend with, it’s also going up against the unstoppable <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a> which has taken the online gaming space by storm.</p>
<p><iframe title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - FOX HUNT Trailer | KONAMI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c46xM5-wScg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fox Hunt may be the underdog, but when it comes to MGS multiplayer, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/konami">Konami</a> couldn’t have set the bar any lower with 2018’s simply awful Metal Gear Survive. Not only does it easily surpass the company’s previous attempt to do something new with the Metal Gear franchise, Fox Hunt is a surprising stroke of genius that takes elements of the Snake Eater remake to craft a fun and fast spin on the now matured battle royale formula.</p>


<p>Konami has done very little to attract attention to this new mode and even during Fox Hunt’s initial onboarding, the developers don’t do a great job at succinctly explaining what the deal is. So, here’s a quick breakdown.</p>
<p>Each match features 12 players – 6 pairs – who will drop into one of two scenarios. In Survival Capture teams will scour the map for frog-like “Kerotan” figures, making sure both players are each holding onto one when the round timer expires. The winning team will advance to the next round, where the number of figures is reduced, until one pair of players wins.</p>


<p>Survival Intrude uses the same round-based formula, populating the map with duck-like “GA-KO” figures instead. Shooting one of these will create a zone that you and your partner will need to defend until the clock counts down. The further you advance, the fewer capture points become available, inevitably leading to a final showdown.</p>
<p>Despite their preoccupation with cutesy collectable figures, both modes work surprisingly well when paired with the spruced up stealth action gameplay of MGS Delta. Snake Eater’s OSP (on-site procurement) doctrine is a natural fit for the battle royale or extraction shooter formats, dropping players into each match completely naked, forcing them to scramble for weapons and equipment. If you happen to spawn next to an enemy team, that first minute or so will be a desperate struggle to see who can bust open a supply crate first, using whatever gear inside to repel the attackers.</p>

<p>While it’s possible to scour the map for more crates until you’ve refined the perfect loadout (complete with body armour, upgrade kits, and health/stamina consumables) you’ll also need to keep an eye on the countdown clock. Clever operatives will lock down an objective in good time, fortifying themselves using natural terrain and Fox Hunt’s smart new gadget: AT-Camo.</p>
<p>Think of this as a goofier version of Old Snake’s OctoCamo suit from Metal Gear Solid 4. Wherever you are, you can pop open a radial menu and select from a variety of equipped patterns such as rubble, grass, or bark. Doing so will daub your character in a bulky disguise with the intention of blending in with your surroundings. If you happen to have the right the camouflage you will be almost impossible to see from a distance, though all players can temporarily activate a kind of six sense that will give a rough indicator of which direction other operatives are located.</p>
<p>Fox Hunt’s gunplay is lifted directly from the Snake Eater remake, allowing you to seamlessly switch between third and first person perspective (while aiming). It’s sharp and responsive though not everyone will be a fan of how it pairs with Metal Gear’s character movement which can feel janky and a bit cumbersome. With that said, after a few rounds, it should start to feel natural and you’ll quickly learn how to make the most of your surrounding terrain and the ample cover it provides.</p>

<p>Compared to other shooters, the “time to kill” or “TTK” here is fairly generous, especially if you happen to scavenge some body armour. This helps add some longevity to firefights, and puts more emphasis on positioning and strategic use of equipment rather than favouring whichever players wield the most firepower. With that said, well-placed headshots can still strike down unsuspecting operatives with a “drop shot” damage bonus given when shooting someone as they open a crate or use items such as meds or rations.</p>
<p>On the subject of longevity, Fox Hunt features a progression system that feels both genuinely rewarding and problematic at the same time. As you play, you’ll earn in-game currency that can then be spent on loot boxes (remember those?) stuffed with various unlocks. While some of these are purely cosmetic – such as radio callouts, emotes, and playercards – others will reward you with valuable in-game buffs when you duplicate them. For example, AT-Camo suits can come equipped with perks such as silent movement or even a bonus luck rate when opening supply crates. Meanwhile, stacking duplicate character skins will increase their life regeneration and stamina recovery.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, players have a chance at unlocking some pretty effective augmentations that can help give them the upper hand. While it sounds bad, this is pretty much the case for most online shooters with the likes of Call of Duty and Battlefield reserving the best weapons, perks, and gear for higher level players. You might even argue that Fox Hunt’s random box system is fairer, giving anyone the chance to unlock loadout options they would typically need to grind for. And before anyone asks if it’s pay-to-win, there is no in-game cash shop or microtransactions. We hope it stays that way, Konami.</p>
<p>Although it’s on a much smaller scale than most live service titles, Fox Hunt’s ongoing success will also depend on meaningful post-launch support. With only two modes and a handful of maps, it would be a shame for Konami to let this little gem fade away without presenting its players with some kind of roadmap.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt multiplayer mode rounds off one of the best remakes of 2025. It offers a surprisingly robust spin on existing battle royale and extraction shooter concepts, with smaller maps and match times working in its favour, successfully incorporating those stealth and strategy elements fans have come to expect.	</p></div>

			<p>The massive Battlefield 6 1.2.2.0 title update has gone live today on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, introducing new content and over 160 fixes, including the restoration of Aim Assist to its popular Open Beta tuning.</p>



<p>The new title update marks the beginning of the second phase of the game's first season, with the introduction of the new Eastwood map, a map with a South California theme whose variations are available for all official modes. </p>



<p>The new map is accompanied by new weapons - the DB-12 Shotgun and M357 Trait Sidearm - and support for a new feature called Battle Pickups. This feature will provide players with powerful weapons in specific experiences that offer limited ammo but massive firepower when it becomes available shortly.</p>



<p>Besides introducing new content, the new Battlefield 6 title update also brings some significant changes to Aim Assist, resetting it back to its Open Beta tuning. The changes made to the feature for the final version of the game were among the most controversial, so it being back to the Open Beta state will make more than a few players happy.</p>



<p>The changes to Aim Assist are only one of the over 160 changes featured in the new Battlefield 6 title update, which also include improved input latency and stick response for controllers, weapon accuracy tuning, major polishing for select gadgets, vehicles, maps, and modes fixes, and more. You can learn more about every change the new title update brings in the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-2-0">official update notes.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launched last month on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, and it's a definite improvement over its immediate predecessors.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Strauss Zelnick, who has been the CEO, chairman, and largest stakeholder of Take-Two since 2007, appeared yesterday <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Squawk Box</a>, CNBC's business news program that airs weekdays from 6 to 9 AM Eastern Time.</p>



<p>During the conversation, the veteran executive of what will soon be the largest independent American publisher (once the Electronic Arts leveraged buyout goes through) said that the gaming industry is moving toward PCs and more generally toward open ecosystems, although the console experience isn't really going away.</p>



<p><em>I think it’s moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed. But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen — that’s never going away.</em></p>



<p>The Take-Two executive isn't wrong. The console market has long stagnated, and its three big players, Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, are only really stealing each other's customers rather than gaining new ones. On the other hand, PC gaming continues to grow, as evidenced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-already-generated-sales-for-16-billion-this-year-gabe-newell-gets-superyacht/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam's record-breaking sales</a>. Moreover, new PC-based devices with a handheld or home console format, such as the Steam Deck, the ROG Ally, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-70-gaming-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Steam Machine</a>, are being produced, thus potentially stealing market share from regular console manufacturers.</p>



<p>For its part, Microsoft is also shifting the way it thinks about consoles. While Xbox president Sarah Bond has just reiterated that the Xbox experience starts with the traditional console, rumors point to the next-generation hardware being a sort of console-PC hybrid that might also offer access to a Windows desktop environment.</p>



<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-largest-gaming-publisher-want-to-be-everywhere-competition-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a slight hint late last month</a> at the company innovating in that space:</p>



<p><em>We also want to do innovative work on the system side on the console and on the PC. It's kind of funny that people think about the console and PC as two different things. At Microsoft, we built the console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for games. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom. But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled. It delivers performance that's unparalleled that pushes I think the system forward.</em></p>

            <p>The touring <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/in/en/concert">Witcher in Concert</a> musical performance was a resounding enough success that CD Projekt Red has announced a second tour for Europe next year.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I watched The Witcher in Concert in London earlier this month and was very impressed. A 14-piece ensemble played through the music of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> (plus expansions) all while a specially cut montage of game moments - divided into chapters - played on a projected screen above.</p>
<p>More excitingly, perhaps, the ensemble included Polish folk metal band Percival, which co-composed the music in the game. It's their almost guttural singing and discordant-sounding harmonies that provide The Witcher 3 with such a distinctive sound. It's a rousing performance.</p>

<p>There will also be an Asian tour next year though no details are available for it yet.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3 turned 10 years old this year - a milestone anniversary the Witcher in Concert tour was created to celebrate - and a lot has happened in that time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> was built and released, which brought all kinds of challenges to be overcome. A decade later, the studio is returning to The Witcher world with brand new instalment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. And I thought this anniversary would be a good time to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-worked-in-the-witcher-3-and-what-didnt-looking-back-on-a-landmark-rpg-with-cd-projekt-red">look back on The Witcher 3 with the studio, at what it got wrong, and what it got right</a>.</p>

                <p>More than 12 years ago, Steam creator Valve attempted to usurp Microsoft's hold on PC gaming by introducing the first Steam Machine. The reliance on Linux and a loose hold on OEM hardware specifications ultimately led to its failure, but Valve is finally in a position to give it a better shot. The new Steam Machine is a compact, powerful PC designed for desks, living rooms, and more, leveraging all of the lessons Valve has learnt with its hugely successful Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">We're rounding up everything we know about Valve's ambitious push into living room gaming, including confirmed specifications, its release window, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">potential pricing</a>, and more. Keep checking for more as we update this post with any new information that Valve shares leading up to the Steam Machine's imminent release in 2026.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><ul><li><a href="#Steam_Machine_Release_Date">Steam Machine Release Date</a><ul><li><a href="#Steam_Machine_Price">Steam Machine Price</a></li></ul></li></ul><li><a href="#Steam_Machine_Specifications_">Steam Machine Specifications </a><ul><li><a href="#Steam_Machine_Peripherals">Steam Machine Peripherals</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h4 dir="ltr" id="Steam_Machine_Release_Date">Steam Machine Release Date</h4><p dir="ltr">The Steam Machine will be released in Q1 2026. Valve announced a trio of new hardware at once, but also didn't provide a firm release date for the new Steam Machine, Steam Controller, and Steam Frame VR headset. Instead, it provided a vague release window of "Early 2026," with further clarification limiting this to Q1 of 2026. That means you can expect the Steam Machine to go on sale no later than 31 March 2026, unless Valve runs into unforeseen delays.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="Steam_Machine_Price">Steam Machine Price</h4><p dir="ltr">Another crucial detail missing from Valve's Steam Machine announcement was its price. The Steam Machine is a PC, and not strictly a console in the traditional sense, which might mean it will be priced higher than expected. That's backed up by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">statements made by Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat</a> who tempered expectations by reaffirming that the Steam Machine is competing with other similarly powered PCs on the market.</p><p dir="ltr">Analysts have predicted a price between $400-$500, saying that the lower end of that range would be the "sweet spot" that would put pressure on the likes of Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X. Valve still sells the SteamOS-powered Steam Deck, starting at $400 for the base LCD model and rising all the way up to $650 for the 1TB OLED model.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Steam_Machine_Specifications_"><span>Steam Machine Specifications</span></h2><p dir="ltr">While its price and release date are still a mystery, Valve was far more open with regards to what you're getting with each Steam Machine. The small form factor PC will be sold with two storage options to choose from–namely 256GB and 2TB–while also offering an easy way to install new, larger SSDs in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the storage, each Steam Machine will be identical. It's equipped with a capable AMD Zen CPU, featuring 6 cores and 12 threads with a maximum boost clock speed of 4.8GHz. That's paired with 16GB of DDR5 memory via SODIMM modules, which Valve also says will be accessible for upgrades down the line. Unlike modern consoles, the Steam Machine isn't going with an APU approach, instead settling on a dedicated GPU that is soldered onto the same board as the CPU. This is a AMD RDNA 3 GPU with 28 compute units and 8GB of GDDR5 memory, with many noting that it closely matches the specifications of the AMD RX 7600 from a few years ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the Steam Deck, the Steam Machine will run Valve's impressive SteamOS--a heavily modified version of Linux Arch which turns the operating system into an easy-to-use version of Steam Big Picture mode. While primarily configured for use with Steam, SteamOS still lets users boot into a desktop version of Linux, letting you configure other storefronts (like the Epic Games Store, GOG, and others) as well as install anything from emulators to word processors. It is a PC, after all.</p><p dir="ltr">You can find the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list of specifications</a> below.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Category</th><th scope="col">Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CPU</td><td><p>Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6C / 12T (up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP)</p></td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td><p>Semi-Custom AMD RDNA3 28CUs (2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP)</p></td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>Internal power supply, AC power 110-240V</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td><p>Two Steam Machine models (512GB and 2TB) NVMe SSD.

While the CPU seems perfectly capable for modern gaming demands, there is some concern with the GPU, specifically with its current memory allocation. Many modern games have had some trouble running well on GPUs with 8GB of VRAM or less, with even the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 offering more bandwidth for game developers (closer to 10GB for each). This limits the Steam Machine when it comes to storing textures in memory, which can become an issue the closer you try and push this towards 4K/ 60FPS gaming that Valve says its PC is capable of.</p><p dir="ltr">That is caveated with the use of AI-upscaling techniques, specifically AMD's FSR 3 given the GPU limitation of the RDNA 3 architecture over AMD's newer RDNA4. Currently this means that the Steam Machine cannot make use of the better FSR4 upscaling as well as AMD's latest frame generation technology, which would help deliver better higher resolutions experiences. Right now, it seems that Valve is cognizant of the potential price of the Steam Machine and is configuring it appropriately, making its eventual announcement even more crucial to the device's appeal.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="Steam_Machine_Peripherals">Steam Machine Peripherals</h4><p dir="ltr">While the Steam Machine will be compatible with most controllers on the market today, including the Xbox Series controller and PlayStation DualSense, Valve will also be shipping a new version of its Steam Controller with the PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking all of the lessons learnt with the controller configuration of the Steam Deck, the Steam Controller looks almost like Valve just removed the large screen from the middle, squished the two ends together, and called it a day. And that's a great thing--the Steam Deck is incredibly comfortable to hold despite not always looking like it, and the same thing seems to be true for the Steam Controller given early hands-on impressions.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike Valve's previous controller, this new version comes with two thumbsticks in a symmetrical format, powered by new TMR modules that Valve says combine the accuracy of hall-effect technology with even more reliability. Below them are a pair of haptic touchpads which allow you to easily play mouse-based games, as well as map additional functionality to them depending on your needs. The controller comes with motion control support, which can be used with capacitive sensors that activate as you grip the controller. This can be used in a variety of ways, with Valve using gyro aiming (which you can toggle by simply holding the controller) as a common example.</p><p dir="ltr">The controller also features new, higher-definition rumble motors for improved vibrations over the Steam Deck, as well as the same analogue triggers and four programmable grip buttons on the back. The controller connects to the Steam Machine, or any other desktop, using a proprietary puck for the fastest and most stable connection. The puck features pogo pin capabilities too, letting you set your Steam Controller onto it for easy charging. The Steam Controller can connect via Bluetooth or wired connections too for more flexibility.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve says that it will bundle the Steam Controller with the Steam Machine at launch, and also offer the controller to purchase separately.

			<p>The game Silent Hill Townfall may be launching in just four months, according to a Mexican retailer. The store in question is called Liverpool Mexico, and no, that's not a mistake: it's a chain of department stores founded in 1847 by Jean Baptiste Ebrard. Originally, most of its goods were imported from Liverpool to Mexico, hence the name.</p>



<p>Anyway, as <a href="https://cdaction.pl/newsy/silent-hill-townfall-z-nieodlegla-premiera-meksykanski-sklep-potwierdza-plotki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by the Polish website CD Action</a>, the store briefly listed the game for March 26, 2026. That's certainly not an usual placeholder date, which made fans suspicious. After the news started circulating on the Web, the retailer quickly <a href="https://www.liverpool.com.mx/tienda/pdp/silent-hill-townfall-estandar-para-ps5/1185330351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed the listing</a>, prompting speculation that the game publisher (Annapurna Interactive) had reached out to ensure the information wouldn't spread ahead of time.</p>



<p>The most likely scenario is that Liverpool Mexico jumped the gun on publishing the game page before it actually received the green light from the proper channels. When it comes to the timeline, the launch date makes sense. Silent Hill Townfall was one of the games that KONAMI <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> in October 2022 to confirm the revival of the beloved survival horror franchise. </p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f have since been released, both receiving praise in their own rights. Townfall is arguably the most risky project, though, since it's a spin-off in development at a studio (Screen Burn, formerly known as No Code) that only ever made adventure games. Nothing has been shared yet; fans were even worried about a potential cancellation last year following Annapurna Interactive's issues, but the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-is-still-in-development-despite-annapurna-interactives-woes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Townfall was still in development.</p>



<p>If the game is really this close to launch, we should probably get official news very soon, probably by the end of the year, with Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards event being the most likely venue for such an announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sarah Bond, who was promoted to the role of Xbox president nearly two years ago, has been featured in a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Fortune Magazine</a>. After a brief introduction about her earlier career outside the games industry (she worked at McKinsey &amp; Company and later at T-Mobile), the conversation switched to her passion for gaming and her work at Microsoft.</p>



<p>The interviewer asked where hardware fits within Xbox's new multiplatform, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sarah-bond-xbox-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything-is-an-Xbox</a> strategy, and Bond said everything starts with the console, adding that the next one will deliver a 'powerful experience'. This aligns with rumors suggesting that the next Xbox hardware <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-performance-9070-xt-xbox-next-rtx-5080-rdna5-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be more powerful than Sony's PlayStation 6</a>.</p>



<p><em>Hardware is absolutely core to everything that we do at Xbox, because we know that our most valuable players, the people who love Xbox, love the hardware experience, and so that is why we are working on our next generation hardware. It's going to be a powerful experience, and one that also enables people to take their library with them, and that's what's really important here as well, is that we know that while people want to play their library absolutely on the console, they also want to be able to play it on PC or stream it around the cloud. And so, the Xbox experience starts with the console, but then gives something to people that they can experience across all screens if they choose to, bringing their library, their community, their identity, and the store with them everywhere they go.</em></p>



<p>Not too long ago, rumors surfaced that Microsoft might be abandoning the console business altogether, following the dwindling sales of the current generation Xbox Series S and X hardware, but Bond <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-is-100-percent-looking-at-making-things-in-the-future-says-president/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped in to confirm</a> that Microsoft is indeed still planning to produce new hardware in the future. </p>



<p>Of course, many gamers at this point wonder what the point is now that all Xbox games are available elsewhere, such as PC, mobile, and even previously rival console platforms. Brand fans used to answer that even without exclusives, Game Pass was too good a deal to pass on. That was true for a long time, but perhaps no more following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">substantial price hike (+50%) for the Ultimate tier</a>, which is now the only one to guarantee access to all first-party games, including the new Call of Duty, on day one.</p>



<p>In the chat with Fortune Magazine, Sarah Bond also briefly talked about Game Pass, clarifying that Xbox's approach is wider than simply reproducing Netflix in the gaming space:</p>



<p><em>People have said that, and I think it's that, but I also think it's more than that. We support every business model. So if you want to subscribe and get access to your library games, you can absolutely do that. If you want to buy your games and build up your own library, you can also do that. It's really about actually giving as much access and choice to people, to not locking into any one model, but letting people actually pick the way they want to consume their games, and also letting developers choose pick the way that they want to monetize their games and reach the most users.</em></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty Black Ops 7: First Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>The Black Ops 7 post, shared at the end of the 3-day launch period, is far more vague with its celebrations. "Across opening weekend, we've seen a great response to the quality and depth of gameplay in Black Ops 7," the post reads, alongside thanking players and developers, and promising "this is only the start," with new content lined up soon.</p><p>Black Ops 7 had big shoes to fill after the success of Black Ops 6, which managed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">set new records</a> for Game Pass sign ups, while still driving a major increase in sales on competing platforms like Steam and PlayStation.</p><p>The latest Call of Duty title has come under fire for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/" data-ref-id="1100-6536232">alleged use of generative AI</a>, with some fans speculating that the distinctive Ghibli-style art for certain Calling Cards had been AI generated. The debate has even seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">US Congressman Ro Khanna</a> use the game as justification to call for greater regulations around the use of generative AI.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">Black Ops 7's multiplayer</a> has generally been well-received, the co-op campaign has mostly been met with criticism. Both disappointing campaign narrative and anger around the use of AI appear to have contributed to players review-bombing the game on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>, leaving Black Ops 7 with a user score of just 1.7. The game also has a "Mixed" review score on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, with only 41% positive reviews.</p><p>Outside of the game's own struggles, Black Ops 7 has also launched into an exceptionally competitive year for large-scale shooters. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> continues to go strong after its October launch, while Embark Studios' new extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> also hit a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-hits-480000-active-players-on-steam-quadruple-cods-launch-weekend-peak/1100-6536262/" data-ref-id="1100-6536262">new concurrent player peak over the weekend</a>, with the release of its first major update no-doubt eating some of CoD's player base.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Five months ago, Hypixel <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the studio was shutting down, which also meant the end of the long-awaited game project Hytale. Riot Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired</a> the developer and the project in April 2020 and reportedly requested a change in game engine, which caused numerous problems.</p>



<p>Now, however, Simon "Hypixel" Collins-Laflamme has surprised fans with the news that he has regained the rights from Riot Games and that Hytale will return to its original 'Legacy' engine and vision. The reason for that, according to Collins-Laflamme, is that the new 'Cross-platform' engine is significantly behind when it comes to gameplay features and would take at least two years to get to the same point as the original engine. This made the decision for the studio, which, however, still plans to make the Legacy engine cross-platform compatible at a later time, thus opening up compatibility beyond PC.</p>



<p>For now, Collins-Laflamme has already rehired over thirty developers from the Hypixel team, with more expected to return soon. The early access date will be announced soon and is likely to be relatively close, although the creator has warned that it will be a true early access release, with crashes, bugs, and broken features to be expected. It will be a long road to version 1.0, too, estimated to be 'at least a few years' away.</p>



<p>In its current state, Hytale already features over 100 NPCs and thousands of items and blocks, but many of these are not yet properly configured. The Adventure Mode won't be ready at the early access launch, and the same goes for the official minigames. The team is aware that these were an important part of the original Hytale vision, but the infrastructure and minigames are not yet ready. However, they have a dedicated team that will focus on implementing minigames once the core game is stable.  In the meantime, the community can start creating their own minigames, custom servers, and experiences. When the official minigames go live, their assets will also be shared, allowing the community to develop their own versions. </p>



<p>Indeed, Hytale will be all about modding from the very beginning. Collins-Flamme says it is possible to mod almost everything, both content and server-side, and claims that even non-developers can create impressive experiences with minimal technical knowledge. The development team promised to share server source code access within several months, allowing users to create their own custom servers, maps, adventures, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GSC Game World has once again proven it’s dedicated to the ongoing support of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, released almost one year ago. The open-world, (almost) post-apocalyptic shooter turned heads when it dropped on November 20 last year, and in the most recent update pushed out by the team, it has evolved once again.</p>



<p>The latest update, ‘Expedition’, introduces hundreds of bug fixes and stacks of new additions, improvements, and upgrades across the board, impacting everything from AI and controller handling to UI and player character behavior.</p>







<h2 id="h-stalker-2-patch-1-7-notes">STALKER 2 Patch 1.7 Notes</h2>



<p>STALKER 2 is set to be released on PlayStation 5 on November 20, which is probably why GSC Game World has issued such a massive update to the game in the 1.7 patch.</p>



<p>The team has boosted A-Life, the in-game AI system, to allow for territory control mechanics and faction battles. There’s a new ‘Master’ difficulty rating, as well as an Expedition Mode that offers a new level of immersion. When paired with the new ‘Immersive Mode’ that serves as a replacement for a traditional photo mode, things get seriously engaging.</p>



<p>NPC vision and combat mechanics have had a major overhaul, making stealth more viable, and the game’s UI has been upgraded to make certain stats easier to understand. Skif, the player character, can adopt new ‘conditions’ based on the consumption of certain drinks, and two new anomalies pose threats in the game’s open world.</p>



<p>Controller players have had their aim assist features buffed, DualSense support has been added (of course), and, as I mentioned, <strong>hundreds</strong> of bug fixes have been applied.</p>



<p>Here they are.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lqgend-has-officially-joined-vancouver-surge-in-the-call-of-duty-league.1356514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Lqgend, who was most recently an active competitor in Halo esports and ascended to win the Halo World Championship in 2024 with Spacestation, has officially merged into the Call of Duty League. He follows a transitional path that <strong>many </strong>other CDL competitors have, but it has been a very long time since a Halo world champion wound up in the top-tier Call of Duty esports space.</p>



<p>One of the most notable competitors to walk that path before Lqgend was Shotzzy, OpTic Texas’ frontman and one of just two esports pro players in history to win a world championship title in <strong>two games</strong>.</p>



<p>Will Lqgend be the third?</p>



<h2 id="h-from-sci-fi-to-sci-fi">From Sci-fi to Sci-fi</h2>



<p>It’s an appropriate time for Lqgend to merge into the Call of Duty League, given that the 2026 season will play out on Black Ops 7, a near-future game with some Halo-like mechanics. It’s a natural transition, and in recent weeks, Lqgend has already proven his Call of Duty talent in scrims and streams.</p>



<p>The 22-year-old French player has enjoyed a rapid rise to fame in the Halo space, but now that Halo Infinite’s esports structure has all but finished, he’s ready to make that all-important move.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The all-new Surge roster was uncovered hours ago, and it contains mostly young and fresh players keen on cutting their teeth in the Call of Duty League this coming season.</p>



<p>Last season, Vancouver Surge had a stunning run, but couldn’t close out a tournament. The team wound up in second place numerous times, including at the Call of Duty League Championship in Canada, falling in second against a dominant OpTic Texas.</p>



<p>Do you think Lqgend will go far in the Call of Duty League? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>T1 Esports has confirmed the departure of Lee ‘Gumayusi’ Min-hyeong, closing the book on a seven-year chapter that saw the team secure three consecutive League of Legends World Championship titles, including the 2025 win that came mere days ago.</p>



<p>While Choi ‘Zeus’ Woo-je’s controversial exit in 2024 left T1 fans stunned, Gumayusi’s decision to depart feels different, given that it has come very early in the off-season and coincides with the expiration of his contract with T1.</p>



<h2 id="h-gumayusi-goes-into-the-open">Gumayusi Goes Into the Open</h2>



<p>T1’s recent announcement regarding Gumayusi’s departure from the roster was loaded with gratitude and respect for all the player has given the organization over the last few years. It was confirmed that the choice to leave the team was ‘his alone.’</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="ko" dir="ltr"><p>𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐲𝐨𝐮, 𝐆𝐮𝐦𝐚𝐲𝐮𝐬𝐢</p><p>'Gumayusi' 이민형 선수가 T1을 떠나 새로운 도전을 시작하게 되었습니다.<br>함께한 시간 동안 들어 올린 트로피와 'Gumayusi' 선수가 남긴 발자취는 팀과 팬들의 마음에 오래도록 빛날 것입니다.<br>T1은 'Gumayusi' 선수의 헌신과 희생, 그리고 눈부신 활약에 대해… <a href="https://t.co/zhiC6v7Qqu">pic.twitter.com/zhiC6v7Qqu</a></p></div>— T1 LoL (@T1LoL) <a href="https://twitter.com/T1LoL/status/1990389461771816974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Despite his MVP-winning performance at Worlds 2025, Gumayusi had a trying 2025 leading up to the monumental win. Earlier this season, the competitor was <strong>benched</strong>, and T1 only just managed to scrape up a qualification to Worlds. The tough year and cracks showing in the foundations might have pushed Gumayusi to seek pastures new.</p>



<p>Speculation is now swirling like wildfire in the League of Legends esports space. Gumayusi’s next home could be under the Hanwha Life banner, or it could be assuming a spot with Gen.G’s roster, changes pending.</p>



<p>In social circles, rumors have already begun circulating about Gumayusi’s replacement. T1 appears to be wasting no time in filling that spot, and suggestions have emerged that Kim ‘Peyz’ Su-hwan could join the squad in place of Gumayusi.</p>



<p>Wherever he winds up, Gumayusi will be an asset to every roster he sits within.</p>



<p>Where do you think Gumayusi is headed? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what your pick would be.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rebecca-heineman-passed-away-interplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rebecca-heineman-co-founder-of-interplay-has-passed-away.1356505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Yesterday, the unfortunate news broke that Rebecca Heineman, co-founder of Interplay, Logicware, Contraband Entertainment, and Olde Sküül, and the first national United States esports champion, had passed away. Following a battle with aggressive lung cancer, Heineman was recently hospitalized and given days to live.</p>



<p>As a pioneer in the games industry for women in development, video game archival, and lifetime creator of some of the most influential video games, Heineman leaves behind a stunning legacy.</p>







<h2 id="h-generational-run">Generational Run</h2>



<p>In 1980, Rebecca Heineman traveled to Los Angeles to attend an enormous Space Invaders championship event, hosted on the Atari 2600. Not expecting to get anywhere close to the top spot, Heinemen unexpectedly won the entire event, going on to later win a second championship in New York.</p>



<p>That made Heineman the United States’ first national esports champion.</p>



<p>As young as 16, Heineman was diving deep into coding, creating games and software at a time when concepts were just being framed. She co-founded Interplay Productions in 1983, a legendary studio that would go on to create Baldur’s Gate, The Bard’s Tale, Wasteland, and, probably most importantly, <strong>Fallout</strong>.</p>



<p>Heineman was rumored to be one of the last people in possession of the source code for the original Fallout game, released in 1997.</p>



<p>Her career took her through some of the most prolific companies in gaming, from Electronic Arts and Ubisoft to Microsoft and Sony, and she was a stalwart advocate for LGBTQ+ representation in the industry.</p>



<p>In a post on a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebecca-ann-heineman-fight-aggressive-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GoFundMe page</a> set up to help with medical costs, Heineman explained her story:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>How did this start? I noticed when I was at PAX prime that I was out of breath climbing a single flight of stairs. When I got back to Dallas, I went to the emergency room and they found I had 2300ml of fluid in my lung cavity (see photos). They drained another 1600ml a week later. After cat scans, X-rays, and blood tests they finally found that the cancer is in my lungs and liver.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yesterday, a final post was shared, along with a last image:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s time. According to my doctors. All further treatments are pointless. So, please donate so my kids can create a funeral worthy of my keyboard, Pixelbreaker! So I can make a worthy entrance for reuniting with my one true love, Jennell Jaquays.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Heineman, who predominantly went by the nickname ‘Burger’ for two decades, leaves behind five children.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-switch-2-claimed-insider/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-6-could-come-to-switch-2-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1356499/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p> In a recent post on social media, a rumor has once again surfaced that Grand Theft Auto 6 could arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 <strong>after </strong>it has launched on other major platforms. This rumor was partially backed up by NateTheHate, who confirmed hearing that Rockstar was ‘doing tests to bring it to Switch 2’.</p>



<p>If Rockstar Games could optimize the hell out of Grand Theft Auto 6, it could be the biggest game to ever land on a Nintendo platform, alongside the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-gta-6-coming-to-switch-2">Is GTA 6 Coming to Switch 2?</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, user ‘Nash Weedle’ published a claim that GTA 6 is actively in the works for Nintendo Switch 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can CONFIRM that a GTA VI port for SWITCH 2 is in the works. I haven’t said much about it; I had to be cautious until now. I can also comment that: – The game’s delay isn’t due to this version. – It doesn’t seem like it will be a launch title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nash has a decent track record when it comes to Nintendo leaks and insider tidbits.</p>



<p>NateTheHate, another notable insider, <a href="https://xcancel.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990491837182980193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was summoned</a> to the post to offer his two cents, and he confirmed that Rockstar Games was at least <strong>testing </strong>bringing GTA 6 to Switch 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I said a while ago that R* was doing tests to bring it to Switch 2; but tests don’t always equal release. I know an effort has been made to see if they can bring it to the platform. I don’t know the current state of that effort.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It wouldn’t be the first Grand Theft Auto game to wind up on a Nintendo platform, but it would by far be the biggest. In recent years, the remastered GTA Trilogy landed on Switch, but Grand Theft Auto 5 always eluded the platform.</p>



<p>It’s believed that GTA 6 could <strong>technically </strong>run on the Switch 2, but with some major performance downgrades, such as a lower frame rate, reduced visual fidelity, and tapered resolution. It certainly wouldn’t offer anything close to the performance of a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X, for example.</p>



<p>If GTA 6 comes to Nintendo Switch 2, could you see yourself buying it? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>This follows the <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1983542094452138164">release of Version 1.3.0</a>, which was released across multiple platforms at the end of last month.</p>
<p>If you haven't already checked out The Ivalice Chronicles, you can read our Switch 2 review here on Nintendo Life. Here's brief summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yes, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles cuts content from the War of the Lions version, and it's a shame. However, put this one issue aside, if you can, and you've got a fantastic — and fantastically thoughtful — revamp otherwise. Meaningful QoL changes meld with delicate gameplay nips and tucks, CPU enemy tune-ups, and a smoother-flowing experience overall to deliver a game that's pretty much impossible to knock."</p>

<p>It's been a <em>huge</em> year for Nintendo so far with the launch of the Switch 2 in June. This has followed with one major first-party release after another, and on top of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> earlier this month, it's now time for some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> racing action.</p>
<p>Since the reveal of this new entry, there have been multiple details shared about it by Nintendo and its legendary game director, Masahiro Sakurai. This includes two Nintendo Direct presentations, and more recently, there have been some Global Test Ride Demos.</p>
<p>Now that everyone has <em>hopefully</em> had some time to try it out, we're curious to know if you'll be jumping back in for the official Switch 2 game release later this week on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>. So, vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-pc-consoles-comments/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-ceo-says-gaming-%E2%80%98is-moving-towards-pcs%E2%80%99.1356451/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In an interview with CNBC, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick had some comments regarding the console/PC debate. In fact, it seems he’s taken a side in the whole debacle.</p>







<p>The divide between PC and console gaming has been a rather long one. Exclusives on one, better quality on the other, it all seems to go back and forth. Take-Two, known for publishing the Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K, has been on both fronts. Every month, it seems the company finds itself on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling list for consoles</a> for its catalog of sports games. While it’ll take a while for the company to see a bigger pay day with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6 delayed</a>, it seems the CEO has some thoughts on the console/PC divide.</p>



<h2 id="h-zelnick-says-business-is-moving-towards-open-to-pc-in-recent-interview">Zelnick Says “Business is Moving Towards Open” to PC in Recent Interview</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick sat down with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC’s Squawk Box</a> for an interview on gaming. While on the topic of console gaming, Zelnick stated,</p>



<p>“<strong>I think it’s moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed</strong>,” says Zelnick. “<strong>But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen — that’s never going away.</strong>”</p>



<p>His comments do come at a convenient time, as Valve announced the upcoming console, the Steam Machine, which can play Steam games on your TV. Similarly, Xbox and Microsoft have veered a bit towards PC gamers, as recent statements from figures in the company indicate a change in tone from consoles. Weirdly, Take-Two’s biggest upcoming release, Grand Theft Auto 6, has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-will-gta-6-release-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not been announced for PC</a>. Its last entry, Grand Theft Auto 5, didn’t see a PC release until two years after launching in 2013. In any case, it seems the company may be gearing to open up with PC gaming more than ever.</p>







<p>What do you think of Zelnick’s comments? Do you think PC is the way to go? Or is console better? Do you think GTA 6 is going to PC? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-liquidates-bose-headphones-at-50-off-now-cheaper-than-mid-range-no-name-models-2000644975</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-liquidates-bose-headphones-at-50-off-now-cheaper-than-mid-range-no-name-models.1356439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bose’s <em>QuietComfort</em> line leads the way for the company in active noise cancellation, and Amazon just dropped the price to an unprecedented record low that makes premium audio accessible to anyone. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">QuietComfort headphones now sell for $169, slashed from the usual $349 (51% off)</a> and provide active noise cancellation and high-fidelity sound for less than half the price of the original.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Noise Cancellation That Works</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation technology suppresses ambient sound incredibly well and creates that quiet bubble when traveling by airplane, train, or working in a noisy office. It suppresses background chitchat, the rumbling of engines and air conditioning humming immediately when Quiet Mode is on so you can just tune in to your music or work without diversion. The system works both through <strong>active electronic cancellation and passive isolation</strong> provided by the plush ear cushions and stops sound within a very wide range of frequencies.</p>
<p>Aware Mode works the opposite way and pipes the ambient sound into your ears with external microphones and enables you to hear your surroundings without removing the headphones. This is useful if you want to hear airport announcements or have quick conversations, or be more attentive to the traffic while walking. Quiet and Aware modes toggle instantly with a button press for seamless control over how much of the outside world you want to let in.</p>



<p>Plush ear cushions softly <strong>encompass your ears in their over-ear design</strong>, rather than pressing hard against them. With even pressure distribution from the memory foam padding, hot spots and discomfort do not develop during extended wear like they can with poorly designed headphones. The padded headband keeps everything secure without pulling tight across the top of your head.</p>
<p>The<strong> 24-hour battery life easily covers multiple days of typical use</strong> without the need for frequent charging. You can take these on weekend trips without packing the charging cable, and commuters easily get through a full work week on a single charge. Then, USB-C fast charging gives you 2.5 hours of playback from just 15 minutes plugged in-perfect for when you forgot to charge overnight and you’ve got to leave soon.</p>



<p><strong>High-fidelity audio reproduction reproduces clear and detailed sound</strong> in all frequency spectra. Bass hits with impact and depth, yet does not overpower the mid or muddy the vocals. Treble stays crisp and present but never gets harsh and fatiguing even on longer listening sessions. The Adjustable EQ in the Bose app lets you customize the sound signature to match your preferences: boost the bass for hip-hop or elevate the treble to make classical music shine.</p>
<p>Multipoint Bluetooth connectivity lets you p<strong>air with two devices at the same time</strong> while switching between them automatically, depending on which one is playing audio. You can watch videos from your laptop and jump right into your phone calls without having to manually disconnect and reconnect. The feature does away with the frustration of juggling multiple devices all day long. Bluetooth range of up to typical home and office distances is covered without dropouts or issues in connectivity.</p>
<p>At $169, you’re paying less than half the original price for flagship Bose noise cancellation, 24-hour battery life, and premium comfort that competing headphones at this sale price can’t match. This record low price on Amazon brings legendary audio quality within reach and you shouldn’t miss that opportunity.</p>

What really makes them stand out is how unique their approach to puzzling is. Each piece is odd and interesting, and the puzzles themselves feature a secret ending you can only uncover once you've fully completed it. True to its name, these puzzles feel like a mix of magic and puzzling as you're making your way through them. Although they usually cost $25 each, Amazon is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqWxG?object_uuid=fd753bb1-dd12-4a56-8d3a-aec644008373&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>currently running a buy 1, get 1 50% off sale</strong></a> that includes quite a few of them.

There are hidden Easter eggs in every puzzle and the secret endings are all unique and interesting. There have been 13 Magic Puzzle Company puzzles released across five different series so far, but only eight of them are part of Amazon's early Black Friday promotion. Series One and Series Two are underrepresented here, but many of the newer releases are eligible for the discount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most notably, the <em>only</em> Series Five puzzle that's been released so far is included in this sale. The Drippy Trip <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-series-five-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzle-features-art-from-an-adventure-time-designer">came out back in early August</a> and features some interesting ties to the animated series Adventure Time. I haven't had the chance to put this one together myself, but as a fan of that show I can't help but admire the resemblance to Adventure Time artwork I've grown to love.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should you wait for Amazon's Black Friday sale?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you aren't keeping up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday sale dates</a> as closely as I am, it's worth noting that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2025-start-date-and-sale-predictions">Amazon Black Friday sale</a> actually starts on Thursday this week. While I do recommend taking advantage of this discount right now, there's no guarantee that there won't be a better deal once that sale actually kicks off. I'd expect at least <em>some</em> of the Magic Puzzle Company puzzles to get discounted during Black Friday, but we won't know which ones until Thursday (or next week even).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, this sale is definitely worth checking out if you're looking to buy more than one puzzle at once. You may be able to find a lower price on some of these next week, but the extra 50% off now isn't likely to last forever. Amazon launched a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-early-black-friday-book-sale-2025">similar sale on books last week</a> that has already ended, so it's probable this week's promotion will expire before we even get to Black Friday as well.

<p>A small update and a new stop-motion short</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="3aef8915d5ca1"><a title="Hello, Mario" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3aef8915d5ca1/hello-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>In August, Nintendo launched a new 'My Mario' campaign in Japan designed for parents and their children. This included an interactive app called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> for the Switch and smart devices.</p>
<p>Although this app is a bit different to Nintendo's usual offerings, it seems it will still receive the same type of post-launch support – with the company today rolling out Version 1.0.2. Here's a rough translation of the official patch notes from Nintendo's website:</p>
<h3><strong>Hello, Mario! - Ver. 1.0.2 (18th November 2025)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the screen after starting the software, a warning message for parents has been added.</li>
<li>When in TV mode or table mode, the HOME button, etc. can be operated without disconnecting the controller.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>It's worth noting this app is currently exclusive to Japan's eShop, but if you have access to a Japanese Nintendo account, you can still download it on your system and try it out right now. Below is the official description, and we already shared some impressions when it was originally released.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"A free smart device app and Nintendo Switch software that children can play intuitively by pulling Mario’s face, or turning it around and around on the screen. Mario will react in various ways based on the player’s input, allowing parents and young children to play together and enjoy each reaction they see."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This update to the Hello, Mario! app follows the announcement of a similar <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_yoshi">Hello, Yoshi!</a> app earlier this month (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hello-yoshi-app-now-available-for-switch-and-mobile-devices">which is now available</a>), as well as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-announces-my-mario-yoshi-app-for-switch-and-mobile-devices">new range of products for children and parents</a>. The 'My Mario' line of toys is scheduled to be made available outside of Japan early next year.</p>
<p>Alongside this app update today, Nintendo has also released episode four of its My Mario Stop-Motion series. You can see it in action below:</p>
