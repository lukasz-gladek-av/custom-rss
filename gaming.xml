The free Herdling demo is out now on Steam, as was just announced alongside a new gameplay trailer during the Future Games Show.</p><p dir="ltr">In Herdling, players control a nameless child who takes on the responsibility of herding a pack of fantastical mammoth-like creatures, called calicorns, to their home. Players must guide them to safety and will benefit from their help in puzzles. The trick will frequently be getting the calicorns from A to B without losing any to narrow passageways, train tracks, and other (sometimes deadly) obstacles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPaS2fmFEAY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KPaS2fmFEAY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">I played an early portion of the game at PAX West last year and have since been anticipating it hitting me like a ton of bricks when it arrives in full--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-love-for-incredibly-sad-games-has-me-very-excited-for-herdling/1100-6529824/">in a bittersweet way that I appreciate, mind you</a>. It's going to be sad, no doubt, but if there <em>is</em> a way to play it without losing any furry friends, you can bet I'll be trying to find it. It reminds me of Journey in that the objective is a mountain far off in the distance, and getting there is a road trip of beautiful music to listen to and sights to see.</p><p dir="ltr">You can download the free Herdling demo here. It's unclear if the demo will stay on Steam or disappear after a time, so if you're interested, don't hesitate. Herdling comes to Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, and PS5 this summer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/survival-horror-holstin-gets-new-trailer-and-2-hour-long-demo-revealed-during-future-games-show/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Sonka's psychological survival horror game Holstin just got a brand new trailer during the Future Games Show, along with the news that a new, 2-hour-long demo is available for players to try, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2235430/Holstin/">right now</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous demos that have been available on Steam, which focused on specific mechanics in Holstin, this new demo is just the first two hours of the game for players to try, and get the full opening experience.</p>
<p>Holstin is a Resident Evil, Silent Hill-inspired horror game that uses 2XD rendering, allowing the team to "<em>seamlessly shift between multiple perspectives in real-time, lit, fully 3D pixel environments,</em>" according to a press release. Set in 1990s Poland, in a lakeside town called Jeziorne-Kolonia, you&nbsp;play as Tomasz, one of the last remaining locals who hasn't yet turned into an ooze-riddled creature.</p>
<p><iframe title="Holstin: Jeziorne-Kolonia Demo Shadow Drop | Summer Game Fest Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0O3ofy7-iFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Holstin is currently planned to be released on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, and PC, with a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonkagames/holstin">Kickstarter campaign</a> planned to launch later in 2025 to help the development team get the game over the finish line.</p>
<p>We've seen a lot of indie horror games break through into the main gaming conversation in the last few years, with games like Signalis, Crow Country, and Mouthwashing becoming indie-darlings for horror fans, all of them leaning into pixel art and a slightly more retro-look-and-feel to enhance the scares they have waiting for players.</p>
<p>Holstin looks like it could be the next game on that list, if the horror is able to deliver when it launches in the hopefully near future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-says-take-two-does-not-use-spyware-in-its-games-as-borderlands-review-bombing-continues<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox Software has published a statement regarding the controversy surrounding changes to parent company Take-Two’s Terms of Service and fears that many Borderlands games now contain “spyware.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Published <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/598528766295202095/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>directly on Steam</u></a>, where outcry has materialized in the form of review-bombing campaigns for all major Borderlands titles, the statement’s aim is to address concerns while “maintaining transparency and confidence with the community.” That means tackling two key talking points that have taken over the Borderlands fanbase for months, including fears of spyware and modding crackdowns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox makes its stance clear from the get-go: “Take-Two does not use spyware in its games.” While there are instances data will be collected, Gearbox doesn’t want players to fear that their private information is always up for grabs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Take-Two identifies these practices in its Privacy Policy to provide transparency to players and comply with its legal obligations,” Gearbox’s Steam statement says. “Take-Two collects this information to deliver its services to players, including to protect the game environment and player experience. You can read more about this in the Privacy Policy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement continues: “For example, player and device identifiers are collected in part to ensure the game is compatible with each player’s media, platform or website browser type. It allows us to better understand how players play games, and to personalize the user experience (like having usernames show up!). Account credentials are collected from users who choose to create accounts with Take-Two and its labels.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear if Gearbox’s explanation of Take-Two’s Terms of Service will be enough to calm those who took up arms after the agreement was altered back in February. Meanwhile, the studio’s explanation for its stance on the modding scene is fairly straightforward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Take-Two’s Terms of Service prohibit mods that allow users to gain an unfair advantage, negatively impact the ability of other users to enjoy the game as intended, or allow users to gain access to content that the user is not entitled to,” the statement clarifies. “We do this to protect the integrity of the game experience for all users.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a direct response to fears that the modding community could face repercussions for any kind of modding activity, as Gearbox says Take-Two’s primary concern lies with cheaters who could dampen the experience for other players. The statement goes as far as to say Gearbox’s parent company “generally does not seek to take action against mods that are single-player only, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of its labels and third parties.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Uproar began around May of this year when fans caught wind that Take-Two had updated its terms of service, affecting many of its existing titles. Rumor that the company was preying on user data quickly caught fire, resulting in a movement that saw the Recent Reviews sections for Borderlands 1, Borderlands 2, and Borderlands 3 tank into the “Mostly Negative” and “Overwhelmingly Negative” zones. While concerns subsided for the back half of May, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-2-goes-free-to-keep-on-steam-where-recent-eula-changes-have-sparked-a-mostly-negative-user-review-rating-across-the-entire-franchise"><u>fears kicked up once again when Borderlands 2 was made free to keep</u></a> (for a limited time) on June 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, the Borderlands series’ Recent Reviews on Steam remain firmly in the red. Meanwhile, Gearbox is working to deliver <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4"><u>Borderlands 4</u></a> this September. You can check out the latest news as well as a bit of gameplay by reading up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-state-of-play-april-2025-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at its April 2025 State of Play presentation</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

It then takes viewers behind the scenes of motion capture performances, including how that emotional opening scene between Gustave and Sophie came to life and another fun moment between Monoco and Verso.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the documentary is still a work in progress and the full video may change, we were able to chat with Jennifer English (Maelle), Ben Starr (Verso), Shala Nyx (Sciel), Kirsty Rider (Lune), Rich Keeble (Monoco), and Maxence Cazorla (Esquie) about their work on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were all really excited," English said of the time before the game launched. "We weren’t as stressed as the developers were, but I was dead nervous about it because we put all our love and heart into it and hope it pays off - and thankfully it did."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can do whatever you do in the studio, but then it stops being yours," Starr added. "You don’t know what it’s going to become. There are so many circumstances that go into the release of a game, and I felt, personally, there was a huge amount of pressure. It’s a game I wanted to be good for the team because they had put so much work into it, and because we didn’t just come into it, we were an additional part of it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">English then went on to discuss what it was like recording for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and video games in general, and it was a fascinating glimpse behind the curtain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I get so lonely in the booth," English joked. "You have to pretend. It’s very rare in video games that you get a playmate. I think it’s happened once or twice that I’ve had another actor in the room, so it’s a real honor when people think you were together recording. Video game acting is the Olympics of acting. If you can do good acting in video games - there is some bad acting, but not in this game – you can do anything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nyx then shared how many people have reached out to her about how her character, Sciel, has helped them with struggles in their own lives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s so cinematic," Nyx said. "It’s just so wonderful to be the voice and body of a character that is so rich and has so much emotional depth. I’ve had so many people reach out to me about how my character has helped them with their depression and helped them with their mental health. It’s so ephemeral and every moment is so rich and that’s a testament to the writing."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, Starr spoke on the emotional impact of the game and why we care so much about these pixels that became characters that mean a lot to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason you cry is because there is so much joy to be lost," Starr said. "You can’t have something that’s just morose all the time. If these people who are so vibrantly brought to life by these actors, if we lose them, then you lose everything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sells-33-million-in-33-days-not-bad-for-a-game-some-thought-was-going-to-get-crushed-by-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">how the game sold 3.3 million copies in just 33 days.</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination/" data-ref-id="5000-600315">Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> sees Agent 47 and his penchant for disguises and creative murders arrive on Nintendo's newest console. The Switch 2's Signature Edition is a comprehensive package, featuring the full campaigns for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman/" data-ref-id="5000-281972">Hitman</a> (2016), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-2/" data-ref-id="5000-483226">Hitman 2</a> (2018), and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-3/" data-ref-id="5000-513791">Hitman 3</a> (2021), along with Contracts mode, Escalation, Elusive Target arcades, the relatively new (and excellent) Freelancer mode, Sniper Assassin mode, featured live content, and everything from both the Hitman 2 Expansion Pack and Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack. That includes cosmetics, locations like Haven Island and The Bank, and side missions such as the Seven Deadly Sins and Special Assignments campaigns.</p><p dir="ltr">The only content not included are three specific Elusive Target arcade contracts--Replication, The Base, and The Oroborous--and the Sarajevo Six bonus contracts. You can purchase all of this content on the Nintendo eShop for $5 each, but it's disconcerting that these missions are gated behind paid DLC in the first place. The Sarajevo Six is the latest piece of significant DLC for the game, but it still came out two years ago after previously being exclusive to the PlayStation 4 version of Hitman 2, so you'd expect it to be included in a package that already costs $60. The Elusive Target contracts are even more egregious because they were previously released as free updates many years ago. These packs include cosmetics, which is probably the justification for selling them, but I think people would be a lot happier if the actual gameplay content was separated and included in the initial purchase. Having said that, you're still getting dozens upon dozens of hours of Hitman to sink your teeth into. It's an exhaustive package, even with parts missing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4508527-hitmanworldofassassinationsignatureedition_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508527" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4508527-hitmanworldofassassinationsignatureedition_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508527"></a><figcaption>Ultimately, this is still a solid collection--it just plays better everywhere else.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4508527-hitmanworldofassassinationsignatureedition_01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Of course, the big question regarding this port is: How's the performance? Unlike the Switch version of Hitman 3, which required cloud streaming to run at all, the Signature Edition runs natively on the Switch 2 but falls short of other versions of the game in several areas. It's not terrible, but there are clearly better places to play if you're interested in killing people with a bald, barcoded assassin.</p><p dir="ltr">Visually, it looks good both docked and in handheld mode, whether you're throwing axes at faces at a Paris fashion show, tampering with open-wheel race cars in Miami, or solving a whodunit at an opulent estate in Dartmoor. It appears to be 1080p when docked and 720p in handheld mode, so you lose some of the detail available on other platforms, and there is some occasional shimmering on certain objects. The Switch 2's HDR implementation also doesn't function properly when playing handheld, resulting in an overly bright image that makes certain aspects of the game, like the map, unreadable. Fortunately, you can at least turn this off in the system settings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4508524-screenshot2025-06-07145142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508524" data-ratio="0.5625814863103" data-width="1534" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4508524-screenshot2025-06-07145142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508524"></a><figcaption>The framerate fluctuates wildly whenever you're not in a small room.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4508524-screenshot2025-06-07145142.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Performance in the Signature Edition is uneven, utilizing an uncapped 60fps that varies from moment to moment depending on what's happening on screen. If you're in a small room by yourself, you can see the frame rate reach its upper limits, but it fluctuates wildly everywhere else. I never noticed any substantial drops, even when dealing with large crowds of NPCs, but playing in handheld mode fares best, as the Switch 2's built-in Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) does a decent job of making the fickle frame rate feel smoother than it does when docked, where VRR is unavailable. Playing on a TV just feels unpleasant, even if the game's methodical pacing somewhat mitigates this. There aren't any graphics settings to tinker with either. This isn't out of the ordinary for a console game, but the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Hitman did let you cap the frame rate at 30fps for a more stable experience.</p><p dir="ltr">While playing in handheld mode is the way to go for more consistent performance, that doesn't mean it's great for taking Hitman on the go. The death knell for this port is the Signature Edition's always-online requirement. This restriction has been part of the game since 2016, so it's hardly surprising, but it's disappointing that IO Interactive hasn't found an alternative solution that allows you to reap the full benefits of the Switch 2's portability. You can still play the game offline, but it's a badly diluted experience, lacking progression, rewards, challenges, and level mastery; essentially, everything that adds replayability and a sense of accomplishment is absent unless you're connected to the Hitman servers. If you're playing through the campaigns for the first time, it's mostly fine, but anything beyond this is significantly stripped back due to a rigid requirement.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4508528-hitman-world-of-assassination-deluxe-pack-pc-game-steam-wallpaper-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508528" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4508528-hitman-world-of-assassination-deluxe-pack-pc-game-steam-wallpaper-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508528"></a><figcaption>Hitman 3 is one of our favorite games--it was picked for GameSpot's Best of 2023.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4508528-hitman-world-of-assassination-deluxe-pack-pc-game-steam-wallpaper-4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Due to these issues and the game's performance problems, it's tough to recommend Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition. Not only are other versions of the game regularly cheaper--and sometimes free--but they also run and look better, both on TVs/monitors and handheld devices like the Steam Deck and ASUS ROG Ally. The Switch 2 port is certainly playable (albeit compromised), and the World of Assassination trilogy remains fantastic, but even amidst the excitement of a shiny new console, Agent 47's latest Nintendo outing is a letdown.</p>

            <p>
I've been excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roman-sands-rebuild">Roman Sands RE:Build</a> since the moment I laid my eyes on it, particularly because it's from the same studio behind the ever-haunting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paratopic">Paratopic</a>. Roman Sands just has a ridiculously strong art direction to it, very much one that could easily be dubbed Y2K, but I think more accurately should be seen as an evolution of the aesthetic/ era. Almost as if this is the direction it could have gone in. 
</p>

<p>
Just great stuff, not even counting the oddball gameplay, and as revealed in a new trailer, it's got a release date now too: September 12th. That's close enough for me to count down the days, but far away enough for me to think "I'd like to be playing this right now actually, ta very much." The trailer offered a new look at its strange, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzley</a> hotel and all of its guests, as well as a tease for the things you'll be getting up to (all of which seem quite ominous.

<p>
The gameplay itself sees you attending to the demands of said guests as outlandish as they all are, but the clock is working against you. Specifically, a clock that'll see the sun swallowing up the world. Terrifying! And a great hook. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231460/Roman_Sands_REBuild/">There's a demo you can check out on Steam too</a>, or you can just wishlist it if you want to wait for the full thing.
</p>
<p>
Excitingly, the release date trailer also had a mysterious tease for Paratopic: Overdub, seemingly an anniversary edition of the game. Over on its <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/rockpapershotgun/content-article/edit/news/2346939?tab=compose">Steam page</a> it's described as a remaster/ remix/ sequel, and look, it could be none of those things and I'd still be in. Paratopic is a peak example of the modern trend of PS1-inspired games, using the aesthetic to really hone in on its subtle horrors. Whatever this new thing contains, I'll take it. It's coming September 12th too, so I'm sure like me you'll be plenty busy that day!

            <p>
Now, I'm not naming any names here, but there's a certain hand-drawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> that everyone's a bit sick of waiting for by this point, and could really do with a release date. OK, fine, yes it's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and if those recent Steam backend updates mean anything, I expect it'll get some kind of update sometime in the next few days. In the meantime, here's <a href="https://rockpapershotgun.com/games/constance">Constance</a>, also a hand-drawn metroidvania, that actually does have a release date.
</p>

<p>
In Constance, you play as a purple-haired painter who is "striving to escape from a colorful but decaying inner-world, created by her declining mental health." Mental health themes are nothing new in the world of indie games, but that's not what really sells me on Constance. That'd be the tight-looking platforming and snappy, paint-brush oriented combat.

<p>
You literally fight and hop dart around with a massive paintbrush, using it to do pretty much everything, from glooping up the side of a wall, to doing quick brush strokes that let you dodge. Occasionally you'll even have to do some actual painting, if you can believe it! The thing looks lovely too, I'm a sucker for hand-drawn games, as they always feel like labours of love. Aesthetically that certainly seems to be the case here, so I'm hoping the full release lives up to its look. There's a demo to available too, so you and I could always give that a go to find out!
</p>
<p>
Oh, right, release date! That'll be November 24th, a few months away still, but I'm sure you can wait. As I said, I really wouldn't be surprised if Silksong does get dated this weekend, but definitely consider keeping Constance on your radar too, I'm sure more than enough people are going to pick up the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> sequel.

<figure><a title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156582/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to put your Switch 2 through its paces, there’s no shortage of options in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-all-day-one-releases">its generous launch lineup</a>. Whether it’s the candy-colored charm of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or the neon-drenched cityscape of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, you’re spoiled for choice when it comes to visual powerhouses.</p>
<p>With such major titles on offer, it would be easy to overlook <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>. Released on other platforms in July 2024, it’s a game that, at first glance, might seem like just another Japanese action game, complete with unwieldy title and familiar feudal-era setting. Jumping into the adventure of the goddess Yoshiro and her faithful protector Soh, I was surprised to find that Capcom’s Shinto-inspired epic is a truly compelling blend of action and tower defence.</p>
<p>The land has been overrun by a demonic force known as the Seethe. Villages surrounding the sacred Mount Kafuku have fallen to corruption. Yoshiro, a divine being, must perform a ritual dance to cleanse each area. Cleansing leaves her vulnerable to attack, which is where her bodyguard Soh comes in. He is tasked with defending the goddess as they move through each settlement, dancing away the evil. Thankfully, Soh won't be alone in this task.</p>
<figure><a title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156589/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In each area, you cleanse corrupted villagers and assign them combat roles, allowing them to join your fight. You’ll place these villagers in strategic positions around Yoshiro. As night falls, your group must hold their ground against waves of Seethe. The day-night cycle creates a natural ebb and flow of action. During the day, you free villagers, collect crystals, and purge corrupted fauna while a timer counts down to nightfall. Roles are assigned to your fighters using crystals, but this currency is primarily used to carve a path for the ritual. As Soh waves his harai gushi to guide Yoshiro, her progress will determine how many cycles it will take to clear the area. Some will take a single day, most take multiple.</p>
<p>Half ARPG, half tower defence, Kunitsu-Gami is a fascinating and addictive mashup. You control Soh directly, and there’s a beautiful fluidity to his combat. His “blade dance” has a slight delay between input and impact, giving the sensation of gliding through swathes of enemies and cutting them to ribbons. He can attach multiple talismans and tsuba to his gear, which add devastating new abilities or boosts to villagers.</p>
<p>After a settlement is cleared, it becomes a base that you can revisit between rituals. Upgrading these bases provides rewards for both Soh and his growing band of fighters.</p>

<p>Between villages, powerful bosses await, and defeating them earns you a mask that unlocks a new role type to assign to villagers. Boss fights themselves play like a gritty, horror-tinged version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_1">Pikmin</a>, as you command fighters to swarm an enemy or defend Yoshiro from adds.</p>
<p>Each villager role has unique utility, from the humble woodcutter to the formidable sorcerer. Selecting the right roles for the right type of enemy or environment is key to Yoshiro’s survival.</p>
<p>The settlements of Mount Kafuku are visually stunning, vibrant dioramas that shift from fleshy hellscape to lush paradise as Yoshiro does their thing. The game runs incredibly well too; Soh slices shafts of bright colour through large groups of enemies without any noticeable frame drops. Performance remains impressive undocked, with the Switch 2’s larger display complementing the top-down environments perfectly. There’s also a healthy selection of visual options (being able to disable motion blur and depth of field is appreciated, Capcom) and accessibility tweaks.</p>

<p>Completing the audio-visual feast is an intoxicating soundscape, which is only slightly marred by a woeful English voice track. Luckily the option to swap to Japanese is available.</p>
<p>Mouse control will be a bit divisive for some. Arguably, this kind of title is well suited to the mouse, as a large chunk of gameplay has you assigning units in the command menu. It took some getting used to, but once I found a comfortable hand position, I enjoyed playing this way. Ultimately, though, I found myself retreating to traditional controls during difficult sections like boss fights. Manoeuvring Soh around enemies while shifting the camera with mouse movement just didn't quite work for me.</p>
<p>Still, even without the extra ways to play that Switch 2 offers, this is a great representation of multiple genres in its own right. It’s a generous title, with plenty of reasons to go back to levels, revealing secrets and unlocking more abilities for Soh and his army.</p>
<figure><a title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156590/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While each villager role introduces a new strategy and each corrupted settlement adds fresh mechanics, the formula does start to feel slightly repetitive after the midpoint. That said, the core loop of upgrade-plan-defend is addictive and makes Kunitsu-Gami one of the most unique launch titles on Switch 2.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Kunitsu-Gami was a real surprise. A solid blend of strategy and action that incorporates aspects of Shinto and Japanese folklore to create a visually stunning experience. It's a great showcase for Switch 2, even if mouse controls might not quite work for everyone.</p></section>

Think of a haunted toy box belonging to a deranged puppeteer, and then add a bit of glam rock for good measure. It's the perfect vibe for the story of a sailor with no memories setting out to find a cursed location, and the adventure will arrive on PC and mobile in 2026. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our creative journey began with a spark of pure feeling—an emotional image that guided everything: 'If a puppet’s mind is soaked in water, memories slip away into the ocean, yet they still choose to return and sail again.' This early inspiration was both a playful nod to the Chinese saying “ 脑子进水” ('brain soaked with water') and a philosophical reflection seen in some of our favorite films," Joker Studios told us. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When it came time to build the actual framework, we drew on a wide range of influences—from JRPGs and CRPGs to open-world titles and even niche indie games that share a spirit of boundless exploration. At every step, we focused on how to let players experience these feelings themselves, not just watch them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you dive into Sea of Remnants you'll be focused on exploring the pirate city Orbtopia, talking to the rich cast of NPCs and - you're a sailor after all -  taking to the briny waves to find islands, treasures, and hidden ruins. You can raid the ships you meet on the sea or take on huge monsters, all while a dynamic weather system rages overhead. When you're not doing that you'll be focused on upgrading your vessel, learning new skills, or even kicking back with some fishing, cooking, and mahjong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You’ll challenge sea monsters, explore local cultures, and sense the deeper mystery of how memory and forgetting begin to intertwine between the ocean and Orbtopia, the pirate haven. Alongside your companions, you’ll begin a journey that’s equal parts unrestrained and romantic, charting a course as unique as each sailor who steps aboard," says Joker Studio. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Joker Studio previously released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/identity-v"><u>Identity V</u></a>, a survival horror game created in partnership with Dead by Daylight's Behavior Interactive. Since its release in 2018, Identity V has collaborated with Edward Scissorhands, Sherlock Holmes, Personae and Deathnote. Just like Sea of Remnants it has a distinctive visual style - think Coraline but creepier. The game made a bigger impact in Asia than the US, but it still has a dedicated fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At their core, the two games exist in entirely separate worlds and storylines. That said, as a nod to fans and our shared studio DNA, you might find a few subtle Easter eggs or world-building hints here and there. But rest assured, any connections are handled with great care and won’t overshadow the unique stories of each game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Live 2025 is packed with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-partners-announced">exclusive reveals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-to-give-away-more-than-20000-prizes-and-freebies">thousands of giveaways</a>, 170 gaming stations, and tons of fun, the event is shaping up to be a huge celebration of everything fans of games, TV, movies, comics, and collectibles love, and here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect">how to watch</a> the event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sgf-2025-toem-2-hands-on-back-behind-the-lens/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With its first gameplay reveal during this year's Day of the Devs, indie developer Something We Made finally showed off the sequel to their inaugural title TOEM: A Photo Adventure from 2021. This charming photography adventure brought an easygoing monochrome adventure to hundreds of fans and left us wanting more.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>TOEM 2 opens with the same plucky character from the first title dropped into the world with little more than ambition and a trusty camera. While the first game focused on ascending the TOEM mountain, I didn't catch nary a whiff of the actual motivations and reasoning for the journey this time around. Instead, I was given free reign to meander around the idyllic village and solve a variety of problems for the townsfolk, from trying to retrieve a potion of liquid courage for a scaredy-cat knight to taking photos of three goats in order to permit a bridge troll to let me pass. In my twenty or so minutes of play, I was able to help solve the small-scale problems of four individuals and be rewarded with a stamp for my collection each time.</p>
<p>The camera remains the player's best tool in the world of TOEM 2 with players not only able to use their photography skills to solve the plights of the ordinary person, but also a variety of attachments to use as tools in your adventure. The very first unlockable upgrade I earned for my camera was a hammer upgrade that let me smash through select stone blocks that hindered my progression. Using the hammer is just like the other attachments from the first TOEM: simply point and shoot (or in this case, tap on the rocks). It took a moment to realize that there's a small minigame to using the hammer with players having to tap out morse code with short and long taps in order to break those rocks.</p>

<p>One puzzle I encountered was take a 3x3 cube of blocks and chisel away to make a matching sculpture to the quest giver. Rather than trying to memorize the layout or run back and forth between the source sculpture and what I was crafting, I stopped to take photos of each side of the cube and use those to remember the requested shape. The developers from Something We Made seemed surprised that this was a valid solution to their puzzle and it was nice to see the camera being used as a note taking device as well as the tool you'll use to take pictures of every animal around the landscape.</p>
<p>New to TOEM 2 is also the addition of jumping, and in true platformer style, I had to test it out by jumping around on top of any short wall I could find and try to scale up the world. I couldn't find any unintended out-of-bounds areas, but I was at least able to find some climbable areas that would lead to new hats for the playable character. With jumping now on the menu, I wouldn't be surprised if the Honk attachment gets phased out for TOEM 2.</p>

<p>Sadly, there's still a fair bit of time before <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/">TOEM 2</a> is ready to be in players' hands. Developer Something We Made and publisher popagenda have penciled in this quaint photographical adventure for 2026 across a slew of unannounced consoles as well as PC.</p>

I don't think you can more easily sell me on a game than by saying it was made by one of the artists behind Celeste, and has music from Disasterpeace, i.e. the composer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, and It Follows. But that's exactly what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverway">Neverway</a> is, a horror RPG in the vein of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/neverway-is-a-horror-rpg-stardew-valley-from-one-of-the-artists-behind-celeste">first announced back in April</a>, back with a nice little look-in at yesterday's Day of the Devs presentation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Pedro Medeiros, the Celeste artist in question, and programmer/ writer Isadora Sophia gave a great little rundown of Neverway, explaining that you play as Fiona, a character who much like the player character in Stardew has just quit her dead end job. She's trying to start over on a farm, live the quiet life, except she ends up having to serve as a herald for a dead god because of some debt she owes. Awkward!

<p>
That kind of life does end up leading towards the need to fight in a classic Zelda-ish 2D action combat kind of way, but you do have to balance all of that adventuring with your regular life too. That means farming, paying your mortgage, making friends, maybe even falling in love. Those bonds can lead to new combat abilities too, something I wish my own relationships offered me. 
</p>
<p>
Time works a bit differently in Neverway too, as rather than the day slowly tick tocking away, it moves from morning, to afternoon, to night when you do things like eat, sleep, or read a manual of some sort.
</p>
<p>
After a while, you'll end up searching for the titular Neverway, a "decaying nightmarish reality that is slowly leaking into yours." This is where you'll learn about the game's post-apocalyptic world as you pay off your debt.
</p>
<p>
I know "farming sim but dark" isn't exactly a new concept, it's just that Neverway is doing so with such eyecatching style I can't help but be won over by it. It looks like there's a real sincerity to the life-sim elements as opposed to them just being slapped into some dark themes. That's the ticket to my heart honestly, a good bit of earnestness goes a long way.
</p>
<p>
Neverway doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318330/Neverway/">wishlist it on Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-arrives-in-fortnite-battle-royale-during-star-wars-live-event-as-death-star-detonates-and-destruction-rains-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has just wrapped up its latest explosive live event, detonating the Death Star looming over the Island and welcoming DC Comics hero Superman in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonight's event, Death Star Sabotage, saw nearly 6 million players infiltrate the Empire's fully operational battle station that has hovered menacingly over the Fortnite battle royale Island throughout its Star Wars mini-season. Happily, and perhaps unsurprisingly, players were able to stop the station's deadly space laser from obliterating the game's map — although not without causing a bit of damage in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As destruction rained down, the event's closing moments saw Superman arrive — presumably to try and help with clean up duties during the game's incoming superhero-themed season, which begins in just a few hours' time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite's big Star Wars event began in orbit around the game's battle royale Island, giving players a rare glimpse at the game's setting from outside its usual boundaries. Fortnite's setting exists as a bubble of reality floating through the multiverse (which handily allows any character from any franchise to turn up at any time!) and here, players were able to pilot X-Wings and TIE-Fighters to blow up orbiting Star Destroyers and engage in fun dogfights. In the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes">continued absence of a Star Wars: Battlefront 3</a>, this was a fun riff on its space battles to get things started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action then swiftly moved to within the Death Star itself, as Fortnite heroes Jonesy (Troy Baker) and Hope (Suzie Yeung) led players through the bowels of the station, initially disguised as Stormtroopers and their captives. Ultimately, players found themselves in an encounter with Star Wars' Emperor (was that the voice of Sheev Palpatine himself, Ian McDiarmid?), and able to escape the Death Star as it exploded.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/07/0defa510-26bf-45aa-835e-6c50e905e524-1-1749324031249.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Star Wars: Battlefront eat your heart out.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a nod to Fortnite's 2021 live event Operation Sky Fire (which also ended in a space station exploding above the game's Island), players were initially left to celebrate their victory — until the realisation that huge flaming chunks of said space station were now raining down on their battle royale home. And here, one of these chunks smashed straight into the glowing Rift Gate used to access the spirit realm by Fortnite's current antihero Daigo, unleashing its untold power. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event's final moments see players back on the Island, mysterious energy now crackling around them. (Will this be the explanation for why superpowers now exist in the next battle royale season? Quite possibly.) Meanwhile, Superman is seen watching the Island from afar, as it is flooded by spirit realm energy. The suggestion here, of course, is that Superman will be swooping in to help.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/07/696-fortnite-death-star-sabotage-full-event-experience-00-14-22-1749324356071.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Superman watches as Fortnite's battle royale Island erupts in spirit realm energy.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite will, for the first time, follow up a major live event with a new season launch on the same day. Following the conclusion of Death Star Sabotage, Fortnite is currently in downtime, but will return with Chapter 6: Season 3 in just a few hours' time. As you might expect from Superman's arrival, this next season will indeed be superhero themed — and as eagle-eyed players have noticed, this is indeed the new version played by David Corenswet from James Gunn's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/superman-2025">Superman</a> movie. That's some well-timed brand synergy!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While highly anticiapated, Fortnite's Star Wars season saw some of the game's lowest player numbers in some time — perhaps in response to its daring decision to remove all regular weapons (and all ammo!) and fully commit to a five-week period of Star Wars gunplay. It will be interesting to see how player numbers rebound with the launch of this new season later today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Fortnite developer Epic Games announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-darth-vader-was-the-beginning-epic-reveals-plans-to-let-people-create-their-own-ai-npcs-in-fortnite">making Star Wars in-game assets available to creators to build their own experiences in a galaxy far, far away</a> in the not too far off future. While enjoyable, tonight's live event did feel at some points like something of a showcase for that, while including a few morsels for fans of the game's ongoing narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want to watch the whole of Fortnite's Death Star Sabotage for yourself? You can find a recording of the full live event mission below, or Epic Games has a 4K quality version on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRJ2z07dpoc&amp;ab_channel=Fortnite" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Fortnite x Star Wars: Galactic Battle Death Star Sabotage Event <a href="https://t.co/3EeBvjVmpI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3EeBvjVmpI</a></p>— iFireMonkey (@iFireMonkey) <a href="https://twitter.com/iFireMonkey/status/1931417911190491429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

A. Corey novels and Syfy TV adaptations. It's an original story that casts you as a Pinkwater Security mercenary, who starts out trapped on Eros Station - an asteroid base that undergoes cataclysmic upheaval in the TV show - and later takes charge of an advanced starship, so as to quest around the solar system. The game is inspired by BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> series, with "tactical" third-person combat featuring two ally characters and cover mechanics. Also, crew romances. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>In a press release, game design producer Yuliya Chernenko comments that "the original Mass Effect trilogy was absolutely an inspiration to the team", being "iconic for the Xbox 360 generation of gamers". I was going to get snobby about that nod to consoles, but then I realised that the sentence is a sick burn on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect Andromeda</a>, so we'll call it square.</p>
<p>Its 360 thinking aside, Osiris Reborn's combat "reflects the standards of modern action gameplay". I'm unconvinced of Owlcat's ability to develop a real-time Mass Effect-style squad action experience, but they've got ample prior for the kinds of crew relationship dynamics and political tensions you find in both Mass Effect and The Expanse.</p>
<p>Please take shelter behind the nearest knee-high surface while I pepper your position with these bulletpoint features, according to what I hope is a faithful simulation of zero-G physics:</p>
<blockquote><p>Create Your Own Captain: Play as an Earther, Martian, or Belter and take command of the system's most advanced ship. Shape your journey through identity, leadership, and the pressure of survival.</p>
<p>Lead a Crew: Your companions are more than squadmates -- they have pasts, motives, and a voice in your story. Your leadership decisions will determine how squadmate loyalty shifts under pressure.</p>
<p>Tactical Third-Person Combat: Implement real-time strategic cover mechanics using various abilities and squad coordination. Bring two companions into combat while others support from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Explore a Divided Solar System: Travel across iconic locations from the TV show and books, like Ganymede, Ceres, Mars, and Luna. While traversing the various environments, players must uncover secrets and influence outcomes through their skills and decisions.</p>
<p>A Story-Driven RPG True to The Expanse: Immerse yourself in a narrative grounded in tension, consequence, and the complexity of humanity's future among the stars</p></blockquote>
<p>Osiris Reborn is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3727390/The_Expanse_Osiris_Reborn/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-736f65">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/the_expanse_osiris_reborn">GOG</a> at a date that is not today, nor tomorrow, but "soon".</p>
<p>The developers are at pains to reassure that they've got a whole new team working on the thing and that there is no overlap with any of Owlcat's other projects, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-is-the-next-tactical-and-bloody-crpg-from-the-devs-behind-rogue-trader">the recently revealed Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy</a>. They're collaborating on the game with Alcon Interactive Group, publishers of The Expanse: A Telltale Story.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A release date was not announced. <span id="more-971806"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Owlcat Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</em> is a third-person action RPG set in <em>The Expanse</em> universe. You’re no hero—just a merc caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, trying to hold your crew together and keep the ship up and running. Your choices will shape your story.</p><p><strong>The Universe Never Told Us if We Did Right or Wrong</strong></p><p>By the 24th century, humanity has conquered the cosmos. However, life has remained anything but easy. In The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, a story-driven sci-fi Action RPG, you play as a Pinkwater Security mercenary whose brief shore leave on the asteroid Eros spirals out of control. Trapped in a deadly lockdown and drawn into a solar system-wide conspiracy far beyond your control, you’ll have to adapt, survive, taking command of the most advanced ship in the whole of the solar system.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Create and customize your own captain—Earther, Martian, or Belter—and lead a crew of highly-skilled specialists as you face off against escalating threats, political pressure, and a relentless enemy that will stop at nothing to see you dead. In a solar system held together by fragile alliances, every decision leaves its mark.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_971804"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Trust Isn’t Given—It’s Earned</strong></p><p>Your companions are more than just mission assets—they are people with their own scars and loyalties. Some chase redemption. Others hide their truths. Over time, your relationships will flourish or deteriorate depending on the choices you make and how you choose to lead. The ship becomes your home—a place where trust is earned, not given.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Third-Person Combat</strong></p><p>Fight in third-person utilizing cover-focused gunplay and abilities. Two companions will accompany you into the field while others will support from a distance: disabling systems or drawing the enemies’ attention. You will issue real-time commands and have to adapt quickly to survive the manifold threats the system will throw at you.</p><p><strong>The Fractured World of The Expanse</strong></p><p>Visit iconic locations like Ganymede, Ceres, Mars, and Luna. Walk through ruined habitats and political strongholds mired in unease and tension. Talk to the locals. Uncover secrets. Use your skills to influence what happens next. The system looks different from every planet and from every asteroid. Some are falling apart. Others just hide it better. You may even come across a familiar face or voice that reminds you of just how small the system really is.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
