            <p>
The next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> update, Chronicle, is due out next month with a newly revealed June 24th release date, and developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/kinetic-games">Kinetic Games</a> have offered up some details on what it calls one of the game's "biggest updates" so far. So, let's have a look at what that entails! The key addition with this update is the arrival of sound evidence, which as you can probably guess is a new haunting paranormal proof type that you'll acquire by using the newly added sound recorder.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In turn, the journal has been completely redesigned. The photos tab will now be the media tab, which organises evidence into photos, videos, and those aforementioned sound recordings. You'll need to fill your book up with unique media to achieve a perfect investigation, and there's some new events like EMF spikes, interactions like rocking chairs, and different ghost forms to help you do this.
</p>
<p>
The media quality system has been revamped too. Now whenever you capture your first bit of evidence of any media type, it'll be marked as unique, so you'll get some bonus dosh and experience once you've wrapped up a contract. Plus, there are some bug fixes coming with this update too.
</p>
<p>
Following the release of Chronicle, a rework of Grafton Farmhouse will be coming too. Kinetic explained in a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-dev-preview-19">blog post</a> that the whole map has been overhauled, namely some re-themed rooms, certain spaces increasing or decreasing in size, and there's a new "crowded attic, complete with sheet covered old furniture."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year Kinetic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/phasmophobia-is-getting-a-new-haunted-location-but-wont-be-getting-any-more-big-maps">outlined the future of Phasmophobia</a>, promising more (but not big) maps, more map reworks, and Horror 2.0, the long awaited full release of the, uh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game.

            <p>
Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rebellion-developments">Rebellion Developments</a> revealed a first look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall's</a> first DLC expansion yesterday. Titled Wicked Isle, it unsurprisingly brings you to an island called Midsummer Island that is, in fact, a bit wicked, but like, in the bad way, not in the something a teen in the 2000s would say about something they like kind of way. Specifically it'll have a bit more of a folk horror vibe to it, which I'm certainly into conceptually. Lots of great folklore in the UK, as long as it's not stepping over frequently trodden upon territory.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Rebellion head of design Ben Fisher explains that the island is "close to the Windscale Atom Plant and as a result the levels of infection in both the people and environment are higher than on the mainland." It'll feature new enemies like pirate bandits and infected druids to fight, though you'll get some new weapons to fend them off in kind. That includes things like a blunderbuss shotgun, a cutlass, daggers, a new bow, and a beekeeper's staff. You know, the typical kind of things you find on a creepy island.

<p>
The completionists amongst you might also like to know (or dread to hear depending on how much you liked the game) that some of the new storylines can lead to new endings in the base game. No details on what those are, obviously, but I suppose the joy of experiencing things for the first time is just that!
</p>
<p>
There's a release date for the expansion too: June 3rd, just a few days away at the time of writing. Let's all see how it shapes up, as our own James found himself left wanting a bit with a lot of what Atomfall had to offer in his own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/atomfall-review">review</a> of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>.

			<p>There's a lot of speculation about what the new Nintendo Switch 2 console, due to debut next week in stores globally, can achieve in terms of system performance. The system supports up to 120 frames per second in handheld mode and up to 4K and 60 frames per second in docked mode, and complex open world games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-comparison-videos-highlight-how-the-game-and-technology-have-come-a-long-way-since-1-0-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and Star Wars Outlaws are being ported to the hardware.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition-qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking to Koei Tecmo</a> in an interview about the launch title NOBUNAGA’S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition, we learned that the Japanese team tried to run the game at 4K resolution and 60FPS but had to scale down to just 1080P@30FPS. Here's what game producer and director Michi Ryu told Wccftech:</p>
<p><em>We are not using NVIDIA DLSS. The game runs at Full HD and 30fps. We also experimented with 4K and 60fps, but the power required to render the Japanese archipelago with these graphics is more than you can imagine and difficult to keep stable, so we had to give up. We hope to revisit this challenge in the future if the opportunity arises.</em></p>
<p>NOBUNAGA's AMBITION: Awakening isn't exactly the most taxing game, as you can see from its recommended requirements for PC:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>OS: Windows 10, Windows 11, 64bit</em></li>
<li><em>Processor: Intel Core i7-3770 or over (Windows 10), Intel Core i3-8350K or over (Windows 11)</em></li>
<li><em>Memory: 8 GB RAM</em></li>
<li><em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060(6GB) or over, AMD Radeon RX580(8GB) or over</em></li>
<li><em>DirectX: Version 11</em></li>
<li><em>Network: Broadband Internet connection</em></li>
<li><em>Storage: 25 GB available space</em></li>
<li><em>Sound Card: 16-bit stereo, 48KHz WAVE file can be played</em></li>
<li><em>Additional Notes: 1920 x 1080 Display required</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Still, owners of the Nintendo Switch 2 will at least see a major graphics improvement, according to Ryu:</p>
<p><em>Thanks to the hardware evolution of Switch 2, the graphics have been significantly improved. Elements like the sea, sky, and ground look much more real, enhancing the immersive experience of the game. Being able to have this level of graphics in a portable format is a major point to be enjoyed by players. Additionally, with mouse operation via Joy-Con 2 and USB mouse support, intuitive controls are now possible. We have also included some game content that was previously only available in Asia, so we hope players will enjoy those as well.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on Thursday, June 5. Check out our info roundup article <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Kinetic Games has confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s next content drop, Chronicle, will release on 24th June, and it'll be its "biggest update yet".</p>
<p>As well as introducing a "total overhaul" of how evidence is collected, the team said Chronicle will expand investigations with three new evidence types, a completely redesigned Journal, reworked levelling and progression, a refreshed Main Menu UI, and "many eerie surprises still lurking in the dark".</p>

<p>But at the "heart" of the Chronicle update is the debut of the all-new Sound evidence. An entirely new haunting paranormal proof type can be captured through the new Sound Recorder, bringing "a new dimension to gameplay, revealing subtle clues that might otherwise be drowned out by terrified screams". Available in the customary three upgrade tiers, players will be able to record audio from ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and Paranormal Sounds like those detected by the Parabolic Microphone.</p>
<p>It's this new evidence type that's necessitated a Journal upgrade, too. The Photo tab will be rebranded as "Media", and keep all your photos, videos, and new sound recordings in one place. Importantly, you'll have to fill your journal with all these unique media types, including "EMF spikes to ghostly interactions and fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms", to complete a "perfect" investigation.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kinetic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Chronicle will also introduce a revamped media quality system," Kinetic teased. "The first evidence capture of any media type will be marked as 'Unique', granting extra cash and XP rewards at the end of each contract. Any subsequent captures of the same evidence type will be classed as 'Duplicates', offering smaller rewards. The new system will also add tier bonuses based on the equipment used and adds all media captures into the Reward Multiplier, making every shot, sound, and sight count even more toward player’s final payouts."</p>
<p>Don't forget that this year, Phasmophobia will also rework Grafton Farmhouse, following Bleasdale Farmhouse's recent overhaul. Before then, though, we'll also get to see the new levelling and progression system and Main Menu UI when Chronicle arrives at the end of June.</p>

            <p>
Yesterday, ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, the union made up of more than 300 quality assurance workers at Microsoft via its subsidiary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/zenimax-media">ZeniMax Media</a>, reached a tentative contract agreement with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/microsoft">Microsoft</a>. The union was formed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">back in 2022</a>, and has been bargaining with Microsoft in the intervening years since. Last month, the union was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/union-workers-at-fallout-and-elder-scrolls-company-ready-to-strike-against-microsoft-after-two-years-of-haggling">preparing to potentially strike against Microsoft</a>, but now it seems like this may be avoided.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
If fully agreed to, the contract will bring in "substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers", according to a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">press release</a> from the CWA. On top of that, there would be protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a "crediting policy that clearly acknowledges the QA workers’ contributions to the video games they help create." The press release notes that the agreement would also include an agreement made in 2023 in relation to how AI is used in the workplace.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, this contract isn't set in stone just yet. Explanation meetings need to be held for members over the coming weeks, and according to the CWA a ratification vote should be completed by June 20th. If it goes through, it will be a huge win for the workers, and should set a big precedent for game workers employed at a Microsoft-owned studio.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, a union made up of almost 200 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-devs-have-formed-an-almost-200-person-strong-union-with-the-cwa-called-the-overwatch-gamemakers-guild">was also formed alongside the CWA</a>, called the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild. Microsoft have already recognised this union as well. If things continue to go well for ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, perhaps we'll see wins at other unions further down the line. I for one have my fingers deeply tied for such results.

            <p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA) says it has reached a "historic tentative contract agreement" with ZeniMax Media staff at Microsoft.</p>

<p>The new contract is said to set "new standards for the industry" and includes "substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers". It also includes protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a crediting policy that "clearly acknowledges the QA workers' contributions to the video games they help create", as well as a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/zenimax-workers-reach-agreement-microsoft-contractors-and-ai">previously announced agreement</a> on how artificial intelligence is introduced and implemented in the workplace.</p>
<p>"Workers in the video game industry are demonstrating once again that collective power works. This agreement shows what's possible when workers stand together and refuse to accept the status quo," added CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. "Whether it's having a say about the use of AI in the workplace, fighting for significant wage increases and fair crediting policies, or protecting workers from retaliation, our members have raised the bar. We're proud to support them every step of the way."</p>

            <p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ea">EA</a> did the thing they oh so frequently loves to do, which is making a bad decision. This time, it was cancelling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Marvel's Black Panther</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-shut-down-studio-they-opened-less-than-two-years-ago-cancel-black-panther-game">shutting down the two year old studio that was making it, Cliffhanger Games</a>. As every single announcement like this over the past few years has been, it was an incredibly frustrating one that can't be justified. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-30/why-ea-canceled-a-new-black-panther-video-game-and-closed-cliffhanger-studios?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODYyODA1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5MjMyODU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWDM2MEFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.5NJqkn46ldc6n5M7d2faM7HRVe-P6bpFT21kj1vHHl8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> has shed a bit of light on why it was cancelled, as well as what the game might have been like.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, according to the report, the announcement came as a shock to Cliffhanger staff. This was in part because the studio was actively hiring, and Black Panther had passed a "gate", a term EA use for when executives look at how a game is doing and decide whether production should continue. 
</p>
<p>
Some sources did also say that EA executives were still frustrated it hadn't left pre-production despite being in the works for four years. That slowness was apparently due to the fact that a lot of now laid off staff were hired within the last year, even just the last few weeks and months.
</p>
<p>
The game itself sounded interesting too. Cliffhanger were being led by former Monolith head Kevin Stephens, the same studio behind the Middle-earth: Shadow series of games. Monolith's beloved (and patented) Nemesis System was apparently going to be the basis of a new system in Black Panther expanding on those ideas. This included things like being able to play as T’Challa, Killmonger and Shuri, all of which would be competing for the Black Panther role.
</p>
<p>
You'd be able to play as one of them, with the other two becoming rivals that you could form relationships with. There would be Skrulls, shapeshifting aliens, that would have been trying to overtake Wakanda, some of which might pretend to be allies, others acting based on previous things you as the player might have done. You can see the similarities to the Nemesis System.
</p>
<p>
However, showing off this feature to executives was apparently difficult; building a game and a studio side by side was part of the struggle here, reportedly. On top of that, Cliffhanger were based in Kirkland, Washington, an expensive city that meant staff would need appropriate (and deserved) wages. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-employees-upset-and-confused-at-return-to-office-mandate">EA also recently put in a return to office mandate</a>, so it all seems to add up to the game not being far enough along with a studio that costs too much to run, in their eyes. Probably worth a reminder that EA CEO Andrew Wilson and EA Entertainment president Laura Miele <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">took about $40 million home last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing is just tremendously unfair, and a massive shame. I would have loved to have seen a studio build upon the Nemesis System, easily one of the most interesting gameplay systems in the past decade locked behind something as stifling as a patent. As always, big solidarity to those affected by the layoffs.

<p><i>Line of Fire Burnt Moon&nbsp;</i>is listed as a card game, deck-building lane battler. It uses some mechanics from the awesome <em>Undaunted</em> series, but in a more compact package. It takes place in the same setting as <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>, with the LFA batting a group of hackers, rather than a group of protesting miners.</p>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> keeps the deck-building elements, action, and damage elements of <em>Undaunted</em>, meaning that you play each turn using the cards in your hand. 1 card is played each turn for its initiative value, and the remaining 3 are used for actions, either to place a drone on one of the 5 lanes, activate a drone already in a lane that matches the card being played, or gain an effect from a personnel card.</p>

<p>When a unit is damaged in <em>Line of Fire</em>, as with <em>Undaunted</em>, you remove a matching card from your hand, discard pile, deck, or board in that order, meaning that taking damage also affects your ability to activate a unit in the future, possibly that turn. You start the game with a set deck, and certain cards allow you to draw from your supply to your discard pile, waiting for your current deck to run out so they can be shuffled in. This allows you to tailor your deck as you play, drawing in the units that will be the most useful to you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-3.jpg?itok=v0embd7Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-3.jpg?itok=PVnup-bp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rather than on a game board,&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> takes place in lanes.</figcaption></figure><h2>Pick A Lane</h2>

<p>The deck-building elements are where the similarities to <em>Undaunted</em> end. Rather than taking place on a map with tokens, each player has 5 lanes that they are trying to control. <em>Line of Fire</em> is won when either player has 8 control points on the 5 lanes, or if their opponent has no MOSS-type units on the board. This changes the style of play from <em>Undaunted</em> dramatically, removing the strategic movement of the map and replacing it with lane control. This makes the board space a lot more compact for <em>Line of Fire</em>, but also means that you're going to be in your opponent's face, right from the start.</p>

<p>This immediacy has an effect on game length too, and games of <em>Line of Fire</em> can be extremely fast compared to <em>Undaunted</em>. There's also no randomness in the attacks, with attack and defence values fixed to the units and zone, and modified by controlling the zone, having certain types of units in the lane, and having fortifications present. This means that you always know in advance if your attack will be successful or not, and puts a focus on the activation order that you will take each round.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-6.jpg?itok=sJ9L5-sI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-6.jpg?itok=b8cNX7S_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lanes in&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon </em>can be controlled, and have fortifications built and destroyed on them.</figcaption></figure><h2>Choose a Side</h2>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> has 2 different factions, the corporate LFA and the POSIWID hackers. They both come with identical decks and a set of 5 identical lanes and are identified by unique artwork and the icon colors (blue for the LFA and pink for POSIWID). I initially felt like I wanted a difference in the forces, the different troop types in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em> gave each force a unique feel, but after a few games, the tighness of play and the ability to tailor your deck as you play means that an initial deviation in forces could have a signification impact on balance.</p>

<p>The short length of <em>Line of Fire</em> games means that every turn counts, and poor draws can have a big impact. There's a balance to be found in going first (which is a big advantage as you can decimate your opponents' turn by removing cards from their hand), with high initiative cards usually having the best abilities, and once used for initiative, they can't be used that round, and saving that card for a big effect, if you get a chance to after your opponents turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-2.jpg?itok=1hCytoQo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-2.jpg?itok=5Bc5CWl2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm a huge fan of how compact and tidy the&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon </em>components are.</figcaption></figure><p>The game length also means that if you are decimated, draw poorly, or make some bad supply draw choices, the game is usually over quickly, and you can jump straight back into another game. The quick setup and play also mean that you don't get heavily invested in a game, and losing and starting again isn't as painful as an evening-long strategic masterpiece.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting how well all the components fit together in the small box. Both forces have their own colored box to keep them separate, which also fits the fortifications and site tiles. The only other components are an initiative card, 4 player aid cards, and two tiny rulebooks, which makes the components as tight, clean, and compact as the table space it takes up, and the gameplay itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-5.jpg?itok=rZpqeI_B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-5.jpg?itok=ADbaJq6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Personel cards in&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon </em>have an ingame effect but aren't played into the lanes.</figcaption></figure><h2>Line of Fire Burnt Moon Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>My first thought was, 'Why is it not called <em>Undaunted</em>? I love <em>Undaunted</em> and this is <em>Undaunted</em>, right?' But I think that the <em>Line of Fire</em> name makes it clear that while there are <em>Undaunted</em> elements, this is new, and while players of <em>Undaunted</em> will feel comfortable, players who find <em>Undaunted</em> too complex, random, or too large on the tabletop shouldn't approach this expecting any of those things.</p>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> has gameplay as light and tight as the components that fit perfectly into the small box, but gameplay that well outgrows the small package. Games are fast and can be brutal, but the small play time means that if your opponent decimates you, you can get right back in for another quick game. The deck-building element means that small changes can have a big impact (good or bad), but the short game lengths mean that poor picks won't affect you for long. Players who like long-term deck-building strategy won't find it here, but players looking for a quick and sharp deck builder will love it.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is, to the surprise of no one, <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928451382111052101">off to a bit of a flying start</a> (even if not everyone is completely in love with it just yet). I have no intention of diving into it just yet, in part because the solo experience doesn't interest me all that much, and I don't really want to be matched up with two other randos that would surely abandon me the moment I forget what my character can do. There isn't a duos option either, the thing I'm actually after, something that was a bit forgotten about during development, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/couples-afraid-of-being-third-wheeled-rejoice-fromsoftware-might-add-in-a-duos-option-to-elden-ring-nightreign">but might be coming further down the line</a>. The power of modding always comes through however, as despite only launching yesterday, there's already a seamless co-op mod that allows for duos.
</p>

<p>
Aptly titled <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/3">Seamless Co-op (Nightreign)</a>, those of you that have previously indulged in a bit of seamless co-op in other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslikes</a> won't be surprised to hear that it comes from none other than Yui. She made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-lets-you-play-the-entire-game-with-a-friend">the original Elden Ring Seamless Co-op mod a few years ago</a>, alongside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-the-duskbloods-who-needs-them-now-that-dark-souls-seamless-co-op-mod-is-here">Dark Souls Remastered one last month</a>.

<p>
Much like those two mods, this one allows you to play online with a friend without all of the usual faff you'll find in FromSoft's games, even if it is easier to play with others in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-best-character-tier-list">Nightreign</a> than usual.
</p>
<p>
Right now, the mod is pretty simple. You can either create two or three player lobbies, and play online with them. Yui says that "there will be more to come, but whilst the current game lacks 2-player modes, this mod will be available in this state." Don't worry about it banning you from regular online either, as it prevents your game from even connecting to any matchmaking servers in the first place. What more could you ask for!

<p><a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928822575318126753">In a post on X/Twitter</a>, the developer said: "If you have difficulty matchmaking on PS4 &amp; PS5, please check your NAT type. NAT type 3 may affect matchmaking on PSN.</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY: </strong> If you're jumping into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> this weekend and are struggling to find a Player 2 - and/or a Player 3 - you're not alone.</p>
<p>In a brief statement posted to official Elden Ring social media accounts about an hour ago (Saturday, 31st May), developer FromSoftware is recommending players "restart the matchmaking process" if they're struggling to find a co-op partner.</p>

<p>It may not quite fix the issue for all players, however; as one commenter asked in the replies: "How often am I supposed to restart it? Yesterday I spend [sic] several hours restarting it on PS5 to not even play one match…"</p>
<p>Finding a co-op partner is pretty important for Nightreign players. As Ed wrote yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">he wouldn't recommend Nightreign as a solo game</a> at this point as it's clearly not the intended way to play. However, it seems FromSoftware is aiming to respond to the current backlash to make solo play more feasible, with the studio previously stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">considering a two-player option post-launch</a>, acknowledging it was "something that was overlooked during development".</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," Ed wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What’s more, the rear triggers feature adjustable stops, so you can control how far they can be pressed and fine-tune your response time in shooters and other competitive games.</p><p>Additionally, the Edge offers the same haptics and adaptive triggers found on Sony’s standard DualSense controller, along with two styles of rear paddles, each suited to a different grip preference. Its charging cable also features a handy locking mechanism to ensure it won’t get yanked out while gaming; however, the Edge is limited to approximately eight hours of battery life when used wirelessly, meaning it doesn’t last quite as long as the OG DualSense. I guess that’s the price you pay for souped-up components and software, at least with Sony.</p><div><p id="more-ways-to-save-this-weekend"><h2>More ways to save this weekend</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Now through tomorrow, June 1st, you can grab the last-gen <strong>Oura Ring Generation 3</strong> at Wellbots in the <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Foura-ring-gen3-heritage" rel="sponsored">Heritage configuration</a> for $195 ($104 off) or the <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Foura-ring-gen3-horizon" rel="sponsored">Horizon config</a> for $210 ($90 off) when using coupon code <strong>OURAVERGE25</strong>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/677301/the-switch-2s-promising-start-hides-an-uncertain-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With the Switch 2 launch days away, analysts and consumers are watching to see how well Nintendo can follow-up the best selling home console in its history. Judging from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655361/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sold-out-walmart-gamestop-target">the pain of trying to secure a Switch 2 pre-order</a>, it seems like Nintendo has nothing to worry about – at least at launch.</p><p>Down the line, however, concerns about tariffs, a steadily rising cost of living, and a saturated market might cast a shadow on the Switch 2. <em>The Verge</em> talked to analysts, journalists, and normal video game playing people to put the Switch 2 launch in perspective. The key takeaway? While the console will assuredly have another blockbuster debut, its future looks much less certain.</p><p>The Wii U gets brought up a lot in the conversation surrounding the Switch 2, as it’s the most famous example of a Nintendo failure. “The Wii U, with its confusing controller-screen gimmick, sluggish user interface, and lack of a great <em>Custom Robo</em> game, was one of Nintendo’s worst flops,” <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/"><em>GameFile</em></a> author Stephen Totilo explained in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. </p><p>It sold less than 14 million units, a dramatic drop from the Wii, which sold over 100 million. And while Nintendo expects to sell one million more Switch 2 units in its first year than the Wii U sold in its life, that’s not necessarily indicative of long-term success. “The Wii U nevertheless sold out at launch back in November 2012,” Totilo said, “pulling in sales that <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/arts/nintendo-wii-u-hardware-sales-411119/">reportedly</a> topped the US launch sales of the Xbox 360 and PS3.”</p><p>When looking at launch sales projections and predictions, Mat Piscatella, video game analyst for Circana, warned that what a console does during its launch period is no indication of what it’ll do overall. </p><p>“Sales around the launch period are more reflection of available supply than anything,” Piscatella said. Another, more important factor for a console launch is the audience. “With anything regarding gaming right now, we have to separate the enthusiast market from the mass market, because they’re behaving very differently,” Piscatella added. </p><p>According to Piscatella, it’s the enthusiasts driving most of the Switch 2 hype we’re seeing, particularly since the last major console launches – the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S – happened five years ago. “We haven’t had new hardware designed for the masses in a long time,” he said. “So we have a big pent up demand just for something new.” </p><p>We’re seeing part of that demand satisfied by the Switch 2 pre-order frenzy. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">day pre-orders opened in the US</a> (after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">a few weeks’ delay</a> because of President Donald Trump’s tariff chicanery) they sold out within hours. GameStop held in-store pre order events that saw people <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/655949/switch-2-in-person-preorder-gamestop">lining up outside storefronts</a> for hours to secure one.</p><p>But what will really determine the success of the console is how the bigger, mass market reacts, the same one that made devices like the Wii and original Switch such hits. Piscatella says this group is biding its time right now, “leaning into free-to-play and the content they already have.”</p><p>It’s a tricky time for the industry. New blockbuster titles are getting ever more expensive to make. Consumers, in turn, are buying fewer of them in favor of spending their time and money in established games, all while persistent layoffs three years running are making it harder for new games to come out on time. Add that to 2025’s unique and volatile US tariff situation and the associated price increases, and now is one <em>hell </em>of a time to launch a video game console.</p><p>“A games console is for a lot of people [...] an unaffordable luxury, especially for families,” said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/keza-macdonald">Keza MacDonald</a>, video game editor at <em>The Guardian </em>and author of a forthcoming book about Nintendo’s history. MacDonald believes that most people who want a Switch 2 will have already pre-ordered one and that Nintendo’s real work will be to convince everyone else they want one too – a job the company doesn’t seem to be doing that well.</p><p>Silvie Krekow, a gamer who works at Vox Media as a creative director, says she knows “almost nothing” about the Switch 2. She doesn’t frequent gaming websites or consume gaming media, but she noted it was odd that “a 33-year-old gamer with disposable income who owns a Switch, PS4, and Xbox One” didn’t casually come across at least <em>some</em> Switch 2 information.</p><p>Other colleagues and self-described “gaming casuals” I spoke to expressed similar sentiments. According to MacDonald, Nintendo is handling this launch period very conservatively. “It’s like, ‘We know everyone’s going to buy this anyway. We don’t have to sell you on it,’” she said. “But I’m not sure if that’s true.”</p><div><p>At the Switch 2 Direct in April, Nintendo showed off a console with some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">slight quality-of-life and performance upgrades</a>. That may work for the enthusiasts – <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">they get more of what they already liked about the original</a>. But without something more to entice consumers beyond the diehards, the Switch 2 may struggle to find its audience.</p></div><p>“As for the [Switch 2 features] I’m not particularly excited,” said Kushal Raval, an operations manager at Vox Media. “The rolling controller sounds interesting, but the voice chat feature seems a bit pointless.” </p><p>Kushal owns a Switch, which he said didn’t run games like <em>Fortnite</em> as well as he wanted. And while the Switch 2’s technical upgrades will likely improve this, Kushal said, “With a $450–$500 price tag, I’m leaning much more toward getting a Steam Deck.”</p><p>The Switch 2 also has to compete against people content with its predecessor. “I have a Switch Lite that I bought during the pandemic,” said Jackie Noack, a video producer at Vox Media. “My husband has the Switch 1, and I don’t think we use them quite enough to justify replacing them.” For Noack, the console’s price is also a major factor. “$500 does seem steep to me!”</p><p>The Switch 2 will not be a dud like the Wii U, but it likely will not reach the heights of the original Switch. The price and lack of defining new features are two reasons, but perhaps the biggest is that the circumstances that fostered the OG Switch’s success were incredibly unique.</p><p>“The Switch really picked up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22188452/animal-crossing-new-horizons-coronavirus-pandemic-year-2020">during the pandemic with <em>Animal Crossing</em></a>. That was an enormous hit,” MacDonald said. “And obviously that was such a unique combination of circumstances, I’m not sure that could happen again.” Piscatella agrees: “The Switch is an outlier success. I think [the Switch 2] is unlikely to do Switch numbers in the long term.”</p><p>The lead up to the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 has been filled with so much built-up pressure from the anticipation of hungry gamers eager for any news, which was exacerbated by prolific leaks and Nintendo’s typical propensity for silence. With the console’s official reveal and the enthusiastic response from dedicated fans, that pressure could not be higher – and with launch coming next week, the release valve is finally about to open.</p><p>“Simply because of the logo on the box, it’s safe to say that the Switch 2 is too Nintendo to fail,” said Totilo. “At least in the early going.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/is-marathon-the-best-chance-extraction-shooters-have-to-break-into-the-mainstream<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Late last month, mega publisher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn">EA fired 300 workers</a>, including around <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted">100 at developer Respawn</a>. The studio, founded by ex-Call of Duty developers, is responsible for Apex Legends and the Star Wars Jedi games, and was reportedly working on a third game in its beloved Titanfall series before its staff roster was cut. Now cancelled, the rumours suggest that this Titanfall project was an extraction shooter – a difficult-by-design PvPvE genre that currently only enjoys niche popularity. But an extraction shooter set in the world of Titanfall and Apex Legends could have been the genre’s ticket to the big leagues. So if not EA, who will take the “Tarkov-like” beyond its enthusiastic niche and into the mainstream? The answer may be just months away.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we’ve made select changes within our organization that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth," an EA spokesperson said of the layoffs that cut away at Respawn. It’s a sentiment EA employees have heard before. This move follows a rash of downsizing in other segments of EA’s portfolio, including at developers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs">Codemasters</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">BioWare</a>, and a more general <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">670 company-wide employees</a> back in March of last year. This trend has many decrying the state of the games industry as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-this-bad-game-developers-explain-the-huge-layoffs-hitting-riot-epic-and-more">unsustainable</a> and calling for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-workers-form-first-north-american-industry-wide-union-with-communications-workers-of-america">unionization</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what of that rumored Titanfall extraction shooter? Naturally, its apparent cancellation has many fans disappointed; the existence (and lack of public appearance) of a new Titanfall game has become something of an in-joke in recent years. Further, rumors of a new extraction shooter from a triple-A studio has shone a spotlight on a style of game that has struggled to garner a significant audience thus far. And whether or not the cancelled Respawn title was indeed an extraction shooter, more people are discussing the potential of a genre that is in its infancy.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is an enthusiast genre which has, thus far, not significantly broken out to the mass market player,” Mat Piscatella, Video Games Industry Advisor at Circana, tells IGN.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, developer Bungie finally revealed gameplay footage for Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter that some predict will launch the genre into the mainstream. It's a game that's already found itself in hot water, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-developer-bungie-launches-thorough-review-after-once-again-being-found-to-have-used-work-from-an-uncredited-artist">accused of plagarising art assets</a>. But while there are ethical questions around Marathon's production, the response to the game itself after press went <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-hands-on-preview-can-bungie-do-to-escape-from-tarkov-what-fortnite-did-to-pubg">hands-on with it </a>seems largely positive. Perhaps this is to be expected from the studio with a reputation for stellar first-person shooter experiences like Halo and Destiny. But, come September, Marathon will be launching into a very different market, and the extraction shooter is a relatively untested genre. Will pedigree and tight FPS design be enough to carry the game to success? Analysts say: perhaps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If I were to bet on any developer being able to bring this genre to the mass market it would be Bungie,” Piscatella says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar, extraction shooters tend to be made up of a combination of player-versus-player and player-versus-environment gameplay loops. Small squads of players are dropped into a world, where they fight AI enemies and sometimes other player-controlled squads, to complete goals and gather resources, then escape the map. The genre was popularized by Escape From Tarkov, an incredibly unforgiving take on the formula characterized by its high-risk, high-reward firefights, which garnered a respectable audience during the COVID-19 lockdowns. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If I were to bet on any developer being able to bring this genre to the mass market it would be Bungie.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, a number of other developers have tried their hand at the genre with varying degrees of success. One of the most prominent is last year’s Helldivers 2, developed by Arrowhead Game Studios and published by Sony. It leans heavily on a campy schtick, community engagement, and in-game events, which has made it a standout among extraction shooters. Also, and perhaps most importantly, it’s a co-op only affair, with none of the tense PvP encounters that make games like Escape from Tarkov so challenging. According to Piscatella’s data, Helldivers 2 was the eighth most-played game on Steam in April, and ranked 34 on PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Helldivers 2 is the outlier success among this group,” Piscatella explains. “In April, approximately 9% of US active Steam users played Helldivers 2, while around 3% of PS5 players engaged with the game at least once. No other [extraction shooter] reached more than 2.3% of active players on any platform on which that particular game was played.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s immediately obvious that these stats are small when compared to more popular genres like battle royale or multiplayer FPS games. As hugely popular as Helldivers 2 seems to dedicated PlayStation owners, the mainstream is Fortnite, Call of Duty, and EA’s FC – games that garner much, much larger audiences. But Piscatella is quick to point out that the extraction shooter is a burgeoning genre with a great deal of potential, and it faces the same challenges as any other genre does in its early days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Small or developing genres often only get big after one game makes it so,” he says. “The dance/music genre was a pretty small niche until Guitar Hero showed up. Console FPS games didn't usually sell all that well at all until Halo. MMOs comprised a relatively small portion of the market until World of Warcraft became the biggest thing in the world. Maybe Marathon does that for extraction shooters. Maybe it doesn't. Nothing is guaranteed for any new game in today's market.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/marathon-1-1747388849733.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Other popular games in the extraction shooter genre include Deep Rock Galactic, Hunt: Showdown 1896, and Delta Force. The latter is a free-to-play title launched late last year and has been enjoying a steady rise in popularity in recent months: as of this writing, it ranks 15th in daily players on Steam, with somewhere around 135,000 players at peak. This is a respectable number, but nowhere near the numbers consistently put up by the battle royale genre and its titans. And let’s face it: executives have exhibited a certain amount of tunnel vision chasing the high monetization bars set by the Fortnites, Warzones, and PUBGs of the world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an argument that this sort of fixation has led to a certain amount of creative stagnation in the development space, and studio heads are less willing to take a chance on an unproven genre such as extraction shooters (it’s perhaps telling that Call of Duty’s attempt at it was an under-supported, now abandoned mode added to Warzone, rather than its own flagship release). In that way, Marathon represents the first significant triple-A effort to bring the genre to the masses. And it’s going to need all the help it can get along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bungie being the developer certainly does not guarantee Marathon success,” Piscatella says. “In order for [it] to break through it would certainly help if the game could win over dedicated fans of the genre so they could advocate for the game among family and friends.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest challenge facing Marathon is the untested nature of the extraction shooter genre as a whole.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond word of mouth, Bungie will need to ensure smooth onboarding for prospective players. In particular, converting core players familiar with first-person shooters will likely figure into Bungie’s rollout strategy, but long-term retention will all boil down to the gameplay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It would…be helpful if Marathon were to have a ramping path for people that are more familiar with the big FPS titles like Call of Duty to help initiate trial and conversion,” Piscatella explains. “It would also have to nail the whole ‘easy to pick up, difficult to master’ trick that many mass market hits are able to pull off.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reality is that these are all the same problems faced by any new title, and the one true decider of success or failure is the market, which, as Piscatella points out, is extremely unwelcoming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is a very fickle market at the moment. People have their favorite long-running games that are constantly being updated, are familiar, have significant social and monetary hooks, and many of these titles are free-to-play or easily accessible without an upfront purchase price. So, the challenges facing Bungie and Marathon are not dissimilar to those facing any new game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fickle market notwithstanding, the biggest challenge facing Marathon is the untested nature of the extraction shooter genre as a whole. Escape From Tarkov has enjoyed its accolades, but that game benefitted from an audience inflated by pandemic lockdowns, as well as a gameplay loop that appealed to the core gamer segment. Subsequent titles have only seen middling performances (with Helldivers 2 being the outlier), so it’s easy to understand why studios have been reticent to devote significant resources to such a project, especially when the battle royale genre has proven its dominance.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that way, Marathon should prove to be a useful litmus test for the rest of the industry. It’s surprising to see a studio like Bungie going all-in on an extraction shooter in this environment, and if it receives a strong reception you can expect other developers and publishers to take its lead. Of course there are dozens of factors to account for - things like monetization and market trends - and nobody can predict how things will unfold. But Bungie certainly has the clout and design chops to make something special. And it’s going to take something special to take the extraction shooter genre from niche to mainstream. You can be sure that, come September, the industry will be eagerly watching the launch of Marathon. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>For those who are not familiar with Football Manager, it is easy to assume that the series is just about football. After all, you choose a team to manage, get a squad together, pick some tactics, and hope they work out to take your team to glory. It is easy to come to that conclusion. It is also wrong. Football Manager 2024 is a game that’s about so much more than just football. It’s really just the cover to a game about interpersonal relationships, and the importance of how managing them is integral to success or failure.</p>
<h2>The connection between players and manager</h2>
<p>The most crucial relationships in Football Manager 24 are between you and your players. You are managing people at different stages of their careers, from the youngsters just taking their first steps into the world of professional football to those who are experienced and close to retirement. Just like any workplace, each individual has their own needs, wants, and goals. If you’re a good manager, you will help each of these players to meet their expectations and exceed them in some cases. One player may want to be seen as the most important player at the club, while another will want to go out on loan to gain valuable experience. Others can make demands of you to make improvements to the club or push you to back other players in the squad.</p>
<p>Dealing with the different demands and promises made of a small group is hard enough, but now imagine that for a squad of 25 or more players? Not everyone will get what they want, no matter how hard you try. If you have two players wanting to play in the same position, and there is one who is clearly better than the other, your job as manager is to pick the better player for the good of the club. You can do your best to support the other player, such as placing them on loan, but this can upset them just as much as not playing. Making too many promises comes with its own issues. Break a promise to one player and you might get away with it, depending on their influence on the team, but keep breaking promises and the squad will turn on you making it almost impossible to get success on the pitch, putting your own job at risk.</p>



<p>No manager really wants to admit it, but everyone has their favourites. Some players will be backed no matter what because of how good they are, while a player who doesn’t take their chances will start to be ignored, leading to a breakdown in your relationship. However, your favourites can also turn on you when the transfer windows open, demanding to be sold to someone else, no matter what you say. At the same time, the player you ignored may not want to leave and try to prove they can be better.</p>

<p>All of this just scratches the surface of how relationships with players works in Football Manager 2024, and it can be a source of more frustration than losing 1-0 in a league match where your team had 15 shots while the opposition had one. Players are not the only group you have to have a good relationship with though.</p>
<h2>The connection between the backroom staff and manager</h2>
<p>The players are the public-facing part of the football club, with their performances there for all to see. However, those performance and player development depends on the hidden engine which is the backroom staff. Assistant managers, coaches, the medical team, and the recruitment team all influence the club’s success, with the advice they can give you and how they help your players.</p>
<p>The relationship system with your backroom staff is not as deep as it is with players, but it still matters. For example, if you find an exceptional coach that is great for your team’s development you will want to keep them happy, lest another club comes in and offers them a job. You can convince them to stay with you, usually with a better contract, but if you do not know their needs they will decide to leave.</p>

<p>The whole backroom squad is also reliant on your for their jobs, and at times you need to be ruthless. Better coaches and scouts may become available, meaning you weigh up keeping a current staff member or deciding to get rid of them and bring someone with better attributes in. It is not a simple decision, because firing someone usually means paying them some compensation which can also impact your club finances.</p>
<p>The backroom team has as much power as you allow them to have. As a manager you might want to control everything or, like me, delegate responsibility for things like training. You can choose to have meetings regularly with your staff too, discussing things like recruitment policies and player development. Their suggestions can help you decide if a staff member fits your vision, or is providing information that is useless, so firing them is the better option. Like the players, it is all about managing staff expectations and doing what is best for the club, even it means letting people go and angering them in the process.</p>
<h2>The connection to the board</h2>
<p>While you have management power over players and the backroom staff, you are not the final authority. Just like most of us in real life, you also have a boss in Football Manager 2024 and you need to meet their expectations to keep your own job. When you start at a club, the board will set you targets to meet. Unhappy players and staff can be managed, but an unhappy board of directors is a sign you are not going to last long in your post.</p>

<p>What you have to do here is apply techniques of managing upwards, influencing your board to come to your way of thinking. Some boards are easier to persuade than others, especially those with some money behind them. Those with poor finances will need convincing that your requests will turn the club around. When you make a request a board may decide to implement it or reject it. If they reject you can try to convince them or give them an ultimatum. Much like real life, ultimatums rarely work so it probably isn’t a good idea unless the board really likes you.</p>
<p>Boards will like you if you are meeting their targets, which vary club to club. Some will want you to focus on building up the youth squad for long term success, so convincing them to build better youth training facilities should be easy. Others will want you to focus on club finances by buying and selling players for profit or reducing the wage budget. Meet these expectations and the board will listen to you. Fail and you’ll be sitting in front of them convincing them to keep your job.</p>
<h2>The connection between the fans, media and manager</h2>
<p>There are two other groups that will help decide your fate with those being the club fans and the media. As a manager you have a responsibility to engage with these stakeholders too. Fans are similar to the board in that they have their expectations, and if they are unhappy that will influence the board. Their expectations usually align, so the only way to keep them happy is to meet or exceed them, as there is no direct way to chat to a fan spokesperson about club issues.</p>

<p>The media is another matter. They will contact you for quotes about club happenings, grill you over new signings, and want to chat post-match. Each sports journalist will form an opinion of you, with some loving you and others absolutely loathing you. How they view you impacts the way they write their stories, which will influence relationships with others other managers, the fans, the players, and the board.</p>
<p>How do you manage the media? By providing them some juicy quotes and tidbits, so they want to keep you happy so you provide more information. How do you turn the media against you? Well, keep your information close to your chest or just don’t engage with them. They will write stories that are not great for you, but as a manager you need to put the club first.</p>

<hr>
<p>Football Manager 24 is not just a football management game. It is a relationship game which is set in the world of football. You have to meet the expectations of players, the board, fans, and staff. Just like real life relationships, each one has different ways to navigate them so that people feel valued, but just like in reality, you cannot keep everyone happy all of the time. Sometimes things will work out for you and the relationships are all positive which is great, but if things start to break down it can lead to a messy breakup with the club.</p>

This one is an ice dragon that specializes in AOE attacks, which can be annoying. However, there’s a special in-game event that could help you out immensely if you’re lucky.</p><h2 id="h1092444"><a id="1"></a>Preparation</h2><p>Being made of ice, Caligo’s weakness is fire, so it’s important to find a fire elemental weapon during your expedition. Just look for structures on the map with the fire icon and defeat the bosses there for a chance at earning a corresponding elemental weapon..</p><p>If the Mountaintop Shifting Earth event is active, trekking up the mountain to get the bonus at the end is worth it. Shifting Earth events are random occurrences in the game that will change a part of Limveld’s map. </p><p>If you reach the top of Mountaintop, you’ll earn a passive buff that will greatly increase your frost resistance as well as increase your damage against dragons. Since we’re going up against an ice dragon, Mountaintop is definitely worth tackling on Day Two where you’ll have more of a fighting chance against the monsters there.</p><p>Ranged classes like Ironeye are helpful too as you can aim for Caligo’s head.</p><h2 id="h1092445"><a id="2"></a>Strategies for fighting Caligo</h2><figure id="" data-id="225d8cae93ab74f345d02d6720c16f1d" data-recommend-id="image://225d8cae93ab74f345d02d6720c16f1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player races toward Caligo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player races toward Caligo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="225d8cae93ab74f345d02d6720c16f1d" data-recommend-id="image://225d8cae93ab74f345d02d6720c16f1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player races toward Caligo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Caligo is gigantic, even by Nightlord standards. As such, it doesn’t move nearly as often as others and that can make for an easy target. It’ll typically swipe with its claws, but that attack is easily telegraphed and dodged by rolling forward.</p><p>Caligo will start incorporating ice into its attacks, such as its freezing breath. This attack spreads out in a cone, so be sure to dodge roll <em>behind </em>Caligo. There is another breath attack where Caligo will stand on its hind legs and breathe fog directly down in front of it. The same strategy as before applies here—get behind Caligo. This attack can also form icicles on the ground that will inflict damage and build up frostbite should you touch them. Avoid these.</p><figure id="" data-id="2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-recommend-id="image://2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The entire sky is blotted out with a icey fog." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The entire sky is blotted out with a icey fog." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-recommend-id="image://2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The entire sky is blotted out with a icey fog." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Eventually, Caligo will cover the entire screen with fog. You’ll also sometimes see a gust of black wind heading in a specific direction at the same time. Follow it until you find a pillar of ice to hide behind. This will shield you from Caligo’s upcoming huge ice wave attack. </p><figure id="" data-id="6fc3ab7e4e50b41234431eae71a4dfd3" data-recommend-id="image://6fc3ab7e4e50b41234431eae71a4dfd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A surge of ice stretches across the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A surge of ice stretches across the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6fc3ab7e4e50b41234431eae71a4dfd3" data-recommend-id="image://6fc3ab7e4e50b41234431eae71a4dfd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A surge of ice stretches across the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In a variation of this attack, Caligo will summon a gigantic sheet of ice to come crashing down into the ground. The sound of ice cracking signals this attack. Unfortunately, right now it seems like the only way to avoid this attack is to run as fast as you can away from the noise and pray that you’re out of the ice sheet’s range before the fog lifts and the sheet comes crashing down.</p><figure id="" data-id="01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-recommend-id="image://01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ice forms around the player while the dragon boss flies into the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ice forms around the player while the dragon boss flies into the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-recommend-id="image://01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ice forms around the player while the dragon boss flies into the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Caligo will also fly around and summon meteors to hit you. This is the most mobile it’ll be through the entire fight. Fortunately, this move is rather rare and easier to dodge than Caligo’s other ones.</p><p>Arguably, Caligo is a more annoying boss battle than it is a hard one, especially due to how much space its attacks cover. Timing your expedition with the Mountaintop event will make the fight significantly easier, so make sure you get every advantage you can.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/677197/playdate-season-2-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A lot of games have been released for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">the Playdate since it launched in 2022</a>, as a quick browse of <a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate">itch.io</a> or <a href="https://play.date/games/">the Catalog shop</a> will attest. But still, there’s something unique about the handheld’s seasonal format, which just kicked off its second iteration. When it first launched, the Playdate came with 24 games from notable indie developers that were steadily released on a weekly cadence, making a perfect introduction to the little yellow device and its crank. Now, a few years later, we finally have season 2, and it’s off to a solid start — and it even includes a bizarre mystery.</p><p>The new season runs for the next six weeks and totals a dozen games, two of which will drop each week. <a href="https://play.date/games/seasons/two/">The entire collection will run you $39</a>. To start, we have a pair of very different games. <em>Fulcrum Defender</em>, from <em>FTL: Faster Than Light</em> developer Subset Games, is sort of like a modern take on <em>Asteroids</em>. You control a little ship in the middle and fire guns at little squares flying toward you. The twist is that you use the crank to rotate the ship around and aim your shots. There’s also something of a roguelike element, where you steadily unlock random upgrades like new weapons or a larger spread for your bullets. The goal is to last for 10 straight minutes.</p><p>It’s a pretty challenging game — so far, I’ve only really had success on easy mode — but it’s also surprisingly chill, eliciting that sort of zen state that the best shooters and puzzle games can create. This is helped by its lo-fi soundtrack that pretty much demands you play with headphones on. It’s an absorbing game.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum is <em>Dig Dig Dino!</em>, developed by Dom2D and Fáyer, who brag that the game “is perfect to play while watching TV! No time pressure, no quick reflexes needed!” It’s a puzzle game where you travel to different dig sites to uncover dinosaur bones, artifacts, and trash. You only have a limited amount of moves per dig, but you can upgrade your capacity over time — while also getting new tools to smash rocks or dig deeper — letting you dig both more and for longer. It’s sort of like a really cute take on <em>Minesweeper</em>, one clearly designed for short play sessions. It’s not exactly difficult, but there’s still something satisfying about uncovering a large dinosaur bone when you’re just about to run out of moves.</p><p>These two games do a good job of showing the breadth of games possible on the Playdate; one is meant for quick bursts, the other for longer, more focused sessions. But the launch week package is rounded out by something a whole lot weirder. It’s called <em>Blippo Plus</em> and, well, it’s a series of TV channels you can flip between using the crank. Some are nothing but static, while others have giant FMV videos of strange TV shows or commercials. One show, called <em>Tantric Computing,</em> is nothing but closeup shots of someone using a computer mouse. Another, <em>Werf’s Tavern</em>, is some kind of musical talk show. There’s also a messaging tool and some kind of fax service.</p><p>What’s most interesting about <em>Blippo Plus</em>, though, isn’t just that it’s odd. It’s also a mystery that seems like it will evolve over the course of the season. Playdate maker Panic says that “Playdate season 2 owners should tune in weekly and make sure they are connected to WiFi when season 2 updates at 10 AM PT on Thursdays.” There are lots of other promising games planned for season 2, including the point-and-click adventure <em>Shadowgate PD</em> and whatever the heck <em>Long Puppy</em> and <em>Tiny Turnip</em> are.</p><p>But an FMV mystery that unfolds over the course of weeks is something that’s pretty unique to this format — and further evidence that the Playdate exists in its own parallel universe.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Next week is set to be just about the busiest week of the year. More than that, with the Switch 2 launch, Summer Games Fest and even some developers and publishers choosing the back end of next week to launch, it’s going to be the busiest 72-hours in video gamedom.</p>
<p>But before we get to that, let’s look back on the week that was.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman’s&nbsp;</strong>sadly run into a progress breaking bug in Oblivion and doesn’t fancy replaying a whole chunk of the game to rectify it. So he’s hopped into the Skyrim and Elden Ring inspired Tainted Grail… which is also quite buggy, but does at least have active devs working on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead and we’ll see you back here next week!</p>
