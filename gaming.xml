            <p>
Stop Destroying Videogames - the European campaign inspired by the Stop Killing Games movement - says it's "confident" its petition will progress to the legislative phase now that 15 EU countries have successfully verified almost half of its 1.4m signatures between them.
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames is looking to convince the EU to pass regulations preventing "the remote disabling of video games by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said video games without the involvement from the side of the publisher." Its European Citizens' Initiative - an official EU mechanism designed to provide a way for citizens to propose a legal act to the European Commission - surpassed the required 1m signatures before the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci">petition</a> closed in July, meaning it can be presented to the EU for either a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament provided those signatures can be successfully verified.
</p>
<p>
Writing in September, Stop Destroying Videogames said it expected the verification process to take around three months, and it's now shared a progress report in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1og0kb3/stop_killing_games_announcement/">new post to the Stop Killing Games campaign's subreddit</a>. "Out of 1,448,270 signatures, 689,035 are already verified, and 15 countries have met their thresholds," petition organisers explained. "We are still missing the two largest countries - Germany and France - but based on our current progress, we are confident we have surpassed the required thresholds." They added only about 3 percent of signatures have failed verification so far.
</p>
<p>
According to the update, Stop Destroying Videogames organisers have been engaged in "intense discussions" with Members of the European Parliament, national governments, political parties, and the European Commission throughout the verification process, ready for the legislative phase. It's also been working to secure expert backing from academics, explaining, "Having politicians, lobbyists, and developers in our ranks is invaluable, but we must credibly address the tough questions." Organisers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-stop-destroying-videogames-petition-verification-continues-in-eu-organisers-preparing-to-counter-misinformation-and-industry-lobbying">previously said</a> they were taking steps to counter "misinformation and industry lobbying".
</p><p>
"Our fight is not against a united CEO front," the update continues. "It's against a handful of companies holding our favourite games hostage... Let's not just talk about developers but with them, big and small, who are already resisting these awful practices. We can't undo past damage, but we can stop what's coming. If we allow these few bad actors to dictate the future, we will continue to lose ground on issues that should never have arisen."
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames' update concludes with a call for EU citizens to reach out to their governments, local consumer protection groups, and favourite studios in order to spread the word. It also encourages developers to make their voices heard. "We are already in talks with many in the industry," it explains. "If we’ve missed you... please reach out to us... We are planning public events and want to bring some of you in front of parliament to demonstrate how things could be."
</p>
<p>In July, EU industry body Video Games Europe - whose members include Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - insisted the initiative's proposals <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">would make games "prohibitively expensive to create"</a>.</p>

            <p>The US government's use of AI-generated Halo imagery on social media has absolutely been a power-play to appeal to like-minded American gamers.</p>
<p>As if there were any doubt, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link">White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai told journalist Alyssa Mercante</a> overnight: "Yet another war ended under President Trump's watch - only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J. Trump. That's why he's hugely popular with the American people and American Gamers."</p>
<p>Desai's comments were made in relation to <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">an image tweeted by the Department of Homeland Security</a>, which showed a picture of a Halo ring world and two spartan soldiers in a Warthog jeep - one driving it and the other on top of it, operating the machine-gun turret. The soldiers appear below the words "Destroy the Flood" and a call to join the Immigration Customs Enforcement group, ICE.</p>
<p>The Flood are the primary antagonists in the Halo franchise - a parasitic lifeform which overran the galaxy. The reference here in the ICE promotional image, then, is depressingly clear: the Flood represents the immigrants ICE seeks to forcefully detain.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>The US government's use of AI-generated Halo imagery started at the weekend, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">Microsoft announced a remake of the Halo: Combat Evolved campaign</a> will be coming to PC, Xbox and - for the first time - PlayStation. In response, <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982213786221109263">US games retailer GameStop posted a memey statement declaring the console wars dead</a> - the inference being that now Halo, the series that epitomised the rivalry between Xbox and PlayStation, was heading to Sony's machine, the console wars were effectively over.</p><p>The White House X account responded to this <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632">with an AI-generated image of Donald Trump as Master Chief</a>, holding a blue energy sword and saluting in front of an American flag, which doesn't have the correct amount of state-stars on it. "Power to the Players," the tweet read.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982654845166428607">GameStop replied with another AI-generated Halo image</a> showing Trump's face in Master Chief's helmet, and holographic AI companion Cortana as Vice President JD Vance nearby. GameStop hasn't tweeted since.</p>
<p>All eyes now are on Microsoft and whether it will do anything about the unsanctioned use of AI-generated Halo imagery to promote political causes such as this. Microsoft has not commented on the matter and I expect never will, though I've asked through official channels all the same.</p>
<p>However, we can find depressing precedent in the recent lack of action (or effect) by Nintendo's legal team to do anything about the US Department of Homeland Security using imagery and music from Pokémon to promote ICE causes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-confirms-that-no-its-imagery-was-not-granted-for-use-in-disturbing-us-department-of-homeland-security-video">The Pokémon Company even publicly confirmed it had not sanctioned the use of Pokémon  assets in this way</a>, further underlining its apparent powerlessness to change the situation.</p><p>That, then, is what I expect this latest Halo-related display is: another power-play. Another demonstration that as unsanctioned and abhorrent as the use of the Halo imagery is, and enormously powerful as Microsoft is, it probably won't be able to force the US government to take it down.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>EA is pushing its employees to use AI for basically every task, but the results can be flawed, resulting in more work for developers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> recently talked with current EA staff, who confirmed that the company's leadership has spent the past year or so pushing its 15,000 employees to use AI for virtually every task, from producing code and concept art for games to advising managers how to speak to staff about a certain number of topics, including pay or promotions.</p>



<p>The AI tools used to produce code are among those creating the most issues for developers. It is reported that these tools produce flawed code that requires manual fixing. Other developers are concerned about the AI software training they are expected to do with their own work, which could decrease the demand for concept artists and level designers.</p>



<p>Heavy AI usage also puts QA roles at risk. One former employee at Respawn, one of EA's biggest studios, said that they were laid off this Spring, along with around 100 other employees, because the company was using AI to review and summarize feedback from play testers, work previously conducted by human employees like the ones that were fired.</p>



<p>Although heavy AI usage in game development and related tasks poses a real danger to jobs in the field, not every developer is against its use. Masahiro Sakurai, creator of the Super Smash Bros. series, believes that <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">using generative AI can improve efficiency and make large-scale development sustainable</a> in the current age, especially in Japan, where the talent pool is getting smaller and smaller. Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear and Death Stranding series, also has a positive view on generative AI, seeing it as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">way to boost efficiency while he can focus on the creative part of game development. </a></p>

            <p>The USA's Immigration Customs Enforcement service, aka ICE, have started using imagery of Microsoft's sci-fi shooter Halo for recruitment posts on social media, even as Gamestop and the US administration indulge in some bantz characterising Donald Trump as Master Chief, and even as Microsoft attempt to flog a new Halo game.
</p><!--more-->
<p>As <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link">reported</a> by journalist Alyssa Mercante, the US Homeland Security account put out <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">a Xeet on October 27th</a> with the message "Finishing this fight", a reference to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-3">Halo 3</a>'s tagline, alongside a picture of Mr Chief driving the legendary Warthog humvee across the original Halo ringworld from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>, with the label "Destroy the Flood". 
</p>
<p>For context, the Flood are an enveloping, parasitic lifeform who want to overrun and consume all other species. You can see how that framing of an overwhelming invasion might appeal to the top brass at ICE, who have carried out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/26/immigrants-criminal-record-ice-detention">a brutal mass deportation campaign</a> that has placed tens of thousands in detention, including thousands who have no criminal record.
</p>
<p>Separately, US retailer GameStop have declared "the console wars over" in <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982213786221109263">a Xeet from October 25th</a>. The impetus for this is Microsoft's announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">a Halo: Combat Evolved campaign remake</a>, which will be the first Halo project to appear on PlayStation consoles - much to the public outrage and secret voyeuristic delight of Xbox fanboys - and introduces a few prequel missions featuring Chief's buddy Sergeant Johnson.
</p><p>"Console loyalists are instructed to cease hostilities, disband militias, and enjoy this new era of gaming," goes the GameStop post, in jocular legalese. "GameStop will continue to operate as a demilitarized zone, offering hardware, accessories, and trade-ins to combatants on all sides". 
</p>
<p>A couple of days later, the official White House twitter <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632">shared GameStop's post</a> with the message "power to the players", adding a dinky little image of Donald Trump dressed in Spartan armour with a plasma sword, saluting on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in front of the Stars and Stripes.
</p>
<p>GameStop <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982654845166428607">replied with an image of their own</a>, featuring Master Trump and a remarkably unpleasant version of Chief's AI mission handler/love interest/mother figure Cortana, who has been doctored to resemble US vice-president JD Vance. The speed at which the images were shared implies that they were AI-generated, though I can't confirm this.
</p>
<p>It's often and not unreasonably claimed that reactionary gamers played a major part in Trump's rise to power, with the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamergate-chat-logs/">Gamergate hate movement</a> of 2014 onwards <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/mar/08/gamergate-trolls-woke-game-consultants">introducing various "alt-right" demagogues and Trumpist politicians to an embittered segment of players</a> who think feminism and progressive politics are a blight on society. The Trump administration's tweets above certainly reinforce that chain of connection. 
</p><p>In general, the banter between GameStop and Trump together with ICE's latest recruitment drive is an absolute triple-concentrated circus of contemporary demons. Fascism, chan humour, and the military entertainment complex spinning around in a toilet bowl, exchanging possibly Grok-derived high fives. The trade-in shelf as DMZ. The marketing fiction of a war between rival consumers re-deployed as a MAGA meme. 
</p>
<p>Neither GameStop nor Microsoft have responded to Mercante's requests for comment. The White House press office has replied to her with some snippy (and in Mercante's view, likely illegal) emails referencing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g7d9j7p5qo">the current US government shutdown</a>, which they blame on their Democrat opponents in Congress.
</p>
<p>This isn't the first time the USA's Homeland Security organisation has invoked a videogame for recruitment purposes. Back in September, they put out <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">a jokey Pokémon video on Xitter</a> with the caption "Gotta Catch 'Em All", which shows immigration enforcement agents rounding people up, with bleak gags about Pokémon being vulnerable to ice-based attacks. It seems obvious that the aim is as much to wind up progressives as to draw recruits.</p>
<p>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8ex9n8gxdwo">pushed back</a> against ICE, albeit gingerly, stating that "our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property." We'll see if Microsoft do likewise. I'll send them a request for comment now.</p>

              <p>Earbuds are great, but they don’t compare to the sound quality achievable with a pair of headphones. You can even get a pretty solid pair for not much cash. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/">Right now, Amazon has the Beats Solo 4 on-ear Bluetooth headphones on sale for 35% off.</a> That ends up bringing the price down by $70. The headphones start at $200, so that brings the price down to just $130. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the Beats Solo 4 since the summer.</p>
<p>Now, even though these on-ear headphones can produce pretty stellar sound, do note that they do not support active noise cancellation or transparency mode like some of the premium model Beats do. The option of turning on noise cancelling is super practical and can be great to have, but its one of those features that can really jack up the price of a pair of headphones. So you end up getting high-quality audio at a fraction of the price by going without ANC. If that’s a deal breaker for you though, check out the Beats Studio Pro instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All-Day Listening</h2>
<p>With the Beats Solo 4, you can expect to get a full 50 hours of playtime off on just a single charge. That’s more than two days of non-stop listening if you really wanted to. Then when they finally do die down to zero percent, they can charge up super quickly. Say you’re about to head out for the day and realize you forgot to plug them in overnight. Not a problem. The Beats Solo 4 support fast fuel charging which can bring your battery up from dead to five full hours of listening time after charging the set for just 10 minutes.</p>
<p>That long battery life wouldn’t do you any good if the headphones weren’t comfortable to wear. Well, the Beats Solo 4 have an ultralight yet durable construction which means you can keep them on throughout the entire day without them weighing down your noggin. Plus, the flex-grip headband with adjustable angled ear cup and plush ear cushions help to ensure they stay snuggly fit and comfy for all sizes and shapes of heads.</p>



<p>Connecting to your Beats Solo 4 is easy whether you have an iPhone or an Android. The headphones support touch to pair functionality with is exactly what it sounds like. Just touch you phone to your headphones and you’ll immediately be able to listen to your favorite music, audiobooks, or podcasts.</p>
<p>Choose between five different color options which include matte black, black gold, cloud pink, metallic pink, or slate blue. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/">All colorways are on sale for $70 off for a limited time.</a></p>

                <p>Loulan: The Cursed Sand has been officially revealed, and this action-RPG will see players take control of a skeletal warrior--who goes by the on-the-nose name of Cursed Sand--on a quest to rescue his beloved princess.

This resulted in developer ChillyRoom creating a "dual-form" protagonist, who wraps himself in golden sand to take on a human-like appearance. When he uses his powers, he shifts from Sand Form to Bone Form, which Huai described as a powerful stance built for one-against-many combat.</p><p>"On his journey, he will face powerful factions ranging from the Loulan royal family--who embody the power of the sun--to the frost-bound spiders of the Western Regions," Huai said. "We've reimagined iconic landscapes of the western region through a fantastical lens, from vast deserts to flowing rivers of sand."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592319-54875016489_3a7f0dbb11_h.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592319" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592319-54875016489_3a7f0dbb11_h.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592319"></a><figcaption>Loulan: The Cursed Sand</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592319-54875016489_3a7f0dbb11_h.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592320-54874775056_dbbfcef11b_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592321-54874775126_daa7e098e6_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592322-54874999743_40bc4267ee_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592323-54874999773_376322f325_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592324-54875071555_2229a904c7_h.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4592320,1300-4592321,1300-4592322,1300-4592323,1300-4592324" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592320-54874775056_dbbfcef11b_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592321-54874775126_daa7e098e6_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592322-54874999743_40bc4267ee_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592323-54874999773_376322f325_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4592324-54875071555_2229a904c7_h.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592320-54874775056_dbbfcef11b_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592321-54874775126_daa7e098e6_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592322-54874999743_40bc4267ee_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592323-54874999773_376322f325_h.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4592324-54875071555_2229a904c7_h.jpg"></figure><p>Loulan: The Cursad Sand is one of several projects supported by Sony's China Hero Project. The team producing the game includes several veterans who have worked at Santa Monica Studio, From Software, and Platinum Games, and Huai added that Loulan uses a retro-inspired top-down camera perspective to blend classic arcade-style combat with modern gameplay ideas. Loulan doesn't have a release date yet, but it is coming to PC and PS5.</p><p>Several more games inspired by Chinese folklore are also currently in development.

            <p>Twice now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> devs Team Cherry have put out a Simplified Chinese translation of the Metroidvania, only for Chinese players to point out some stuff it does weirdly. Well, in their third crack at providing said translation, Team Cherry look to have gone the tried and trusted route, introducing a fan-made one people already like with the latest update to patch 4's ongoing Steam beta.</p>
<p>As a quick recap, the Simplified Chinese translation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> offered at launch was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-cherry-working-on-quality-issues-with-hollow-knight-silksongs-simplified-chinese-translation-following-mixed-steam-reviews">flagged as being a bit Shakespearey</a>, leading to mixed reviews of the game in the region. Team Cherry were quick to introduce a second translation in an attempt to rectify the issue, but that one ended up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-4-live-in-steam-beta-problems-persist-with-its-new-simplified-chinese-translation">earning thumbs downs from players</a> due to how it translated some place and character names.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to attempt number three, the delivery of a Simplified Chinese fan translation by Team Cart Fix. "Team Cart Fix's translation has been well received by the community," Team Cherry wrote in the patch 4 beta update <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/603045243319975841/">Steam post</a>. "Their approach builds from elements of the original translation, retaining existing names for characters and places, except in instances where the original translation was incorrect, or inconsistent with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>."</p>
<p>Scrolling down to read some early feedback on the translation, which the devs stress will have "some small issues" due to the fact its implementation hasn't been finalised, I can see one Chinese player claiming that "some errors that were previously corrected by new translators have been retained again". They've highlighted 'Last Judge' and 'Fay Mountains' as perhaps having been translated a bit too literally, but we'll have to wait for more verdicts to roll in to see for sure whether those are wider issues or more personal nitpicks.</p><p>As for the rest of patch 4, Team Cherry say it's still in line for more fixes ahead of release. With this update, they've added fixes for the likes of issues with Rune Rage and Thread Storm damage, when using the harpoon to stun or kill certain bosses, and "instances of Hornet being able to push some enemy types through the floor". Couriers should also no longer offer you exactly the same delivery immediately after you've completed it. Phew.</p>
<p>Hopefully this fan translation does the trick, or I fear patch 4 might be in the beta realm forever.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bart-simpsons-treehouse-fortnite-location/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-is-bart-simpson%E2%80%99s-treehouse-in-fortnite-mysterious-anomaly-explained.1336582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Simpsons are on their way to Fortnite, and it appears Bart Simpson is the first to make his arrival, as his iconic treehouse can be found on the Battle Royale island, and we’ll tell you exactly where to go.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s mini-season themed around The Simpsons kicks off this week, starting with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge live event</a>, which marks the final part of Chapter 6 in the game, with Epic Games now gearing up for the big release of Chapter 7 at the start of December.</p>



<p>Ahead of the big live event, a new quest is live in Fortnite that tasks you to investigate the Mysterious Anomaly, and we’ve got a full breakdown of where you need to go.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-the-mysterious-anomaly-in-fortnite">How to Find The Mysterious Anomaly in Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Head here. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Mysterious Anomaly in Fortnite, aka Bart Simpson’s treehouse, is located in the northwestern part of the map, close to the Creepy Camps POI.</strong></p>



<p>Approaching this location, you’ll immediately spot a cell-shaded treehouse that sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the environment, which serves as a huge teaser ahead of the Simpsons-themed mini-season that will serve as the final swansong of Chapter 6 in Fortnite.</p>



<p>To claim the 20,000 XP and complete the quest, which provides a huge bump to your season level and can help you unlock any remaining rewards from the Battle Pass and Fortnitemares, simply approach the Treehouse. When you appear close enough, the challenge will automatically tick off and provide the reward.</p>



<p>There’s no need to head inside the treehouse, but if you do, you’ll be treated to another mini easter egg for the forthcoming season, with a TV that has a sketchy signal in the corner of the building. Periodically, images will flash up with memes from The Simpsons, another major hint at what is coming.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-any-other-simpsons-easter-eggs-in-fortnite">Are There Any Other Simpsons Easter Eggs in Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, there are other Simpsons-themed easter eggs located on the Fortnite app, though none of the others provide an additional quest or XP bonuses.</strong></p>



<p>In the Steamy Shacks location, a workstation very similar to Homer Simpson’s at the nuclear power plant can be found, with no secret as to who it belongs to, as pink-glazed donuts are also there, many of which have had a bite taken out of them.</p>



<p>Additional teasers could be added before the start of the live event this weekend, but it’s not too long to wait now until the big reveal of everything there is to enjoy.</p>

                <p>In April 2022, developer and publisher Sharkmob officially launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt/" data-ref-id="5000-533058">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt</a>, a battle royale set in White Wolf Publishing's World of Darkness. Players took control of vampires in Prague as they joined rival sects and battled each other with their supernatural abilities and conventional weapons. However, new updates for the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/1-year-later-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-is-shutting-down-servers-to-remain-online/1100-6514160/" data-ref-id="1100-6514160">ceased in 2023</a>, and now Bloodhunt's servers are going offline in 2026.</p><p>Sharkmob announced <a href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/bloodhunt-servers-will-close-on-april-28-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the news on its site</a> that Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt will have its final death on April 28, 2026. Once the game's servers go offline, the PC and PlayStation 5 versions of this title will no longer be playable.</p><p>In a message addressed to the Bloodhunt community, Sharkmob shared its gratitude for the game's four-year run.</p><p>"When we first opened the streets of Prague to you, we could only hope that the nights you spent there would create the memories they did," reads the statement. "From the battles fought on the rooftops to the friendships made in the chaos, Bloodhunt has lived through you in countless unforgettable ways. During these past four years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to Bloodhunt ... However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable. This has led us to make the difficult decision to take Bloodhunt offline."</p><p>Token purchases have already been disabled, but the in-game store will remain open so players can use the tokens they already have before the game goes offline.</p><p>Earlier this month, the action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" data-ref-id="5000-494182">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> hit PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wachowskis, the writers and directors behind the Matrix movies, once asked Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima to design a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-matrix"><u>Matrix</u></a> video game, but publisher Konami reportedly turned it down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's according to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/they-were-big-fans-of-kojima-the-wachowskis-once-asked-the-metal-gear-creator-to-make-a-matrix-video-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Time Extension</u></a>, which said that while a December 1999 edition of NextGen magazine stated Kojima was apparently in the running to develop a game based on the blockbuster movie, Konami exec Kasumi Kitaue shot down discussions in favor of keeping Kojima focused on the Metal Gear series instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima," Konami Digital Entertainment VP of licensing, Christopher Bergstresser, told Time Extension. "So Kazumi Kitaue, Kojima, Aki Saito (who still works with Kojima), and I were at the Konami HQ, and we got a call from the Wachowskis, who wanted to come in and meet with Kojima. So they did!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The two of them came in with their concept artist, and effectively they said to Kojima, ‘We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that?’ Aki translated this into Japanese for Mr. Kitaue, and Kitaue just looked at them and told them plainly, ‘No.' We did still get to enjoy the Matrix Japanese premiere and afterparty, though."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, that's not quite how everyone recalls events. Another former Konami employee, this one unwilling to go on record, claimed Konami had actually shown "strong interest" in the game, and there was "immense disappointment" when the project didn't go ahead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Matrix franchise was adapted into a series of games nonetheless, starting with Shiny Entertainment's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/the-matrix">Enter the Matrix</a> in 2003, follow up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-matrix-path-of-neo">The Matrix: Path of Neo</a> in 2005, and Monolith Production's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-matrix-online">The Matrix Online</a> in the same year. We were also treated to a Matrix-themed tech demo in 2021, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-matrix-awakens-an-unreal-engine-5-experience">The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience</a>, in which Epic Games showed us what Unreal Engine 5 was capable of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It didn't turn out too badly for Kojima or Konami, either; after 1998's Metal Gear Solid, Kojima and his team then concentrated on the critically-acclaimed and award-winning <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-2-son-of-liberty"><u>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</u></a>, which was released in 2001.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Matrix Movies in (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And Kojima is equally busy now, of course. With Death Stranding 2 out the door, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kojima-productions-beyond-the-strand-10th-anniversary-livestream-everything-announced-hideo"><u>Kojima is working on a number of new projects</u></a>, including horror game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game"><u>OD for Xbox Game Studios</u></a>.

            <title><![CDATA[NASCAR 25 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nascar-25-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nascar-25-review.1336558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2000s are memorable for plenty of peaks. The last truly great salvo of R-rated Hollywood comedies. Finnish mobile phones built sturdy enough to kill a man. Also? NASCAR games. If you know, you know. It’s not a controversial statement to say that, over the last 20 years, no licensed NASCAR game has been able to unseat NASCAR Dirt to Daytona, NASCAR Racing 2003 Season, and NASCAR Thunder 2004 from the podium. Enter NASCAR 25. While several elements of it are roughly hewn and underfeatured – and the multiplayer misses the mark – the moment-to-moment single-player racing it serves up is fast, fierce, and fabulously nuanced. Does it slingshot itself past the very best to ever do it? Not quite. However, it has gotten closer to doing so than any other in the last two decades, and that makes it quite notable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">NASCAR 25 isn’t just the first NASCAR-licensed console game in almost five years, it’s the first ever produced by iRacing – the subscription-based racing simulation of choice for professional race drivers and sim-seat warriors alike. Considering the very foundation of iRacing was built using the source code for the legendary NASCAR Racing 2003 Season, there’s an undeniable element of pedigree at play here. There’s obviously a level of expectation that comes with this sort of heritage but, while it still has plenty of scope for growth and refinement, it’s been nice to see NASCAR 25 succeed in key areas where it counts. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Matched Perfect and Staggered Special</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">NASCAR 25 is at its very best on the track, rubbing panels at nearly 200 miles per hour. While oval racing isn’t a personal speciality of mine, I do find it massively fascinating just how ruthless it can be – and how different it is to typical circuit racing. As such, NASCAR 25 has me hooked right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There isn’t always a consistent racing line in oval racing; depending on the conditions and the track itself, the most efficient way through a bend might be low, somewhere in the middle, or even way up by the wall. You may need to start taking a corner differently to be faster, and I’m finding this necessity to adapt extremely interesting. I’m also particularly attracted to the sort of patience oval racing requires, with events that can unfold over hundreds of laps. Doggedly hanging onto the coattails of a breakaway pack of opponents, dicing with them doorhandle-to-doorhandle, is tense and engaging – but there’s also a part of it that I find almost meditative as I stalk slipstreams lap after lap, waiting for the perfect moment to attempt to lunge and strike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason this all comes together in a meaningfully believable way is really thanks to NASCAR 25’s very impressive and tunable AI, and it’s very much what I crave in a racing game of this type. The core thing I look for constantly is racing that I can play by myself, in my own time, that feels authentic against my skill level. That’s it. I don’t want to be at the mercy of online randos, many of whom are ill disciplined and weave unrealistically across the track. Just sell me the fantasy of being a racing driver. Let’s not kid ourselves: I’m driving pretend race cars that I can pause when I need to pee. I’m not here to take on the world; I just want to enjoy my time. I want to believe I’m in the mix amongst a bunch of bona fide professionals who drive accordingly. NASCAR 25’s AI gets this right. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want to believe I’m in the mix amongst a bunch of bona fide professionals who drive accordingly. NASCAR 25’s AI gets this right.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As a very casual consumer of NASCAR racing from the other side of the planet, my interest has ebbed and flowed depending on the involvement of drivers I have existing familiarity with, like Marcus Ambrose and SVG, so I’m not going to claim I can assure you that the AI <em>always </em>make the right tactical decisions. That said, they really do seem to drive with a lot of credibility. They hold their lines extremely smoothly around corners, and they shrewdly carve through packs of other cars competing for spots, effectively bump drafting and changing lanes. The only thing that undoes them is NASCAR 25’s frankly absurd way of penalising corner cutting, which will literally bring your car to a halt wherever you currently are if it detects a track limit violation. This will result in the AI piling up behind you as they all slam on the anchors to stop. It’s a massive immersion killer when it happens.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Greatest Racing Games Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">AI speed operates on a difficulty slider, meaning I was able to get it dialled in to perfectly match my skill level. The values are arbitrary, but they range between 85 and 105. About 100 was the sweet spot for super speedways for me, and slightly lower on short tracks and road courses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of settings available to customise the AI, including their predisposition to losing control, their skill in regaining control after incidents, and their resistance to car-on-car collisions in the first place. I’m currently experimenting with making the AI more susceptible to losing it after a decent whack – and dialling incident frequency way up to make things a little more exciting. It probably hasn’t <em>quite</em> resulted in the turmoil I was anticipating, but I appreciate settings like this. There isn’t one, single way to play NASCAR 25. Keep it stern and serious or let it lean a little more Hollywood? It’s a decision the developers are happy to let us handle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>I Don’t Want You Spoiled, Buck</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of handling, the news is also largely positive. It feels strong and challenging with a wheel, and the laser-scanned track surfaces (which have migrated from iRacing) means the characteristics of circuits with bumpier surfaces come through to have interesting effects on the driving feel from race to race. Cars feel balanced and obedient at high speed, and I was particularly impressed with how approachable NASCAR 25 is on a controller – which is important as a console-oriented game. It’s hard for me to accurately put myself into the mind of an inexperienced or younger racer, but there are also a range of assists available – and the simple tuning slider should be sufficient for anyone not looking to get too lost in the weeds when it comes to minor vehicle adjustments. The handy slider is essentially a bunch of quick tunes you can apply to either tighten everything up (which should make your car quite planted and stable, at the cost of some front end responsiveness) or create something looser (and if I’ve learned anything from Days of Thunder beyond what happens when a load of unwanted lettuce reaches Japan, loose is fast and on the edge of out of control).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One key controller problem so far, however, is a peculiar lack of meaningful rumble – and this creates a disappointing disconnect between what’s happening with my car’s grip on-screen and what I’m feeling through my hands. It just injects an unwanted floaty sensation at times, particularly when you don’t realise your rear tyres are spinning up because there’s no tactile information coming in that that’s happening. It makes playing on the expert level handling settings – where ham-fisted throttle mashing will rotate your car around quick smart – a bit more frustrating than I like. I think it’s also contributing to a skatey feeling on road courses, because I can’t really always feel the edge of the grip.</p><div id="rank-these-classic-nascar-related-movies" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these classic NASCAR-related movies</h3><h3>Rank these classic NASCAR-related movies</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Information is definitely one of NASCAR 25’s weaknesses, overall. It’s not just the fact that it doesn’t really do a great deal to teach a player the ins-and-outs of, say, oval tactics or road course track limits. It’s also missing useful, basic info, like your opposition’s current qualifying times – which can’t be seen while you’re also out trying to set down a scorching lap. You need to return to pit lane to view where you currently stand in the group. The spotter also has a habit of giving us the wrong info, like noting you have clear space inside or outside when you don’t. I’m very lukewarm on how robotic the spotter sounds, too; being direct and matter-of-fact is all well and good during racing, but being unable to muster any convincing human enthusiasm about winning a race makes him feel like a chatbot – and NASCAR 25 misses out on any meaningful personality as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The presentation of career mode is a bit sterile, too. Your driver is never more than a blank silhouette, and the inability to even select a home state or country of origin is odd. It’s small potatoes, sure, but missing the little things does make it all feel a little more impersonal than I’d want from a custom driver. Cars can be customised using a combination of preset designs and some basic shapes, but the livery system is underdone. A one-button system for syncing your design up with your driver and team gear is handy, but simple stuff like flipping the design from one side of a car to the other hasn’t been implemented. You also can’t apply custom shapes to liveries you want to use online, which is an annoying restriction we don’t typically face in other racing games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did enjoy the evolution of the custom racing operation and garage backdrop, which is quite cool as you progress up through the four series (and you can compete in up to two series at once), but this first effort is a bit vanilla compared to other career modes in the official motorsport sim space, like F1 or WRC. There’s a basic economy here, where you need to monitor an overall budget and manage repairs between races with a secondary resource called ‘work points’, but I did find myself ploughing through it between races without too much thought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’ve established multiplayer is not my natural environment, it’s not a particularly strong component of NASCAR 25 either way, which is a tad surprising given the sheer volume of online racing experience the iRacing team has. NASCAR 25’s multiplayer is simply a basic lobby system of random races, and there are no scheduled races or special events. It plays just as smooth and reliably as the single-player – even in races against over two dozen online opponents – which is commendable. It just feels listless.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nascar-25-review]]></content:encoded>

WildBrain Studios has worked on plenty of animations for Netflix, including Carmen Sandiego, Malory Towers, and the aforementioned Sonic Prime. As What’s on Netflix points out, this is the first time Crash Bandicoot will front his own series. There is no release window nor plot details for the Crash Bandicoot animated series yet.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Crash Bandicoot video game series, it’s been quiet for some years now. After 2018’s Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy came out, Activision released Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled in 2019, Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time in 2020, Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! in 2021, and, most recently, Crash Team Rumble in 2023. Support for the latter ended less than a year after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is there a new Crash Bandicoot video game in the works? Last year, it was reported that Microsoft, which brought Crash Bandicoot under its umbrella after shelling out $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-reportedly-reaches-agreement-with-crash-bandicoot-dev-toys-for-bob-for-new-game">had reached an agreement with former Crash Bandicoot developer Toys for Bob for the studio’s next game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In February 2024, Toys for Bob announced plans to spin off from Microsoft-owned Activision to become an indie developer. Toys for Bob is the developer behind Skylanders, Spyro Reignited Trilogy, and Crash Bandicoot games, but in more recent years had become a Call of Duty support studio.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Best Anime to Watch on Netflix</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Toys for Bob said it was exploring "a possible partnership between our new studio and Microsoft,” adding both Microsoft and Activision were "extremely supportive" of its new direction. While Toys for Bob's first project as an indie studio is apparently "in the early days," fans speculated it could be a revival of Crash, Spyro, or another IP Toys for Bob has become known and beloved for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Netflix, continuing to invest in video game adaptations comes as no surprise given the success it’s seen doing so already. It has animations for everything from Splinter Cell to Tomb Raider, Castlevania to Cyberpunk. And of course it enjoyed critical acclaim from the League of Legends animated adaptation, Arcane. It’s now working on adapting board games, with Catan, Clue!, and Monopoly shows in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>Buckle up</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Back in 2021, Funselektor Labs brought us <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/art_of_rally">art of rally</a>, a super sweet driving sim that packed an unexpected depth under the hood. Next year, the team will be following it up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/over-the-hill">over the hill</a>, an equally gorgeous-looking driver that's all about trekking <em>off</em> the beaten path. The really exciting news? It's coming to Switch 2.</p>
<p>While art of rally was all about rally driving (surprisingly), over the hill is for the off-roading fans. You'll be sitting behind the wheel of a whole host of exploring vehicles from the '60s to '80s, making your way through unwelcoming wilderness environments from rocky mountains to icy rivers. You can go it alone in a Solo Tour, or bring three friends along for the ride and use winches and ropes to make sure everyone's drive goes smoothly.</p>
<p>It's all wrapped up in a similar simplistic art style to Funselektor's previous game, and a photo mode means you can capture the vistas in all their cel-shaded glory — increased car customisation should really help those snaps pop, too.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the publisher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>- Explore the world in the golden age of offroading.<br></em><em>- Drive iconic vehicles from the 60s to 80s by yourself or with friends through challenging trails and beautiful scenery.<br></em><em>- Explore, navigate, and uncover the vast wilderness.<br></em><em>- Ramble your way through varied biomes inspired by real-world locations, from valleys to mountains and everything in between.<br></em><em>- Discover portals to travel to new areas, and complete objectives to unlock new vehicles, upgrades, customizations, and cosmetics, with many combinations to try.<br></em><em>- Set up a campsite for some much-needed R&amp;R after a long day in the elements.<br></em><em>- Take on the elements with dynamic weather, day/night cycles, and realistic terrain deformation.<br></em><em>- Complete all the objectives, unlock the many customizations and upgrades, and discover everything the wilderness has to offer.<br></em><em>- Grab stills of your favourite landscapes with the built-in photo mode.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There's still no specific release date for over the hill just yet, though the end of the console announcement trailer reveals that pre-orders for a physical edition will be coming soon — the premium version of which comes packaged with a window cling and soundtrack download card.</p>
<p>Our biggest gripe with art of rally was the visual cutbacks that had to be made to the Switch version of the game. With over the hill coming to Switch 2, let's keep our fingers crossed that Funselektor and Strelka Games can make the most of the increased power to keep things as stunning as they seem.</p>

            <p>Bully, Rockstar's classic boarding school Bart Simpson simulator, is about to have another massive multiplayer mod fired at it from a slingshot. The mod's dubbed Bully Online, stands atop the battered blazer of a previous attempt to let a bunch of folks play Bully together, and is set to arrive in paid early access this December.</p>

<p>Bully Online's being worked on by a group of modders which includes Rockstar-focused YouTuber Swegta, who's announced the mod via the video above. It includes a trailer and some gameplay snippets showing off different aspects of the mod, including roleplaying-focused free roam, trolley racing, and minigames. The whole thing understandably seems very GTA Online-inspired, just with schoolkids mucking around instead of uber-rich criminals with dodgy tattoos and flying death bikes.</p>
<p>"Bully Online runs on the DSL script loader, which is a plugin for Bully that essentially allows for a way more versatile approach to modding," Swegta explains. "A lot of the things that we thought were impossible just a few years ago can now be done, including making an online mode. We do have an official server for Bully Online and we plan on making that available to the public to enjoy in due time."</p><p>Prior to that, the team plan to release the mod in paid early access this December, with those who pay $8 to support it on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline">Ko-fi</a> being let in ahead of the general public, as well as being granted perks like server queue priority and an in-game camera they can use to save pictures. "Supporting us on Ko-Fi means that we can spend more time working on this and us spending more time working on this means that it's going to be available to the general public sooner," Swegta says of the decision to go this potentially eyebrow-raising route.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, this isn't the first massive multiplayer mode modders have attempted to add to Bully. A <a href="https://bully-mp.com/#preview_release">Bully multiplayer mod</a> was released back in 2018, with Swegta involved as a community manager, but since looks to have <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/bully-multiplayer">ended up dormant</a>. The YouTuber offered his perspective as to why that project ran aground in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr2_pa_cPic">a video six months ago</a>, and says in the Bully Online announcement that "some of the ideas that did not make it into BullyMP have been repurposed for this project".</p>
<p>"It's been in the making for a very long time," he added. "The cool thing about doing Bully Online is that we can add any kind of miniame or game mode that we feel is fitting for it. This is our project and we're able to do anything we want with it."</p>
<p>Given how that previous Bully multiplayer mod turned out, I think I'd take a wait and see approach with this latest one. Especially given there are the likes of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bullyscholarshipedition/mods/242?tab=description">Bully co-op mods</a> already out there if you're desperate to prank some nerds with a mate.</p>

<p>The current season in Fortnite, along with the heap of collabs in the Fortnitemares event, is rapidly approaching its conclusion, with all eyes cast towards The Simpsons mini-season, and we’ve already seen a bunch of leaked skins.</p>



<p>The Simpsons are making a long-awaited arrival in the world of Fortnite this week, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live event set to kick off the huge collab</a>, with a month-long stage in the spotlight before Chapter 6 comes to an end and Chapter 7 begins.</p>



<p>Leaks for the big Simpsons takeover in Fortnite have already emerged, and we’ve highlighted all of the skins that are coming to the game as part of the update.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-leaked-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-skins">All Leaked Fortnite x The Simpsons Skins</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Collab crazy. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Keyart leaked for Fortnite, and a small batch teased by Epic Games themselves, has provided a first look at a total of 12 skins coming in The Simpsons mini-season.</strong></p>



<p>As usual, a bunch of skins will be available as part of the Battle Pass, now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-battle-passes-will-now-be-included-in-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included with a Game Pass subscription</a>, and the usual approach is that characters front and center of keyart will be included in the Pass.</p>



<p>Therefore, we expect Homer, Marge, Simpsons Jonesy, and Simpsons Hope to be included in the Battle Pass skins, while Ned Flanders could be the final reward, along with his trademark moustache-styled glider.</p>



<p>Other skins could still be included in the Battle Pass, but we’ll have to wait and see. There’s plenty more to come in the Item Shop though via V-Bucks purchases, including Lisa Simpson and Krusty the Clown.</p>



<p>As usual, many of the skins will be NPCs to interact with on the map, with Moe Syslak standing out as the leading candidate for that regard, with his bar likely to be a POI, while Lisa Simpson could potentially be found the the school. Again, we’ll have to wait for full confirmation.</p>



<p>Check out the table below for all the leaked Simpsons skins in the Fortnite collab.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Image</th><th data-align="center">Skin</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Homer Simpson</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Marge Simpson</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Bart Simpson</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Simpsons Peely</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Simpsons Fishstick</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Simpsons Hope</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Simpsons Jonesy</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Ned Flanders</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Lisa Simpson</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Krusty the Clown</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Moe Szyslak</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center">Scratchy</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>2025 seems to be the year of the ninja with multiple releases in the Ninja Gaiden and Shinobi series, so it’s good to also see a game that focuses on the masked assassin’s natural predator: the pirate. Now in Steam Early Access, Davy X Jones sees the fusion of pirate myth and pirate history as you play the role of the eponymous antihero following his death at the hands of Edward Teach – the infamous Blackbeard. Despite Teach decapitating Jones, you awake in the Locker, a space which works as a kind of piratical Purgatory. What follows is a hard hitting first person adventure that takes clear influence from Pirates of the Caribbean and adds a comic Gothic twist.</p>
<p><iframe title="DAVY x JONES | Early Access Launch Teaser (Out Now)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_XTPD8U9HUQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The main conceit of the game is that your head remains separated from your body, with the floating skull Davy constantly berating and bossing around the body of Jones (which you play as). Of course, verbose skulls have a long lineage in gaming, from the navigator Murray in Monkey Island to Johnson the gun in Shadows of the Damned. Davy is very much in this mould, serving as the main narrative driver of events, and having an awful lot to say for himself. In fact, Davy is <em>so</em> verbose that he can become a little annoying at times with repeated lines whilst Jones somehow manages to speak a monotone ‘Jones’ in response. How does he do this? It’s best not to think too hard about it.</p>


<p>The underwater world of Davy X Jones is suitably submersive and immersive with fish of various kinds swimming around the place. There doesn’t seem to be any sense of moving underwater, but this is probably a good choice as the resistance this would provide goes against the fluid and dynamic combat system.</p>


<p>Enemies are mostly variations of undead pirates with some imps and aquatic monsters scattered amongst them. The pirates range from simple grunts with cutlasses to grenadiers and others that can shield and empower their comrades. The frequent combat encounters involve combinations of these enemies that make the most of their different skills and require some degree of strategic approach. I generally found it most effective to remove the ranged enemies first and then focus on the close combat foes. Combat does get a little repetitive at times, as fights are seemingly constant and enemies respawn quickly. I would hope that the latter is remedied for the full release as it leads to serious fatigue.</p>
<p>Traversal across the watery depths is pretty neat, with double jumps and a grapple move helping you to cross great distances with ease. This can become a double-edged sword at times, as the open environments can make it easy to get lost and the relatively samey scenery means that landmarks are few and far between. You do find a feathered companion who helps direct you to objectives quite early on and there is a map though so navigation becomes easier, but what doesn’t change is how easy it is to fall to your death. Whilst checkpoints are quite frequent, repeating fights gets boring fast.</p>

<p>The characters in Davy X Jones are well realised and the writing is pretty solid. The early access version has some interesting quests, but I did encounter a bug whereby these wouldn’t progress so I ended my time until the full release. I will definitely check out the 1.0 version as there is a lot here to enjoy and hopefully the bugs and balancing issues will be fixed by then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>There's little doubt that The Matrix franchise is criminally underserved when it comes to videogame adaptations, despite being theoretically a perfect fit for the medium. In the 26 years since the original movie's theatrical debut, we only got two decent games: 2003's single player action/adventure game Enter the Matrix and 2005's MMORPG The Matrix Online. More recently, the interactive experience The Matrix Awakens <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-matrix-awakens-unreal-engine-5-trailer-photorealistic-keanu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in late 2021</a>, but it was really just a tech demo for Unreal Engine 5 and a tease at the level of quality that gaming fans of the IP never really got to fully experience. </p>



<p>That makes it all the harder to swallow the news that revered videogame designer Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear, Death Stranding) was once asked to make a game based on The Matrix. The revelation was shared by Christopher Bergstresser, the Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning &amp; Business Development at Konami between 1996 and 2002, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/they-were-big-fans-of-kojima-the-wachowskis-once-asked-the-metal-gear-creator-to-make-a-matrix-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Time Extension</a>.</p>



<p>Bergstresser recounted an episode that occurred on August 25, 1999, the day of the Japanese theatrical debut of the original movie. The Wachowskis were fans of Kojima's work and, upon meeting him, asked if he'd want to make a Matrix game. However, former Konami CEO Kazumi Kitaue allegedly flat-out refused.</p>



<p><em>The Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima, so Kazumi Kitaue, Kojima, Aki Saito (who still works with Kojima), and I were at the Konami HQ, and we got a call from the Wachowskis, who wanted to come in and meet with Kojima. So they did! The two of them came in with their concept artist, and effectively they said to Kojima, ‘We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that?’ Aki translated this into Japanese for Mr. Kitaue, and Kitaue just looked at them and told them plainly, ‘No’. We did still get to enjoy the Matrix Japanese premiere and afterparty, though.</em></p>



<p>Time Extension also claims to have talked about this with another former Konami employee, who reportedly added that Hideo Kojima continued to express a strong interest in the partnership after Kitaue's comment. Perhaps that means he subsequently petitioned the executive to allow it to happen, but alas, it was not to be. </p>



<p>We'll never know how such a project would have turned out, but it certainly makes us sad that it never came to light.</p>

            <p>
After much wrangling with players over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a>’s Age system, which sees you taking charge of different civilizations as you progress from Antiquity into the Modern era, Firaxis are bringing back the option to play as one culture all the way to the endgame. They’re now playtesting the feature internally, and want players to help by way of a new community testing initiative, the Firaxis Feature Workshop. 
</p>
<p>
Firaxis have also shared a few snippets from Civilization 7’s update 1.3.0, due in the week of November 3rd alongside the Tides of Power DLC, which will be free to existing owners of the troubled 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> over the Xmas holidays. Update 1.3.0 is all about nautical doings and conspirings, with new naval units and buildings, the addition of ranged combat to ocean warfare, and some delightfully soggy terrain features. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Writing on the Civblog, creative director Ed Beach dropped some hot goss about “two of the biggest things in motion” at CivHQ. “First, we're testing some dramatic changes to the Legacy Paths and Victories in Civ VII,” he wrote. “We want to open up the game and provide many new paths your empire can follow while achieving greatness and competing for victory.
</p>
<p>
“Second - and this one’s been one of the most requested features from players - we're internally playtesting ways to play as one civ continuously through the ages, allowing you to choose a civilization from any Age and guide them throughout your journey through history.”
</p><p>
Firaxis would like a “small number of community members” to go hands-on with these and other WIP features via the aforesaid Workshop. They’ll share details of how to apply in the next few months – for more, join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/civilizationofficial">Discord</a>. Beach also notes that you can expect “smaller, less frequent updates” over the Xmas holidays “while the team shifts into testing and iteration on these larger changes, and preparing for the Workshop”.
</p>
<p>
Thus the gauzy hypotheticals of Civilizations to come. Now, let’s dig into the sweaty specifics of that imminent Civ 7 update. It introduces a new warehouse building, the Harbor, for all Civs, which serves as a spawn for naval units and boosts your fishing production. The Harbor accompanies a new naval unit, the Privateer, unlocked in the Exploration Age on the Heraldry Civic. It’s a speedy raiding vessel with license to cross borders and attack the military units and trade routes of non-allied civs, regardless of your war status.
</p>
<p>
The ocean itself will expand with three new water resources – crabs, turtles and cowrie – plus the new pitch resource on land. Deep oceans may now generate atolls, which act “as movement-stopping terrain to create strategic choke points”, while lakes may spawn lotus terrain that provides food and gold bonuses. Base ocean tiles will become workable in the modern age and one civ, Hawaii, will also be able to work them in the exploration age.
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the revamp for naval combat. Existing naval units will be split into light and heavy varieties. Light units are melee combatants with better movement and vision, plus the ability to perform flanking attacks. Heavies are ranged strikers who move slower and don’t see as far. It sounds like the optimal Civ 7 admiral will use lights and heavies in tandem.
</p><p>
These are just the highlights from the forthcoming patch. There are a few other bits <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-oct-27/">on the Civblog</a>, and Firaxis will share the full changelog notes down the line. As for that Tides Of Power DLC, the first part will add a new leader, Edward Teach (aka Blackbeard) plus two new civilisations - Tonga and the Republic of Pirates. The second part, coming in December, introduces Moroccan pirate leader Sayyida al Hurra, together with the Ottomans and Iceland.
</p>
<p>It's been interesting - and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-developers-firaxis-have-laid-off-an-unspecified-number-of-workers-2k-confirm">saddening</a> - to follow Civilization 7's attempts to right the ship after a heavily mixed launch reception, with much player ire directed at the Age system. I particularly appreciated the recent post about how they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-dev-explains-how-the-revamped-4x-map-generator-bolts-together-continents-from-voronoi-diagrams">overhauling the map generator</a>.</p>

It will be whisked away on November 14, meaning you still have a couple of weeks to take it for a spin.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a recent chat at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show, Marvel Games executive producer Danny Koo told Game Developer that</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Marvel Rivals'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> playerbase remains "healthy," which begs the question: why spend time and resources developing a new limited-time PvE game mode (aside from the obvious overlap with the recent Marvel Zombies animated series) when the core PvP experience remains in fine fettle?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Koo, the intention with Marvel Zombies—and PvE in general—is to offer players a respite from the intensity of competitive play. "With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rivals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> being primarily a PvP game, we wanted a supplementing mode to relieve the pressure of having competition every single minute," says Koo.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains the development team wanted to build a PvE mode from the outset, but were happy to wait for the right opportunity. That chance arrived following a chat with the Marvel Animation team, who explained they'd been tasked with developing a Marvel Zombies series. After watching the show, Koo realized the premise of a world overrun with crimson eyed cannon fodder was the perfect fit for a PvE experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/crusader-kings-3-team-says-addressing-feedback-backlogs-is-like-playing-darts-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Crusader Kings 3 team says addressing feedback backlogs is like 'playing darts'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Koo explains Netease Games views Marvel Zombies as a mini-game that's designed to pack a solid punch without overshadowing the core PvP experience. It took around six months of work to wrangle the mode into reality. Initially, a small strike force was assembled to cobble together a graybox prototype that would help the team understand how many players it could support and the inner workings of PvE level design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, the core PvP mode supports six players per team, but it was vital to understand whether that would translate to a PvE offering that includes kinetic hordes of enemies. Koo explains the next step was to figure out how AI foes would behave—and, as a result, which hero characters would be a good fit for PvE. The end result is a cooperative mode that supports up to four players and five heroes in Thor, Blade, Magic, Jeff the Land Shark, and The Punisher.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Every single player is valuable because of geography, play patterns, and how they team up with others&quot;">"Every single player is valuable because of geography, play patterns, and how they team up with others"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A couple of those characters were included to overlap with the show. Others were intentional wild cards. "Some characters were chosen because it makes thematic sense, especially characters from the show because they have great new costumes that we can show. Others were just fan favorites like Jeff the Land Shark. He has no business being there but it's just funny to see what happens if you pit a shark against zombies," says Koo. "Then you've got The Punisher, who is like your regular military guy defending against zombies."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/survey-shows-young-players-feel-pressured-to-conform-to-gender-and-racial-stereotypes" target="_self" data-discover="true">Survey shows young players feel pressured to conform to gender and racial stereotypes</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those characters were remixed with augmented skills and a new upgrade system to ensure they could effectively handle the huge crowds of undead that will be swarming players in Marvel Zombies. Koo says figuring out how those undead masses should attack players was also important in dictating the ebb and flow of the experience. In the end, the team landed on fast-moving mobs that can bamboozle players and incorporated hard-hitting bosses such as Namor and Scarlet Witch to bolster the challenge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Koo believes players will learn a lot about themselves and their peers based on how they behave when the walls start closing in—but notes the difficulty curve has been fine tuned to ensure Marvel Zombies remains an enjoyable sojourn as opposed to a stifling timesink.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-secrets-of-dead-cells-smart-constraints-unlocking-the-vault-3" target="_self" data-discover="true">The secrets of Dead Cells' smart constraints - Unlocking the Vault #3</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You can play Marvel Zombies solo or even as a team, so I think this mode will show players who you really are outside of competition. Whether you're cooperative, whether you care about your other teammates, or whether you want to lone wolf it," he says.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The development team is also keen to observe player behavior, and Koo underlines the importance of ensuring all players—whether they're big spenders or those who put the 'free' in free-to-play—feel there is value in sticking around for the long haul. Ultimately, the belief is that Marvel Zombies will offer them another reason to sink their teeth into a title that Koo hopes will still be going strong in a decade.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When you see a player who comes in—even if they don't pay—to enjoy themselves they provide competition for other players. Every single player is valuable because of geography, play patterns, and how they team up with others. It allows us to see where their interests are and how we can create content that caters to them," says Koo. "And because this is not a pay-to-win title all of our heroes are free, we're able to see that pure engagement. Even if nobody pays, it's pure engagement."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer attended Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show 2025 as a media partner, with flights and accommodation being covered by event organizers.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bully-online-mod-promises-to-let-you-roam-rockstar%E2%80%99s-classic-with-friends.1336513/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A team of modders is working on Bully Online, a modification for the PC version of Bully: Scholarship Edition that promises to allow players to roam the grounds of Bullworth Academy and the nearby town with their friends. The Wii and Xbox 360 versions of Scholarship Edition did have a multiplayer mode, but it was limited to two players and only allowed them to face off in the class minigames. </p>



<p>According to community creator SWEGTA, Bully Online promises much more, including free roam support, solo and group minigames, and even a role-playing system. They were able to add a 'fully fleshed out inventory system' so that players can earn money through side objectives, minigames, or item finding/trading. Money can be spent on houses, weapons, vehicles, and various items. When purchasing a vehicle, the player will receive unique car keys, allowing them to lock vehicles so others cannot steal them.</p>



<p>There will also be some new minigames, such as Rat Wars, a team shooter mode where oversized cartoon rats wield guns, as well as racing, which includes custom vehicles and tracks. These minigames will be instanced, avoiding potential issues with griefing or mode conflicts. </p>



<p>In case you're curious, this online mod is made possible by the DSL script loader plugin, allowing the team to introduce features like server connectivity and custom scripting.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The current plan is to open the private official server to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline">Ko-Fi support</a><a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline">rs</a> starting in December. Besides early access, supporting the modding team also provides the following benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li>Developer updates: videos, screenshots, behind-the-scenes commentary</li>



<li>Custom name tag colors (blue for supporters, red for admins)</li>



<li>An in-game digital camera (10 photo slots, shareable with other players)</li>



<li>Priority access to join when the servers are full</li>



<li>Discord role and private chat to communicate with the dev team</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to eventually release Bully Online to the public after an early access period. However, the big question is whether the project will even reach that phase. We've seen Rockstar shutting down modding projects before, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-liberty-city-preservation-project-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty City Preservation Project</a>, which attempted to recreate GTA IV inside the GTA V engine.</p>



<p>As for Bully itself, we know that Rockstar started working on a sequel that was, however, eventually canceled. Dan Houser recently claimed that it was due a lack of 'bandwidth'.</p>

			<p>This morning, indie Chinese developer ChillyRoom unveiled Loulan: The Cursed Sand, one of the games funded through the PlayStation China Hero Project.</p>



<p>The game is a hack 'n' slash action RPG viewed from a Diablo-like camera. The setting is the ancient Silk Road, in China's Western Regions. Loulan: The Cursed Sand tells the tragic love story of an exiled royal guard who returns to the titular fallen kingdom amidst the chaos of war in search of his beloved princess.</p>



<p>Players will step into the game as the skeletal warrior known as 'The Cursed Sand', mastering the power of sand as they explore, solve puzzles, and engage in realistic melee combat against overwhelming odds, including powerful enemies. There's no release date yet, but the game will be released for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3833280/Loulan_The_Cursed_Sand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/loulan-the-cursed-sand-60d275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>) and, of course, PlayStation 5.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Sims Games Coming to Xbox and PlayStation, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-sims-games-coming-xbox-and-playstation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-sims-games-coming-to-xbox-and-playstation-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1336498/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reputable source has claimed that MySims, an adorable version of the popular life simulation series, is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox later this year. MySims first surfaced in 2007 on the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii, before expanding to PC, mobile platforms, and in 2024, the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>This marks the first time that MySims will be available to play on Xbox or PlayStation, and fans of the franchise are excited. The MySims: Cozy Bundle, which was recently announced for Apple Arcade (November 6), will arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series platforms from November 18.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-sims-in-mysims">More Sims in MySims</h2>



<p>In an exclusive report published <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mysims-cozy-bundle-arrive-enfin-sur-playstation-et-xbox-on-vous-devoile-sa-date-de-sortie-60696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Dealabs</a>, backed by leading industry insiders, it was claimed that MySims: Cozy Bundle will be released on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5 on November 18, 2025. It was stressed that the game will be priced at $39.99.</p>



<p>The bundle includes the original MySims game, released almost 20 years ago, and MySkins: Kingdom. They’re <strong>remastered version </strong>of the original titles, though.</p>



<p>MySims is something along the lines of The Sims fused with Animal Crossing, presenting players with a cutesy take on the life sim that was first released way back in 2000. It was a spin-off of sorts from SimCity, with developers wanting to explore a more granular take on the city builder, zooming in and allowing players to simulate a life of their dreams.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>As the MySims Cosy Bundle is set to drop exactly one year after it was released on Nintendo Switch, it’s easy to assume that an exclusivity deal was arranged between Electronic Arts and the Japanese gaming titan.</p>



<p>The ‘retro re-release’ of MySims has been met with excitement from fans of the franchise. It has been a while since we had a new Sims game, given that The Sims 4 is now a free-to-play, live-service game, and anyone who hasn’t played MySims before is hungry to experience all it has to offer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon’s latest round of closed technical testing is unravelling as we speak, and in social circles, the inevitable leaks are surfacing. While Bungie has been quick to plug the more serious leaks, comments have made it to social media platforms and are staying up for all to see.</p>



<p>On Reddit, users breaking their NDA (or sharing content from others who have broken their NDA) have uploaded clips and screenshots from the Marathon tests. These have already been taken down, but the opinions and comments from those playing the game are still up and represent a mostly positive reception.</p>



<h2 id="h-latest-marathon-leaks-are-looking-good">Latest Marathon Leaks Are Looking Good</h2>



<p>In the newest Marathon leaks to hit the social space, users seem to be experiencing mixed feelings about Bungie’s floundering extraction shooter. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/">Marathon was delayed</a> by Bungie amid a wave of issues, leaving prospective fans out in the cold and unsure of what would happen next.</p>



<p>This was after information surfaced regarding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/">stolen art appearing in Marathon</a>, which was addressed by Bungie.</p>



<p>As Marathon came crashing down, we heard information from employees at Bungie concerning the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/morale-at-bungie-is-reportedly-in-free-fall-over-marathon/">free-falling morale</a> at the studio.</p>



<p>At the start of October, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-new-closed-technical-test-october-2025/">a new closed technical test</a> would take place under NDA, with Bungie inviting several hundred players to experience the evolution of Marathon behind closed doors. Inevitably, information has leaked from that closed test.</p>



<p>On Reddit, one user praised work done on factions and quests, while another bagged on some weird mechanics, such as paying credits to remove attachments from your weapons. The latter user also hated limited stash space, poor audio, and the continued existence of ‘bullet magnetism’.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ohmvpy/marathon_nda_technical_test_pastebin_leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Those comments</a> came after 25 hours of playing the NDA’d Marathon, and ultimately the user stressed that they’re ‘still enjoying the game but (they) hope it receives the time in the oven that it needs.’</p>



<p>Another, who may or may not be directly experiencing the technical test, wrote, ‘Our friend says he had zero expectations but has not been able to put the game down since the playtest began. He said the solo experience is a borderline horror experience.’</p>



<p>Others regarded the game as a ‘significant improvement’, while some pointed out that ‘basic, minor things’ are still being overlooked, like some button mapping elements and directional audio mechanics.</p>



<p>Those who managed to see the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ohbx2w/leaked_footage_of_the_marathon_closed_technical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked Marathon gameplay footage</a> suggested that ‘it looks better than the alpha’, while another who didn’t play the first round of tests said, ‘It’s pretty decent and I’m actually having fun.’</p>



<p>Could Bungie genuinely be turning around the perceptions of Marathon? Might this ‘social extraction shooter’ be a success after all? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-could-have-made-a-matrix-game-but-konami-shut-it-down.1336486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima, the legendary creative behind the likes of Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding, could have once upon a time created a game based in the <strong>Matrix </strong>universe. The idea surfaced in 1999 following the release of the first Matrix movie, but Konami reportedly shut down the concept on the spot.</p>



<p>Later, it was reported that team members at Konami expressed ‘immense disappointment’ at never having had the chance to assemble a Matrix game. It was just three years or so after the Wachowskis (the creators of the Matrix) met with Konami and floundered that Enter the Matrix (2003) was released.</p>



<h2 id="h-konami-didn-t-want-to-touch-the-matrix">Konami Didn’t Want to Touch The Matrix</h2>



<p>In a new report published <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/they-were-big-fans-of-kojima-the-wachowskis-once-asked-the-metal-gear-creator-to-make-a-matrix-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Time Extension</a>, a discussion with Chris Bergstresser, former VP of Licensing at Konami, revealed the time that the Wachowskis approached Hideo Kojima about creating a Matrix game.</p>



<p>By that time, Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2, and Metal Gear Solid had all been released and were doing very well.</p>



<p>Bergstresser explained that while Kojima specifically was approached about the project, it was Kasumi Kitaue, Executive Producer at Konami, who shut down the idea of the Japanese firm creating a Matrix game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima. Kazumi Kitaue, Kojima, Aki Saito, and I were at the Konami HQ, and we got a call from the Wachowskis, who wanted to come in and meet with Kojima. So they did!</p>



<p>The two of them came in with their concept artist, and effectively they said to Kojima, ‘We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that?’ Aki translated this into Japanese for Mr. Kitaue, and Kitaue just looked at them and told them plainly, ‘No’. We did still get to enjoy the Matrix Japanese premiere and afterparty, though.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Enter the Matrix was released as the first game in the series in 2003, which was right between the launch of Metal Gear Solid 2 in 2001 and Metal Gear Solid 3 in 2004. Both of these titles were critically acclaimed, award-winning successes that still have a cult following today.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Konami released a top-to-bottom remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.</p>



<p>It’s easy to see why Kitaue didn’t want to meddle with the Matrix, given that Konami had so much more on its plate in the shooter space.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bully Online Has Been Announced, But There’s a Huge Catch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-announced-huge-catch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bully-online-has-been-announced-but-there%E2%80%99s-a-huge-catch.1336480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to play Rockstar Games’ 2006 hit that was dubbed ‘GTA for kids’ alongside your friends, you’ve finally got the opportunity – or at least you will have soon. Bully Online has been revealed, and it features multiplayer exploration, new minigames (some of which are utterly bizarre), and races.</p>



<p>There’s one <strong>huge </strong>catch, though. Bully Online isn’t an official game – <strong>it’s a mod</strong>. It has been pieced together by a team headed by SWEGTA, a popular YouTuber who specializes in Rockstar content.</p>



<h2 id="h-bully-online-actually-looks-like-insane-fun">Bully Online Actually Looks Like Insane Fun</h2>



<p>SWEGTA posted a new trailer to YouTube showcasing Bully Online, a fan-made concoction that brings multiplayer madness to the 2006 open-world title from Rockstar Games. He stressed it has been ‘in the making for a very long time’, and it seems that, for now, Take-Two and Rockstar are willing to let it slide.</p>



<p>The trailer, posted below, showcases the game’s core mechanics, which include things never before seen in the world of Bully (known in some markets as Canis Canem Edit):</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="BULLY Online is Happening!!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2J0_BnWKvEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The team working with SWEGTA to bring this mod to life has left nothing untouched when it comes to creative potential. There are races in everything from cars to shopping carts, clique battles, first-person shooter arenas, gnome skateboarding, and boxing matches.</p>



<p>It’s looking highly customizable, accessible, and entertaining, and as SWEGTA says, there’s really no end to what they can bring to life in Bully Online. It’s a crowdfunded project that is being backed by a Ko-Fi initiative, and it’s only now that SWEGTA and his team feel ready to reveal Bully Online to the public.</p>



<p>In the video, SWEGTA explains:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A lot of the things we thought were impossible just a few years ago can now be done, including making an online mode. We do have an official server for Bully Online, and we plan on making that available to the public to enjoy in due time.</p>
