            <p>Level 5's role-playing sim Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time has hit 500,000 sales in just three days.</p>
<p>Addressing the thousands of players who had bought the game on PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen systems, the developer thanked players by releasing an all-new illustration marking the milestone.</p>

<p>As Matt summarised for us recently, The Girl Who Steals Time is a sequel to Level 5's Fantasy Life - a sort of job-focussed mash-mash of life sim and RPG - which enjoyed modest critical and commercial success when it launched for Nintendo DS back in 2012. Eurogamer's celebrated its "abundance of features" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-review">our 6/10 review</a> at the time, but noted the result was often "less than the sum of its parts".</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Switch, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> version coming later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-tier-list-best-characters">Zenless Zone Zero</a> Season 2, entitled Where Clouds Embrace The Dawn, will launch on 6th June.</p>
<p>Calling it "a significant update and milestone moment" - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-its-not-a-joke-zenless-zone-zero-really-is-coming-to-xbox">the gacha game will also release on the same day for Xbox</a> - HoYoverse teased that in Version 2, players will "embark on a brand-new and exciting journey to Waifei Peninsula, alongside Yixuan from Yunkui Summit".</p>
<p>"In this expansive update, Proxies will venture into the all-new Waifei Peninsula alongside trusted allies such as Yixuan from Yunkui Summit, revitalize the Suibian Temple nestled within the bustling Failume Heights, and take on more challenging Hollow combat in a more open and spacious environment. To commemorate the game's first anniversary, Version 2.0 will bring a wide array of celebration rewards including a free S-Rank Agent, a free S-Rank W-Engine, 1,600 Polychromes and 20 Encrypted Master Tapes," the developer added.</p>

<p>Following the resolution of the Sacrifice crisis in previous chapters, Season 2 sees Proxies further uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon and experience new Hollow exploration gameplay that harnesses the forces of Ether.</p>
<p>"The region's main city Failume Heights thrives near the Lemnian Hollow, renowned for the rare resource Porcelume. It offers distinctive tea houses, pawnshops, and dessert stalls, inviting Proxies to immerse themselves in the local atmosphere," HoYo added. "Meanwhile, Proxies will take on management of their very own Suibian Temple, upgrade the temple's facilities and earn in-game rewards by dispatching Bangboos, completing commissions, and collecting resources from the Hollows."</p>
<p>Several new allies will join the roster: Yixuan, also known as the Grandmaster, will join the combat as an S-Rank Agent, Ju Fufu, the senior disciple of Yunkui Summit, who will debut as an S-Rank Fire Stun Agent, and Pan Yinhu, Yunkui Summit's A-Rank Physical Defense Agent.</p>
<p>The S-Rank Ether Support Astra Yao and the S-Rank Physical Defense Caesar will return to the Version 2.0 banners.</p>
<p>Players can also expect Hollow Zero: Lost Void to be updated with "new commissions and the possibility to equip multiple Gears to different Agents, adding more strategic options to battles", plus a brand-new 3D map with enhanced navigation features.</p>
<p>"In Version 2.0, Proxies will be able to enter the cinema in Lumina Square to enjoy movies with different characters during the Gravitational Attraction event and obtain exclusive rewards by completing certain tasks, including an A-Rank W-Engine Reel Projector," we're told. "In the Soul of Steel: Golden Bond event, Proxies can pilot sleek mechs into the Hollows, take on a variety of challenges, and earn abundant rewards."</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">two voice actors working on Zenless Zone Zero were suddenly recast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike over AI abuse</a>, and discovered the change alongside the publication of the game's patch notes. In a statement subsequently shared on social media, the studio said its contracts offer "explicit AI protections, regardless of union status" and it will continue to work on its clients' projects "in the most human way possible".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/last-defense-academy-makes-confusion-part-of-the-fun.1198089/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/673768/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> starts off by asking a simple question: what happens when you pluck a handful of colorful teenagers from their homes, plop them in a state-of-the-art school filled with every convenience, then force them to fight for their lives? Your guide as you navigate this question is an unsettling and creepy-cute mascot that knows more than it’s let on, and there’s an overarching mystery to the world that you can’t quite put your finger on. </p><p>If you, like I, answered “<em>Danganronpa</em>!” — as this premise sounds very much like the plot of the quirky and irreverent murder-mystery series from Spike Chunsoft — then congratulations! We’re both totally wrong! And after 45 in-game days with <em>LDA,</em> I still have no idea what’s going on, and I love it.</p><p>I’m going to be gentle with myself and you for thinking <em>LDA</em> is another entry in the genre of high school-themed killing games. After all, it was developed by Kazutaka Kodaka, creator and writer of the <em>Danganronpa </em>franchise, in collaboration with Kotaro Uchikoshi, known for his work on the adventure-puzzle game series <em>Zero Escape</em>. And though <em>LDA</em> oozes with the DNA from both series, it stands so completely apart mechanically and narratively that while I can get a grasp on the former, I’m lost with the latter.</p><p>The premise is simple enough. You play as Takumi Sumino, who gets whisked away to the Last Defense Academy, where he and a group of others use their newly awakened powers to defend the school from monster attacks for 100 days. Should they fail, the invaders will destroy the school and thereby… because of plot… all of humanity. Usually past a certain point, I can figure out a game’s core gameplay loop and rough narrative thrust. When the first body dropped in <em>Danganronpa</em>, I immediately understood that I’d be spending the rest of the game solving my classmates’ murders. But I haven’t been able to figure out <em>LDA</em>.</p><div><p><em>LDA</em> fills the gaping hole <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23557639/fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em></a> created and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23688312/advance-wars-reboot-camp-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Advance Wars </em>remakes</a> could not fix</p></div><p>I understand the gameplay loop easily enough: it’s a tactical RPG with visual novel-like relationship-building elements. Combat takes place on a gridded battlefield with each combatant able to attack in a different configuration, similar to chess. One of Takumi’s abilities attacks enemies in a straight line. My ally, Gaku, attacks in a rectangular pattern. Each of my allies’ attacks contributes to a voltage meter that allows us to use our special abilities when full. And if one of my allies should fall, they’ll be revived before the next wave of enemies. </p><p>I like how the tactical combat isn’t like <em>Fire Emblem</em> or <em>Triangle Strategy</em>. <em>LDA </em>is unique, as you’re not trying to manage the complex rock-paper-scissors formula of what weapons are strong or weak against each other. Instead, life is the engine that drives combat. Actions you take are determined by how many action points, or AP, you have, and killing certain enemies grants you more AP. On the flip side, allies who are near death can unleash big special attacks that can clear entire battlefields at the cost of losing them for the rest of the wave.</p><p>Combat then becomes a function of playing with life totals — my enemies and mine. I’ll arrange my attacks in such a way that every time I act, I kill an enemy and gain more AP so I can just keep going, denying my enemies the chance to fight back. Then, when I’m out of AP, I can unleash a killing blow that ends the round. My allies get revived the next round, and I can start the process all over again. I’ve been left so unsatisfied by the crop of tactical RPGs lately, and <em>LDA</em> fills the gaping hole <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23557639/fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em></a> created and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23688312/advance-wars-reboot-camp-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Advance Wars </em>remakes</a> could not fix.</p><p>But while I’ve got a handle on the combat, I still haven’t the faintest clue of the story it’s trying to tell. My confusion is so thorough that as I go through each new day, my experiences start sounding like wartime letters from the front lines.</p><div><blockquote><p>It’s day 33. Our self-proclaimed leader, Hiruko, is still missing. We’re starting to suspect she’ll never return. Meanwhile, the enemy keeps hurling themselves at our defenses. So far, we’ve been able to hold them off. Gaku recently developed his power, revealing himself to be a peerless ranged fighter. But our forces are nowhere near full strength, since Ima, Kako, and Shouma refuse to fight. And alas! Our foodstores have burnt up and I fear we’ll starve soon. War is grim, but I fight knowing the closer I get to the 100th day is a day I am closer to returning home… or so I hope.</p></blockquote></div><p><em>LDA</em>’s narrative is so unlike anything I’ve ever experienced that not knowing what’s happening next is part of the fun. I like getting dragged along for the ride, discovering new developments alongside the characters, who are themselves a delight. <a href="https://aftermath.site/darumi-amemiya-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-emo-cringe-punk">As other outlets have pointed out</a>, Darumi Amemiya is the physical manifestation of the irony-poisoned and terminally online dirtbag edgel(ady), and I adore her even if her characterization gets uncomfortably familiar sometimes. </p><p>I also really enjoy how the characters are over-the-top caricatures themselves — Darumi’s the creepy murder-obsessed emo girl, Takemaru’s the typical fighting-obsessed delinquent — but make decisions like normal people. I often struggle to get into “transported to another world” stories because none of the decisions made in them have ever made sense to me, a woman who can’t turn off her overly logical and reason-obsessed brain in order to just go with the flow. So it’s incredibly refreshing to see these characters push back on the circumstances they’ve been dropped in. </p><p>Instead of just accepting that they’ve been taken from everything they’ve ever known and forced to fight <em>and die</em> (even if that death is temporary), some of my allies maintain a healthy level of skepticism, question everything, and refuse to fight. I know I would! And even better, other characters in the game understand and acknowledge that as a reasonable position. There’s no rah-rah speech of “You must fight!” that convinces them to take up arms. The reluctant characters are given the space to come around on their own time and for their own reasons.</p><p>That may sound boring. After all, in an isekai-like narrative, the characters are usually forced to get on board quickly otherwise there wouldn’t be a plot. So seeing a game take its time with the reluctant characters, letting them work through their hangups in a natural and unforced way, was pleasing to my brain.</p><p>In the almost 50 days I’ve spent with <em>LDA</em>, I do have some working theories as to where the overall story will go. How it gets there, though, I have no clue, but I’m excited to see what twists the game will take along the way.</p><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is out now on Switch and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I love the moral conundrums it presents, the violent grief it depicts, and the games’ excellent writing that poignantly brings all of those complicated emotions to the surface. What I don’t like is listening to pretty much any of the creative team talk about the series, especially when it comes to weighing in on decade-long discourse around its complex storylines. Even when I agree with series director Neil Druckmann’s interpretation of something, we’d all rather he just let bad readings fester in the corners of the internet than tell us exactly what something means. Nevertheless, he continues to do so in interviews. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-fireflies-cure-joel-ellie-vaccine-could-make-1851781975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-fireflies-cure-joel-ellie-vaccine-could-make-1851781975">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="655029cf03bee10f7bc0f96d09b1ccf6" data-recommend-id="image://655029cf03bee10f7bc0f96d09b1ccf6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="655029cf03bee10f7bc0f96d09b1ccf6" data-recommend-id="image://655029cf03bee10f7bc0f96d09b1ccf6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647?_gl=1*gkben*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc2ODI3MTQkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzQ3NjgzOTExJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647?_gl=1*gkben*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc2ODI3MTQkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzQ3NjgzOTExJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw.."><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span> is a very good game that animal lovers can enjoy because there’s no way to harm a single creature in the game (except for people, of course).

            <p>NetherRealm has confirmed there will be no more additional story chapters or characters "from this point on".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X/Twitter, the studio said that despite "hearing players' requests for continued game support of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>", "there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released". It will, however, "continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes".</p>

<p>"It's disappointing because there's no thorough QoL, no online lobbies, &amp; locked away skins....you truly gave us an unfinished $140 game," <a href="https://x.com/Mikemetroid/status/1926025851734196480">replied</a> one player. "An extreme low from WB/NRS. What changed over there???"</p>
<p>As for that "next project" NetherRealm refers to? Well, no-one's entirely sure as it's not been formally confirmed as yet, but that's widely thought to be Injustice 3. Let's watch this space.</p>
<p>Some fans aren't surprised by the announcement, however. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-mortal-kombat-1-definitive-edition-has-fans-thinking-warner-bros-has-quietly-wrapped-up-development">NetherRealm Studios released its surprise Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition on Switch, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC earlier this month with minimal fanfare</a>, bundling together the main game, its Khaos Reigns story expansion, Shang Tsung, two Kombat Packs featuring additional fighters and Kameo characters, some in-game currency, and a selection of skins. Animality finishing moves have also been added in a free update for all players.</p>
<p>"The arrival of the definitive edition meant it was over with the previous games, so... I guess that was it," noted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1kmhhqw/this_means_its_over/">one poster on the Mortal Kombat subreddit</a> at the time, a sentiment largely shared across the playerbase.</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition costs £55/$70 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, while Switch players can pick it up for $60. There's also a £50/$60 Definitive Edition Upgrade ($50 on Switch) for Mortal Kombat 1 owners wanting to get everything in the new version without purchasing each bit of DLC separately.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Packing brand-new sculpts, the essential new Codex, and a suite of datacards designed to get you howling into battle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’ve recently covered army sets from the warp with our reviews of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-world-eaters-gorestorm-slaughterpack-review-gory-goodness" rel="nofollow">World Eaters Army Set</a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-death-guard-poxwrought-vector-review-so-sick" rel="nofollow">Death Guard Army Set</a>, so join us now as we take a sneak peek at this massive army set release.</p>

A lot!</p>

	<li>10 Blood Claws</li>
	<li>6x Wolf Guard Headtakers</li>

<h2><b>Space Wolves Army Set - Special Edition Codex</b></h2>

<p>I really like the look of the Codex, and reading through it we get, as usual, a really great and extensive dive into the lore of this Chapter. From the start of the chapter on the death world of Fenris, to detailing how this Chapter battles with the ferocity of the wolves of their home planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s also an extensive section in the lore describing the heraldry of the Chapter, as well as how each of the different “packs” of warriors (like the Blood Claws and Grey Hunters, which we’ll speak to in a moment). Finally, the Codex includes all the rules you need to play, including how Sagas work for this Chapter.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a Quick Look at the individual units included in this Army Set!</p>



<p>The new Space Wolves Army Set comes with five units all ready to hit the battlefield (after some assembly, of course) and fight until the Wolftime dawns! As opposed to one of our more in-depth reviews where we break down all the stats, for this Army Set preview I really want to just take a Quick Look at what makes each unit feel different from one another and special.</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Guard Battle Leader</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-battle-leader.jpg?itok=RPNs3_Vt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-battle-leader.jpg?itok=X6xvQBgY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Let’s start with the Wolf Guard Battle Leader - veterans of battle and some of the bravest warriors in the army. What makes this unit most unique is how customizable it is. You can choose from an array of melee weapons (a power weapon or a thunder hammer) and ranged options (Carbine, heavy bolt, or plasma pistol), and as a leader you can attach this unit to Blood Claws, Grey Hunters, or Wolf Guard Headtakers.</p>

<p>When you set them up as a leader, you give their unit the Sustained Hits 1 keyword and let them re-roll 1’s when you’re attacking within 6 inches. Not bad for a melee-happy Chapter like the wolves!</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Priest</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-priest.jpg?itok=TtWVfNLJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-priest.jpg?itok=V0r4gklv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Next up is the Wolf Priest, the physical and spiritual leader of the group. And while they’re outfitted with decent weaponry, their abilities truly make the Wolf Priest an extreme standout.</p>

<p>You can attach them to Blood Claws, Grey Hunters, or Wolf Guard Headtakers, and as they act as leaders you’ll get two special abilities. First, you’ve got the Litany of Hate ability, which says if the Priest is leading a unit they add 1 to wound rolls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the real prize here, and what makes the Wolf Priest stand out, is the Healing Balms ability, which says “While this model is leading a unit, in your Command phase, you can return 1 destroyed model (excluding Character models) to that unit.” That’s not a once-per-battle thing, which is huge!</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Guard Headtakers</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-headtakers.jpg?itok=UtiqqE40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-headtakers.jpg?itok=JGQ1VlUm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Wolf Guard Headtakers are tasked with breaking through enemy lines and taking down important figures in the enemy camp. To do that, they’re joined by their ferocious Hunting Wolves!</p>

<p>What makes this unit special is that, at the start of your deploy units phase, you actually split this unit up into two units - one for the marines and the other for the wolves! This unit can also can name one enemy unit as their quarry which gives the marine models in this unit Devastating Wounds and Precision keywords tied to attacking their quarry!</p>

<h3><b>Grey Hunters and Blood Claws</b></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-blood-claws.jpg?itok=NCnjymrg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-blood-claws.jpg?itok=HU7kOajz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Space Wolves Blood Claws</figcaption></figure><p>Blood Claws are the youngest members of the Chapter, hungry to prove themselves in savage battle. Contrasting that are the Grey Hunters, who are older, more mature, and patient marines. These are two different units, but they each only have one thing making them each stand out - beyond the impressive weaponry of your standard space marine.</p>

<p>For the Blood Claws, their fiery and impatient nature is brought to life via their Berserk Charge ability, which let’s them charge in the same turn it Advanced, meaning these marines can cover some serious ground.</p>

<p>For the Grey Hunters, their stalking nature is portrayed in the Cunning Hunters ability, which let’s them re-roll Wound rolls of 1 and, if they’re within range of an object marker, the ability is upgraded to allow them to re-roll all Wound rolls.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-gray-pack.jpg?itok=nzLq0QHV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-gray-pack.jpg?itok=Kldmcjxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Space Wolves Gray Pack</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the Codex, Codex Cards - which do a great job of making it super easy to keep track of your units - and the models, this feels like a very solid offering, and similar to other Space Marine Army Boxes we’ve seen since the launch of 10th. I’ve got some playtesting to do with these models, but on first look - I think you could use this box as the start of an extremely aggressive Force!</p>

Basically: a Very Confident Man was doing his own bathroom reno, and despite the best advice from… everyone speaking to him, made a succession of terrible decisions, many stylistic, others load-bearing (like weakening the floor beneath the tub). It became so notorious that in 2019<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-hot-new-doom-mod-is-a-nightmare-diy-bathroom-renovation-bathdoom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a Doom mod was made to commemorate the job</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Something Awful | bEatmstrJ</figcaption></figure><p>Anyway time moved on, the bathroom was completed,<a href="https://aftermath.site/escape-to-the-country-tv-series-review-from-the-circles-of-hell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> we found other fucked up houses to focus our attention on</a> and got on with our lives. The Doom Bathroom was filed away in our memory banks, where like so many Jokes Of A Time I would have expected it to remain.</p><p>But no! It's now back! Because the house the Doom Bathroom emerged from the depths of hell to take residence in<a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/25380-Coral-Canyon-Rd-Corona-CA-92883/79835564_zpid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is currently up for sale</a>. For just $1,088,000, you could live in this "uniquely remodeled home", which upstairs--provided you equip a chainsaw and are aware that at some point you're going to need to rip and/or tear--features a "master bathroom [that] has been fully transformed with a sleek, modern design that stands out from the rest".</p><p>It really does stand out!

You could click through 94% of this gallery and think this was a normal, boring, house, were it not for the three photos in the middle that show a completely unrelated <em>bathroom from hell</em>.</p><p>If you've never seen the house before please check it out.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">AMD announced its latest graphics card, the Radeon RX 9060 X, at Computex 2025 earlier this week. This is the third GPU in AMD's 9000 series lineup that also includes the RX 9070 and 9070 XT, and its slated to launch June 5. While it's positioned as the entry-level option in the RX 9000 series, the RX 9060 XT runs on the same RNDA 4 architecture as the more powerful RX 9070 and 9070 XT and includes FSR 4 resolution upscaling and frame generation, as well as DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b support. </p><p dir="ltr">AMD is producing two versions of the RX 9060 XT: one with 8GB VRAM and another with 16GB VRAM. Both models will feature 32 RDNA 4 CUs (computation units), up to 3.13GHz clock speed, and between 150W and 182W power draw, depending on the model's VRAM and clock speed. While those are solid specs for an entry-level card, things get a bit more confusing from there.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Power and pricing</h2><p dir="ltr">AMD lists the MSRP as $300 for the 8GB model and $350 for the 16GB model. However, the company is not releasing RX 9060 XT reference cards itself. Instead, third-party manufacturers like Asus, Acer, Gigabyte, and others are launching their own versions of the RX 9060 XT starting June 5. As such, performance, power draw, and pricing will likely differ between the various RX 9060 XT models (especially for overclocked models), but at least some of these GPUs will stick to the reference clock speeds and therefore MSRP (assuming the ongoing tariffs do not impact those prices).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4500190" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4500190"></a><figcaption>Asus is launching three RX 9060 XT models</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for performance, the RX 9060 XT 16GB is positioned as the replacement for AMD's RX 7600 XT as its flagship entry-level GPU, making it the primary competitor to Nvidia's $300 GeForce RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti (which costs either $380 for the 8GB version or $429 for the 16GB version). According to AMD's Computex 2025 presentation, the company's internal testing found the RX 9060 XT is roughly six percent faster than the RTX 5060 Ti on 40 games running at 1440p--and at roughly $80 MSRP cheaper. However, those tests compare the RX 9060 XT 16GB to the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, rather than the RTX 5060 16GB. The RX 9060 8GB model's performance is a bigger question, as the smaller amount of VRAM could lead to significant performance dips.</p><p dir="ltr">On X (formerly Twitter), AMD's Chief Architect of Gaming Solutions and Gaming Marketing, Frank Azor, explained that most players use a 1080p display, for which 8GB of VRAM is more than enough. While technically true, it doesn't alleviate the concerns over confusing consumers who may see the above comparisons of the RX 9060 XT 16GB's 6% performance boost over the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB and assume that applies to <em>all </em>RX 9060 XT models. And again, the actual performance will likely differ between the various SKUs launching June 5, which could further compound the issue.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AzorFrank/status/1925651286998794443" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Majority of gamers are still playing at 1080p and have no use for more than 8GB of memory. Most played games WW are mostly esports games. We wouldn't build it if there wasn't a market for it. If 8GB isn't right for you then there's 16GB. Same GPU, no compromise, just memory…</p>  — Frank Azor (@AzorFrank) <a href="https://twitter.com/AzorFrank/status/1925651286998794443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><h2 dir="ltr">Where to find the AMD RX 9060 XT</h2><p dir="ltr">Those potential concerns and unanswered questions aside, the RX 9060 XT nevertheless looks like a solid entry-level choice for those already invested in AMD's hardware. As mentioned above, multiple manufacturers are releasing RX 9060 XT GPUs starting June 5, and while none are currently listed for preorder, you can learn more about the models announced from <a href="https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rx9060xt-o16g/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus</a>, <a href="https://store.acer.com/en-us/components/graphics-cards" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Acer</a>, and <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Graphics-Card/All-Series?fid=3124" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gigabyte</a>, at each company's online store. Other brands like PowerColor also showed off upcoming RX 9060 XT GPUs on the Computex 2025 show floor. We'll be sure to update this post once the GPUs are available.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-1993-movie-30th-anniversary-edition-blu-ray-where-to-watch-buy-amazon/1100-6531622/">Highly Limited Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary 4K Blu-Ray In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-board-game-monkey-palace-strategy-building-set-amazon-deal-2025/1100-6528660/">Lego Monkey Palace Board Game Is Over 50% Off At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-leverless-arcade-controller-xbox-switch-2-pc-preorder-amazon/1100-6531585/">8BitDo Reveals Leverless Arcade Controllers For PC, Switch, And Xbox</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/locke-key-keyhouse-comic-compendium-gets-massive-limited-time-discount/1100-6531565/">Locke &amp; Key Keyhouse Comic Compendium Gets Massive Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-review-where-to-buy/1100-6530000/">Lego's Awesome New Mario Kart Display Set Is Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joe-abercrombie-the-devils-new-fantasy-book-series-2025-amazon/1100-6531472/">First Book In Joe Abercrombie's New Fantasy Series Is Finally Here</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-optimus-prime-lego-set-restocked-and-20-off-at-amazon/1100-6509331/">Amazon Restocks Lego Transformers Optimus Prime, Offers Big Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-super-mario-bowser-muscle-car-amazon-deal-retiring-lego-set/1100-6531375/">PSA: Lego Bowser's Muscle Car Is Retiring - Save Big On 3 Mario Sets Before They're Gone</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/673938/gabe-newell-valve-founder-brain-computer-interface-first-chip-starfish<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve co-founder and CEO Gabe Newell, the company behind <em>Half-Life</em> and <em>DOTA 2</em> and <em>Counter-Strike</em> and preeminent PC game distribution platform Steam, has long toyed with the idea that your brain should be more connected to your PC. It <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014734/Biofeedback-in-Gameplay-How-Valve">began over a decade ago</a> with in-house psychologists studying people’s biological responses to video games; <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/13/2947088/valve-reveals-secret-hardware-project-wearable-computing">Valve once considered earlobe monitors</a> for its first VR headset. The company publicly explored the idea of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhj3C1H5JWo">brain-computer interfaces for gaming</a> at GDC in 2019.</p><p>But Newell decided to spin off the idea. That same year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125379/is-gabe-newells-neuralink-competitor-coming-out-of-stealth">he quietly incorporated</a> a new brain-computer interface startup, Starfish Neuroscience — which has now revealed plans to produce its very first brain chip later this year.</p><p><a href="https://starfishneuroscience.com/blog/ultra-low-power-miniature-electrophysiological-electronics/?header-bg=card-bg0">Starfish’s first blog post</a>, spotted <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1925459695713525986">by Valve watcher Brad Lynch</a>, makes it clear we’re not talking about a complete implant yet. This bit is the custom “electrophysiology” chip designed to record brain activity (like how Neuralink can “read your mind” so patients can interact with computers) and stimulate the brain (for disease therapy), but Starfish isn’t claiming it’s already built the systems to power it or the bits to stick it into a person’s head.</p><p>“We anticipate our first chips arriving in late 2025 and <strong>we are interested in finding collaborators for whom such a chip would open new and exciting avenues</strong>,” writes Starfish neuroengineer Nate Cermak (bolding theirs), suggesting that Starfish might wind up partnering with other companies for wireless power or even the final brain implant.</p><p>But the goal, writes Starfish, is a smaller and less invasive implant than the competition, one that can “enable simultaneous access to multiple brain regions” instead of just one site, and one that doesn’t require a battery. Using just 1.1 milliwatts during “normal recording,” Starfish says it can work with wireless power transmission instead.</p><p>Here’s the chip’s current spec sheet:</p><div><ul><li><span>Low power: 1.1 mW total power consumption during normal recording </span></li><li><span>Physically small: 2 x 4mm (0.3mm pitch BGA) </span></li><li><span>Capable of both recording (spikes and LFP) &amp; stimulation (biphasic pulses) </span></li><li><span>32 electrode sites, 16 simultaneous recording channels at 18.75kHz </span></li><li><span>1 current source for stimulating on arbitrary pairs of electrodes </span></li><li><span>Onboard impedance monitoring and stim voltage transient measurement </span></li><li><span>Digital onboard data processing and spike detection allows the device to operate via low-bandwidth wireless interfaces. </span></li><li><span>Fabricated in TSMC 55nm process</span></li></ul></div><p>Neuralink’s N1, for comparison, has 1,024 electrodes across its 64 brain-implanted threads, <a href="http://whole ASIC consumes approximately 6 mW">a chip that consumed around 6 milliwatts as of 2019</a>, a battery that periodically needs wireless charging, and the full implant (again, not just the chip) is around 23mm wide and 8mm thick. The Elon Musk-led company has reportedly already implanted it in three humans; while some of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24152758/neuralinks-first-implant-in-a-human-started-to-detach-from-the-patients-brain">threads did detach</a> from the first patient’s brain, he still has functionality and <a href="https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/full-q-and-a-neuralink-patient-noland">has been giving interviews</a>.</p><p>Starfish says it could be important to connect to multiple parts of the brain simultaneously, instead of just one region, to address issues like Parkinson’s disease. “there is increasing evidence that a number of neurological disorders involve circuit-level dysfunction, in which the interactions between brain regions may be misregulated,” Cermak writes.</p><p>In addition to multiple simultaneous brain implants, <a href="https://starfishneuroscience.com/research/">the company’s updated website says</a> it’s working on a “precision hyperthermia device” to destroy tumors with targeted heat, and a brain-reading, robotically guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) system for addressing neurological conditions like bipolar disorder and depression.</p><p>In case you’re wondering how any of this might make its way back to gaming, I’ll leave you with Valve’s talk from GDC 2019 about brain-computer interfaces.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What jobs you have your sims sign up for is totally up to you, but there are a lot of factors that can affect your performance, like whether your sim's skills are appropriate for the job you want. If you want your sims to be successful, some knowledge and effort are required--just like it is with a real job.</p><p dir="ltr">While there are specific things you'll need to know about each individual career that can help you get ahead, there are also some universal tips that can help your sims climb their corporate ladders.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#General_tips_for_any_Sims_4_career">General tips for any Sims 4 career</a><ul><li><a href="#Pick_an_active__self_employment__or_rabbit_hole_job">Pick an active, self-employment, or rabbit hole job</a></li><li><a href="#Do_well_in_school">Do well in school</a></li><li><a href="#Get_career_related_reward_perks">Get career-related reward perks</a></li><li><a href="#Actually_do_the_job">Actually do the job</a></li><li><a href="#Work_overtime">Work overtime</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Sims_4_normal_careers">All Sims 4 normal careers</a><ul><li><a href="#Astronaut">Astronaut</a></li><li><a href="#Athlete">Athlete</a></li><li><a href="#Business">Business</a></li><li><a href="#Criminal">Criminal</a></li><li><a href="#Culinary">Culinary</a></li><li><a href="#Entertainer">Entertainer</a></li><li><a href="#Painter">Painter</a></li><li><a href="#Secret_Agent">Secret Agent</a></li><li><a href="#Tech_Guru">Tech Guru</a></li><li><a href="#Writer">Writer</a></li><li><a href="#Critic">Critic</a></li><li><a href="#Politician">Politician</a></li><li><a href="#Social_Media">Social Media</a></li><li><a href="#Conservationist">Conservationist</a></li><li><a href="#Gardener">Gardener</a></li><li><a href="#Freelancer">Freelancer</a></li><li><a href="#Military">Military</a></li><li><a href="#Education">Education</a></li><li><a href="#Engineer">Engineer</a></li><li><a href="#Law">Law</a></li><li><a href="#Style_Influencer">Style Influencer</a></li><li><a href="#Salaryperson">Salaryperson</a></li><li><a href="#Civil_Designer">Civil Designer</a></li><li><a href="#Romance_Consultant">Romance Consultant</a></li><li><a href="#Undertaker">Undertaker</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Sims_4_active_careers">All Sims 4 active careers</a><ul><li><a href="#Doctor">Doctor</a></li><li><a href="#Detective">Detective</a></li><li><a href="#Scientist">Scientist</a></li><li><a href="#Retail">Retail</a></li><li><a href="#Interior_Decorator">Interior Decorator</a></li><li><a href="#Reaper">Reaper</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="General_tips_for_any_Sims_4_career">General tips for any Sims 4 career</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Pick_an_active__self_employment__or_rabbit_hole_job">Pick an active, self-employment, or rabbit hole job</h3><p dir="ltr">There are three main types of careers in The Sims 4. Most of them are rabbit hole-type jobs, where your sims just go offscreen and do their thing without any meaningful input from the player. But there are also "active" careers, where you follow your sim to their place of business and you'll have to make them do various tasks (though you can also play these as rabbit hole jobs if you'd prefer), and self-employment and freelance careers where your sim will complete individual gigs from the comfort of their homes, like writing a book, painting a picture, or building furniture.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Do_well_in_school">Do well in school</h3><p dir="ltr">Teens who get good grades in high school will automatically earn a career level or two in any job they take--a B GPA starts you at level 2 of every career your sim joins for the rest of their lives, and an A will let them start at the third tier. Likewise, there are specific college degrees that will help both your starting level and your performance--we'll note those below.</p><p dir="ltr">In your lifetime aspiration rewards, there are some perks you can purchase that will help a lot with any career you take on. Professional Slacker (4000 reward points) will make it so you'll never lose your job or get demoted for bad performance, and the Connections trait will make it so you start any career three levels higher than you normally would--this stacks with any bonuses you earned in high school or college as well. The Savant perk (4000 points), which increases all skill gains by 25%, will also help, as most jobs have specific skill requirements for promotions.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Actually_do_the_job">Actually do the job</h3><p dir="ltr">For the most part, the job will tell you exactly what it is your sim needs to do to get ahead. Most jobs will require you to complete certain tasks while you're off the clock (homework, basically) or increase certain skills in order to earn a promotion--whatever those requirements are will be listed in the career tab in the bottom right corner of the screen. Likewise, active careers will have random tasks for your sims while they're at the office, and if you don't do at least some of them each day, you'll end up making very little money.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Work_overtime">Work overtime</h3><p dir="ltr">Some jobs allow your sim to stay two hours past the normal end of their shift, which improves their job performance and earns them overtime pay. Using that option whenever it's available can advance your career much more quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond that, you'll also want to level up each career's relevant skills and make sure your sim is in the best mood for the job whenever possible. To help you with that, below you'll find a list of each of the normal and active careers in The Sims 4, along with a rundown on the relevant skills, ideal moods, and which college degrees are most relevant. Follow this guide, and no matter which career you put your sim in, they'll be raking in the cash and vacation days in no time.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="All_Sims_4_normal_careers">All Sims 4 normal

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-roblox-grow-a-garden-geoguessr<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For better and, often, worse, traditional video games have calcified. If you check Steam’s top ten most-played games on any given day, you’ll likely find a lineup of the usual suspects: <em>PUBG</em>, <em>DOTA</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, and the odd recent breakout hit (with a major license attached) like <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Across the way, on their own clients, you’ll find mirror realm versions of the aforementioned games like <em>Fortnite, Valorant, </em>and <em>League of Legends</em>. But then, in another universe, there’s <em>Roblox</em>, which plays by its own, different set of rules. This week, its latest crop to yield viral fruit, <em>Grow A Garden</em>, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made headlines</a> by outpacing anything on Steam. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we discuss how it and other games of its ilk offer young people something that more traditional games don’t.</p><p>This time around we’re joined by <a href="https://aftermath.site/author/nicole-carpenter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath’s newest regular contributor</a>, former Polygon senior reporter Nicole Carpenter to discuss her tenure at <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-staff-goodbye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the freshly gutted games media institution</a>, as well as how she got into journalism in the first place. She also tells us about the time she <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23776996/barbie-fashion-designer-retro-game-untold-story-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got to speak to the voice of Barbie for a story</a>, and she started speaking in character without even being asked. You love to hear it.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we delve into the news of the week: First, the community around Google Maps-based location guessing game <em>GeoGuessr </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/geoguessr-blackout-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protested the game’s inclusion in the Saudi-backed Esports World Cup</a> by blacking out most of the game’s most popular maps… and it worked? Despite the prevailing mentality that corporate interests and oil money will overcome all, <em>GeoGuessr</em>’s developers relented and pulled out of the event. We talk about the ways in which this situation was unique, but conclude that it can still serve as an inspiration to other gaming communities unnerved by the sudden presence of a&nbsp; sportswashing festival on their annual calendars.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to <em>Grow A Garden</em>, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a <em>Roblox </em>game Nicole wrote about</a> that has more concurrent players than anything on Steam. Why is it so popular? And what is <em>Roblox </em>offering young people that more traditional games don’t? Lastly, we accept an offer from the King Of All Cosmos and transform Aftermath into a giant ball company.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can roll up the first giant ball with a second, giant-er ball.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nicole: </strong>It really is just… you grow a garden. It has the typical <em>Roblox </em>look: It kinda looks like Legos. You’re buying seeds and planting the seeds. You’re waiting a little bit for the seeds to grow; you don’t actually have to wait very long. And then you’re selling those so you can go buy more seeds and then plant them in your garden and sell them. You do that over and over and over and over.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing that I think draws people to it is that there’s an RNG element. Your crops can mutate. They can become really rare, so you can get a lot of money. But basically, at its core, it’s watching a number go up, which, you know, universal game activity that draws people back.</p><p>There is a social aspect to it: You can have five people per server, all in what is not dissimilar to a community garden. You each have your own plots, and you’re hanging out. There’s events that happen there. The developer has his global commands; he can make stuff happen in the game. They do dance parties. They’re doing one this weekend: the Monster Mash. And they do lightning bolts, mutate your crops – special stuff like that.&nbsp;</p><p>When I first started playing it for this story, I was baffled. It’s so simple. It’s so heavily monetized. You can play it without buying anything, but if you want to steal from another person, you have to pay. It’s less than a dollar, which I think can be pretty insidious. That’s a <em>Roblox </em>thing in general: Everything is so cheap that you don’t really realize how it adds up. But as I kept playing, I was like “Is this good?” It’s really satisfying and built around viral moments on short-form platforms like YouTube Shorts or TikTok. There are older people, like people my age, playing it, but it’s a lot of gen alpha.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What about it lends itself especially well to viral moments? When somebody goes viral playing this game, what is happening?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nicole:</strong> What I’ve seen is people stealing from each other. If you’ve been playing this a lot, you can get really rare stuff – stuff that for me as a beginner player is totally not accessible. So stealing it, you’re literally picking their plant or whatever and selling it for your own money. There are ways to protect yourself, but it’s funny when someone accidentally forgets to protect that thing, and they get their prize crop stolen. And these videos also have a lot of screaming. Typical TikTok things. That’s largely where I’m seeing the viral moments.</p><p>When I interviewed the dev, he was saying that all those five million people aren’t necessarily playing the game; they’re joining this low-stakes thing for these events to be part of the thing. It’s so easy to plant a few crops. It’s so low stakes and low investment that it’s easy for people to be like “I’m gonna try that out” or “I’ll play it” or “This will become my new social space.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Luke, you were talking about this <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lppoyvczec2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Bluesky</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Yeah, it’s funny watching this game blow up, because they’re all largely the same thing. If you’re not familiar with <em>Roblox</em> – and I’m assuming that’s most of you, and you’re better for it – my son spends all of his time on <em>Roblox</em>, so I’ve developed an unnatural understanding of how it all works and operates and what the appeal is. Like Nicole was saying, these are barely games. What’s important to understand here is, they are social experiences that these large groups of similar-aged kids log onto, and they’re kinda doing it in the background, and a number’s going up, and something is happening that’s making them feel good, but at the same time, nine of their friends from school are in chat, and it’s a space where they’re hanging out.&nbsp;</p><p>The game is happening, but there’s actually not much game. It’s like guys watching football. The game’s on, but there’s really seven people having a beer and catching up. It’s that, but for 12 year-olds – with some deeply problematic structures built into the platform. Although I guess sports have that too with sports gambling and alcoholism. [<em>Roblox</em>] has crippling monetization and the normalization of gambling and stuff built into it.</p><p>But yeah, it’s been funny watching people grapple with this game’s popularity, because it shows that they don’t deal with <em>Roblox </em>on a daily basis. This game blew up, but it kinda only blew up a little more than any other game that is blowing up on a given day in <em>Roblox</em>. Next week, <em>Grow A Garden </em>might have disappeared completely and be replaced with <em>Weightlifting Guy Simulator</em> or–</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> <em>Sisyphus Simulator 4</em>.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> It’s just so funny watching people [try to figure out why these games get big]. And I’m guilty of this myself; I used to write about <em>Roblox </em>at Kotaku, and I used to grossly misrepresent it because honestly, it was very difficult to understand as a normal adult who didn’t have to experience it on a regular basis. But now that I’ve had to spend time with it, it’s so funny watching people grapple with it, because it’s so foreign to how so many of us understand how video games operate – how we operate within them and what we get out of them. <em>Roblox </em>is just on such a completely different level.&nbsp;</p><p>“Why are they playing this terrible game?” Dude, they’re barely playing it. Stop thinking of this as a video game. It’s social lubricant. My 12-year-old son… the pandemic fucked my kids up badly, because they had to spend two or three years doing school work from home on and off and having all their social events curtailed and missing important events. Those were formative years of their life, and so suddenly kids of that age – I’ve got a 14 year-old and a 12 year-old – have just learned to be online during some of their most formative social years in ways that go well beyond what any of us would associate with that. They’ll have friends that live in this suburb that they could go and visit, and they don’t. They sit on <em>Roblox </em>or Snapchat with them, because that’s been normalized to them.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are deeply problematic aspects to <em>Roblox</em>, we let him keep playing because a) we control the spend, and b) he’s getting a lot out of it. It’s not a bad video game for him. It’s just the place where he hangs out with his friends. I think that’s way better than him just sort of lying in his room watching TV or whatever. He’s always actively talking to them and communicating, and they’re always plotting strategies and doing stuff we would associate with gaming; you’d do that playing <em>Halo </em>on a couch or playing <em>FIFA</em>. But they’re all doing it every day in ways that are really healthy.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse"><h3>This Video Game Is Also a Hockey Training Tool</h3></a><p>Dangleverse, which I've been using to practice hockey off the rink, is in beta right now</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoguessr-blackout-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia"><h3>GeoGuessr Map Makers Make Most Popular Maps Unplayable In Protest Of Saudi-Backed Esports World Cup [Update]</h3></a><p>"The GeoGuessr community is diverse and includes many members of groups that would be harshly persecuted were they to live in Saudi Arabia"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/midea-u-shape-ac-gone"><h3>The Most Popular Window Air Conditioner Has Disappeared From Store Shelves</h3></a><p>The Midea U-Shaped air conditioner is universally beloved.

Clearly, Mortal Kombat 1 has underperformed compared to previous games in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> on the official Mortal Kombat social media account, Warner Bros. acknowledged the disappointment the news will cause players, "but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. failed to say what this new project is, but current speculation points to Injustice 3, a continuation of NetherRealm’s DC fighting game series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>We are hearing players’ requests for continued game support of Mortal Kombat 1, and, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on.</blockquote><blockquote>We understand this will be disappointing for fans, but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">March 2025's release of the T-1000 guest character, which came a year-and-a-half after the release of Mortal Kombat 1 itself, now goes down as the game’s final major content drop. For context, in July 2021, NetherRealm announced it had started work on its next project (Mortal Kombat 1) and, as a result, there would be no further DLC for Mortal Kombat 11. That announcement came two years and three months after the release of the game. Today’s announcement comes one year and eight months after the release of Mortal Kombat 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are already bringing up prior comments from NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon, who had promised fans years of support. Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago"><u>many are now pointing to a September 2024 tweet from Boon</u></a>, who at the time moved to reassure fans already concerned that the studio had moved onto its next game by saying: “NetherRealm is still fully committed to supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mortal-kombat-1-community-is-working-together-to-try-to-figure-out-how-to-fight-floyd-but-the-exact-process-remains-a-mystery-for-now"><u>Mortal Kombat 1 enjoyed something of a resurgence in January with the secret fight with Floyd</u></a>, the pink ninja developer Boon had been teasing for years. That sparked a fun community-wide effort that breathed new life into the game. But that was a rare bright spot for what has, overall, been a disappointing release for many core Mortal Kombat fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What now for Mortal Kombat? Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated that it still believes the gory fighting game franchise has a future. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which was Mortal Kombat</u></a>. Movie adaptation Mortal Kombat 2 is due out later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>We're only a few weeks into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s Star Wars season, but since the season is only five weeks long, that means we're already getting close to the end. Once Star Wars season wraps up, things will be back to normal in Battle Royale and Zero Build--or maybe there's nothing normal at all about what's coming up next season.</p><p>Right now we've got a lot more questions (about 7,000) than we do answers (about 0) regarding what's in store for the Fortnite island once all these Star Wars people leave, but let's go through the rumors and guesswork we've got so far.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Is_the_upcoming_Fortnite_season_Chapter_6_Season_3_or_Chapter_6_Season_4_">Is the upcoming Fortnite season Chapter 6 Season 3 or Chapter 6 Season 4?</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_start_date">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start date</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_s_live_finale_event">Fortnite Star Wars season's live finale event</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_battle_pass_skins">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 battle pass skins</a></li><li><a href="#Gameplay_changes_in_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3">Gameplay changes in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_OG_Season_4">Fortnite OG Season 4</a></li><li><a href="#New_Lego_Fortnite_Pass">New Lego Fortnite Pass</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_the_upcoming_Fortnite_season_Chapter_6_Season_3_or_Chapter_6_Season_4_">Is the upcoming Fortnite season Chapter 6 Season 3 or Chapter 6 Season 4?</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't have a confirmed answer for this question right now, but since the Star Wars season is designated in the game's metadata as Chapter 6 MS1 (mini-season 1), it stands to reason that next season will be called Season 3. It also implies, but <em>does not confirm,</em> plans for an additional mini-seasons in the future.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_start_date">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start date</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortnite: Galactic Battle is currently scheduled to come to a close on June 7, with the new season slated to begin on the morning of June 8. But this season won't end in the middle of the night, as most Fortnite seasons do.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_s_live_finale_event">Fortnite Star Wars season's live finale event</h2><p dir="ltr">As promised by Epic when the season began, the Star Wars Galactic Battle season will conclude with a live event in which players will storm the Death Star and confront Emperor Palpatine in order to end the Empire's invasion of the island. This will be a true live event, like the ones that come at the end of each chapter, and it'll take place on Saturday, June 7 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</h2><p dir="ltr">It's rumored that the upcoming season of Battle Royale <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920308377025941969" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be superhero themed</a>, but in the more traditional capes-and-tights sort of way--with Midas running a school for superheroes, apparently. Word is that the new season will have a DC Comics bent, which makes sense with a new Superman film landing in July. And since Fortnite's only existing Superman skin is permanently locked behind the Chapter 2 Season 7 battle pass from 2021, the rumors about <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1918704607083282696" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new item shop Superman</a> make perfect sense.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499942" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499942"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_battle_pass_skins">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 battle pass skins</h2><p dir="ltr">It's expected that the new season will have a normal battle pass that includes several Fortnite-original characters and one or two collab skins. It's very likely that a new corrupted version of Daigo will be on the pass, since the cinematic at the end of Season 2 showed Daigo entering the magic portal in the northeasern part of the island and transforming into a very different body. Beyond that, the only rumored collab skin for the battle pass <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920308377025941969" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is Robin</a>--yes, we're talking about Batman's pal here.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Gameplay_changes_in_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3">Gameplay changes in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3</h2><p dir="ltr">All the rumors and leaks about the upcoming season being superhero-themed also mention that <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1921999441885577714" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">superpowers will be a</a> key part <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920524099136467202" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">of your arsenal</a> in the new season. Not gadgets like we had in last year's Marvel season, but rather actual super-powered abilities--stuff like the mythic Jujutsu Kaisen and Dragon Ball items, or Avatar's elemental abilities.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_4">Fortnite OG Season 4</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 4 of Fortnite OG will also begin on June 8, and that may be because the original Season 4 also had a superhero theme. While Fortnite OG will certainly stick with the loot pool and map that the original Season 4 had, we can't help but wonder if there will be story connections between OG and standard Battle Royale given the simultaneous start dates.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Epic has seemingly been teasing the return of The Visitor, whose arrival with the meteor in the original Season 4 kicked off Fortnite's plot, with <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1920631430188568835" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this remix of an old Seven-related music track</a> that appears to have a modified version of The Visitor's head and shoulders on the cover art. The Visitor would have been a prime candidate for a remix even without that tease, so no one would be surprised if he appeared on the new OG Pass.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_Lego_Fortnite_Pass">New Lego Fortnite Pass</h2><p dir="ltr">The new Lego Pass will <em>also</em> begin on June 8, and we have no rumors or anything about what's in store. But given the date, we have every reason to expect it will tie in with this hypothetical superhero theme. Given DC's close relationship with Lego, it wouldn't be surprising at all for one of that brand's heroes to pop up here.</p>

            <p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time has had an unexpectedly strong start for a sequel to a fairly obscure 13-year Nintendo DS game. And developer Level 5 has now thanked fans for their enthusiasm, pledging to release free DLC in response to its "global success".
</p>
<p>
The Girl Who Steals Time, for context, is a sequel to Level 5's Fantasy Life - a sort of job-focussed mash-mash of life sim and RPG - which enjoyed modest critical and commercial success when it launched for Nintendo DS back in 2012. Eurogamer's celebrated its "abundance of features" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-review">our 6/10 review</a> at the time, but noted the result was often "less than the sum of its parts".
</p>
<p>
But in this post-Stardew Valley world - where you can't watch an indie showcase without seeing a dozen new village sims jostling for attention - the newly released Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals seems to resonated with audiences. It's garnered a positive early critical reception and even surpassed 45K concurrents on its first day on Steam (that's more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> managed) - and Level 5 is now celebrating its launch with news of more to come.

<p>
"Due to the game's global success and the warm support from players around the world," it <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250523_01/">wrote in a message on its website</a>, "we have decided to release a free DLC that includes new recipes as well as expanded content under the title 'Update the World!'."
</p>
<p>
Level 5 hasn't shared much in the way of specifics, but it promises "new content designed to make use of high-rarity weapons obtained from Treasure Groves and other sources", as well as "even more opportunities [for players] to showcase their gear". The studio says it's working to release the DLC "as soon as possible", and will provide further details at a later date. It sounds like there's even more on the way too; "We will continue to update and improve Fantasy Life i," it adds, "so that players can enjoy its world more comfortably and for an even longer time." 
</p>
<p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Switch, with a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> version coming later this year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/games-workshop-reports-strong-profits-hands-out-%C2%A320-million-to-staff.1197843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-reports-strong-profits-hands-out-ps20-million-to-staff<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Employees at Games Workshop are getting a pay bonus. Despite the tabletop industry being highly volatile due to reckless <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a> disrupting trade and imports, the UK-based studio has reported growth. Growth that will be given to its staff.</p>

<h2>The Games Workshop Windfall</h2>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/warhammer-games-workshop-staff-payout-b2756495.html" rel="nofollow">The Independent</a>, Games Workshop will be distributing bonus payments to its staff drawn from profits. These bonus payments will be distributed on an equal basis to each member of the staff. The studio, most well-known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: 40,000 </em></a>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em></a>, stated the payout was in recognition of its employees' contributions to financial performance.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=QoeV3s9Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=SlKjeshh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That performance has led to a £20 million windfall for the company, demonstrating strong sales and growth. This is a notable increase from last year, which saw £18 million shared among the staff for stellar performance. Considering other tabletop studios have either shut down or have filed lawsuits in response to current events, this report of growth is unexpected.</p>

<p>As for how much that&nbsp;£20 million will break down among the Games Workshop staff, that is harder to parse. GW doesn't disclose how many employees they have, but it is believed they have 1,500 employees in their home base in Nottingham. Assuming that number is correct, that would mean each employee may be getting about £13k in pay bonuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the staff number cited doesn't take into account global employees, either in offices outside the UK or working online.</p>

<p>A major factor in Games Workshop's growth are its licensed video games. These include ongoing support for Owlcat Games' RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</em></a> and Saber Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-marine-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></a>. This is in addition to strong sales and ongoing support for the company's many tabletop miniatures games.</p>

<p>The growth of Games Workshop may not be slowing down anytime soon. The company has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/amazon-warhammer-40000-film-contract-signed-production-can-now-begin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">partnered with Amazon</a> and Vertigo Entertainment to produce official movies and TV shows set within the grimdark sci-fi world of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. Better still, the production has the star power of Henry Cavill on board.</p>

If you just want a fun, colorful throwback to pass the time, my suggestion is <em>Penny’s Big Breakaway</em>, one of last year’s great unsung Dreamcast 3D platformer homages. </p><p>There are two other Switch games that are only slightly on sale but might be of interest. The <em>Chrono Trigger</em>-like <em>Sea of Stars</em> is currently $22.75 (around 30 percent off), but just got a big free <em>Throes of the Watchmaker</em> DLC that adds a new eight-hour quest, additional character, and more classes. <em>Labyrinth of the Demon King, </em>meanwhile, is a lo-fi horror dungeon crawler that just came out last week and is already turning heads. It’s $16 this week (20 percent off). If you’re interested in what might end up on the list of 2025's most overlooked games, I’d give this one a shot. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
