<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s upcoming competitor is none other than its decades-old rival, Digimon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-card-game-con-mobile-phone-app-teaser-renamon-1851770444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, a new post on the digimon_tcg account on <a href="https://x.com/digimon_tcg/status/1901112392492478758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> teased an upcoming digital card game for the franchise. The post includes a short 10-second teaser, where we see Renamon hovering over a smartphone before the Digimon is suddenly sucked into the phone. That’s all that was revealed. However, more information about the game will be shown during Digimon Con on March 20.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon and Digimon have been rivals for decades, with the former eventually taking the lead. However, seeing how Pokemon TCG Pocket has amassed so much success within such a short time, earning over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-surpassed-120-million-in-earnings-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$120 million</a> within the first seventeen days and crossing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-crossed-30-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 million downloads</a> within the first nine, Digimon seems to want a cut of that success too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like the Pokemon Trading Card Game, Digimon has also had a card game since 2020, so they already have an established base for the digital version. However, the title’s success ultimately depends on the audience’s reception of another digital trading card game based on a different franchise. However, fans in the r/digimon subreddit seem ecstatic about the new digital trading card game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Niantic, Pokemon Go’s developer, has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-developer-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired by Scopely</a> for $3.5 billion. Also, here’s everything we know about Pokemon Champions, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-champions-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its release window, platforms</a> and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on Digimon planning to compete with Pokemon TCG Pocket?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

So this announcement, coming three months into 2025, will help reassure fans that Ark 2 is still in the works, although Studio Wildcard failed to provide an updated release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do have firmer details for Ark: Lost Colony, however.

This week's bumper Nintendo Music update also brings a third set of songs to the service, from Dr Mario on the NES - which has its own another catchy melody.
</p>
<p>
But nothing beats that classic Tetris track, remixed and resampled countless times over the years in other Tetris sequels, such as the Switch's own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tetris-1999">Tetris 99</a> and the brilliant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tetris-effect">Tetris Effect</a> Connected.

Remember that, if you're a Switch Online subscriber, you can download the Nintendo Music app on your iPhone or Android device at no extra charge.

            <p>Amazon's God of War series already has a second season ordered, even though the first hasn't even aired. In fact, the last I checked, the first season doesn't even have a release date yet.</p>
<p>Confirmation that we'll get at least two God of War seasons comes from showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Moore appeared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu704p568-Y">The Sackhoff Show</a> with Battlestar Galactica's Katee Sackhoff, and this is when the topic of God of War's TV adaptation came up.</p>
<p>"Right now I'm working on an adaptation of this video game called God of War - it's a big title in the gaming world - that Amazon has ordered two seasons of and they asked me to come in," Moore said. "I'm literally in the writers room and working on that. That's my new thing." </p>
<p>Moore admitted he isn't a "a gamer", and hadn't done something like this before - but had at least tried to play the God of War games, albeit rather unsuccessfully. </p>
<p>"I took a stab at it," Moore continued, before joking he "grew up in the arcade era" of gaming.  "I can do that... Astroids? Bring it on baby," he quipped.</p>
<p>"The controllers now..." Moore continued with a laugh. "Press R1, which one's R1, oh I'm dead! I can't quite get a hold of that." It sounds like Moore's family have a better handle on modern gaming, though, as the showrunner noted his wife was a fan of Skyrim. </p>

<p>Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of last year</a> following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>. Despite the shakeup, the likes of Cory Barlog from God of War studio Sony Santa Monica remain an executive producer on the upcoming TV series, as does PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Sony's Hermen Hulst and Vertigo's Roy Lee.</p>
<p>Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is also a co-executive producer on Amazon's God of War adaptation.</p>

		<p>Krafton have announced their plans for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg/">PUBG</a> which is still going strong after eight years. The big news is at the end of 2025 the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions will launch “bringing significant improvements to performance, FPS, map loading speeds, and overall graphical quality.”</p>
<p>“This transition will optimize PUBG for modern hardware, addressing long-standing limitations and enhancing the overall experience for console players,” say Krafton, which does seem to suggest that the Xbox One and PS4 versions of the game may be closed down. The game will also move on to Unreal Engine 5 so should look rather nice.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG | 2025 Roadmap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_snNMMlEk-w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a lot more to come, here are a few highlights:</p>
<p><em>Gunplay remains a top priority, with regular balance updates planned throughout the year. Every two months, balance patches will address key adjustments to the weapon meta, ensuring a dynamic and evolving combat experience. Additionally, an annual large-scale rebalancing will be introduced to shake up weapon usage and encourage diverse playstyles. Alongside these changes, underutilized weapons such as SRs, LMGs, and Handguns will receive improvements to increase their viability. New weapons and attachments are also currently in development, further expanding the arsenal available to players.</em></p>

<p><em>PUBG’s AI system is undergoing a fundamental transformation, making bots behave in a more realistic and strategic manner. AI opponents will react to the shrinking Blue Zone, take cover more effectively, and even deploy smoke grenades to obscure visibility in combat situations. These enhancements aim to make AI encounters feel more natural while ensuring a fair and engaging experience for all players.</em></p>
<p><em>A major world update is planned for the end of the year, transforming existing maps to create new gameplay experiences while maintaining the essence of what players love. Rather than introducing an entirely new map, KRAFTON is reimagining old favorites to offer fresh challenges and strategic opportunities. Additionally, the&nbsp;Destructible Terrain&nbsp;feature is being introduced in Taego, Miramar, and Erangel, further deepening player-world interactions.</em></p>
<p>Along with all of that there will be new guns, new vehicles,&nbsp; and an expansion in Arcade modes and collaborative content.</p>

		<p>Developer Spooky Doorway and publisher Raw Fury have announced The Séance of Blake Manor, a detective game that puts you in a spooky missing person case. Set in Ireland in the year 1897, players take on the role of Detective Declan Ward who has been summoned to solve the case of the disappearance of Evelyn Deane. The case is going to be tough especially when it is Halloween, you are surrounded by mystics gathered for a séance, and the unexplainable situations that plague the investigation.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Séance of Blake Manor | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/09m6cxehfFo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a post, developer Spooky Doorway said, <em>“Inspired by Irish Mythology and the spiritualist movements of the Victorian era, The Séance of Blake Manor is depicted by a beautiful comic-book art style and comes to you from the creators of The Darkside Detective. We’ve been working on this for a long time and are delighted to finally share some new updates. You’ll be hearing a lot more about Blake Manor in the weeks and months ahead…”</em></p>
<p>As a detective players will need to question those gathered at Blake Manor, make observations about each individual, search for clues, and uncover the past stories of the manor to really understand what is going on. As clues are gathered, you will need to make logical deductions even with illogical situations popping up to figure out what happened to Evelyn Deane. Time is not on your side either as the minutes will tick by, and the other people will be going about their day. You may miss vital clues if you are not in the right place when a significant event happens.</p>

<p>A release date has not yet been set for The Séance of Blake Manor, and it appears PC is the only platform confirmed.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-came-as-a-shock-to-pocketpair-because-patent-infringement-was-something-that-no-one-even-considered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Pocketpair’s communications director and publishing manager, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley, addressed Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld during a panel at GDC 2025. Bucky first spoke about the “little thing that happened in September”, where a company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to come for them</a>. Bucky explained that he doesn’t want to talk about it too much as it is “an active lawsuit”, and he doesn’t want to get “wrapped up” in the situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bucky added that Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit “came as a shock” to them, considering they had received a green signal for all the legal checks in Japan before the game was released. The lawsuit was a shock for many people, as it was something the devs had never “considered” and is something they are “still hashing out basically.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bucky elaborated that the lawsuit didn’t “feel good” considering they had been “pretty vocal” about Palworld before the game was released. However, after contacting lawyers and courts, they realised that the lawsuit was for patents. When the information was released to the public, it was a “pretty depressing day” for the devs as “pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge fan”. At the same time, they were gearing up for the PlayStation release and a showcase at the Tokyo Game Show, which had to be scaled back due to legal problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired a new patent</a> that helps their lawsuit against Palworld. Also, Pocketpair publishing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has warned gamers</a> not to expect “more Palworld”. What are your thoughts on Palworld devs being shocked about Nintendo’s lawsuit?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>
Remember <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>? Announced back at The Game Awards 2020 with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-revealed-with-preposterous-van-diesel-starring-trailer">preposterous CGI trailer starring Vin Diesel</a>, the dino-riding sequel has been rarely seen since.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, there's a big expansion for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> - one that's designed to connect the series to it still missing-in-action sequel, whenever it arrives.
</p>
<p>
Ark developer Studio Wildcard announced the expansion, dubbed Ark: Lost Colony, last night with an animtated trailer that features the character played by Michelle Yeoh from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-the-animated-series-surprise-releases-in-us-and-canada-ahead-of-april-debut-elsewhere">the Ark animated series</a>.

<p>
Studio Wildcard said the expansion will follow Yeoh's character, alongside others from the animated series, in a story that "directly connects the storylines of Ark's Extinction and Genesis expansions and leads into the events of Ark 2".
</p>
<p>
Ark: Lost Colony expansion will arrive in June for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S priced $30 (UK price TBA). As for when Ark 2 will turn up? Who knows.
</p>
<p>
In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-survival-evolved-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-with-vin-diesel-coming-2023">Studio Wildcard said Ark 2 would launch the following year</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-delayed-survival-evolved-official-servers-to-shut-down-later-this-year">a delay in 2023 until "the end of 2024"</a> - which evidently did not happen.
</p>
<p>
Back in January, Studio Wildcard shared a content roadmap for Ark: Survival Evolved with updates scheduled up to and beyond December 2026 - with no mention of Ark 2 in sight, leading some fans to wonder whether it had been cancelled. The announcement of Ark: Lost Colony suggests this is not the case.

			<p>Today, Krafton unveiled the 2025 roadmap for PUBG: Battlegrounds. A year after the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/pubg-battlegrounds-is-upgrading-to-unreal-engine-5-and-getting-destructible-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the game's transition from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5, it finally provided an update on the task.</p>
<p>This is meant to establish a new long-term foundation for the game while retaining the same feeling that fans have appreciated. The UE5 upgrade, though, still needs time in the oven, as it was described as being in the pre-production phase. On the tech front, Krafton is also busy making the long-requested current-generation version of PUBG. This is set to arrive on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X in late 2025, delivering visual improvements as well as a more optimized experience for frame rate and map loading speed.</p>
<p>The developers are also preparing to launch the PUBG UGC (User Generated Content) project. This will allow players to create and share their own custom experiences, starting with a new TDM-style mode in Custom Matches. This initiative is designed to give players greater creative freedom and expand the ways in which they interact with the game.</p>
<p>A more unified experience across Normal Matches, Ranked, and Esports is coming, too, thanks to the integration of key elements from Normal Matches into Ranked, reducing the gameplay gap between the two modes. To further enhance progression, a tier overhaul is planned for June, making rank progression feel more rewarding and meaningful.</p>
<p>Balance patches will be released every two months in 2025 to address key adjustments to the weapon meta, ensuring a dynamic and evolving combat experience. In addition, a major annual rebalancing will be introduced to shake up weapon usage and encourage different play styles. Alongside these changes, under-utilized weapons such as SRs, LMGs, and SMGs will receive improvements to increase their viability. New weapons and attachments are also in development to further expand the arsenal available to players.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence will also be majorly overhauled, making PUBG bots behave more realistically and strategically. AI enemies will react to the shrinking blue zone, take cover more effectively, and even use smoke grenades to obscure visibility in combat situations. These improvements are designed to make AI encounters feel more natural while ensuring a fair and engaging experience for all players.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG | 2025 Roadmap" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_snNMMlEk-w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While a new map won't be coming to the game this year, the developers are preparing a big world update due in late 2025. This update will transform existing maps to create new gameplay experiences while retaining the essence of what players love. Moreover, the Destructible Terrain feature is being introduced in the Taego, Miramar, and Erangel maps.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Krafton continues the fight against cheaters. New detection technologies are being developed to counter increasingly sophisticated fraud tactics. The team is also exploring ways to leverage Windows OS protections to provide an additional layer of security against exploitative software.</p>
<p>Machine learning models are being actively used to detect and counter unauthorized software use in real time, improving PUBG's ability to identify and ban cheaters more effectively. Additional security measures are also in development to better protect player accounts and reduce the risk of account hijacking and unfair play.</p>

<p>Amazon has greenlit the God of War series for two seasons, reveals showrunner, as he speaks about how he had to stop playing the games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/god-of-war-tv-show-writer-reveals-amazon-has-already-ordered-two-seasons-and-that-he-cant-play-the-video-games-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>, God of War series showrunner&nbsp; Ronald D. Moore recently appeared on Katee Sackhoff’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu704p568-Y&amp;list=PLiHvVvKZ9lt6_mIcI0YwKPY1CgSYUvORQ&amp;index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sackhoff Show</a>, where he revealed more details about the upcoming adaptation. Moore first revealed that “Amazon has ordered two seasons” of the God of War series. Moore said it is a more challenging project as he is “not a gamer”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moore revealed that he “tried” to play the God of War games but is not a gamer. He grew up in the “arcade era,” and he would always be up to playing a game like Defender or Asteroid. However, Moore hasn’t overcome one obstacle with recent games: the modern controller. Moore elaborates that he has trouble with the button layout and cannot find the right buttons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, Moore’s family is filled with avid gamers. His children play constantly, and his wife has played Skyrim for “probably 15 years.”&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Moore is the new showrunner for Amazon’s God of War series after the previous executive producers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-series-redone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exited the show</a> late last year. Moore is best known for his work on projects like Star Trek and the Battlestar Galactica series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the next God of War game is reportedly centred around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egyptian mythology</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-live-service-games-cancelled-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two PlayStation live service titles</a> were recently cancelled, one of which was a God of War game.

            <p>The CEO of Saber Interactive has some pretty damning words to say about 2022's poorly-received Saints Row reboot, and its developer Volition.</p>
<p>As part of an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/saber-embracer-savvy-games-space-marine-russia">Game File</a> (paywalled), Saber's Matt Karch spoke about studio closures and layoffs. Volition, you may recall, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">shuttered in 2023 as part of then-parent company Embracer Group's previously announced "restructuring" programme</a>.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this, Karch - who worked under the Embracer umbrella for a period of time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">before the sale of Saber assets</a> - stated while "it would be nice in an ideal world for everyone to have a job", the Saints Row team "were so expensive for what they were" and, therefore are "gone".</p>

<p>"They didn't know what they were building. They didn't have any real direction. It couldn't last," Karch said. "And so, who's going to fund them for the next game after that disaster?"</p>
<p>He added: "The days of throwing money at games other than maybe the GTAs of the world [are] over... It's over." Karch stated "this business needs to mature", and if it doesn't it's "in trouble".</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, that means layoffs," the Saber exec continued. "If I were running a team in California, my goal would be: 'Okay. Who are the absolutely must-haves in this group? And they exist. We have American talent [at Saber.] And who could do this for, you know, a quarter of the price in Poland?'"</p>

<p>2022's Volition-developed Saints Row reboot was met with disappointing critical and commercial reception.Following its release, Embracer admitted the game "did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarised" in a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2022-net-sales-increased-by-190-to-sek-9569-million-35-organic-growth/">financial update</a> shared in the November of that year.</p>
<p>We called Saints Row a "snappy but slightly uneven reboot" on its release. "Volition's Saints Row reboot won't set the world alight, but there's a punchy game here with some pleasant surprises," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-2022-review-a-snappy-but-slightly-uneven-reboot">Eurogamer's Saints Row review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Soon after The Last of Us' first season aired the showrunners said when the time came for series two, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">there would be "a lot more infected"</a>. And, well, they appear to be making good on their word. </p>
<p>Along with those infected hordes advancing upon Ellie and co in the trailers - not to mention <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-hbo-the-last-of-us-part-2s-trailer-is-here-and-april-cant-come-quickly-enough">Tommy using a flamethrower to toast a Bloater</a> - The Last Of Us' Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have confirmed Stalkers will be featured in season two.</p>

<p>"All I'll say is that for the people who want to see more of the infected... Buckle up!" Mazin teased in conversation with <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-bigger-far-more-ambitious-pedro-pascal-exclusive/">Empire</a>.</p>
<p>"You get to see a different evolution of this infection," added Druckmann. "It's kept certain parts of their brain alive, so they are smarter. They coordinate and hide and do things that we've never seen any other infected do on this show."</p>

<p>And, it is not  just Stalkers that will bring a change when the second season of The Last of Us airs next month. The showrunners have confirmed spores are also making a return.</p>
<p>The Last of Us' spores are depicted as particle mists, but while a key feature in both games, the showrunners refrained from adding them to the first season of the show. Back in January 2023, it was revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-will-have-tendrils-instead-of-spores-spreading-infection">Cordyceps infection would instead be spread by "tendrils"</a> in series one.</p>
<p>In season two, however, there will be "an escalation of numbers and types of infected", as well as "an escalation of the vector of how this thing spreads" Druckmann said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/vjLYIVh6Dwc?si=wl_qxgq7Zv7ZdL1P">SXSW 2025</a>.</p>
<p>"The reason [we're doing spores now], I mean, we really wanted to figure it out, and again, everything has to be drama. There had to be a dramatic reason of introducing it now," Druckmann said, teasing:</p>
<p>"And there is."</p>

<p>The second season of The Last of Us is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">set to kick off in the US on 13th April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length. It remains unclear where the second season of The Last of Us will wrap up, but the showrunners have already confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">will not cover the entirety of Part 2's narrative</a>.</p>
<p>Returning cast members include Pedro Pascal as Joel, Bella Ramsey as Ellie, Gabriel Luna as Tommy and Rutina Wesley as Maria. New faces for season two, meanwhile, include Kaitlyn Dever as Abby and Joe Pantoliano as Eugene, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">a role that has been expanded upon from the game</a> in the style of the first season's award winning Bill and Frank episode.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-twos-abby-kaitlyn-dever-wants-to-do-this-character-justice-and-make-the-fans-proud">Dever spoke more about her role as The Last of Us' Abby</a>, stating she wants "to do this character justice and make the fans proud" on the second season's debut.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a> turned fifteen this month, <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/3/16/metro-15th-anniversary-update">prompting a blog from 4A Games</a> celebrating the FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> series' past while looking forward to the next entry. The unnamed Metro 4 surfaced again last January as part of a reveal for VR title <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-awakening">Metro Awakening</a>, following a <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/studio-update-exodus-sdk">2023 blog</a> detailing the studio's experience under the Russian invasion.</p>
<p>"We do want to reassure you that work is continuing on both of our projects despite missile strikes, air-raid sirens, and terror still raining down on Ukraine," reads the new blog. "These circumstances are incredibly challenging, the situation remains dangerous and not within our control, but we are currently as safe as possible, and we want to manage your expectations around the reveal of the next Metro title, it will be ready when it is ready, and we can’t wait for you to see it".</p>

<p>The 2022 invasion of Ukraine "changed how we wanted to tell the story of the next Metro game," 4A continue. "As art became life for many of our developers in Ukraine, we drew from that lived experience to create an even darker story, those themes already present in Metro becoming ever-more apparent and important. As conflict, the struggle for power, the horrors of tyranny, and the price of freedom have become part of our lives over the past 3+ years, we are still living and working during this wartime, and that inevitably shapes the games we make."</p>
<p>The series - set in Moscow's metro tunnels and following the survivors of global nuclear  war - began life as a novel by Dmitry Glukhovsky, first published online when the author was just eighteen, then in print in 2005. Glukhovsky, originally from Moscow, is currently abroad after a court ordered his arrest in absentia following <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/06/07/russia-court-orders-arrest-of-critical-sci-fi-writer-a77926">public criticism of Russia's invasion</a>.</p>
<p>"Metro has always had a hard-hitting, political, anti-war and often emotional story," write 4A Games. "You can be sure these themes will continue thanks to our ongoing collaboration with franchise creator, author, and activist Dmitry Glukhovsky".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>To avoid harassment, staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> studio Ubisoft Quebec have been "advised" not to celebrate or otherwise post on social media about the game's launch this week, as reported by French outlet <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/assassin-s-creed-shadows-pour-ubisoft-il-s-agit-de-sortir-de-l-ombre-ou-d-y-plonger-un-peu-plus_AV-202503170023.html">BFM TV</a> and spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">Kotaku</a>.</p>
<p>This follows months of online anger directed at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>, much of it from charming sods with handles like 'Da Phrenology Gamer' doing everything they can to avoid actually playing videogames, presumably before logging off for dinner and complaining that they don't want to eat any more woke broccoli, mum. Can't-hang-viceroy Elon Musk even got involved at one point, commenting "DEI kills art" on a tweet about the game (as opposed to, you know, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/doge-education-department-cuts-trump">cutting education funding</a>).</p>

<p>While much of this ire was targeted at the inclusion of black samurai protagonist Yasuke, it's worth noting that Ubisoft themselves <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1815674592444187116">released a statement last July</a> apologising for promotional materials "that have caused concern within the Japanese community", while emphasising that Shadows aims to be an "immersive and respectful" work of historical fiction rather than "factual representation".</p>
<p>They don't specify which materials, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-statement-yasuke-1851602337">Kotaku note that Ubisoft apologised separately</a> for the use of a flag belonging to military reenactment group Sekigahara Teppo-tai. Collectibles company <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/assassins-creed-shadows/figurine">PureArts also pulled a figurine</a> depicting the game's protagonists in front of a one-legged torii gate, which some felt disrepectfully evoked the damage caused to Nagasaki's Sannō Shrine in the 1945 bombing.</p>
<p>This has all contributed towards an online atmosphere of hostility towards the game, which BFM TV report has culminated in an internal anti-online harassment plan at Ubisoft. "It's an initiative from Canada. There's a team that monitors networks and acts quickly in the event of a targeted attack," an employee told the outlet, via Google Translate. "Unlike what we've had before, this is serious".</p>
<p>Activity on X, Reddit, and Youtube will be "closely monitored by a dedicated unit", write BFM TV, "in order to respond quickly to the slightest problem". Lawyers are prepared to "file complaints in the event of proven harassment."</p>
<p>“Our stance has always been that team members’ social media channels are their own," a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/assassins-creed-shadows/ubisoft-anti-harassment-plan">Ubisoft spokesperson told PCGN</a>. "Our top priority is the safety of our employees, including online, which is why, as a standard practice across Ubisoft, we offer guidance on navigating social media, digital safety, and support for team members’ well-being. We also share resources to help prevent and protect against online harassment, something our teams have unfortunately faced.”</p>
<p>Ubisoft aren't the only publisher to take similar steps in recent months. In January, Square Enix announced a new policy vowing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-square-enix-policy-will-clamp-down-on-harassers-bigots-and-unreasonable-compensation-requests">clamp down on harassment, bigotry and, uh, fallacious compensation requests</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals devs recently spoke about drawing inspiration from Hazelight Studios’ It Takes Two when they had performance issues with Dr Strange’s portals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Strange’s portals in Marvel Rivals are one of the strongest abilities for strategic gameplay. The character can create a portal between any two points on the map, providing a direct line between those two points. However, while developing this ability for the character, Marvel Rivals developers were worried about the performance issues it might cause in the game, and to bypass this issue, they took inspiration from It Takes Two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-surprising-game-helped-improve-doctor-strange-portals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, Marvel Rivals senior graphic designer Tieyi Zhang recently spoke about drawing inspiration from It Takes Two at a panel at GDC 2025. Zhang talked about how the Unreal Engine game (It Takes Two) “simultaneously renders two views without catastrophic overhead”, which made him wonder whether this game uses “some magic” he doesn’t know about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Marvel Rivals’ breakthrough came after “discovering the local function, creating a local player.” Zhang realised that adding a local player “automatically enables split-screen rendering via distant cameras.” The report reveals that Marvel Rivals devs didn’t go through It Takes Two’s source code. The problems were solved by researching how Hazelight addressed its performance issues and using a similar strategy for Marvel Rivals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While speaking on a panel at GDC, Pocketpair’s John Buckley, who leads the Pocketpair Publishing arm of the firm, took a deep dive into the rampant and overwhelming success of Palworld. In January 2024, Palworld – which was dubbed ‘Pokémon with guns’ – was released to the open market, going on to secure <strong>25 million players </strong>in a single month.</p>



<p>To this day, Pocketpair still has no idea how or why Palworld was such a roaring success, as Buckley revealed at GDC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-things-started-to-get-weird">‘Things Started To Get Weird’</h2>



<p>On the panel at the Game Developer’s Conference, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley reeled off his impression of the release of Palworld, which took place a little more than a year ago:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We quickly go over a million wishlists within the first year, so we knew that something was happening, and it kept going.</p>



<p>2023 was when things got really weird – we rose to number three on Steam wishlists, then we hit a crazy peak around November 2023. People always ask us, ‘Why? What happened? How did you get so much attention?’ But we don’t know. If we knew how to do it, we’d do it again, but we have no idea what happened.</p>



<p>Within this first week, we hit this disgusting number that makes me feel sick when I see it.</p>



<p>Why did we get this many players? I don’t know, please don’t ask me. I know someone will ask me after, but I promise you we don’t know the answer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/we-hit-this-disgusting-number-that-makes-me-feel-sick-palworld-devs-dont-know-why-their-survival-game-was-so-successful-if-we-knew-how-to-do-it-wed-do-it-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>Palworld became one of the best-selling games in history, shattering player count records and skyrocketing up the charts on social and streaming platforms worldwide. It was an overnight sensation, and it became the talk of the town mere hours after hitting the market.</p>



<p>Pocketpair could barely handle the weight – and Epic Games struggled as well. The popularity of the game brought servers offline, struggling under the stress of the sheer volume of people trying to play the game.</p>



<p>While the player count has understandably petered off by now, Palworld remains a popular title that’s being updated by Pocketpair all the time. It wasn’t exactly a flash in the pan.</p>



<p>It’s tough to understand exactly why Palworld was such a success. Perhaps it’s the disbelief that it was ‘allowed’ to exist or the sheer inanity of the concept that pulled players in. Pocketpair doesn’t know, and I don’t know either.</p>

			<p>Former Call of Duty veteran Jason Blundell has revealed that he's leading the foundation of a brand new PlayStation development team called Dark Outlaw Games. As some of you might remember, Blundell left Treyarch in 2020 after&nbsp;<span>working on the first four Black Ops games. A year later, he&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Deviation Games</span>, with the backing of Sony, albeit in an external capacity. Fast-forward another fifteen months or so and Blundell <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-deviation-games-loses-jason-blundell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left Deviation Games</a>, too, not long before the studio closed down.</p>
<p>This time, Dark Outlaw Games is being structured inside PlayStation Studios, as Blundell said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY37_Cenui4&amp;t=4729s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on The Jeff Gerstmann Show</a>:</p>
<p>I<em>'ve had the amazing opportunity to create a new studio within PlayStation Studios for Sony. The studio is called Dark Outlaw Games, and we have been working away in the shadows for a while. When we got something to talk about, we'll step out into the light, but you know the story for me is always about the game, not about the studio. The reason why we're not doing a fanfare or shout about it from the rooftops is like, let's get something, right? But yeah, Dark Outlaw Games. It's such a privilege to be able to do it with Sony as a new first-party studio. Sony doesn't set up first-party studios all the time. To have that privilege is humbling; it's really nice. I'm really excited.</em></p>
<p><em>We're keeping it kind of low key. We have been going for a little bit of time now. Not gonna really comment about what we're doing exactly, but we're getting the team to gel, getting the ideas clicking and testing those. You know I'm a programmer at heart, so let's test those assumptions. Is it working? Again, we're trying to hit that escape velocity. But again, being asked to do something like this... I get the studio head and director. I'm just gonna keep that side. I got an executive producer this time. But yeah, it's very exciting, and I love the fact that still, at this point in my career, I'm given these opportunities.&nbsp;It's always that desire to, again, you want to put that one extra disc on the wall if you will. Can we bring something to an audience and excite them and get some new IPs? That makes me jump out of bed every morning. We'll be working tirelessly to get that ready.</em></p>
<p>Dark Outlaw Games is based in Los Angeles. For the time being, the studio appears to be relatively small, at least judging by LinkedIn. However, it's likely to staff up in the coming years. Given the average triple-A development time, we might have to wait until 2027 or 2028 before we get to see something concrete.</p>

<p>Ark: Survival Ascended, the controversial upgrade of the 2015 survival game, is getting a major expansion in November titled ‘Lost Colony’. It’s the first expansion designed specifically for the evolved version of the game, and it’s laying the foundations for the eventual release of Ark 2, which still doesn’t have a date.</p>



<p>It was mentioned by Studio Wildcard, the developer behind the Ark ecosystem, that Lost Colony will ‘connect the storylines of Ark’s Extinction and Genesis expansions and lead into the events of Ark 2.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-connections">Connections</h2>



<p>The link between Ark: Survival Ascended and Ark 2 is front and centre in Lost Colony, which features the vocal talents of Auli’i Cravalho, of Moana fame. She represents Meeka, a character revealed in the 2022 trailer for Ark 2, which also starred Vin Diesel. </p>



<p>To kick off 2025, Studio Wildcard revealed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2399830/view/526457668016013820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a two-year roadmap</a> for Ark: Survival Ascended that runs until December 2026. It’s relatively safe to assume that Ark 2 won’t be released before then, but if the later updates for Survival Ascended aren’t all that meaningful, perhaps Studio Wildcard could manage with a skeleton crew working on the ‘old game’.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583650/ARK_Lost_Colony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lost Colony</a> looks like a unique expansion at first blush. It’s fused with anime-style cutscene pieced together by MAPPA, a Japanese studio famed for the likes of Attack on Titan and Chainsaw Man. It’s being dubbed a ‘massive canonical expansion pack’ that’ll ease players into the impending world of Ark 2.</p>



<p>Players will get to explore Arat Prime, a frozen wasteland while battling their way through new enemies, exclusive ability trees, and fresh building systems. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Lost Colony and the release of Ark 2? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/months-add-escape-from-tarkov-gun/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-can-take-months-to-add-a-new-gun-to-escape-from-tarkov-developer-reveals.1137381/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/months-add-escape-from-tarkov-gun/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent interview with Epic Games around Escape from Tarkov Arena, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov explained just how long it takes to develop a single weapon for the popular extraction shooter series. Escape from Tarkov has been on the market for almost a decade, and in that time, it has amassed a staggering arsenal of weaponry, but it’s not all that easy to add <strong>more</strong>.</p>



<p>Typically, new weapons will be introduced with major updates to the game – otherwise known as ‘wipes’. The weapons, Buyanov says, can take <strong>several months </strong>to be designed, created, coded, and balanced in Escape from Tarkov, and by association, Arena.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-putting-in-the-effort">Putting in the Effort</h2>



<p>In the discussion <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/news/escape-from-tarkov-arena-interview-nikita-buyanov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Epic Games</a>, Buyanov, who heads the studio at Battlestate Games, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a long and complex process that requires many iterations. We have a large team of game designers and testers who constantly check and refine the balance. We also carefully listen to feedback from our community. Many people are passionate about&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>&nbsp;and eagerly share their comments and impressions with us.</p>



<p>It’s a very slow and meticulous process.</p>



<p>To fully implement a single weapon in the game, with textures, animations, and all the details, takes about two to three months. It depends on the specific weapon. The fastest one we ever made took about a month, but we already had the animations ready. However, for example, belt-fed machine guns <strong>take an average of four months</strong> to complete.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He stressed that the team has a perfectionist attitude towards new weapons because they’re all ‘gun nerds’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We shoot real firearms very often. This is especially helpful for our programmers who work on the gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p>When you fire a real weapon, you hear it, smell the gunpowder, feel the weight, and experience the recoil, something in your mind shifts, and you start approaching weapon creation in the game with much greater attention to detail.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans of the extraction shooter might not agree with the perfectionist claims, but the weapons in Escape from Tarkov are being adjusted and balanced all the time in a bid to keep as many people as possible happy. Every time a major update surfaces, it seems a new meta emerges, and that’s often by design.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released this week, ushering in a new generation of Ubisoft’s open-world flagship franchise. In the run-up to the game’s release, the title (and Ubisoft itself) has been criticised numerous times for historical inaccuracy and faced intense backlash from ‘anti-woke’ grifters. </p>



<p>It was recently claimed by sources speaking to a French outlet that Ubisoft has prepared an anti-harassment plan, and that lawyers stand at the ready to pursue anyone attacking the company’s employees on social media.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-preparing-for-the-inevitable">Preparing for the Inevitable</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has already faced mass blowback, which has almost always been related to Yasuke, the African samurai representing one-half of the game’s dual protagonist operating model.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is no stranger to facing aggression online at the hands of keyboard warriors, but the chatter around Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been much more volatile than with any other game in the series.</p>



<p>In the report from <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/assassin-s-creed-shadows-pour-ubisoft-il-s-agit-de-sortir-de-l-ombre-ou-d-y-plonger-un-peu-plus_AV-202503170023.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BFMTV</a>, it was claimed by unnamed Ubisoft employees that an anti-harassment plan has been presented to the CSE in Canada – the Communications Security Establishment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s an initiative from Canada. There’s a team that monitors networks and acts quickly in the event of a targeted attack. Unlike what we’ve had before, this is serious.</p>



<p>Messages posted by internet users on X, Reddit, or even videos on YouTube will be closely monitored by a dedicated unit in order to respond quickly to the slightest problem. </p>



<p><strong>Lawyers are already ready</strong> to file complaints in the event of proven harassment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another claim stressed that Ubisoft has ordered a social media blackout of sorts, advising employees to <strong>not mention </strong>that they work at the company online to avoid harassment.</p>



<p>In a statement handed to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/assassins-creed-shadows/ubisoft-anti-harassment-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, Ubisoft’s representatives backed up the initiative to keep employees safe but didn’t mention the specific plan:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our stance has always been that team members’ social media channels are their own. Our top priority is the safety of our employees, including online, which is why, as a standard practice across Ubisoft, we offer guidance on navigating social media, digital safety, and support for team members’ well-being. </p>



<p>We also share resources to help prevent and protect against online harassment, something our teams have unfortunately faced.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released worldwide on March 20. Stay tuned, because later today, my full review of the game will go live and you can get my full impression.</p>

Together with generations of heroes, you’ll unite the past and the future of <em>ARK</em>!</p></blockquote><p><em>ARK: Survival Ascended</em> is available now in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,070 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,894 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,631 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2399830/ARK_Survival_Ascended/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->

The expansion will add new abilities, gear, builds, beasts to tame, and more to the game, while those who preorder the expansion will receive "exclusive gameplay preview content" immediately after placing the order.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XM4hkeEAfA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3XM4hkeEAfA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The expansion will include multiple anime story sequences created by Studio MAPPA, which is known for multiple hit series including Attack on Titan, Jujutsu Kaisen, and Chainsaw Man.
