            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-expansion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced a new&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3&nbsp;</em>expansion in the form of&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe</em>, and it's the first part of the game's fourth "chapter".</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/535470580526219410" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Paradox reveals that&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>will launch on April 28th, and that it'll begin "the next stage in <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>'s development". As with previous&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-crusader-kings-3-expansion-highlights-royal-court" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>,&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>will add a number of new gameplay mechanics and features.</p>

<p>Since the expansion is based around the Mongols, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that the first major feature is a nomadic government system. You'll be tasked with exploiting the resources in your current location, then moving on to a new place with more resources to reap.</p>

<p>The new Dominance system will also measure your power and influence within the steppe, and Paradox says that if you manage to raise your Dominance high enough, you "might even claim the mantle of Genghis Khan; the Universal Ruler".</p>

<p>You can also look forward to "changing climate and weather patterns" affecting your life in the steppe; you may, for instance, have to contend with sudden snows "decimating fertility and putting pressure on you to find greener pastures".</p>




<p><em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>may be&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3</em>'s first Chapter 4 expansion, but it's not the main event; that honor goes to&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven</em>, which will, as the name suggests, expand the game's map to encompass Asia.</p>

<p>You can look forward to new cultures, faiths, and more in this expansion, as well as a new Dynastic Cycle system that will have you attempting to maintain the Mandate of Heaven to prove you can "navigate the empire through treacherous waters".</p>

<p>There's no release date for&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>yet, but the first dev diary is set for May, with regular dev diaries for&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>also due to air throughout April until the expansion's release.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/crusader-kings-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/crusader-kings-iii/9n7gg222gtth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>'s game director Carrie Patel has been on the blower to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-arent-there-romances-in-avowed-obsidian-explains">Eurogamer</a> about why Avowed doesn't have any romance in it, which is to say it does, actually, if you're paying attention, and also, affairs of the heart aren't supposed to feel like min-maxing your Wizard, Kevin. To put that another way, she has gently suggested that relationships are more relatable when they aren't some kind of mechanic or system.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The more you introduce romance as a mechanic, and the more that you build systems around it, and metrics, and ways for players to bolster and measure their affinity and affection level with other characters, the more it becomes something people engage with as a system rather than as a relationship," she told Eurogamer's Robert Purchese (HELLO BERTIE). </p>
<p>As Purchese adds, Avowed does actually harbour the possibility of a soulmate, but this isn't served up to you Commander Shepard-style on a bed of amorous tooltips. It'll happen if you get to know the person in question and decide that you like them.</p>
<p>"There's nothing that says 'hey this is a thing that can happen' - there's no system that's going to track your status with them," Patel explained. "But if you're doing the kinds of things that you would do if you were interested in this character, you'll probably come across the option by the end of the game. And it should feel natural, organic, and surprising."</p>
<p>I'm still playing through Avowed, and have no idea who this is referring to, so you'll have to do your own homework, you scamps. Also, I tend not to romance people in RPGs because I am afraid of emotions, and also because look Morrigan, we are trying to save the world here, there'll be time to knock boots after the credits roll. Ah, many are the sparks I have allowed to fizzle out. Sometimes the horny design gets the better of me, admittedly. I was appalled to learn at the end of the original Dragon's Dogma that I'd been seducing the local blacksmith all along. </p>

<p>The SAG-AFTRA strike involving video game performance actors is set to continue after the latest negotiations have failed to result in a new deal. In an <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/member-message-video-game-strike-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update posted</a> on its official website Tuesday night, the union’s chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland for the video game strike says there has been progress in some areas, but it’s not enough to curb the concerns the union has about “A.I. Abuse”.</p>



<p>“Though progress has been made and agreements have been reached on certain provisions since we launched our strike last year, the last proposal the bargaining group made is still filled with alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to A.I. abuse,” the statement reads. “The union recently submitted a counter to this proposal that diligently addresses all of the loopholes and would result in a contract that offers the minimum protections our members need in order to maintain sustainable careers as video game performers.”</p>



<p>The statement continues to say that the “bargaining group” wants to paint a picture than a deal is close. Crabtree-Ireland says that it’s not the case and it’s part of a hope to have union members “turn on each other”.</p>



<p>“They want to use all past performances and any performance they can source from outside the contract&nbsp;without&nbsp;any of the protections being bargained at all,” Crabtree-Ireland wrote. “You could be told nothing about your replica being used, offered nothing in the way of payment, and you could do nothing about it. They want to be able to make your replica continue to work, as you, during a future strike, whether you like it or not. And once you’ve given your specific consent for how your replica can be used, they refuse to tell you what they&nbsp;actually&nbsp;did with it.”</p>



<p>In response to the latest statement from the union, representatives on behalf of the studios provided a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. </p>



<p>“”We have proposed a deal that includes wage increases of over 15 percent for SAG-AFTRA represented performers in video games, as well as enhanced health and safety protections, industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor’s performance in other games,” spokesperson Audrey Cooling said. “We have made meaningful progress and are eager to return to the bargaining table to reach a deal.”</p>



<p>The current video game actor strike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began in July 2024</a>.  Despite it continuing, however, the union says that “more than 160 games” have signed interim and independent agreements to allow them to work wit SAG-AFTRA members.</p>



<p>“Those agreements contain the protections we have been asking the bargaining group for — terms that are clearly feasible and acceptable to a great number of game companies of all sizes, even as the bargaining companies resist,” the union says.</p>

<p>The Show has an interesting history with Microsoft. If you’re on the edge of your seat waiting for news about MLB The Show 25 coming to Xbox Game Pass, the answer is reaching you swifter than a fastball.</p>



<p>2021 was a landmark year for MLB The Show. It signalled the end of PlayStation’s decade-plus long exclusive relationship with the series. Microsoft finally managed to get a bit of the pitcher pie starting with MLB The Show 21. Each new release is a multi-platform extravaganza allowing PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo players to get picked.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mlb-the-show-25-cover-athletes-and-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MLB The Show 25</a> is 2025’s newest rewriting of the rulebook with multiple cover stars, tons of new animations, and much more. It’s all promising, but let’s see if it’s even better for Xbox Game Pass subscribers.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-mlb-the-show-25-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play MLB The Show 25 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Guess where this one is going. Credit to San Diego Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite its history, MLB The Show 25 is not arriving as a day-one launch on Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass service.</strong></p>



<p>The news might come as a shock to Game Pass users—more on this later. As it stands, MLB The Show 25 is not coming to Xbox Game Pass. Given that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-mlb-the-show-25-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a> starts shortly, this is unlikely to change either.</p>



<p>The official <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/p/9NZP0WKX3WJD/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MLB The Show 25 Xbox Store page</a> makes no mention of Game Pass anywhere—nor do any trailers. It’s a cold, hard strike on this one but it’s not time to sit down yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-mlb-the-show-25-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will MLB The Show 25 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>MLB The Show 24 came to Xbox Game Pass on day one in 2024, meaning there is a good chance MLB The Show will follow suit and arrive on Game Pass in the future.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, I’m not sure why MLB The Show 25 has missed out this year. The 2024 edition was a day-one benefit for Game Pass.</p>



<p>However, MLB The Show 25 hasn’t been as lucky. As there is a precedent of The Show games appearing on Game Pass, I’d wager it’s only a matter of time before Microsoft throws a curveball for those unwilling to purchase the game straight away.</p>



<p>We’ll update this article if the move comes to fruition for Xbox and PC users.</p>

The inhabitants of the lowest levels fight for survival by working forced labor, while the ones in the higher levels rule over the new underground world. </p><p>ANTRO’s government has become a totalitarian system, handing power over to a corporation based on technological overproduction and the automation of sectors known as La Cupula. Freedom of speech has been censored, art and music are forbidden, and a rebellion seems to be coming to life inside the den in which they’re living.</p><p>Journey through the most remote places in the underground metropolis of ANTRO, and join the protagonist, Nittch, as you embark on a mission to deliver a package to a mysterious, unknown recipient. While you’re at it, how about overthrowing the totalitarian government of La Cupula? Play with urban music in a thrilling adventure full of action, puzzles and 2.5D platforming.</p><p>Explore ANTRO to the rhythm of hip-hop, drill, R&amp;B, and electronic music, and move around the city overcoming obstacles in your way, be it by resolving puzzles or traversing the environment using parkour. But be prepared to run at full speed, as the pursuits in ANTRO are plentiful and both you and the scenario will move in synchrony with the music. But remember: the enemy is always lurking.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

Sony recently announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-shifting-focus-to-ps5-games-next-year-will-only-occasionally-include-ps4-titles">shift the focus of its PlayStation Plus monthly games and Game Catalog updates toward PS5</a> titles starting early next year, after which PlayStation 4 games will only "occasionally" feature thereafter. "Many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles," it said at the time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/12/pxn-p5-wireless-gaming-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The gamepad trees are bearing their joystick-equipped fruits early this year, with many manufacturers already launching their latest and greatest for 2025, covering a wide spread of different devices and price points. While we’ve just seen some incredible value offerings from GameSir, there’s space within the budget bracket to innovate and over-deliver as much as anywhere else. That’s where PXN are aiming the P5, a multiplatform wireless gaming controller that’s available for less than £30. With the features it totes, it’s ridiculous value for money.</p>

<p>The PXN P5 offers a trio of connection options: a wireless 2.4GHz dongle, Bluetooth or wired. That means it’s all set to work with your PC and Nintendo Switch, as well as mobile or smart TVs – something that’s becoming increasingly useful with the arrival of streaming services like Luna and GeForce Now. In fact, this is an ideal extra controller just to hop into the latest games on Apple TV arcade.</p>


<p>The headline feature set for a controller at this price makes a mockery of the other manufacturers out there, especially Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo’s standard offerings. It offers Hall Effect sticks with a 1000Hz polling rate, meaning better response time and faster reactions, while also cutting down on the risk of stick drift. It has a 256-level Hall Effect trigger, with trigger lockouts, 25 hour battery life, an air-mouse mode, and is equipped with a gyroscope for motion controls and back buttons. How have they done all of this?</p>
<p>Well, the money you’re saving can be felt the moment you pick it up. The P5 is extremely light, even though the black plastic of the main body feels solid and well-made. You can tell that it’s cheaper, but it doesn’t give you the ick like third party controllers used to. The Hall Effect analogue sticks have a decent level of tautness, and they feel great in use, making the most of the accurate response in Overwatch 2. In the heat of the moment, you could easily forget that this is a value controller.</p>


<p>The face buttons feel surprisingly good as well, with traditional membrane buttons that have the right level of activation. The D-pad is a weaker element, with the up direction on our review unit feeling a little less pliant than the other directions, but it proved absolutely fine in use. I’d probably be looking elsewhere if you’re a beat ‘em up fan that uses the D-pad heavily, but for most people it does the job.</p>
<p>The cost-cutting becomes more obvious when you put your fingers on the triggers and shoulder buttons. The plastic used here feels cheaper than elsewhere, and there’s definitely an acclimatisation period to getting used to them.</p>
<p>They haven’t skimped on the tech behind the triggers though, which, like the analogue sticks, boast Hall Effect technology, so not only are they more precise through their range of movement, but they should last longer than their traditional brethren. Of course, there’s other elements to a trigger’s durability, and the spring providing tension is the traditional breaking point.&nbsp;The PXN P5 also boasts trigger lockouts, which make playing FPS games much more immediate, and improve your activation time – vital if you’re into competitive gaming.</p>

<p>On the rear of the controller you’ll find a bunch of inputs and switches, first of which are the four back buttons. These are well placed beneath your middle fingers, though that depends on whether you play with four fingers across the triggers and shoulder buttons for a claw grip.</p>
<p>I found that shifting my hands up meant I had to stretch more with my ring fingers to activate the back buttons, as they are quite small, though that, in turn, makes them harder to activate accidentally. I do like the way that the central two buttons are angled, as this made them easier to use, and you won’t catch them when using the two that sit within the controller’s grips.</p>
<p>On the rear, there’s also a switch for moving between the wireless dongle, Bluetooth, or to move across to the Nintendo Switch mode. Unlike the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/">GameSir Super Nova</a>, it’s chunky and very easy to use.</p>

<p>There’s two options when it comes to programming the PXN P5, and first amongst them is programming the controller using the PXN button on the front of the unit. Holding this down with a combination of buttons will let you alter a multitude of settings, including switching through deadzone settings as well as button mapping, but you’ll probably have to reach for the instructions to remind yourself each time.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s the PXN Nexus app which is available for Android and iOS. This gives you a clear and comprehensive way to update your controller, and alter all of its settings to within an inch of its life, including setting up macros on the back buttons. You can add multiple steps here, loop them, or add interval times between button activations, and it’s a great addition to an already impressive package.</p>
<p>The key competitors here are fundamentally all more expensive than the PXN P5, though the Gamesir Super Nova’s extra £15 buys a far more premium experience, and a charging stand. Meanwhile, for another few pounds, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">GameSir Cyclone 2</a> throws in a bevy of microswitches, and you also gain a 3.5mm headphone socket, if that’s important to your setup.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/skyrim-unreal-engine-5-remaster-textures/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-unreal-engine-5-5-remaster-lumen-nanite/">Skyrim Unreal Engine 5 remaster</a> is now available for download, introducing a lot of new textures to improve the unofficial remaster's visuals.</p>
<p>The new version of the mod, which can be downloaded from the developer Greg Coulthard's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Udab2K5a5X">Discord server</a>, can be seen in action in the video below by Digital Dreams, the modder who provided the new 1000 textures the unofficial remaster now features in its latest iteration. While this unofficial remaster doesn't look as good as modded Skyrim does, it's still interesting to see how some of the original game's low polygon elements fare with the lighting improvements offered by the engine.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K60] Skyrim Port in Unreal engine 5 HUGE update with 1000 new textures | RTX5090 NextGen graphics" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KNIHJJZQPlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While an official Skyrim remaster or remake is nowhere on the horizon, there's the chance fans of The Elder Scrolls series will soon be able to revisit Oblivion with a remaster/remake that is rumored to be in development by Virtuos, the developer of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater that previously worked on plenty of other high-profile titles. Unofficially revealed via an <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">FTC investigational hearing with Phil Spencer back in 2023</a>, the remaster/remake is said to feature a lot of improvements over the original, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">combat, stealth, and interface improvements</a>. Unfortunately, the game has yet to be officially revealed, so everything about it is still up in the air, except for the fact that it was originally planned for a Fiscal Year 2022 release.</p>
<p>The latest version of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade/">Anniversary Edition</a> now available on PC and consoles. It introduces some additional content over the Special Edition, which is also available on PC and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-player-count-how-many-people-are-playing-cs2-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Despite eternally sitting at the top of the Steam charts, the player count for Counter-Strike 2 is still an important metric to many in the community. From its early CS:GO days to its current day CS2, Counter-Strike continues to grow at an impressive rate, despite periods of fluctuation.</p>



<p>The doomers that predicted that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Counter-Strike would die</a> after the release of CS2 have been proved (so far) to be very wrong.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-counter-strike-2-player-count-march-2025">Counter-Strike 2 Player Count (March 2025)</h2>



<p>On March 1st, 2025, CS2 achieved 1,789,374 concurrent players, its highest ever player peak since releasing. CS2 is also currently averaging over 1 million players since mid February, which is also a first for the newest version of the game. The only time in Counter-Strike’s illustrious history when it was more popular was in May 2023, when CS:GO hit a peak of 1,818,773 and was averaging over 1.1 million players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned earlier, CS2 effectively owns the top spot on Steam’s Most Played chart. There are only three games that have ever had higher concurrent player peaks: PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, Black Myth: Wukong, and Palworld. To put into context how popular CS2 is, PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS is currently the second most played game on Steam, and CS2 has almost twice as many players.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-cs2-more-popular-than-cs-go">Why is CS2 More Popular Than CS:GO?</h2>



<p>Despite resounding community resentment towards CS2 after it was first released, the game did reignite many dormant fans and attract several new ones. CS2’s esports scene has also flourished since the COVID-19 online-only era, attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers a day. While the game is certainly not in a perfect state, Valve has released updates addressing major issues, launched a new seasonal competitive model in Premier, and is keeping the map pool fresh.</p>



<p>Is CS2 in a good place? Is it possible that it eclipses 2 million players? Let us know down below or in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>An Ubisoft shareholder is planning a protest outside the company’s Paris offices after it claims the studio failed to disclose meetings regarding a potential acquisition.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-plots-protest-outside-paris-hq-accuses-company-of-failing-to-reveal-discussions-with-microsoft-ea-and-others-allegedly-interested-in-acquiring-ips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, AJ Investments, a firm with less than a 1% stake in Ubisoft, says that studio is “horribly mismanaged by current management”. In addition, the firm’s CEO Juraj Krúpa says that the company failed to disclose reported meetings with EA and Microsoft, among other interested parties, regarding potential acquisition of Ubisoft IPs.</p>



<p>Krúpa says that the company didn’t “appropriately” communicate its plans or talks with shareholders. Because of that, he is calling those “who are frustrated with the prolonged stagnation in Ubisoft’s stock performance and the lack of decisive action from the management team” to join them in protest in May.</p>



<p>Krúpa added that AJ Investments is ready to sue Ubisoft for “misleading investors”. He did add, however, that they are aware of Ubisoft management having a financial review of various strategic options that is being advised by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan</p>



<p>In a statement given to IGN, Ubisoft restated its past messaging that reviews of strategic and capitalistic options is ongoing at the company.</p>



<p>“The Board has established an ad-hoc independent Committee to oversee this formal and competitive process, so as to extract the best value from Ubisoft’s assets and franchises for all stakeholders,” the company said. “Ubisoft will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and once a transaction materialises.”</p>

As you can see, the turn-based title resembles Advance Wars, featuring infantry, tanks, and airplanes that can be moved around a tile-based map. The pixel art even shares similarities with the long-running Nintendo franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/12/niantic-sells-gaming-division-and-pokemon-go-to-saudi-owned-scopely-for-3-5-billion/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Niantic has announced the sale of its gaming business to Saudi-owned mobile gaming specialists Scopely in a deal worth $3.5 billion. This brings <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pikmin-bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-now">Monster Hunter Now</a> and more into Scopely’s portfolio, which also includes the likes of Monopoly Go!, Star Trek Fleet Command and Marvel Strike Force.</p>
<p>The deal will keep all the current developer teams together to continue working on the AR gaming hits, while Niantic is transitioning to being “<span>a geospatial AI company”, seemingly looking to use all their experience with augmented reality technologies (including something called Gaussian splatting) for more general purposes.</span></p>


<p>Announcing the change on the Pokémon Go website, Ed Wu, head of Pokémon Go said, It’s been an incredible joy to serve hundreds of millions of Trainers in our real-world community for the past 10 years, and I truly believe the best is yet to come. Our mission remains clear: to inspire people to discover Pokémon in the real world together. With Scopely’s full commitment, experience, and resources, we’re going to make Pokémon Go the very best it can be – from incredible battles for thousands of Trainers at a time at our live events to new ways to connect to your friends and community. Most importantly, we’ll remain focused on the excitement and experience of discovering Pokémon in the real world.”</p>
<p>Scopely was founded in 2011 and has its headquarters in Culver City, California. it had its initial success with its series of … With Buddies games in 2012, before pushing into licensed IP for games like The Walking Dead: Road to Survive, Star Treck Fleet Command and Scrabble Go. In April 2023, Saudi PIF group Savvy Games Group bought Scopely for $4.9 billion, adding to its portfolio of owned companies and investments across the games industry.</p>
<p>We’ll have to wait and see what influence Scopely has on Niantic’s games, with the outgoing company often having a fractious relationship with its fanbase. After its breakout success in 2016, Niantic regularly sought to tweak and adjust how in-game items were used and available, often to the chagrin of the player base as this affected their ability to play – most notable, perhaps, was how Niantic made changes in 2020 to enable more distant playing through lockdowns, and then rolled them back at still contentious moments.</p>

<p>Pokémon Go was a huge success for the company, and remains the best example of its augmented reality game style, while they’ve struggled to adapt it to other IP. A Harry Potter game came and went, while Pikmin Bloom and Monster Hunter now haven’t hit the same heights. They’ve also created companion pieces like Campfire to add a new social avenue for playing their games, instead of seeing people resort to other platforms.</p>
