        <p>Arriving on Netflix this November</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>I've never played League Of Legends and I have no interest in doing so, but Arcane was superb. Set within the world of Riot's MOBA and starring several of its playable characters, Netflix's mini series was better animated and better written than any of its peers.
</p>
<p>A second season is on the way and due to arrive this November. Its teaser trailer also refers to it as "the final chapter".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Probably don't watch this if you didn't see the first season:
</p>

<p>
<a aria-label="Arcane: Season 2 | Official Teaser | Netflix" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AEbfiLaOdJA?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Arcane season two teaser trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEbfiLaOdJA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>That its the final season is good news, right? I loved the first season of Arcane, but good stories have endings. 
</p>
<p>I might need to go re-watch the first season between now and November, because I've forgotten a lot of the details since the first season launched in 2021. Even I can tell its picking up the major plot threads from the original's ending, with several recurring characters - which is why you shouldn't have watched the above trailer if you didn't see season one.
</p>
<p>Arcane is the work of French animation studio Fortiche, who aside from Arcane also worked on K/DA music videos and game trailers for Riot. Riot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-buy-big-part-of-arcane-animation-studio">bought a substantital stake in the company in 2022</a>, which suggests Arcane might not be their last League Of Legends-themed animation project. Or maybe next time it'll be a Valorant series, who knows.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Won’t Actually Take Up Over 300 GB of Storage Promises Activision]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-does-not-take-up-over-300-gb-storage/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-won%E2%80%99t-actually-take-up-over-300-gb-of-storage-promises-activision.898326/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-does-not-take-up-over-300-gb-storage/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Call of Duty franchise has become rather notorious in recent years for gobbling up unreasonable amounts of storage, which is particularly frustrating on current-gen consoles with limited SSD space. So yeah, most people were expecting <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> to be a big game, and yet, many were still shocked when the game’s pre-order pages indicated the game will require a <em>310 GB install</em>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops69.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Say whaaaat? Thankfully, the <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1720119892697821399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty X account</a> has since popped up to reassure players that the Black Ops 6 install won’t be <em>that</em> unreasonable. That 310 GB is for somebody who installs Call of Duty HQ, which is the launcher required for all recent CoD titles, along with CoD Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone, and all DLC for those games. While you can’t get away from installing Call of Duty HQ, obviously you don’t need to install Warzone or any of the other games to play Black Ops 6.</p>
<p><em>“Correction: The estimated file size currently displayed on the Black Ops 6 pre-order pages does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6.</em></p>
<p><em>The sizes as shown include the full installations of Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone and all relevant content packs, including all localized languages combined which is not representative of a typical player install experience.</em></p>
<p><em>Players will be able to download Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at launch without downloading any other Call of Duty titles or all of the language packs . The actual estimation of the Black Ops 6 file size will be available closer to launch.”</em></p>
<p>As for how big Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will actually be, that remains to be seen, but Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and III “only” require about 150 GB apiece to play if you strip them right down and don’t install Warzone, DLC, other games, ect. Interestingly, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will also be utilizing cloud-based texture streaming, which means the game is always online, but perhaps that might also keep the game’s file size somewhat in check.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on PC (via Steam, Battle.net, and Microsoft Store), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on October 25. You can <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct-omnimovement-campaign-zombies-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get more details on the game here</a>.</p>

This will also include the chance to recreate their protagonist from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, who will appear in <em>The Veilguard</em>, though you’ll be controlling Rook, a new protagonist for this game.</p><p>“What’s not lost on us is that it’s been 10 years since existing players have played,” Busche told <em>IGN</em>. “They might not remember [what they did in previous games]...They might need that refresher and we don’t want new players to feel like they’re missing out on those decisions. So in the character creator, I like to call it ‘Last Time on <em>Dragon Age</em>,’ but you can go into your past adventures and it, actually through tarot cards, tells you what the context was and what decision you want to make.”</p><p>Busche explained the decision was made to not import save data this time around because “technology is so different and [BioWare] wanted it to be in the client.” That makes sense given <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>is 10 years old and was played on old hardware. I’d also be surprised if a lot of those decisions tracked by Keep will factor into <em>The Veilguard</em>. So maybe as novel as it was, it’s just simpler to give players a menu to pick the decisions that will play into things rather than importing <em>everything</em>.</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S this fall, and takes a notably more action-oriented approach with combat than the series has ever had.

Now in full production, senior members of the development team spoke about their goals for the remake.</p><p>One of the first challenges was finding the right balance between being faithful to the original game and modernizing it. According to creative director Bio Jade Adam Granger, there was a fine line between keeping "the original recipe" intact and tweaking other parts of the experience.</p>

<p>"We have things that are staying as-is, like the wall run, which is so iconic that we will try to match it as much as we can," Granger said in a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/5bpvgE64gxlTtkBULl98XT" rel="nofollow ">Ubisoft blog post</a>. "The dagger as well. There are core elements of the original recipe that we respect and sanctify: time powers, the tone of the game, and the gravity-defying gameplay. But we modernize stuff like the level design, for example, and really enhance the scale of the world."</p><p>Game director Michael McIntyre added that combat has also been reworked, but signature moves like the overhead vault strike and rolling attacks have been kept so that players still feel like an acrobatic hero.</p><p>Addressing the lengthy development cycle--the project was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-revealed-dur/1100-6482030/">first revealed during the 2020 Ubisoft Forward Showcase</a>--Granger explained that "the landscape of remakes has evolved a lot" in the years since Sands of Time was first announced and that the bar had been raised. Big changes to the characters, camera, and controls have been made, and Ubisoft Montreal had to build prototypes to fine-tune the gameplay further.</p><p>"It takes time and craftsmanship and people, which is why we have reinforcements from other studios to help us here," Granger said.</p><p>While the story will remain the same, McIntyre says players will get to experience more interactions between the Prince and companion, Princess Farah. "Probably the biggest development that we've done is to make Farah more present," McIntyre said. We're able to add more interactions between her and the Prince, so you can get more from their relationship. They will simply spend more time beside each other.</p><p>This year marks the 35th anniversary of the Prince of Persia franchise, and Ubisoft is celebrating with new content for two of its recent releases. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" data-ref-id="5000-590624">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> has more DLC on the way and it will receive its first expansion, Mask of Darkness, in September.

        <p>Nearly 250 employees at risk</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sumo Group has announced it is seeking to cut costs with up to 15%, or nearly 250, of its employees at risk.</p>
<p>The firm says it hasn't been immune to the challenges facing the games industry and needs to reshape its organisation to 'navigate upcoming challenges'.</p>
<p>The company is best known for its work-for-hire and co-development services, and has built games for the likes of PlayStation, Microsoft and Sega. It also has an indie publishing team called Secret Mode. The firm has offices across Europe, India and Canada.</p>
<p>It was acquired by Tencent<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-high-court-approves-tencents-sumo-acquisition"> in a $1.27 million deal in January 2022.</a></p>
<p>The firm said in a statement: "Every day the incredibly talented people across Sumo studios are dedicated to creating great games and bringing ground-breaking experiences to players worldwide. That work and dedication over the past 21 years has helped to put Sumo on the map and build a family of studios that are second to none, and we are incredibly proud of what Sumo has become.</p>
<p>"Whilst Sumo has been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced, we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward.</p>
<p>"The difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways is a direct result of these challenges, and unfortunately will include a reduction in the number of people the business can support. Every alternate route to limit the impact to our people is being considered but sadly this process of transformation will affect up to 15% of our people across the Group in Canada, UK, Poland, Czech Republic and India.</p>
<p>"This is an incredibly challenging process to go through for everyone at Sumo and our focus is now on supporting our people and working with our partners on their games as we move forward to ensure we emerge from this difficult time, ready for the future."</p>
<p>Sumo Group has developed games including the BAFTA-winning Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Crackdown 3, and supported the development of games such as Team Sonic Racing, Forza Horizon and Hogwarts Legacy. It also develops its own internal projects, including Snake Pass and the upcoming Still Wakes The Deep.</p>

Our studio is best known for our roguelike deckbuilder </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In May 2023, we released another roguelike strategy game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062810/Inkbound/">Inkbound</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, into Steam’s Early Access program. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was recently released in 1.0, and we have been reflecting on our first experience with Early Access. This postmortem will outline what we think went right and wrong and will hopefully have some useful takeaways.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After wrapping up </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, its expansion pack, and various ports, we decided that we wanted to continue making roguelike strategy games but wanted to try to expand into online cooperative multiplayer. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> started as another card game, like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but we felt we couldn’t make that work well in a cooperative environment after some early prototypes. The pacing was too slow. We pivoted to a hybrid of real-time and turn-based gameplay. In Inkbound, each player has an avatar they control with free movement in a 3D world, but in the strategic battles, the gameplay is turn-based. Players go on roguelike runs in a fantasy world where books create portals into their stories. During a run, players draft powerups to improve their “build” on a mission to defeat the enemy threat who is trying to unravel the world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although the game can be played solo, we also support 2 to 4-player cooperative multiplayer. Critically, to keep the pace up, in multiplayer, all players can take their actions simultaneously, including in combat. There is no defined turn order among players. It’s up to players to coordinate to use their abilities effectively. This combat system is one of our core twists and one of the reasons we wanted to use Early Access: to get additional feedback and iteration time on this new model before reaching 1.0.</span></p><p>Players battling a boss in multiplayer. Images via Shiny Shoe.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of feedback, listening to team and player feedback is a critical component of our development process and we have built a variety of systems to try to make gathering feedback as efficient as possible. Creating a culture of open feedback is a core studio goal. Prior to releasing in Early Access, we tested the game with a few hundred testers to try to both catch as many technical issues as possible, as well as improve balance and game feel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the stage set, let’s jump into the specifics of what went right and wrong in our Early Access program.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What Went Right">What Went Right</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text"><br>Listening and Pivoting</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After releasing in Early Access we received a significant amount of feedback from a variety of channels, some good, some bad, and some requesting major changes. Although it can be painful to listen to negative feedback at times, I believe it’s critical to push through and try to understand the feedback trends. It’s clear to me that some people are better at staying level-headed when reading negative feedback than others. I encourage you to identify those people on your team and have them help summarize the feedback in constructive ways.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We felt we had a solid core game at our Early Access launch but some aspects of how the title was built were not received well by players in a way that blindsided us. More on this later. We absorbed that feedback and made some major pivots during Early Access in terms of game structure and business model. Some of the biggest feature additions included new character classes, new bosses, and a popular feature called “vestige sets” that give synergistic benefits to collecting different items during the course of a run.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Feedback Made Easy">Feedback Made Easy</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we’ve shipped all of our games with a feedback mechanism built straight into the game. It has gone so well that I encourage every developer to do this. On PC, we map a key to open an in-game feedback form, and in pre-release builds, put a message on the screen at all times encouraging players to push the button if they have something to say. We also ship this feature into production, though we turn off the always-on prompt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This system has proven immensely useful. If a player encounters a bug, they have an immediate way to send a report to the development team right when they are experiencing the issue and it is fresh in their mind. The same is true for balance feedback, quality of life concerns, and any frustration that they might be experiencing. When a player sends feedback, they get a free text entry to type in what is on their mind and under the hood, we capture a screenshot, their log file, their save game, and some other gameplay metadata. This additional data is incredibly useful for investigating bug reports and generally understanding the context of the feedback in cases where the written text may not be 100% clear.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to this in-game mechanism, we also encourage our engaged player community to connect with us on Discord and put in the effort to keep that well-moderated and a positive place to offer constructive feedback. Finally, we monitor a few other sources for feedback, like the Steam forums, our support e-mail, and social media. We want it to be easy to reach us.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Online Infrastructure">Online Infrastructure</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We designed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to encourage multiplayer. When playing the game online, players see each other in a central social hub between runs. There, they can optionally chat and party up before going on their next run. As a studio, this was our first big online game, and we decided to go with centralized hosting to ensure multiplayer would be as frictionless as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We had the benefit of deciding to approach it this way from the outset, which enabled us to make technical decisions to support multiplayer and cloud server hosting along the way. We did a lot of research on engine architecture and server hosting deployment architecture, and we did as much simulated load testing as we could before the game came out to look for issues. Finally, before Early Access release, we ran a Steam Playtest, framing it as a “technical test” where players could try out the game and we could see how well our infrastructure was working.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We were quite nervous about this aspect of the project going into Early Access launch day, but, in the end, it went fairly well. All the effort in research, development, and testing in this area resulted in a quite stable launch from a technology perspective.</span></p><p>Players hanging out in the Atheneum social hub.

This is not common in the roguelike genre, but with our planned centralized online/cooperative experience, we wanted to try a business model that could support ongoing updates without having to charge for content in a way that segregates the community (like only certain players having access to an area). We tried to be as simple and generous as possible with the monetization design. There were plenty of cosmetics to earn for free, and the system was completely optional. Players could not buy power, and all gameplay was available without interacting with that system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to incorporate in-game monetization did not go over well with players. We were blindsided by the amount of negative feedback. The complaints were primarily centered around the sense that additional items being sold in an Early Access title is unacceptable. This wasn’t stated by players but I also theorize that between the time we started developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2021 to its Early Access release in 2023 that in-game monetization in premium games has soured industry-wide.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even though we did a lot of pre-release testing, I think we were blindsided because business model decisions are basically impossible to test pre-release on PC compared to elements like gameplay balance. Our pre-release community testing crew got the game and everything in it for free, so they did not have the same emotional response to these features as players who were not involved in the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, during our time in Early Access we fully removed in-game monetization. As expected, this was a popular decision, and I believe the right one for the project. We migrated the cosmetics that were previously available in the game into DLC “supporter packs” that can be optionally purchased on Steam. This is a model that is more widely accepted.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="English-only during Early Access">English-only during Early Access</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We made a strategic decision to launch in Early Access in English only to maximize our ability to iterate and release content updates without lengthy translation pipelines. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a lot of text and game mechanics, and the goal was to empower game designers to change it as rapidly as they saw fit, improving the game and reducing the time it took to release those changes to our players. In that regard, this decision was a success because it certainly simplified the release process and allowed us to patch gameplay rules and systems rapidly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s impossible to know for sure, but I believe that this was a mistake on the business side. Our top refund reason for the duration of Early Access was “no Chinese language support.” The Early Access release is one of your most important marketing beats, and only supporting English certainly reduced our reach during one of the times of maximum visibility. Eventually, we localized into a variety of languages at 1.0, which had been our plan all along, but I’ll always wonder how many players we failed to reach between Early Access that we were not able to reconnect with at 1.0.</span></p><p>At 1.0 we finally completed the Chinese localization. Images via Shiny Shoe.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Solo vs Co-op—it’s hard to serve both well">Solo vs Co-op—it’s hard to serve both well</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We designed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from the outset to support online co-op as one of its core unique features, but also committed to supporting solo play. We found that after launch, approximately 60% of runs were played solo, and 40% were co-op. We received feedback from engaged players in both camps, suggesting ways to improve either the solo or co-op experience.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these suggestions were sometimes at odds with each other.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our design team found it challenging to support both playstyles optimally, and with the split between runs relatively even, there wasn’t an obvious side to fully commit to. It also caused some friction internally where some folks on the team were advocating for focusing on pushing multiplayer features while others didn’t want to do anything that would potentially cause a purely solo player to be unhappy. For example, adding objectives that require multiplayer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, we stuck to ensuring solo players could experience everything in the game, with multiplayer remaining a fun way to play but not pushed as far as it could have been if we had gone co-op only. In the end, we feel it did work out, but we also wonder if we should have gone solo-only or multiplayer-only.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was our first game to utilize Early Access, and we had some surprises that we did not anticipate. In the end, it was a valuable learning experience and I’m glad that we tried it. As we continue to support </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inkbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> post-launch we also have an eye to the future and are debating internally if and how we will use Early Access on future games. Regardless, we will definitely be applying the lessons learned on this project to our future games.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Blogger</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mark Cooke is the Lead Gameplay Programmer at Nihilistic, which he joined in August 2004 after interning at the company 3 years earlier.

Born during these challenging times, emerging studios will be fueled by creative freedom, innovation, and a more sustainable and equitable future. Those studios with a clear vision for the industry will be the standouts. Whether you’re a solo dev or indie studio riding the crest of the next wave, now is the time to clarify that vision.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While promoting your game is crucial, crafting a compelling corporate story is equally important — a story that shows your unique vision for gaming’s future and outlines a proactive PR strategy that builds trust and establishes your studio as the forefront of thought leadership.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Why should we care about your studio?&quot;">"Why should we care about your studio?"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">More than a marketing schtick, your corporate story is the DNA of your studio which encompasses your mission, values, unique vision, and team culture. It's the narrative that differentiates you and will attract top talent, resonate with investors, and ultimately connect with paying players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To craft a compelling corporate story, start by defining your mission and values. What drives your team? What kind of games do you want to create?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-games-to-play-if-you-are-tired-of-warhammer-40-000.898302/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-games-to-play-if-you-are-tired-of-warhammer-40000/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-best-games-to-play-if-you-are-tired-of-warhammer-40000<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="274" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Take it from someone who has played an assortment of wargames for nearly four decades: sometimes, a change is as good as a rest. If you have been pouring your heart and soul into <em>Warhammer 40K</em> for a while and just need something a bit different, there are options out there.</p> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true">While Games Workshop certainly has a lot going for it, such as rather nice sculpts, very good lore, and a degree of mindshare that makes getting games extremely easy, that’s no reason to ignore the rest of the offerings on the market from all manner of companies. Now, this list will concern itself with games that are set in science-fiction settings and are army-level. I’m assuming you want to play something like 40K here, not something dramatically different.</p>
 <h2 id="h-great-alternatives-to-warhammer-40k" data-injectable="false">Great alternatives to Warhammer 40K</h2> <h3 data-injectable="false">Grimdark Future by OnePageRules</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via One Page Rules</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="641" data-current-count="941" data-injectable="true">OnePageRules is something of a cheat entry, as they have an alternative for almost everything, but this really is the very best thing to play if you are looking for something new to do with your <em>Warhammer 40K</em> army. A simple set of rules won’t take long to learn, and you’ll be able to use pretty much every model you already own because that is how the system was designed. Over the years, OPR products have slowly been turning into viable standalone products rather than just a “this is almost 40K, but free” alternative. This is great, as they are a talented team that deserves to grow beyond that initial concept. </p>
 <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">Have you always wanted to use a custom Space Skaven army to smash up some silly Chaos Space Marines? You can just use Mantic’s Veer-myn range of minis for a Ratmen Clans army while your CSM become Havoc Brothers. Fans of the magic of 3D printing can buy all sorts of files for the game’s many factions, and those same factions have been designed to cover just about every popular motif across the biggest games in the genre. They also have an extremely high-value Patreon, where you get oodles of free files each month.</p>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">The best thing about <em>Grimdark Future</em> is that the rules really are fun. Army balance is pretty on point, and there is a certain reward for playing in a sandbox with less structure and lore around it, in that you can simply make it all up as you go. For an average game of 40-50 models made up of squads, vehicles, and characters, you are looking at about an hour and a half once you are familiar with the rules.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">BattleTech by Catalyst Game Labs</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Catalyst Labs</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><em>BattleTech’s Alpha Strike</em> made it onto my list of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-tabletop-miniature-skirmish-games-to-play-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best skirmish games to play</a>, but this time around, we are talking about the standard rules. Catalyst Game Labs have done a pretty good job of bringing this beast back to good condition in recent years, although folks outside of America should be warned that distribution can be a little spotty.</p>
 <p data-characters="529" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">The joy of <em>BattleTech</em> is in the details. While the model count might be low, with a classic match being two players and four mechs each, the deep and detailed ruleset means you are still looking at maybe two hours to wrap a game, and that is if you are quite familiar with it. Now, there are plenty of ways to make that shorter or longer, depending on your preference. I’ve seen people play games that took entire weekends to complete, with multiple players, multiple boards, and troop migration from one table to the next.</p>
 <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="204" data-injectable="false">What seems to be the sticking point for many people is the models, which have quite dated designs and might not be your cup of tea. That just means you are wrong, but don’t worry about it too much. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Firefight by Mantic Games</h3> <figure data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mantic Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">I’ve got a few reasons why Mantic is a better company than Games Workshop, and <em>Firefight </em>is one of them. Cheaper overall, better rules (sorry, 10th Edition 40K, you are just not for me), well supported, and similar enough to be inviting while different enough to be challenging. </p> <p data-characters="670" data-current-count="955" data-injectable="true">I feel like Mantic gets unfairly saddled with a “poor man’s GW” title, but <em>Kings of War</em> has been the best rank and flank game on the market for years, and <em>Firefight </em>is a fantastic game on its own merit. Starter sets cost about $140 with everything you need for two forces and all the rules to play. There are also two of them available, in case you don’t like one of the factions in one of the boxes. Most armies have a starter set for about $100, which would maybe get you two squads in other systems. You can even get the rules for free by signing up for their companion app, and those app-based rules get updated whenever new changes are made.</p>
 <h3 id="h-star-wars-legion-by-atomic-mass-games" data-injectable="false">Star Wars: Legion by Atomic Mass Games</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Atomic Mass Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">Don’t tell anyone, but <em>Star Wars: Legion</em> is actually pretty ace. This is the game to go to if you want to play out some of the large battles that you saw on screen as a child in those space opera movies that nobody ever really saw. It has the advantage of getting to use designs that have stood the test of time and are as visually striking today as they were when first released. </p>
 <p data-characters="495" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true">One of the reasons that I like <em>Legion</em> is that it scales pretty well. You can use smaller forces on a small table or bigger forces on a bigger table, and you won’t get some of the creaking that comes from under the hood of other rule sets. Games Workshop has a novel means of solving this lately with Combat Patrol in <em>40K</em> and Spearhead in <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, but <em>Star Wars: Legion’s</em> designers managed to crack this one pretty well without the need for an additional ruleset being attached.</p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">The game features a neat activation system that replicates some of the randomness of war without leaving one player completely open to getting RNGd into oblivion, and the gameplay manages to walk a fine line between being both strategically and tactically rewarding. I always break it down like this. Strategy is how opposing armies interact, and tactics are how opposing troops interact. If you are missing one of those elements, you have a bad tabletop game.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Beyond the Gates of Antares by Warlord/Skytrex</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warlord Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true"><em>Beyond the Gates of Antares</em> is an interesting fish because it never really got the attention it deserved, and now it might be too late. <em>Gates</em> is all about human and non-human factions punching the hell out of each other to control the titular gates that allow access to all manner of hidden worlds and cosmic wonder.</p>
 <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">Rick Priestly, probably still best known for his work laying the very foundations and building an awful lot of the walls of <em>Warhammer 40K</em> back in the day, is the man behind the rules. You’d be tempted to think he would have just rolled off and designed his next iteration of that ruleset under a different banner, but <em>Gates </em>is a pretty interesting game on its own merit.</p> <p data-characters="561" data-current-count="937" data-injectable="true">The bad news on this one is that the game is currently in an odd place. It is no longer under the banner of former publisher Warlord Games and is instead with sister company Skytrex, which is selling the miniatures. This means it now sits in a strange place where you can get the game, and it is being supported as a passion project by Rick Priestly and former official head of the project Tim Bancroft. It is seeing an interesting surge in support on a community level, and it’s worth exploring if you don’t mind buying into older, at-risk systems.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Warmachine by Steamforged Games/Privateer Press</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="773" data-injectable="true">Folks were wondering where <em>Warmachine </em>was on my list of best skirmish games. Well, here you go. <em>Warmachine </em>is the game that could have, nay, should have, taken the crown from <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, at least as a competitive game. Then publisher Privateer Press somewhat fumbled the bag, sadly, and over the years, the game has faded away. The launch of MKIV didn’t do much to win me back with $200, 3D printed starter sets, and it seems like that is the case for others, too.</p>
 <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><em>Warmachine </em>and related IPs were recently sold to Steamforged Games. Now, Steamforged is certainly not above some criticism around certain areas, but I originally wrote this entry BEFORE this news was announced, and it was a few paragraphs of doom and gloom. I feel much better now, as Steamforged has said nothing will be changing except the stuff I think is bad, such as the lack of availability of the product, lack of a proper two-player starter set, and lack of plastic models in the new sculpts.</p>
 <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="183" data-injectable="false">So, while I still feel a lot of trepidation about Warmachine in general, I do wonder if this might be it. The moment. The glorious ascent to levels of yesteryear? We can live in hope.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Quick Hits</h2> <h3 data-injectable="false">Victory Decision: Future Combat by A.D. Publishing</h3> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">Flexibility is the name of the game for Victory Decision: Future Combat. This tome builds onto the Victory Condition system, adding specific rules for science fiction units. It covers quite a lot of variety and can work with anything from 6mm to 32mm models. It’s a fun system, but will definitely take some getting used to.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Dropzone Commander</h3> <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Technically more <em>Epic </em>than <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, this 10mm scale city battles game by TT Combat is well worth a look. Miniature design in this game is just wonderful, with all factions being distinct and a lot of love going into each and every model. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Any old edition of Warhammer 40K</h3> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="false">If, like me, you are just not jiving with 10th Edition, then feel free to break out any old edition of the game. I still play 2nd Edition a lot and will play 5th Edition when people give my arm a little twist. Old rules are, thankfully, not dead rules, we can always crack open those old books and play again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/marvels-spider-man-2-gets-an-amazing-new-lineup-of-suits-including-the-latest-into-the-spider-verse-skin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=marvels-spider-man-2-gets-an-amazing-new-lineup-of-suits-including-the-latest-into-the-spider-verse-skin<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="223" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Just when I think I’ve gotten my fill in the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-spider-man/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Spider-Man</a> </em>universe, Insomniac Games swings me back in with new content. Another suit expansion is on the way, with an upcoming update set for June 18, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">The new update offers eight new suits to try on, and don’t worry; they are entirely free to use. The artist Colm Dillane, also known as KidSuper, designed several skins, blending together his classic artwork into <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-marvels-spider-man-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a></em>. He also collaborated with other special guests for the project, including professional football player Vini Jr., motorsports driver Lando Norris, and singer/actress/model Rina Sawayama.</p>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Vini Jr. and KidSuper have co-designed the vibrant Ginga Suit (left), depicting a sporty look for Vini Jr.’s successful athletic career. Lando Norris, on the other hand, has taken his racing career as the muse for the Fluro Suit (right), perfectly matching any motorsports driver’s gear through its helmet. </p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">As for Rina Sawayama and KidSuper’s collaboration, players can expect a “badass motorbike” look with the Motorchic Suit. Hit the streets of New York City covered in leather and take down those bad guys in style.</p> <figure data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Among the suits that Insomniac Games has customized, one that I’m particularly thrilled about is Into the Spider-Verse’s Peter B. Parker fit. This suit, with its unique design and nod to the beloved character, will be excellent for those movie scene recreation shots. Many players have already done this with other skins, specifically with the film-based suits from <em>Spider-Man</em> and <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="148" data-current-count="148" data-injectable="false">Another personal favorite of mine, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-spider-man-miles-morales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miles Morales</a>, will also be getting more suits, including the Animated Suit (left) and Uptown Pride Suit (right).</p> <figure data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">I have always loved the look of <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man’s </em>animated outfits, so it’s fantastic to see even more join the lineup. Insomniac Games also plans to implement more stability fixes with the update. It will address the issues with the parry and traversal swap from the Symbiote to Spider Arms.</p> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false">Both the stability fixes and the suits will arrive on June 18. Make sure to update <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> with the latest patch to get the new skins for free.</p>

<p data-characters="242" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em>, the free-to-play gacha game by Kuro Games, has only been available for the masses to play for under three weeks. However, since its release on May 17, 2024, the RPG has already hit a huge milestone — 30 million downloads.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">This number does include pre-registrations and doesn’t reflect the number of active players per day. However, it’s a commendable occasion for the studio either way you slice it. It’s no small feat, considering the issues faced by <em>Wuthering Waves</em> since it was released.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">There have been a string of issues plaguing the game, such as event schedule readjustments, translation errors, problems with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-echoes-guide/">Echo system</a>, and balancing issues when recycling certain Echoes. All of these issues have resulted in compensation rewards for all players, including huge amounts of Shell Credits and Astrite to make up for inconveniences faced.<br></p>

 <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="214" data-injectable="false">Despite all of these issues, it’s clear that players are still coming back for more <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, with new players adding to the number of pre-registrations that existed prior to the release of the game.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">It’s easy to see why, with regular updates and hotfixes, plus a seemingly endless stream of events and the addictive nature of gacha gaming, <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is clearly hitting all the right notes with players, even if things haven’t gone entirely smoothly.</p>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">With a new update arriving on June 28 (or June 27, depending on where you’re located), including two new Resonators and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-1-1-release-date-new-resonators-and-map-expansion/">host of other new features</a>, <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is likely to keep attracting players both new and returning.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-sails-far-from-the-series%E2%80%99-origins.898278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare has released the first&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer, and we're a long way from the careful, considered CRPG approach of 2009's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>.</p>
<p>Last week, BioWare revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-the-veilguard">had become&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em></a>, and that we'd get a first look at gameplay soon. That time has come, and first impressions of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>are...certainly different.</p>
<p>The trailer opens with the player character, here named Rook, and series regular Varric Tethras looking for a mage detective (that's a detective who's a mage, not one who finds mages) named Neve Gallus.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-hack-and-slash.jpg?itok=HQ1OCbZg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-hack-and-slash.jpg?itok=WA2K4rUo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>isn't the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>you might remember.</figcaption></figure><p>Varric and Rook move through a city seemingly watched over by a giant Panopticon-style tower, and it isn't long before demons are running loose throughout the city, apparently summoned by Solas himself, the Dreadwolf of the game's previous title.</p>
<p>Soon, Rook, Varric, and companion Harding get into some combat, and we see that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is pretty much shrugging off the cloak of tactical RPG combat to fully embrace action.</p>
<p>The combat looks very hack-and-slash-inspired; the focus seems to be on stylish moves and cooldowns rather than strategy and planning, which means the trajectory of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Inquisition&nbsp;</em>is arguably at its apex here.</p>
<p><em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>also looks like it's putting quite a heavy emphasis on setpieces and "cool moments"; bringing down a statue and watching as demons rampage through the city streets spring to mind in this trailer.</p>

<p>Although the combat doesn't look much like old-school&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>, we do get to see our protagonist making some dialogue decisions on an&nbsp;<em>Inquisition</em>-style dialogue wheel that assigns responses to certain tones and moods.</p>
<p>We also get to see decisions being made that will apparently impact the plot and how characters feel about us; at one stage, Rook makes a decision of which one character approves and another disapproves.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this gameplay trailer represents the opening moments of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, which means that it might be placing a heavier emphasis on setpieces than later sequences do in order to set the scene.</p>
<p>The trailer culminates in Varric confronting Solas about his deeds, upon which Solas shatters Varric's iconic crossbow Bianca and two powerful-looking demons appear to flank him.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see just how much of the original&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>'s DNA has actually made it into&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>, but either way, the game is launching on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S this fall. You can check out our hands-off preview of BioWare's latest RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-epic-fantasy-action">right here</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 5.45pm UK:</strong> Arcane may be ending with its second season, but Riot Games is planning more projects with the show's talented animation studio Fortiche, the developer has now said.
</p>
<p>"Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and our partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," co-creator Christian Linke said in a new <a href="https://x.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1800543519725297679">developer update video</a>. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with the second season. 
</p>
<p>"But Arcane is just the first of many stories we want to tell in Runeterra. We've been with Riot through Vi and Jinx's entire journey thus far, from becoming in-game champions to characters featured in different cinematics to main characters in a TV show. Their arcs have grown so far beyond our original dreams, and we want to give the same treatment to more champions. 
</p>
<p>"We're currently working on our next projects across television and film, and we're hopeful that we can share more before the end of the year. We're still in the early stages of that, and these things do take a lot of time, but we want to share updates with you whenever we can."</p>
<divider></divider>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 4.45pm UK:</strong> 
You wait years for a new season of your favourite show, and then find out it's ending. In what looks like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">classic Netflix fashion</a>, today's action-packed trailer for Arcane season two describes the show's long-awaited second run of episodes as "The Final Chapter". 
</p>
<p>
Which, for possibly the best video game adaptation of all time, and just an incredible TV show in general, is pretty bad news. 
</p>
<p>
Spoilers abound for the show's first season here, as the trailer appears to answer what happened next after the first season's explosive cliffhanger ending.

<p>
Some (but clearly not all) of the series' characters from season one are present, in this, our best look at Arcane season two yet. It looks great! But hell, to find out these episodes are likely the end of Arcane's story already is a massive shame. 
</p>
<p>
Arcane's first nine-episode season debuted on Netflix in 2021. It took six years to make, and was showered by praise from fans of its League of Legends source material and newcomers alike. It was also critically adored, and won that year's Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program.
</p>
<p>
The show's upcoming second season has taken another three years to put together, and it was hoped its story would continue on further. There's still the possibility of another Arcane-style series set elsewhere within its universe, perhaps, but fans should now seemingly prepare themselves for the show's overall series finale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-two-teaser-reveals-a-big-new-character-and-sets-fan-tongues-wagging">when new episodes arrive this November</a>.

Just like the motion picture, this <a href="https://www.polygon.com/board-games">board game</a> depicts the escalating desert war between the deposed House Atreides and usurping House Harkonnen.

<p id="vUsPmS">Each turn both players roll a pool of dice. These custom six-siders have various action icons and the results determine what you will be able to do during the round. Play then consists of going back and forth from Atreides to Harkonnen, each player assigning a die and executing an action. </p>
<p id="e4YUu5">This is a simple system. You spend a die to recruit troops or move them. You can also play special cards from your hand to spring nasty surprises or launch massive attacks. The dice pool acts as a restriction, forcing players into tough spots where you can’t perfectly execute a plan. The tactical challenge is in how you utilize your options to warp the board to your will.</p>

<p id="acyUYN">Victory, likewise, is nuanced. The Atreides have the tougher assignment as they need to focus on a small assortment of goals dealt out from the Prescience deck each turn. These encourage various maneuvers built broadly on the novel’s narrative, such as Paul drinking the Water of Life or Atreides using their Fremen warriors to attack vulnerable harvesters. They focus play on momentary considerations, forcing adaptation and bending to the environment — two central themes running throughout Herbert’s novel. </p>
<p id="0ya1rT">There is also incentive to control the ecological stations scattered about the map. These form hotspots as the Harkonnen player will typically try to defend them. Finally, Atreides will edge closer to success by taking the Harkonnen strongholds, such as the North Pole and Arrakeen. These are always well defended and a significant challenge, but with tools such as the fierce sandworms and the elite Fedaykin troops, such an offensive is possible.</p>
<p id="ID6Isy">The Harkonnen player has it a bit easier. Instead of pursuing dynamic objectives that change each round, they simply need to destroy 10 points of Fremen bases. The value of each sietch is hidden, but this number can be scouted with ornithopters as well as some clever card play. This is the more blunt faction, relying on marshaling legions of troops to root out the indigenous Fremen and annihilate them. It highlights the alternative philosophies of each house and incorporates one of the novel’s many motifs.</p>

<p id="ffBFQL">Both combat and the incorporation of named leaders on the battlefield are reminiscent of <em>War of the Ring</em>. Violence is simple: Each unit adds a die that yields either a hit, shield, or special leader buffs. Shields cancel out hits with the remainder applied as casualties to the army. The special leader buffs are the most intriguing aspect. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23930166/lego-dune-set-buy-order">Baron Harkonnen</a>, for instance, will offer defense while The Beast Rabban supplies extra blows. The special troops — Fedaykin and Sardaukar — add further texture by soaking multiple hits and negating the opponent’s defense results. This, while simple and easy to internalize, proves a surprisingly strong offensive toolset that results in the potential for devastating results. Fights resolve quickly and logically, framing dramatic moments that punctuate play and support the larger narrative arc of the game.</p>
<p id="vb9M65">Besides conflict, the leaders are a significant aspect due to how they enhance player actions. Paul allows you to perform a special action that rallies multiple legions to him. Rabban can execute a potent double move which allows you to strike behind enemy lines and gain separation. Still other leaders influence card acquisition or deploy special units to the board. As the narrative evolves, new leaders come into play. The result is an unique story path each playthrough, with some sessions never even witnessing the Reverend Mother or the great Wild Maker.</p>

<p id="etH8DU">There is a lot of detail here. The asymmetry of the two forces is a large part of the appeal. The Atreides/Fremen forces can ride worms across the desert with impunity, while Harkonnen legions left in the open desert are worn down by storms each round. Collecting spice is integral to the Harkonnen keeping the rest of the empire content and maintaining their economic advantage. There is bluffing and secrecy through hidden units and vicious card play. Despite all of this detail and the large amount of content, the game wraps up in a surprising two hours. It’s shocking how this framework is exceedingly capable of furnishing a full story arc with depth and precision in the alloted time.</p>
<p id="1CrEm0">Many of its accomplishments are a result of the design team iterating on <em>War of the Ring</em>, now in its second edition. Tweaks to leaders represent a significant improvement over that game, as they are now decoupled from the bonus dice they grant in Middle-earth. Here on Arrakis, the action system is more satisfying, as Atreides possess less dice but are able to perform the clever wormsign action on their turn — effectively manipulating the environment — instead of simply passing and waiting for their opponent to spend their extra dice. The time commitment is much shorter, as <em>War of the Ring</em> requires a huge chunk of the day to setup and play. There are other small improvements found in battle, the card system, and general game flow. The outcome is an experience that sits at this splendid intersection of grand strategy wargame with a more personal and intimate composition.</p>
<p id="BhDQfB">Despite these plaudits, it’s important to understand this is primarily a two-player game. It can function as a four-player endeavor with each faction split in half between a pair of players, but this is far less satisfying in practice and undercuts some of the design’s strengths. If a group of four players is in search of something to play, they would be much better off looking elsewhere.</p>

<p id="nYh1Xf">Of more significance is an issue of faction balance. Michele Garbuggio, a developer that worked in support of the design team on this game, has <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3304026/article/44306943#44306943">stated</a> that “by precise design intent, [<em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em>] is not balanced on a 50/50 win ratio…it’s more like a 60/40…in favor of the Harkonnen.” The intentionality behind this reflects the power disparity between the forces and the miraculous rise of the Kwisatz Haderach to lead the scattered Fremen. This does not detract from the overall power of the design. The vast majority of participants will engage this game casually and not in a tournament format, and in this more relaxed environment it’s of little consequence.</p>
<p id="Tzrjtg">Regardless of these minor concerns, <em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em> has burst from the sand with ferocity. This game offers an epic experience flush with drama and moments of grandeur. It successfully condenses and refines many of the concepts of its designer’s previous work, and it produces a special game that stands with its own identity. 2024 is only halfway complete, but it may have already received its best title. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-will-receive-8-new-suits/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Insomniac has just unveiled a brand new free content update for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 that brings new suits into the pictures. 8 new suits will be introduced, some of them are based on new designs whereas others are returning favourites from the previous instalments of the franchise. The update will be released on June 18, 2024, and with the suits, we can also expect the developers to add some stability improvements to the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Four new suits have arrived through a collaboration with American artist and fashion designer, Colm Dillane or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kidsuper/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">KidSuper</a>. The first one is from the designer himself called the Metro Suit, which has a puffer design inspired by his collection along with an exclusive and original colourway. Now Spidey can be dripped out while saving the civilians of New York.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The second suit has been co-designed by Brazilian Footballer, Vini Jr. His suit is called the Ginga Suit and it showcases the footballer’s love for his country. The suit features the colours and accents from the Brazilian flag along with a sportier look for Miles Morales. With the Ginga Suit Spider-Man looks ready to win another Champions League trophy.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The third suit has been co-designed by British-Belgium motorsport racer, Lando Norris and his design is called the Fluro suit. The main inspiration behind his design “is the feeling of speed” and he also wished to give a touch of racing to the suit, which is why the mask looks like a helmet. All that remains is an F1 car to rule the streets of Manhattan&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fourth suit has been co-designed by Japanese singer, actress and model Rina Sawayama. The Motorchic Suit adds a leather jacket and trousers to Spider-Man, with metal detailing. It brings out the inner motorbike rider in Spidey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of the returning favourites, the one that fans won’t miss is Peter Parker’s Spider-Man suit from Into the Spider-Verse movie. Next up we have Peter Parker’s Last Stand suit. In third, we receive a slightly animated version of the Miles Morales suit. Last but not least is The Uptown Pride suit from Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-was-with-that-disappointing-ubisoft-forward-showcase/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Summer Game Fest, E3, or whatever we’re calling it now, is finally over. Xbox had arguably one of the best showcases in the past decade, whereas Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest main show fell short of some of the more significant announcements we would have expected from such a show. The Ubisoft Forward showcase also felt underwhelming, especially considering the slate of games we know that Ubisoft has in development and is set to release in the next couple of years. So, what was up with that disappointing Ubisoft Forward showcase?</p>



<p>Two of Ubisoft’s biggest games to release later this year, Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin’s Creed Shadows, took up over half of the one-hour show, and apart from the two surprise announcements of Anno 117 and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-remade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 date for Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a>, there wasn’t that much else to brag about. </p>



<p>The most notable misses of games that have already been announced were the Splinter Cell Remake, Project U, Beyond Good and Evil 2, the 20th-anniversary edition of the original, and even a showing of the Assassin’s Creed Infinity Hub, which is set to launch alongside Shadows. Division 3 has also been officially announced but will not enter production until later this year after appointed management is free after the release of Outlaws.</p>



<p>Other games expected to be released in the next two to three years include Assassin’s Creed Invictus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Hexe</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry 7</a>, a Far Cry extraction shooter, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-recon-project-over-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Ghost Recon game</a>, several new free-to-play games, and a new WW2 extraction shooter under the codename Crest that has an ambitious 10-year live service plan that will follow the events of World War 2. </p>



<p>If everything comes to fruition, it’s easy to see that Ubisoft does have a great pipeline of games in the works, but the reality of game development is incredibly complex. Speaking with several Ubisoft employees, the feeling is that Ubisoft executives no longer wants to commit to release dates or games publically until they are confident of their releases. Perhaps because of mishaps like Skull &amp; Bones, which saw over half a dozen public delays, or the more recent example with Star Wars Outlaws, which has seen a reduction in its scope to release on time. </p>



<p>Why these things continue to happen at Ubisoft is a bigger story for a later date (but I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-ubisoft-from-low-morale-to-internal-tensions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest reading this article on low morale at the company</a>). Issues internally are not changing, but at least in the eyes of Ubisoft, a little more public caution over its games and release dates can go a long way. A trailer for Beyond Good and Evil 2 has been ready for over a year, but without any confidence in a release date; do they want to see another game with more constant public delays? Probably not. At least, we should hear more about the Beyond Good and Evil 20th-anniversary game soon, but where and when is anyone’s guess.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview.898260/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is off to an interesting start, to say the least. Coming off the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">somewhat controversial decision to change the name</a>, BioWare re-introduced the series to fans with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024">two-minute trailer that drew unfavorable comparisons to Fortnite and Marvel</a>. BioWare quickly followed with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-releases-first-ever-gameplay-footage-ahead-of-tuesdays-reveal">twenty-second tease</a> that was met much more positively – yet another jolting turn in what has been a rollercoaster decade for the franchise since Dragon Age: Inquisition.</p><p>Over the weekend, I watched as BioWare finally took the wraps off Dragon Age: The Veilguard over the course of an hour-long presentation in which they showed off the character creator, a broad swath of the gameplay, and the battle system. Director Corinne Busche also took the time to answer some of my biggest questions around The Veilguard’s romantic options and exploration.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>First, the graphics. Running on the latest iteration of the Frostbite Engine, at least one source told me that The Veilguard targets 60fps. In a subsequent conversation, though, an EA representative said, “Dragon Age: The Veilguard will feature performance and quality modes on consoles to ensure players can choose the visual fidelity they prefer. We’ll have more to share on exact performance as we finish development in the coming months.”</p><p>Whatever the fidelity, it’s evident that The Veilguard is heavily stylized, and whether that look lands is mostly a matter of taste. It’s worth pointing out that Dragon Age has always been a riot of art styles and I’m not so sure that the series needs to return to the blood-spattered style of the original. What matters to me is polish and a cohesive sense of identity, and in that sense The Veilguard seems like a logical evolution of Inquisition, which itself was quite stylized. </p><p>Also, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguards-character-creator">The Veilguard actually has good hair this time around</a>, which, <em>finally</em>.</p><h2>In the shadow of Mass Effect 2</h2><p>For what it’s worth, there’s plenty of nods to longtime fans, including the return of Varric, who Busche calls the franchise’s “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” along with some “killer cameos.” It’s Varric who narrates the story’s opening section, recapping the events of previous games and explaining the motivations of Solas, aka the Dread Wolf. While The Veilguard is once again a standalone story, with Rook joining The Warden, Hawke, and the Inquisition in the ranks of Dragon Age protagonists, it starts in a breathless state of in media res as a group of heroes try to stop Solas before he tears apart the barrier between Thedas and the spirit world.</p><p>“We want to get you right in,” Busche explains. “Especially with an RPG where they can be quite lore-heavy, a lot of exposition at the front and remembering proper nouns, it can be very overwhelming.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p>What follows is basically one long action setpiece as the main characters sprint through Minrathous, a city under attack by demons (this is another big moment for fans, who have been waiting for ages to see the capital of the Tevinter Imperium). While it’s unwise to draw too many conclusions from such a brief section of the game, it’s easy to wonder just how linear The Veilguard will end up being.</p><p>“Yeah, so it is a mission-based game. Everything is hand-touched, hand-crafted, very highly curated,” Busche says, echoing a talking point that comes up repeatedly throughout the presentation. “We believe that's how we get the best narrative experience, the best moment-to-moment experience. However, along the way, these levels that we go to do open up, some of them have more exploration than others. Alternate branching paths, mysteries, secrets, optional content you're going to find and solve. So it does open up, but it is a mission-based, highly curated game.”</p><p>Pressed for more details on sidequests and optional content, Busche says, “Some of them are [highly curated],  especially when it involves the motivations and the experiences of the companions. You're really along on this journey with them. Others, you're investigating a missing family… and the entirety of this bog is open up to you. You're searching for clues, finding a way to solve their disappearance. So really it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. But I do want to emphasize that hand-crafted and curated is our approach.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Alternate branching paths, mysteries, secrets, optional content you're going to find and solve. So it does open up, but it is a mission-based, highly curated game</p></div><p>It reminds me nothing so much as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a>, with The Lighthouse – The Veilguard’s equivalent of Skyhold – standing in for the Normandy. I suppose it only makes sense in light of Dragon Age’s unique relationship with Mass Effect 2. Fans will recall that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-origins">original Dragon Age: Origins</a> was basically a AAA CRPG – a continuation of BioWare’s isometric RPG legacy on PC. Mass Effect 2 followed just a couple months later, garnering praise among mainstream critics for its transition to full third-person shooter. Ever since, BioWare has prioritized action over gritty RPG mechanics, and the latest Dragon Age is no different.</p><p>But The Veilguard’s connection to Mass Effect 2 perhaps runs even deeper than that. Mass Effect 2’s story centered around Shepard recruiting companions from around the galaxy, Dirty Dozen-style, before ultimately embarking on a Suicide Mission where every character is at risk of dying – one of the most famous quests in gaming history.</p><p>Busche hints that something similar might be in The Veilguard. Asked whether The Veilguard will feature permadeath, she teases, “I don't want to get into spoilers but you just might [lose some characters]. Now in what we saw there, obviously no one died. In a situation like that they can get injured, they can influence how they think about you. If they're ready to hit the field with you, it does get more dangerous. We might lose some people along the way.”</p><h2>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of an action game than ever</h2><p>So with that in mind, let’s talk a bit about Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s battle system, which reduces the party size from four to three and in so doing becomes more action forward than ever. It features what Busche calls “sophisticated animation canceling and branching,” with the design centered around dodging, countering, and using risk-reward charge attacks designed to break enemy armor layers. Much of its strategy lives in its ability wheel, which stops the action either by tapping or holding the shoulder button and allows you to issue orders as you see fit. In particular, companions can be kitted out as support units and healers, which Busche cites as a big player request after Inquisition.</p><p>“The combat system is an interesting challenge going into the fourth iteration of this game because as you know, every Dragon Age has reinvented combat to some degree,” Busche explains. “Of course, pause and play strategy is always the backbone of it. But what that means is that, in addition to fans of all three prior games and welcoming in an entirely new generation of fans, we've got a pretty diverse player base to accommodate to.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every IGN BioWare Game Review</h3></div></output><p>While she offers comparatively few specifics, Busche hints at some of the deeper strategy behind the battle system. Weaknesses and resistances will apparently play a major role in the combat, with abilities being designed to exploit them accordingly. One character might be able to plant a weakening debuff on an enemy, and another enemy might be able to detonate them. Likewise, the bonds that Rook forges with companions like Neve, a detective, and Harding, who returns from Inquisition as a full partner, determine how party members grow and what abilities become available. Those bonds are in turn determined by the choices you make using BioWare’s famous dialogue wheel, which returns for The Veilguard.</p><p>I was heartened to see some of this depth make its way into the battle system, which has a fluidity to it thatl Dragon Age: Inquisition lacked. It further includes individual specializations for each class, including Duelist, Saboteur, and Veil Jumper for Rogue, as well as an overarching backstory based on the faction you choose. Players used to choosing a backstory and having it be totally irrelevant to the story will be happy to know that it impacts the dialogue more this time.</p><p>After all it’s the characters who will determine the success of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Larian ironically stole some of BioWare’s thunder with Baldur’s Gate 3, but this is still the studio that gave us Leliana, Liara, and Varric among many others, and it practically invented the RPG romance as we know it today. It’s been less than a week since the first official trailer and <a href="https://x.com/FidzyO/status/1799943346175263057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Lucanis fanart is already manifesting on social media</u></a>. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I've been a fan of all three for different reasons. But Origins is when I fell in love with the franchise</p></div><p>“Each of the companions that you journey with has really complex backstories, problems of their own, deep motivations. And these play out through some really well fleshed-out character arcs; missions that are unique to them, but ultimately tie into the larger story,” Busche says. “And along the way we'll make consequential decisions for each of them, sometimes affecting who they are, sometimes heart-wrenching – I've cried more than once – and sometimes pretty joyous.” </p><p>Many years ago, I stood in a room with Mike Laidlaw as he talked about the tremendous amount of work that David Gaider, Ben Gelinas, and other writers put into building Dragon Age’s world (Gaider, it should be mentioned, is very active on X/Twitter and is <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1799965308213743818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>definitely paying attention to The Veilguard</u></a>). That effort has earned the series an enduring fanbase despite being on hiatus for more than a decade. Busche, a self-described RPG fan who says she loved Baldur’s Gate 3, counts herself among them.</p><p>“I've been a fan of all three for different reasons. But Origins is when I fell in love with the franchise,” she says.</p><p>When The Veilguard arrives later this fall (it doesn’t yet have a firm release date), it will be more than a big moment for BioWare – it will be a huge moment for the fans. The Dragon Age fans I know, many of them women, are palpably excited to have this franchise back in their lives after waiting for so long. It’s too early to say whether or not Dragon Age: The Veilguard will live up to their expectations. All I know is that it’s good to finally be back in Thedas after all these years.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

What's more, Busche confirmed that you'll be able to customize your Inquisitor if you want to remake your protagonist from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>.</p><p>"What's not lost on us is that it's been 10 years since existing players have played.

So in the character creator, I like to call it<em> last time on Dragon Age</em>, but you can go into your past adventures and it, actually through tarot cards, tells you what the context was and what decision you want to make."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/dragonage-veilguard-4-blogroll-1718059907587.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Corrine Busch reveals how world state imports will work in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. </figcaption></figure></output><p>When pressed further about if all the previous characters would be woven into The Veilguard, like Hawke, Busch says, "I won't say everybody, but yes, some of them."</p><p>What it sounds like is that BioWare may be abandoning <a href="https://dragonagekeep.com/en_US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Age Keep</a>, which would allow you to export your world state from previous Dragon Age games into Inquisition through your save files. When asked if The Veilguard would read saves from <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age Origins</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/08/dragon-age-ii-review">Dragon Age II</a>, or Dragon Age: Inquisition, Busche confirmed that it wouldn't. </p><p>"The technology is so different and we wanted it to be in the client," she says.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"What's not lost on us is that it's been 10 years since existing players have played.</p></div><p>Indeed, Busche also confirms that The Veilguard players won't have to link to their accounts for this option, as you'll be able to play the game fully offline.

It's a bit of a surprise for fans, considering that in previous Dragon Age games (excluding Dragon Age II), the romanceable characters had different sexual orientations. Some were pansexual, sure, but others were heterosexual, others were only attracted to the same sex, and some could only be romanced if you were a certain race (Dragon Age: Inquisition's Solas, for example, could only be romanced by female elves).</p><p>But Busche pushes back on the idea that The Veilguard's companions are "playersexual," a term used to describe games where NPCs are specifically only attracted to the player character. She says she's seen playersexual "done in a number of games," and "it can be really off-putting where these characters are adapting to who you, the player, are."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"It's not until the later parts of the game where you really commit to romance and it gets pretty spicy.</p></div><p>Rather, Busche insists that they're all specifically pansexual, and that might come through in what you learn about their backstories.</p><p>"Their past experiences or partners, they'll reference them and indeed who they'll become romantic with," Busche tells IGN. "For instance, we saw Harding. I might be playing a straight male character flirting with her, but I choose not to pursue a romance. She might get together with Taash. So my perception, my identity has no bearing on their identities and that comes through really strongly."</p><p>When asked if that means it won't take long for romance to become an option in The Veilguard, Busche confirms that you'll be able to start flirting with everyone pretty early, as you recruit all seven companions throughout the first act. But, she clarifies, "it's not until the later parts of the game where you really commit to romance and it gets pretty spicy."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/11/harding-1718064550125.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Lace Harding, who appeared in Dragon Age: Inquisition, will be one of the romanceable companions in The Veilguard. </figcaption></figure></output><h2>Speaking of spicy...</h2><p>Of course, Dragon Age: The Veilguard <em>is</em> a BioWare game, and games from the studio — specifically those in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age series — are known to have some fairly explicit sex scenes. Busche confirms that The Veilguard will be no different, particularly towards the end of the game: "Of course, we are an M-rated game," she says. "We do have nudity."</p><p>There's also some obvious parallels to be made between The Veilguard and last year's critical darling Baldur's Gate 3. The latter became known not only for its deep romances (like The Veilguard, Baldur's Gate 3 player characters can romance any companion regardless of gender or race), but also for its sex scenes, including one involving a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-lets-you-have-sex-with-a-druid-in-bear-form">Wild-Shaping Druid that went pretty viral</a>. </p><p>Busche isn't afraid to admit that she has played Baldur's Gate 3, and loved it, as she's an "an RPG fan through and through": "The more character-driven party-based RPGs with deep emotional connection, the better."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Just like real life, our companions have such diverse personalities. Some of them are more physical, more aggressive.</p></div><p>"What I love about the two games is I think they live side by side in a really interesting way," she continues. "They're very different games, but those emotional connections and how the narratives hook you, I think there's space for both."</p><p>Specifically in regards to the sex scenes and how The Veilguard will handle theirs differently, Busche says some of Baldur's Gate 3's scenes were "shocking and comical in some ways, and I would say I loved that." </p><p>"Our companions, we want them to be relatable and fully realized. So they can get spicy, but in a way that I think people will actually relate to," she says.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Basically:<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-lets-you-have-sex-with-a-druid-in-bear-form"> no bear sex</a>. Busche goes on to say that how sexually explicit the scenes are, too, will vary between characters. </p><p>"Some of them are more spicy than others," she reveals. "Just like real life, our companions have such diverse personalities. Some of them are more physical, more aggressive, and some of them are more... we have a gentleman necromancer, for instance, that is more intimate and sensual."</p><p>Our interview with Busche comes as BioWare continues to roll out information about the highly anticipated Dragon Age sequel, with a cinematic trailer having <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024">dropped at the Xbox Showcase</a> over the weekend.

Only the citizens or weaponry on the first liberated planet is likely to be saved, the Major Order reads. Both planets are currently held by the Automatons, Helldivers 2's terrifying robot enemy faction.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MAJOR ORDER: Helldivers, a difficult decision lies ahead.

And while this is all just a bit of fun, already the community is stressing over what to do.</p><p>“We can create more kids, we need the mines now,” reads a post from one player. “We're never getting those mines….” said another. Some are even suggesting Arrowhead is hiding some secret reward behind saving the children, although that doesn’t sound like a very Super Earth thing to do.</p><p>Given how hardcore Helldivers 2 players have struggled to shepherd the wider player base in a single direction for previous Major Orders, there’s a risk here that neither planet is liberated, which would be awful for everyone. Perhaps there’s time for both to be saved.

Both should hit on Thursday, June 31.</p><p>This week is a big one for Helldivers 2 and Arrowhead, which recently revealed it was in the process of setting the studio up so it could “make more and better stuff” in the long-term. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d2pozq/hello_fellow_helldivers_greetings_from_the_newly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an introductory post on reddit</u></a>, new CEO Shams Jorjani, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs"><u>who recently replaced previous Arrowhead CEO and now current Chief Creative Officer Johan Pilestedt</u></a>, said the studio has had to adjust to the enormous success Helldivers 2 has brought to the company.</p><p>Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks since going on sale earlier this year. Amid the huge revenue Helldivers 2 has generated, Arrowhead itself has suffered a number of crises, including launch server problems and, most recently, a battle with Sony itself over the console maker’s controversial attempt to force Steam players to account link to PlayStation Network.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lego-horizon-adventures-shows-even-playstation-knows-growth-lies-beyond-your-own-platform-opinion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>A Sony IP on a Nintendo device shows increasing platform holder efforts to reach new audiences</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The unveiling of Lego Horizon Adventures was not a surprise. As is often the case around major debuts, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-rumoured-lego-horizon-game-reportedly-coming-day-one-to-pc-ps5">hints and details had leaked out</a> in the days before.</p>
<p>What was surprising, however, was that not only is the game coming to PlayStation 5 and PC (as expected), but it is also coming to Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Let's take a moment to process that: a PlayStation-owned IP on a Nintendo platform.</p>
<p>As far as I can Google, such a thing has not occurred in decades – not since, as <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> head Christopher Dring reminded me, Wipeout 64. Yes, Sony's MLB The Show is also available for Switch as well as Xbox, but that's a licensed title rather than a property PlayStation owns.</p>
<p>Lego Horizon Adventures may not have been the biggest blockbuster with which to open Summer Game Fest, but it's perhaps the most symbolic reveal we've seen throughout this year's array of showcases: seeing PlayStation IP coming to a Nintendo console is almost akin to Mario and Sonic appearing in the same game, both of which the '90s child in me sees as a sign of peace between the major players in the console war of that era.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, there was a lot of discussion around Microsoft going multiplatform, with simple <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-reportedly-bringing-indiana-jones-and-starfield-to-ps5-and-switch">rumours that Starfield and Indiana Jones were coming to PS5</a> escalating into full-blown conspiracies that Xbox was going to stop making consoles (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-bringing-four-games-to-other-consoles#:~:text=Microsoft%20is%20still%20working%20on%20hardware%20for%20the%20future%2C%20saying%20the%20focus%20for%20the%20next%20generation%20is%20%22delivering%20the%20largest%20technical%20leap%20you%20will%20ever%20have%20seen%20in%20a%20hardware%20generation.%22">it isn't</a>).</p>
<p>It transpired that Microsoft was bringing just <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-bringing-four-games-to-other-consoles">four games to other consoles</a>, and they <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-announces-slate-of-four-titles-launching-on-non-xbox-systems">weren't exactly flagship titles</a>. Starfield and Indiana Jones are still bound for Xbox and PC only as far as we're aware (for now?), while some of the firm's upcoming titles, like the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-new-gears-of-war-and-doom-headline-xbox-showcase-2024">newly-announced Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, will also come to PS5. In fact, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/06/xbox-you-are-going-to-see-more-of-our-games-on-more-platforms">Pure Xbox</a> reports that, during an on-stage interview at IGN Live on Sunday, Microsoft gaming CEO Phil Spencer said: "You are going to see more of our games on more platforms."</p>
<p>The point is, as we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/does-it-make-sense-for-xbox-to-bring-its-games-to-playstation-microcast">discussed</a> <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/will-xbox-publishing-on-rival-consoles-spark-a-revolution-opinion">at</a> <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/multiplatform-microsoft-and-a-very-different-future-for-consoles-this-week-in-business">length</a> earlier this year, there are a myriad reasons why it makes sense for Microsoft to release select titles on other platforms: the need to reach more players, the limits of its own install base, growing its brand to grow its ecosystem. Much the same applies to PlayStation.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/lego-horizon-adventures-tallneck.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sony has already <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/12-live-service-games-usd300m-pc-sales-aggressive-mobile-strategy-playstation-lays-out-its-plans">openly discussed</a> its plans to grow both its audience and its revenue with a string of PC ports for its blockbuster hits – including both Horizon titles – as well as upcoming but as-yet-unannounced mobile titles. After a few years of ports, PC is working out nicely for PlayStation with president and COO Hiroki Totoki telling investors earlier this year that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-seeking-growth-by-bringing-more-first-party-games-to-other-platforms">Sony will be doubling down on this strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Bringing your previously-exclusive titles to other platforms has many benefits: it reaches new audiences, raises awareness of your brands, gains you insight into what does and doesn't work with those communities.</p>
<p>Even for a market leader like Sony, growth is limited on their own platform. PS5 may be the most profitable PlayStation to date, but its sales have been tracking behind the PS4 – and a PC port reaches those who might be interested but lack the required hardware.</p>
<p>So, with Sony already reaching PC and mobile, targeting Nintendo with Lego Horizon Adventures makes perfect sense once the initial shock has worn off.</p>
<p>For starters, the Switch represents a sizeable audience at over 140 million units sold – more than 20 million more than the PlayStation 4, which still represents <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-5-now-represents-50-of-sonys-active-console-base">50% of Sony's active audience</a>, and more than double the PS5's current sales.</p>
<p>For another thing, it's a <em>different </em>audience (and arguably more so than PC). Nintendo has historically always attracted a family audience including a lot of younger players, often more successfully than Sony has. This likely explains why the debut of a PlayStation IP on Switch is a Lego spin-off, as opposed to a mainline entry. It's also more feasible to create something new that looks in keeping with other Switch titles than trying to port a PS5 powerhouse to Nintendo's more limited device.</p>
<p>And using Nintendo platforms to bring your IP to a broader, more family-focused audience isn't even a new thing. Microsoft expressly said <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-hopes-ds-helps-viva-pi-ata-reach-broader-audience">this was the reason it was bringing Viva Pinata to DS</a> way back in 2008.</p>
<p>It's also fascinating that PlayStation has opted to take a new Nintendo-like direction with one of its mature franchises. While Horizon isn't as violent as, say, The Last of Us, it is heavy with its brooding protagonist and story of environmental apocalypse; this makes it an interesting choice given the more obvious fit for a Nintendo audience would be the likes of Astro Bot (which happens to have a new game out this September), Sackboy, Tearaway or perhaps Ratchet &amp; Clank.</p>
<p>PlayStation's targeting of Nintendo's audience speaks to a trend we've seen growing in recent years: all three platform holders are increasingly trying to reach different demographics by looking beyond their own ecosystems.</p>
<p>Xbox, which has always brought its games to PC, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-mobile-store-to-launch-this-summer">will reach mobile this summer</a> in addition to targeting PlayStation gamers (a similar audience to Xbox) with select titles. Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-mobile-strategy-is-about-reaching-new-audiences">still dabbles in mobile</a> to reach more casual players; for example, a recent Super Mario Run event was used to promote Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. And now, in addition to PC, PlayStation is prioritising the growth opportunities available via the Switch over its historic rivalry with Nintendo (granted, Nintendo removed itself from direct competition with other consoles with the Wii in 2006).</p>
<p>And it's not just about bringing games to other consoles. As former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden told us <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/where-will-you-be-playing-games-in-the-future-ign-live-2024">during our IGN Live panel</a> on Sunday, the total console userbase has been hovering around the 200 million to 250 million mark for multiple generations now, only briefly exceeding this during the Wii's heyday.</p>
<p>This means to grow your brand, to grow your audience, you need to look beyond not just your own consoles and those of your rivals, but into other forms of entertainment. Xbox has the Halo TV series, while its subsidiary Bethesda had a smash hit this year with the Fallout show on Amazon Prime. Nintendo has the biggest animated movie of the year in 2023 with Mario's cinematic outing. These grow brands and attract new audiences in ways no amount of video game spin-offs could manage.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lego Horizon Adventures on Switch demonstrates how the landscape has changed; there are now gates between the walled gardens</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Sony has been trying to broaden Horizon's reach for years. The Call of the Mountain spin-off was the headline launch title for PlayStation VR 2 last year, and there are already a range of transmedia products and merchandise available – from the Titan-published comics series and the special edition Lego sets (showing a pre-established relationship between Lego and Aloy) to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-tv-series-called-horizon-2074">animated Netflix series that's in the works</a>.</p>
<p>Back in the real of video games, it's unclear how much of a precedent this particular title will set. Lego Horizon Adventures coming to Switch doesn't necessarily mean the first two Horizon games are coming to Xbox – putting a family-friendly spin-off on a console with over 100 million players, many of whom have flocked to Lego games, makes more sense than porting Aloy's blockbuster adventures to a device with less than half the audience (and an audience that is likely less family-orientated). It's worth highlighting that even this Lego spin-off isn't coming to Microsoft's consoles.</p>
<p>Nor does all this mean that Nintendo will follow suit by putting Mario spin-offs on PlayStation or Xbox. The 150 million or so players these two ecosystems represents holds less growth potential than making movies and mobile games that appeal to a far larger audience.</p>
<p>PlayStation and particularly Nintendo will continue to protect and prioritise their own platforms – after all, these are their primary sources of revenue. But Lego Horizon Adventures on Switch does at least demonstrate how the landscape has changed; there are now gates between the walled gardens.</p>
<p>It's also premature to declare the death of the exclusives. There is room for both multiformat games and console exclusives, and PlayStation's current strategy still centres around 'killer apps' to draw people to its ecosystem. But while its flagship games remain the biggest attractor to PlayStation – case in point: Astro Bot, a game that fully demonstrates the technical wizardry of the DualSense controllers – the brand extensions, like a Lego spin-off, can serve to introduce the IP to new audiences that companies would otherwise be incapable of reaching.</p>
<p>Will Lego Horizon Adventures drive Switch owners to buy a PS5 or a beefy PC, and pick up Aloy's full-scale adventures? Time will tell. But you can bet Sony will be watching the performance of this title closely. When we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jim-ryan-i-would-love-a-world-where-hundreds-of-millions-will-enjoy-our-games">spoke to former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan in 2021</a>, he talked about how Sony was interested in finding ways to reach hundreds of millions of players with its games. Taking its brands beyond PlayStation consoles is essential to accomplishing this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/06/11/arcane-season-2-which-will-be-the-final-chapter-gets-a-new-teaser-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Netflix had released a new trailer for Season 2 of <em>Arcane</em>, the hit animated series set in the League of Legends universe. Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show's last.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AEbfiLaOdJA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Season 2 is billed as "the final chapter" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will be concluding, Christian Link stated during a LoL dev update released earlier today that it won't be the last animated story set in the franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<em>Arcane</em> is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," said Linke. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of <em>Arcane</em> wraps up with this second season. But <em>Arcane</em> is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”</p>

The introduction of proper, full-blooded endurance races that take a fair bit of time to wrap up and force the player to consider their tire compound, fuel economy, and other such items has got to be a permanent addition though, right? Well, no, because <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-is-insistent-on-not-adding-permanent-new-career-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Forza Motorsport</em> absolutely insists that all of its post-launch content has <em>got</em> to be time-limited</a>.

Had <em>Forza Motorsport</em> simply kept around even just one half of its monthly events instead of permanently removing them from the game with each new update, it would by now have one of the biggest, most varied career modes of all modern simcade racing titles. But, here we are, with Update 9’s admittedly impressive roster of endurance races coming out with a <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-update-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sunsetting timer attached by default</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">The fact that endurance events are being done dirty in such a manner, then, does put a hefty dampener on Update 9’s flagship feature: the Sebring International Raceway track. This comes after Update 8 did not have a new race track attached to it, making the release of a legendary new raceway that much more important for the game’s long-term health and variety.</p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true">Update 9 also introduces some minor tweaks to the Laguna Seca and Nürburgring Nordschleife tracks, improving their real-world accuracy, as well as the option to disable temporal anti-aliasing on PC. The VRAM use estimator, too, has been updated to be useful, as Turn 10 is actively looking into the shift timing problem that has persisted up until now on PC.</p>
 <p data-characters="604" data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true">There is one last thing that could either prove to be a big nothingburger or yet another point of contention for the community: <em>Forza Motorsport</em>‘s Update 9 is the first piece of post-launch content to come with a purchasable DLC attached to it. Notably, the game’s Car Pass DLC is now done and dusted, but Turn 10 seemingly aims to continue releasing bonus vehicles as the game goes on. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2921330/Forza_Motorsport_Porsche_963_Combo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The new Porsche 963 Combo DLC</a>, for example, includes the titular racing car and a Porsche racing suit for the low, low price of $4,99. Granted, you <em>can</em> claim this DLC at absolutely no charge until June 19.</p>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">Note that <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> has already nurtured a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-horizon-5-turns-into-forza-motorsport-new-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">steady cadence</a> of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-horizon-5s-retrowave-season-brings-us-minecraft-cosmetics-a-new-radio-station-and-hyundai-n-vision-74/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLC-locked cars</a> on top of its timed content structure, which can get expensive if you’re out to collect all or most of them. Whereas <em>Horizon</em> usually nets you at least a handful of cars for $4,99, though, <em>Motorsport</em>‘s first outing of this type is far, far weaker in comparison. Interesting times ahead, for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/avowed-director-say-they-feel-sense-of-security-under-microsoft/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=avowed-director-say-they-feel-sense-of-security-under-microsoft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="485" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden closure of Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog Games, and Roundhouse Studios</a> has understandably left many worried about the future of Microsoft’s other internal studios, such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-outer-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds</a></em> developer Obsidian Entertainment. Perhaps to help dispel fears of Obsidian meeting the same fate, Carrie Patel and Matt Hansen, the director and art director of the upcoming <em>Avowed</em>, have commented on how supportive they feel Microsoft has been throughout development.</p> <p data-characters="680" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">“It’s always sad and it always sucks to see studios close and devs lose their job,” said Patel in a recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-believe-in-living-in-fear-obsidian-talks-avowed-release-date-prospects-and-xbox-studio-closures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> interview. “I really hope all those people land on their feet, because I know our industry is better with them in it.” However, she doesn’t believe in “living in fear,” adding that she feels a “a strong sense of security in being part of Obsidian” and has a lot of trust in Microsoft’s leadership: “I do want to emphasise that Microsoft leadership and Xbox leadership have also been incredible supportive of what we do, how we make games, and [are] very communicative with us as well.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Xbox</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="796" data-injectable="true">Hansen also describes the closures as “unfortunate,” in the Eurogamer interview, but is otherwise “not afraid” about Obsidian’s future under Microsoft. He adds, “The only side effect that I’ve personally felt since Microsoft acquired us is just more support. There’s less unknowns, less financial risk, and so we’re able to take more creative risk—but to do that in a measured way. It’s been a really, really rewarding process.”</p>
 <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">As for <em>Avowed</em> itself, the fantasy RPG saw another new trailer at the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Xbox Games Showcase</a>, and it still otherwise looks like a fun time. It didn’t get a lot of focus, though, and Microsoft hasn’t nailed down an exact release date beyond fall 2024. A blog post from Obsidian did <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/avowed-brelease-date-accidentally-announced-before-swiftly-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mention a November 12 launch</a>, but that date has since been excised. Whether this is simply because it was shared too early or isn’t set in stone is unclear.</p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">While it’s nice to hear Obsidian is being supported well, there’s not much to offer in terms of reassurance after so many layoffs in recent years. Let’s not forget that Microsoft considered <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-hi-fi-rush-destructoid-tango-gameworks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a></em> a success, and yet developer Tango Gameworks was shut down anyway.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/2023-opoy-christian-mccaffrey-revealed-as-madden-25-cover-star/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=2023-opoy-christian-mccaffrey-revealed-as-madden-25-cover-star<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="168" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s now official – superstar Christian McCaffrey will be present on the cases of <em>Madden 25</em> as he has been selected as this year’s cover star athlete.</p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">There were several candidates, and the speculations have been intense during the last few days. However, the results are now in, and EA Sports has undoubtedly picked a suitable candidate. The 49ers running back has been a phenomenal performer over the years and was selected as the OPOY last season.</p> <h2 id="h-christian-mccaffrey-could-certainly-boost-sales-of-madden-25" data-injectable="false">Christian McCaffrey could certainly boost sales of Madden 25</h2> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">2024 will be a big year for EA Sports as far as American Football is concerned. July will witness the launch of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-sports-college-football-25-editions-overview-which-to-buy/">EA Sports College Football 25</a></em>, while Madden 25 is expected to be released globally in August. So far, fans have been waiting for the cover athlete reveal, and Christian McCaffrey is undoubtedly a great choice.</p>
 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">His stocks have risen further following a trade with the 49ers. McCaffrey’s talent was already evident for many years, and especially in 2019, when the man completed 1,000 rushing and 1,000 receiving yards in the same season. This made him only the third athlete to do so, which only shows how unique the achievement is even today.</p> <figure data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">McCaffrey will hope to go one step further next season, after losing to the Kansas City Chiefs at the Superbowl. Last year, he also led the charts in terms of rushing yards, but a victory at the Superbowl will have been remarkable. Hopefully, he will manage to lead his side to the coveted title next year.</p> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="false"><em>Madden 25</em> is currently available for pre-order, and you can choose between the Standard and Digital Deluxe Editions. The latter, while being more expensive, offers a lot of extra goodies and three days of early access. The Digital Deluxe Edition is also part of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-pre-order-ea-sports-college-football-25-prices-standard-edition-deluxe-edition-mvp-bundle/">MVP bundle</a>, which also includes the <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> Digital Deluxe Edition at a discounted price.</p>

<p data-characters="326" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Given that it’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever-made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially the fastest-selling PlayStation game <em>ever</em> made</a>, you’d expect <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s content updates to continue dropping in at a blistering pace. This is no longer the case, however, as Arrowhead Games has <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-discord-key-player-questions-responds-to-growing-balancing-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slowed the updating cadence way down</a> ahead of the hotly anticipated spawn rate fix.</p> <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">“You’ve probably noticed we’ve slowed our cadence of patches,” said Arrowhead Games on Twitter. “Similar to our future approach to Warbonds, this is so we can dedicate more time to each patch to reduce the pressure on our teams, dig into your feedback more, and deliver higher-quality patches.” The wait, thankfully, is almost over, as the big update is dropping in alongside <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-adds-throwing-knives-and-the-very-first-vehicle-customizations-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the new Viper Commandos Premium Warbond</a>.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-fixes-its-biggest-outstanding-issues-on-june-13" data-injectable="false">Helldivers 2 fixes its biggest outstanding issues on June 13</h2> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="706" data-injectable="true">This jots down <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s spawn fix update for release on June 13, or just two days from the publication of this article. Being <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-may-not-be-a-solo-game-but-its-how-i-like-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the questionably efficient solo <em>Helldivers 2</em> player that I am</a>, it’s obvious that my biggest concern is whether the spawn rates are reverted to their previous proper state, but I’m equally thrilled with some of the other improvements slated for this update.</p>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">As per Arrowhead Games’ post on Twitter, we’re looking at over 100 total changes and fixes, with some of the most notable tweaks (aside from the spawn rates) being the visibility of in-game military supply lines and attack origins, the introduction of invite-only fireteam lobbies, Super Samples being available from level 6 onwards, and heaps more. Good stuff all around, no two ways about it.</p>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">“We’re very aware that going from quick, small patches to slower, bigger patches means [the community’s] expectations are higher,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fpatch-note-date-confirmed-v0-eeqyk3nflr5d1.png%3Fwidth%3D637%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Ddbaa4b4e8c2ebe1a80b35cec7b6d99011d839c65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead says</a>. “While we think the next patch is strong, with lots of bug fixes &amp; requested features, we’re definitely not resting on our laurels or being complacent.”</p> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="839" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-community-figures-out-the-invisible-supply-line-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The visibility of supply lines and attack vectors</a>, in particular, is a surprising but most welcome addition. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is filled to the brim with extremely deep but intentionally obtuse features and mechanics that have only been revealing themselves to the players as they engaged with the game. Opening up more of this information to the end user is bound to be a good thing, and the only thing that remains to be seen is exactly <em>how</em> Arrowhead Games has chosen to organize it all in the UI.</p>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">There’s one more thing to keep in mind as the next major update drops in: the Illuminate faction is seemingly looming closer than ever. Hints are dropping in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-cant-take-all-the-illuminate-teases-from-the-devs-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-teases-illuminate-faction-again-following-incident-that-spaghettified-scientists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-turns-meridia-into-black-hole/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meridia’s already been turned into a decidedly strange black hole</a> as part of a recent combat operation. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/why-undocumented-patch-notes-should-be-the-norm-for-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patch notes aren’t the be-all-end-all for Arrowhead Games</a>, after all.</p>

            <p>It took over a month of racing and 220 hours of playtime but a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trackmania">Trackmania</a> player has finally beaten the racing game's most horrendously difficult map. For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-racing-game-players-are-11-days-into-an-exhausting-race-to-climb-a-deadly-tower">last month</a>. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a>. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first to finish was French player Brendan "Bren_TM2" Seve, who <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2166634084?t=01h11m28s">streamed the final run</a> with both his microphone and camera turned off in an effort to focus more fully on the nightmarish final floors. Someone on YouTube has put together a nice compilation of highlights, starting with this hairy moment, in which the racer <a href="https://youtu.be/7gfdteqfMQU?feature=shared&amp;t=59">literally drives along a goddamn wall</a>. The final jump is particularly frightening - a vertical hurtle toward a finish line suspended in mid-air, hanging thousands of kilometres above the starting line. Every jump in Deep Dip 2 seems to require total commitment. But the final one has special tension. After a practice approach, Seve gunned his engines and went for the last leap. He made it. </p>
<p>"I thought I didn't make the last jump, I thought I was lacking speed," he said, coming back on-camera (but not before leaping on his bed and unplugging his own headset in the heat of the moment). "I'm shaking like crazy. We're done." </p>
<p>"I'm so happy," said Seve. "I'm so relieved... The last jump, I was afraid I would go down without having enough speed. This is insane. I'm so happy... I've never been so stressed playing Trackmania ever."</p>
<p>The player was met with a congratulations message from the map's makers. "Congratulations, you've done it!" said the audio message. "The metaphorical Everest. You made it to the top. You were willing to fail and because of that, you have achieved something not many will accomplish. You have conquered Deep Dip 2... Now go celebrate, you've earned it."</p>
<p>Seve takes away half of the prize pool, over $15,000, leaving the remaining money for others to follow. The second prize has since been nabbed by Czech player Filip "eLconn21" Šprungl, whose own final run <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2166588703?t=05h45m00s">was also broadcasted on Twitch</a> not long afterwards. He'll take home the second prize of about $9000.</p>
<p>While the third place is still up for grabs, according to <a href="https://deepdip2.com/leaderboard">the leaderboards</a>, the map will soon be broken down into separate floors so that any player can try each floor for themselves. </p>
<p>This is the second time Seve has won such a competition, having beaten the previous Deep Dip as well. He said the feeling of beating this one was "better than the first" although he did admit it wasn't happy hiking all the time, as you might expect from a gruelling month-long challenge broadcast to thousands of people every day.</p>
<p>"I'm so glad I'm not on floor three right now, sweating," he said.</p>
<p>That difficulty and stress set in for a lot of the racers, with some wondering out loud if the course was too difficult. One of the racers, "Wirtual", <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/they-have-been-racing-for-a-month">gave up on the 14th floor</a>. Which sounds like the action of a real quitter. Until you recognise this same player once completed Trackmania blindfolded. That's how hard this course was. Whether a Deep Dip 3 continues the trend some day in the long-running <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> racing game, we'll have to wait and see. For now, Wirtual has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULDE0D6wPnk">a thorough run-down of the month-long event</a> that is worth a watch if you want absolutely all the ups and downs. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176047/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-preparation-achievements-completed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="6ID6xa"><em>Elden Ring</em>’s upcoming <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> expansion <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24079161/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-preorder-guide-standard-deluxe-premium-collectors-edition">is less than two weeks from its June 21 release date</a> — so if you want to play it immediately upon launch, you’ll want to get to work now. That’s because there are some requirements to play <em>Shadow of the Erdtree.</em> You don’t need to have completed the game, but you <em>do</em> need to have beaten two specific bosses to enter <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s Shadow Realm: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">Starscourge Radahn</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Mohg, Lord of Blood</a>.</p>
<p id="sSRXEM">“Friendly PSA for all those looking forward to #ELDENRING Shadow of the Erdtree,” publisher Bandai Namco <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1800330011171496440">posted to X</a>. “You have less than 2 weeks to prepare!”</p>

<p id="AwAokG">Don’t fret if you <em>aren’t</em> fully prepared; you can take comfort in the fact that there are plenty of people right there with you. Each of these bosses has an achievement tied to them: Shardbearer Radahn and Shardbearer Mohg, respectively. By tracking those achievements on each platform, we can see the percentage of people who are — and <em>aren’t </em>— ready for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. Let’s break down the numbers.</p>
<h3 id="Tqghve"><strong>Shardbearer Radahn</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li id="r4QpEO">
<em>Windows PC via Steam </em>— 54.5% of players have the achievement, so roughly 45% of people <em>haven’t</em> beaten the boss</li>
<li id="4vsXoS">
<em>PlayStation 5</em> — 46.6% of players have the achievement, so around 53% of people have yet to beat Radahn</li>
<li id="sfvZSI">
<em>Xbox Series X</em> — 32.8% of players have this achievement, so roughly 67% of players need to beat Radahn</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Zqmo9q"><strong>Shardbearer Mohg</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li id="sUqQ0f">
<em>Windows PC via Steam </em>— 38.7% of people have the achievement, so around 61% of people still need to beat Mohg</li>
<li id="be04sL">
<em>PlayStation 5</em> — 34.7% of people have the achievement, so around 65% of people haven’t beaten the boss</li>
<li id="9Cbyho">
<em>Xbox Series X</em> —22.8% of players have this achievement, so around 77% of players need to beat Mohg</li>
</ul>
<p id="0nZXRO">Xbox players have a lot of catching up to do! There are likely a whole bunch of people who haven’t beaten either boss, which makes the task even harder. But on average, 55% of players still need to beat Radahn, while an average of 68% of players still need to take on Mohg.</p>
<p id="mZ79Hp">Of course, these numbers are likely a little skewed by people who bought the game but barely played it; on Steam, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23054151/roundtable-hold-npcs-encounters">just 77.8% of people reached <em>Elden Ring</em>’s Roundtable Hold</a>, which is basically the player hub. We can assume that the 22% of Steam players who stopped before reaching the Roundtable Hold probably won’t pick up <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> — or, maybe, it’ll be their welcome back to the world.</p>
<p id="1BkrzK">There’s very little in <em>Elden Ring</em> that’s easy, so if you’re looking for help in your <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> prep, head over to Polygon’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">Starscourge Radahn</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Mogh, Lord of Blood</a> guides.</p>

Evenly split between the Spider heroes, these are new takes on Spidey suits designed from the ground up by KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. Check them out—along with some notes from each designer!</p><p><strong>Metro Suit</strong> (Miles Morales) – Designed by KidSuper</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><p>Fashion designer, Colm Dillane, AKA KidSuper, created the Metro suit for Miles Morales, which comes with additional variant suit styles: red on black, classic Spidey, and teal on purple. KidSuper not only partnered with us to make these suits, but he also worked closely with our special guests to design their suits!</p><p>KidSuper’s Comment: “The puffer design you often see in my KidSuper collections and the exclusive ‘original’ colorway! We came up with designs that felt super original, like something only we could pull off.”</p><p><strong>Ginga Suit</strong> (Miles Morales) – Co-Designed by Vini Jr. and KidSuper</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Professional Football player Vini Jr. wears his inspiration on his sleeve. A love letter to Brazil and the beautiful, global game of Football, the Ginga suit features a design and default colorway reminiscent of both: a sporty look for Miles Morales with a black, green, yellow, and blue shader. Of course, this suit also features added styles: red on black, classic, and gold on white.</p><p>Vini Jr.’s Comment: “I wanted it to be a celebration of Brazil’s culture and people. I just love the overall design because it has the energy and <a title="Genres > Action [1,925 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> that I associate Spider-Man with, but it’s beautifully mixed with some Brazilian flair. Which makes this suit super special and different from others.”</p><p><strong>Fluro Suit</strong> (Peter Parker) – Co-Designed by Lando Norris and KidSuper </p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>Motorsports phenom Lando Norris is all about moving fast. Paired with the high-speed action of <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>, Norris’ suit reflects the pace—wholly inspired by <a title="Genres > Racing [185 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a>, complete with a helmet and overalls familiar to those who burn rubber across global circuits. The Fluro Suit features its own suit styles with some variants such as a classic color scheme, white on black, and pink on blue.</p><p>Lando Norris’ Comment: “The main inspiration for the design was the feeling of speed. I also wanted to incorporate racing elements and materials like carbon, along with my trademark Fluro colour, which you can see throughout the suit. The carbon style effect on the suit is my favourite.”</p><p><strong>Motorchic Suit</strong> (Peter Parker) – Co-Designed by Rina Sawayama and KidSuper</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>Singer/Actress/Model Rina Sawayama delivers a badass motorbike look to Spidey’s locker. Decked out in all leather, the Motorchic suit gives Peter Parker a revved-up design unique from any other in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. The suit features other variants as well: a classic color scheme, black, and gold.</p><p>Rina Sawayama’s Comment: “I really wanted to explore my love of fashion whilst making this suit and what we ended up with I think encapsulates that, it’s fun, practical, edgy and chic. I personally love the metal detailing across the suit, it still feels like what I envision as classic Spider-Man but adds a more rugged feel. It looks pretty heavy duty and like it would stand up very well in combat!”</p><h2><span>Legacy Suits</span></h2><p>We’re also thrilled to announce four fan-favorite legacy suits from <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> and <em><a title="Games > Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales [29 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/marvels-spider-man-miles-morales">Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a></em> are being added to the game! Based on community requests, these four suits are being retrofitted for <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>, including two for Peter and two for Miles. See what’s in store below!</p><p><strong>Last Stand Suit</strong> (Peter Parker)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>Donning a red leather jacket, the Last Stand suit is a highly requested fan favorite coming to <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>! Now updated with our suit styles, the Last Stand suit gets a more classic variant, full black, and an Arachno-Man-inspired yellow and green. </p><p><strong>Into The Spider-Verse</strong> (Peter Parker)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>Inspired by Peter B. Parker’s design in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, this iconic look adds a Spider-verse flare to Peter Parker’s wardrobe. Enable the Film Style Animation mode via visual settings to get an even more authentic, filmic look!</p><p><strong>Animated Suit</strong> (Miles Morales) </p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>Miles gets a little animated. We’re adding Miles Morales’ Animated suit to <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>. This suit is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old.</p><p><strong>Uptown Pride Suit</strong> (Miles Morales)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_008.jpg"></a></figure><p>Complete with a gold trim, the Uptown Pride suit is a beloved favorite from <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> that’s making its way to <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>! This time, the Uptown Pride Suit gets added colorways: silver trim, black on red, and blue on pink. </p><h2><span>Stability Fixes</span></h2><p>Finally, our latest update brings stability fixes to the game and addresses some player feedback, such as the ability to swap out your parry and traversal abilities from the Symbiote to Spider Arms, and vice versa. This update, version 1.003.000, will be available on June 18th, so keep an eye out for it!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Roach says the informant is wandering the streets of Akila City and tells you to use the bounty-scanner to identify the target. To use the bounty-scanner, simply press the normal keybind for your scanner that you would use when looking for resources on a planet. With the scanner out, hover over different people you see in the world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4316860-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.06.10-14.01.43.86.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316860" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4316860-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.06.10-14.01.43.86.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316860"></a><figcaption>Using the bounty-scanner to find Adrastos.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4316860-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.06.10-14.01.43.86.png"></figure><p>When the target you're looking for gets caught in your crosshairs, they'll be outlined in red. When hovering over a red target, you can see their name and their bounty on the screen. You want to have your scanner open the entire time when looking for Adrastos, otherwise the quest won't progress if you happen to find him.</p><p>With your scanner out, you need to head to the right from the Trackers Alliance HQ. Adrastos is normally located directly behind The Rock bar on the eastern side of Akila City. I found Adrastos leaning up against a wall right near the tarped area of the city, as you can see in the map screenshot below. However, depending on how long it takes you to find Adrastos, he may move to a different area. After reloading a few saves, though, Adrastos never drifted too far from the location on the map below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4316858-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.06.10-14.01.56.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316858" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4316858-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.06.10-14.01.56.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316858"></a><figcaption>Adrastos' location in Akila City. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4316858-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.06.10-14.01.56.36.png"></figure><p>If you're having no luck finding Adrastos in this area, I suggest reloading a save from inside the Trackers Alliance HQ and trying the mission again. It's also important to remember to always have your scanner open when trying to identify Adrastos.</p><p>After finding him, you can now interrogate Adrastos with Roach. There are some clever lines of dialogue in this conversation, but the main goal of the exchange is to make Adrastos tell you where Hannibal and the Chop Shop are.
