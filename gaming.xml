			<p>Today, ArenaNet announced the release date for Repentance, the second free update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-finally-launched-bringing-in-housing-mechanism-new-raids-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds</a>. The content patch is scheduled to go live on public servers on Tuesday, March 11th, introducing a host of new rewards and challenging activities for players of the MMORPG, as well as a new map, the Mistburned Barrens.</p>
<p>Deep within the ruins of Bava Nisos lies the Mists Gate, which brought the otherworldly titans to Tyria. Players will delve into the secrets of the mysterious Mursaat, long a source of legend dating back to the original Guild Wars, and confront their arcane experiments that have left their lands riven with spectral torment and bloodstone magic.</p>
<p>Repentance will feature a variety of new rewards, including a new weapon and armor set, six new relics to enhance character builds, an update to the Wizards Vault, new mini-pets, and new homestead recipes to be earned through in-game achievements. A new Mursaat Shadowcraft mastery track will help players explore the far reaches of Repentance.</p>

<p>In addition, the Titan Greer will be added to the Janthir Wilds Convergence gameplay mode, beginning an alternating boss rotation for players to test their mettle in the challenging 50-player activity. A more difficult challenge mode will be available in the Mount Balrior raid (first introduced in the November content update), with the most prestigious rewards available to players who complete it. Following the release of Repentance and the previous launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arenanet-to-release-godspawn-update-for-guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-on-november-19-featuring-new-50-player-titan-battle-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godspawn update</a>, ArenaNet plans to release a third and final free content update for Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds before moving on to the next expansion.</p>
<p>As we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-qa-arenanet-on-switch-to-yearly-expansions-secrets-of-the-obscure-learnings-and-2024-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our exclusive late 2023 interview</a>, ArenaNet has switched to a yearly release plan for expansions. As such, fans can expect a new Guild Wars 2 expansion to land in the latter half of 2025.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-star-leap-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami-finally-announces-a-new-suikoden-game-sort-of.1124703/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-star-leap-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has finally announced a new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>series after thirteen years, but&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>might not be what you want it to be.</p>

<p>During a&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-program-march-3rd-announced" rel="nofollow">news broadcast</a> held earlier today, Konami revealed that&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>will be a free-to-play mobile RPG, although it will be set in the main&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>timeline, so it won't be an alternate-history spinoff or anything like that.</p>

<p>The game will take place a few years after&nbsp;the events of&nbsp;<em>Suikoden V</em>, which itself served as a prequel to the original game. That, of course, also means that we might well see some of both games' characters appearing in&nbsp;<em>Star Leap</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suikoden-star-leap-mobile-rpg-viki.jpg?itok=bjiUk453 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suikoden-star-leap-mobile-rpg-viki.jpg?itok=02oowrx5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Familiar faces may well be making an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, one of the screenshots shown on the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/suikoden/star_leap/us/en-us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a> for&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>appears to show Viki, a recurring character who serves as your method of fast travel in every mainline&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>game to date.</p>

<p>Of course, Viki is heavily implied to be able to travel through time as well as through space, so her presence here probably shouldn't come as a shock. It does, however, reinforce that this isn't just a spinoff, but a game that wants to take its place alongside the main series.</p>

<p>The trailer for the game also appears to show Gregminster, the capital city of the Toran Republic and one of the key locations in the original&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>(as well as the site of a brief but memorable stopover in the sequel).</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>right here. Honestly, I know it's a mobile RPG, but the art style and overall presentation has me cautiously excited for it.</p>




<p>According to Konami,&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>will be a free-to-play game with "in-game purchases", although the studio doesn't say what form those purchases will take. I hate to say it, but&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>is ripe for some kind of character gacha mechanic, so that's probably what it'll be.</p>

<p>In addition to&nbsp;<em>Star Leap</em>, Konami is also gearing up to release remasters of the first two&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>games, which are due to land later this week, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> beyond their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-and-suikoden-2-remaster-confirmed-for-2023" rel="nofollow">original release window</a> of 2023.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out those remasters when they launch on March 6th across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932640/Suikoden_III_HD_Remaster_Gate_Rune_and_Dunan_Unification_Wars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/JP0101-PPSA18305_00-SUIKODENREMASTER" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/suikoden-iii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-pre-order-bonus/9P9FM62WZXR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive at some point in the future on iOS and Android, although we don't know when yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-patch-10-04-notes-new-duelist-waylay-balance-changes-map-pool-rotation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>VALORANT Patch 10.04 is officially live, and since it goes hand-in-hand <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-ditches-episodes-for-yearly-season-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a new Act</a>, it means that it’s a big one. The latest patch adds a dynamic, potentially game-breaking new duelist agent, major balance changes to existing agents, and some key changes to map pool.</p>



<p>Let’s dive into the full list of updates now live as of VALORANT Patch 10.04.</p>



<h2 id="h-welcome-to-the-waylay-era">Welcome to the Waylay Era</h2>



<p>Waylay is the newest addition to the duelist class, and this new light-bending duelist from Thailand has “broken” written all over her. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-pros-say-the-next-duelist-will-be-an-even-more-annoying-jett/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The pros weren’t lying when they said she could replace Jett</a>, or be just as annoying. Her kit is designed to disrupt, hinder, and surprise enemy players.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Waylay Official Gameplay Reveal // VALORANT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/njK6KgRNr2k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Here are each of the abilities for Waylay, the newest VALORANT duelist:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Refract</strong>: Create a light beacon on the floor. Reactivate to return to the beacon, traveling as an invulnerable mote of pure light. This is like a stationary Yoru Gatecrash, but it affords the opportunity to gather info before returning to the starting point.</li>



<li><strong>Light Speed</strong>: It’s a Jett double dash. Waylay’s Light Speed can be used to jump over walls or push deep into a site during an execute. There are going to be so many highlight plays from this one.</li>



<li><strong>Saturate</strong>: Throw a cluster of light that explodes when it hits the ground, applying the Hinder effect to nearby players. Hinder slows enemy fire rate, recoil recovery, equip time, reload speed, movement speed, and jump speed.</li>



<li><strong>Convergent Paths</strong>: Waylay’s ultimate ability. Project a beam of light forward, which after a delay, applies Waylay with a speed boost and applies Hinder to enemies caught in the beam.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-valorant-10-04-balance-changes">VALORANT 10.04 Balance Changes</h2>



<p>Clove, Tejo, Iso, and Deadlock are the primary recipients of this patch’s balance changes. In this section, we dive into the major changes made to each of those four agents.</p>



<h3 id="h-clove">Clove</h3>



<p>Meddle, Clove’s Decay-applying throwable, now explodes 0.75 seconds after hitting the ground, instead of just a 1.3 second delay. The cooldown on their Ruse smokes has increased from 30 seconds to 40. Pick Me Up’s health buff duration has increased from eight seconds to 10, but the move speed durations drops from eight seconds to just three.</p>



<h3 id="h-deadlock">Deadlock</h3>



<p>GravNet is now Deadlock’s signature ability, costing no money at the start of the round and receiving a 40 second rechargeable cooldown. GravNet’s size has slightly decreased from 16m to 13m. Barrier Mesh now costs 400 credits.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-iso">Iso</h3>



<p>Iso now only gets one charge of his Undercut, but it now applies Suppression along with Vulnerability. The tagging on Double Tap has been changed, so he is now slowed more when his shield breaks. Iso will always have Double Tap applied now when he wins a duel in his Kill Contract ultimate.</p>



<h3 id="h-tejo">Tejo</h3>



<p>Tejo’s Guided Salvo missiles deal 65 points of damage and deal half damage to non-player objects. This changes has been made so that Tejo’s Guided Salvo does not successfully destroy Killjoy’s Lockdown.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-10-04-map-changes">VALORANT 10.04 Map Changes</h2>



<p>With the start of the new act, the VALORANT map pool is getting a change. <strong>Ascent and Icebox are back in</strong> the Competitive and Deathmatch queues, while <strong>Abyss and Bind are being taken out</strong>. Ascent is returning with a big change: the infamous B Main wall that players spam through with the Odin has been reinforced. Riot noted that all the spamming at this spot was “creating unhealthy gameplay and frustrating experiences.”</p>

                <p>Acclaim, an iconic game publisher from the 1990s behind series like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nba-jam/" data-ref-id="5000-2852">NBA Jam</a>, has been revived as an indie-game publisher.</p><p>Acclaim was founded in 1987 and made a name for itself in many ways. It was known for licensed games, ranging from NBA Jam to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/justice-league-task-force/" data-ref-id="5000-16280">Justice League Task Force</a>, being the console publisher for arcade classics like Mortal Kombat, and its wild marketing stunts promoting games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/turok-evolution/" data-ref-id="5000-4168">Turok: Evolution</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shadow-man-2econd-coming/" data-ref-id="5000-3729">Shadow Man: 2econd Coming</a>. After several high-profile flops like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bmx-xxx/" data-ref-id="5000-4220">BMX XXX</a>, Acclaim filed for bankruptcy in 2004 and had been defunct--until now.</p><p>Companies like Striker Entertainment, Ridge Partners, Global Force Entertainment, VaynerFund, and JET Management have all come together to revive Acclaim as a game publisher that will "support indie developers and reignite classic franchises." It plans to provide funding, marketing, and PR support for any independent developers it works with. This new version of Acclaim is following in Atari's footsteps; Atari has also revitalized itself in recent years and reimagined classic titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-revisits-an-arcade-classic-with-breakout-beyond/1100-6529212/" data-ref-id="1100-6529212">Breakout</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-and-polybius-creator-are-reimagining-the-rare-arcade-game-i-robot/1100-6529425/" data-ref-id="1100-6529425">I, Robot.</a></p><p>It's unclear what specific franchises this new version of Acclaim has ownership over, as this initial announcement is more focused on confirming members of its new leadership team, like CEO Alex Jose. That also includes Jeff Jarrett, a Hall of Fame wrestler who worked with the old version of Acclaim on its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwf-attitude/" data-ref-id="5000-2348">WWF titles</a>. "Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved," Jarrett said of the revival in a press release.</p><p>No new games were announced alongside this revival of Acclaim, although Josef teased that the company has "already signed some incredible titles, which we'll be revealing soon."</p>

                <p>A Gears of War collection is reportedly going to be announced this summer with a PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S release. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">Gears of War: E-Day</a> also reportedly is targeting a 2026 release window.</p><p>According to leaker ExTas1s, Microsoft is reportedly going to reveal a Gears of War collection during the upcoming Xbox Games Showcase in June. While the exact games in the rumored collection are unknown, it's likely going to at least include the first three, although the spin-off Gears of War: Judgment could be part of the package too.

Microsoft is reportedly having the Gears of War collection fill in the release calendar this year as E-Day isn't ready for launch yet.

            <p>Acclaim, the publisher behind hundreds of classic games from the 80s and 90s, is set to be revived.</p>
<p>The company closed back in 2004 as it filed for bankruptcy, but will now return to support indie developers and "reignite classic franchises" from its portfolio of IP.</p>
<p>Acclaim was known in the 90s for game adaptations of familiar franchises, from WWF (now WWE) and The Simpsons, to movie tie-ins like Alien 3, Judge Dredd and Batman Forever, to comic book games like Spider-Man and Wolverine.</p>

<p>It also published the likes of the controversial Mortal Kombat games and Theme Park. Then, in the late 90s, it was prolific for publishing N64 games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok">Turok</a>, Extreme-G, Shadow Man, and the South Park FPS.</p>
<p>As well as resurrecting its old franchises, the company will be offering funding, marketing, and PR support to indie studios.</p>
<p>The newly-revived publisher has an advisory board of industry leaders, including "licensing icons, professional athletes, living music legends and season veterans who have defined the intersection of video games and pop culture". That includes two-time Hall of Fame wrestler Jeff Jarrett.</p>
<p>"For more than three decades, I've had the privilege to have been a part of both the wrestling and gaming universes, and I'm thrilled to now be a partner in the revival of Acclaim, an iconic publisher known for releasing some of the most legendary games of the '80s and '90s," said Jarrett.</p>
<p>"From my early involvement with the publisher's hit 16-bit WWF titles to my experience helping shape the TNA Wrestling series, which spawned the first video game wrestler to become a full-time roster member in the Squared Circle, I've seen firsthand the type of impact great games can have on players and fans. Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved."</p>
<p>Acclaim was originally founded in 1987, publishing a number of NES and Game Boy games. However, sales of its games declined in the early '00s which led to a number of studio closures across the UK. Eventually the company closed in August 2004, closing all of its facilities and terminating all employees at its Austin and New York studios.</p>
<p>Still, a number of game franchises first published by Acclaim have made a return in recent years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-n64-racing-games-join-nintendo-switch-online-today">High-speed racer Extreme-G and puzzle game Iggy's Reckin' Balls</a> were added to Nintendo Switch Online's N64 catalogue last year, which were followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-mature-app-receives-two-additional-n64-games">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and Shadow Man in the Mature app</a>.</p>
<p>What's more, as previously reported, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-shadowman-game-in-the-works-21-years-after-the-last">new Shadow Man game is in development</a> from Blowfish Studios along with comic publisher Valiant Entertainment, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-new-turok-game">Saber Interactive is working on a new Turok game</a> it revealed at last year's The Game Awards.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-breaks-8m-sales-in-just-three-days.1124649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed the first sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, and it probably won't surprise you to learn that the game has dwarfed the two most recent entries in the series in terms of launch weekend figures.</p>

<p>Per a Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>managed to reach eight million sales within the first three days of its launch. That, as Capcom points out, is the quickest a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game has reached that figure.</p>

<p>For comparison's sake,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>hit <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/monster-hunter-world-shipped-5-million-units-in-a-weekend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">five million</a> sales within the same period, while&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>, which was initially exclusive to the Nintendo Switch, reached four million.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m-hunting-horn.jpg?itok=1dV9mxLT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m-hunting-horn.jpg?itok=cX-gdTxy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's fair to call&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>a runaway success.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this isn't just the fastest a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game has reached that eight million milestone; it's also the fastest any Capcom game has managed to do so. It's fair to say Capcom has a bona fide success on its hands with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>

<p>If you've been following&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' launch, its impressive sales performance probably won't surprise you. The game debuted to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">well over a million players on Steam at launch</a>, breaking records for both the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise and Capcom as a whole.</p>

<p>The signs were there even before launch;&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' first open beta, which was held across PC and consoles back in November, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">attracted more Steam players</a> than any game in the series had managed up to that point.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>was expected to do so well before launch that&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off" rel="nofollow">gave the majority of its staff the day off</a> on Friday, recognizing that many employees would just call in sick to play the game anyway.</p>




<p>The game's success hasn't come without a cost. Although critical reviews are broadly positive, players have provided much more mixed feedback for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, especially <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on PC</a>, with many pointing to lackluster performance and poor multiplayer implementation.</p>

<p>If you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>for yourself, you can play it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

I’m excited too, but I also know that no matter what Nintendo has planed, the Switch 2 doesn’t have a prayer of recapturing the magic of the original Switch launch. Perhaps no future console does. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,196181,196230" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This week marks the eighth anniversary of the handheld console hybrid’s release and somehow the device is still going.

No other console has gone on this strong and this consistently for this long, and none of it might have been possible without the constellation of factors that serendipitously collided to make the Switch launch one for the history books.</p><p>First there was the drama surrounding Nintendo, the storied gaming company whose name had once been synonymous with “video game console,” but whose Wii U had bombed so spectacularly that many thought it should exit the hardware business entirely. At only 13.56 million units sold, the white box with the clunky tablet controller performed even worse than the GameCube. Nintendo’s handheld at the time, the 3DS, was similarly its worst performing portable ever, though by a much smaller margin. </p><p>Nintendo had long ago abandoned the gaming graphics arms race, but by the mid-2010s it seemed like it had abandoned common sense as well, taking overly ambitious swings at superfluous hardware gimmicks instead of making decent hardware in service of great games. The fact that the Switch did exactly that, bringing Nintendo franchises into HD for the first time ever, felt like a remarkable coup considering the basement-level expectations coming out of the Wii U era. </p><p>But it also made a great first impression based on a novel insight: portable gaming doesn’t have to be secondary. The conventional wisdom at the time was that no one wanted to play big, deep games on the go. They had <em>Candy Crush</em> for that. The rise of smartphone gaming was thought to be one of the main factors in dooming the PlayStation Vita. It turns out that Sony just didn’t make the right games. Being able to take console-like experiences from home on the go, or just to the bedroom, made the sleek but otherwise humble-looking Switch feel revolutionary.</p><figure id="" data-id="91faaf8fdf1ebe4539e31a4b030e917d" data-recommend-id="image://91faaf8fdf1ebe4539e31a4b030e917d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Someone plays BotW in bed.

Most systems launch with a few visually dazzling but mechanically shallow games. They gesture at what the new tech is capable of but belie the developers’ inexperience in being able to completely capitalize on it. Few console launches get full-fledged sequels in one of the biggest franchises around, let alone a GOTY that redefines a genre. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was all of those things, and eight years later its reverberations throughout the medium are still being felt.</p><p>The real magic of the Switch launch was feeling both of these things smashed together: a mechanically deep, richly emergent, gorgeous open-world adventure on a small tablet that could (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-is-your-favorite-gaming-handheld-of-all-time-1844962828&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-is-your-favorite-gaming-handheld-of-all-time-1844962828">almost</a></span>) fit into your pocket (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-gear-are-you-using-with-your-new-nintendo-switch-1793234536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-gear-are-you-using-with-your-new-nintendo-switch-1793234536">or sock</a></span>).<em> Breath of the Wild</em> was a return to form for a series that had previously grown stiff and predictable, on a device that showed leaving the graphical arms race behind wasn’t a retreat from making great games, but the opposite. Hundreds of amazing games came to the Switch in the years that followed, but have any of them ever topped that feeling of first leaving the Great Plateau in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>? The fact that it’s even still debatable is remarkable. </p><p>There’s one final, less impressive reason why the Switch 2 will have a hard time living up to the  original Switch’s launch window hype: there’s no graveyard of Wii U games to cannibalize this time around. <em>Mario Kart 8</em> was ported to Switch within its first two months, eventually becoming its most popular game ever. Plenty of other first-party Wii U orphans have been rescued this way, filling out the Switch’s release calendar as needed while Nintendo consolidated its console and portable game development teams into a single, streamlined machine. </p><p>Maybe the Switch 2 will launch with a brand-new 3D <em>Mario </em>whose sprawling levels and inventive designs rival those of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Maybe <em>Mario Kart 9</em> will revolutionize the racing series the way <em>Breath of the Wild </em>did for<em> Zelda</em>. Maybe somehow, someway, a new mainline <em>Zelda</em> will also hit the Switch 2 in its first year even though <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>will only be three years old. In any case, though, it’s still only possible to experience the feeling of playing those types of games on a handheld for the first time once, and that already happened eight years ago. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds sold 8 million units in the first 3 days of release, becoming the fastest-selling game in Capcom’s history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was released on February 28, 2025, and the game has been breaking records since the first day. The game brought in over 1.3 million players on Steam alone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within the first 12 hours</a> and is still managing to bring in more than 1 million players within the past 24 hours (at the time of writing). Their latest record, with 8 million sales in 3 days, has made Monster Hunter Wilds the fastest-selling game in the series and Capcom’s history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the announcement <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a>, the developers discussed what it took to sell over 8 million copies in such a short span of time. With the new instalment in the series, the developers wanted to take Monster Hunter to a broader audience. So, they conducted several global initiatives, such as appearing at global game showcases, hosting online beta tests, and hosting individual showcases to spread the word.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from the initiatives, the developers have also worked on several core aspects of the game that have helped Monster Hunter Wilds reach this significant sales milestone. Through the Forbidden Lands, players experience a new, dynamically changing open world where they can be in the harshest environment at one moment and then suddenly find themselves in a “rich natural environment teeming with life”. The game is also the first in the series to feature cross-play co-op, which helps more players across platforms enjoy the game together.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/runescape%E2%80%99s-developer-has-a-new-ceo-in-jon-bellamy.1124637/</guid>

<p>Jagex has announced a change-up at the highest level, with CEO Phil Mansell stepping down and being replaced by Jon Bellamy. Phil has been in the role of Chief Executive Officer at Jagex since 2017 but has been with the company for more than a decade. Jon Bellamy noted that he is excited to communicate his ‘broader vision’ for RuneScape soon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-handing-over-the-baton">Handing Over The Baton</h2>



<p>In a press release, Phil Mansell expressed his sentiments at stepping back from the role of CEO at Jagex:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After an incredible 14 years leading RuneScape and 8 years as Jagex’s CEO, I’m stepping back and handing over the baton to Jon Bellamy. </p>



<p>Working alongside such a talented and passionate team, we’ve significantly grown the Company and player community, cementing Jagex as an innovator in community-driven games and genuine leader in this industry. </p>



<p>As the Company embarks on its next chapter, I am delighted to be handing over to a leader who I know cares about our games and business as much as I do – and I look forward to supporting him as he builds upon the strong foundations we’ve created.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bellamy echoed those sentiments:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a great honour to assume the leadership of Jagex and to help steward a game franchise that means so much to so many millions, myself included. I am also excited to get to work with the outstanding team, whom I know well from my time on the Board, to ensure our games continue to be the best in the world. </p>



<p>I plan to spend some time now with the team, reviewing our ambitions for Jagex, and plan to communicate my broader vision to the RuneScape community in the near-term.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mansell was most recently in the press following an awful proposal made by Jagex to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-ceo-addresses-recent-runescape-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overhaul the paid membership model</a>. It rankled with the community and was taken with an awful reception, and Mansell branded the proposal ‘clumsy and inconsiderate’.</p>



<p>He said that they had failed to think the proposal through from the perspective of a player, and the plans were ultimately scrapped.</p>



<p>Last year, Jagex was in talks regarding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-billion-dollar-buyout/">a potential billion dollar buyout</a>, but that conversation eventually faded out of the press.</p>

                <p>It's become all too common in the video game industry for small developers to shut down if their game isn't deemed a success after its debut. Unfortunately for Studio Fizbin, the decision to close its doors can't even wait another two weeks for the release of its final game, Reignbreaker.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-fizbin-shutting-down-after-reignbreaker-s-mid-march-release" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Studio Fizbin founder Alexander “Pepe” Pieper shared the news on <a href="https://www.studio-fizbin.com/fizbins-last-magic-trick" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the company's official site</a>. According to Pieper, the end of Studio Fizbin is happening in part because the dev team doesn't have a new project to work on after Reignbreaker is finished. Studio Fizbin's parent company, Thunderful, is also drastically cutting back on its internal development. Consequently, Studio Fizbin will be closing its doors after an 11-year run that included titles like The Inner World, The Inner World: The Last Wind Monk, Say No! More, Minute of Islands, and Lost at Sea.</p><p>However, Studio Fizbin will remain open long enough to ensure that its new roguelike action game, Reignbreaker, is "going to be the best game we've ever released." Following the game's debut on March 18, Studio Fizbin will provide post-launch support for Reignbreaker while helping its employees find new job opportunities in the industry.</p><p>"We want to thank every single one of our fans for your purchases, your fan art, your comments, your reviews, your passion, and your seemingly endless support," wrote Pieper. "And finally, we'd like to give the biggest thanks to our team--those who are here until the end, and the many others who have found a different path on the way. Fizbin and its games are defined by its team members, and you all made this the most inspiring place to perform the world's most difficult magic trick: making games."</p><p>Last year, there were large layoffs across the video game industry, and 2025 is already off to a rough start with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/three-studios-have-already-shut-down-in-2025-including-godfall-developer/1100-6528785/" data-ref-id="1100-6528785">the closure of Godfall developer Counterplay Games</a>, as well as Warner Bros.

            <p>
Activision's social media post advertising a new entry in the Guitar Hero series is market research for a game that doesn't exist, and is not meant to be an actual announcement, Eurogamer understands.
</p>
<p>
The fake advert - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-accused-of-ai-slop-yet-again-this-time-for-new-guitar-hero">which has been dubbed "AI slop" for its use of poorly-generated imagery</a> - is one of several tests currently being run across the publisher's social media profiles. 
</p>
<p>
These adverts also include new smartphone games in other Activision franchises such as Call of Duty and Crash Bandicoot that also don't exist (yet) either. 
</p>
<p>
Clicking on some of the adverts will take you through to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GuitarHero/comments/1j0jbh3/instagram_ad_for_a_new_guitar_hero_mobile_game/">mocked up mobile store page</a> organised by marketing service Geeklab, and then onto a survey that reveals "this isn't a real game, but could be some day!"
</p>
<p>
Market research questions then include queries asking users what made them click on the advert and what gameplay features they expected the game to include, based on the fake advert.
</p>
<p>
Activision posts on Instagram and Facebook have similarly advertised "Call of Duty: Zombie Defender", "Call of Duty: Sniper" and "Crash Bandicoot: Brawl".
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Activision plans to develop two new Call of Duty titles for mobile platform:</p><p>🔸 Call of Duty: Zombie Defender<br>🔸 Call of Duty: Sniper</p><p>AI-generated advertisements are being used to gauge player interests. If there is enough interest, the project will go into development. These… <a href="https://t.co/PWA1KjLd4h">pic.twitter.com/PWA1KjLd4h</a></p></div>— Leakers On Duty (@LeakersOnDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeakersOnDuty/status/1896536223478403382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

Artwork for the latter game, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Activision/videos/569180362817791/">hosted on Facebook</a>, again shows obvious use of AI image generation. One squirrel-like character appears to be missing half a face.

<p>
Will any of these Guitar Hero, Crash Bandicoot or Call of Duty smartphone games ever see the light of day? That remains to be seen. If and when they do, however, here's hoping Activision hires some actual humans to work on their artwork.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Activision recently added a warning label to the Steam page for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> confirming the game "uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets", after players spotted various in-game examples - including a zombie Santa Claus with six fingers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced is now available on PC, introducing plenty of new features that are sure to breathe new life into the latest main entry in the series.</p>
<p>The new version of the game includes, as announced a few days back, new features such as new ray tracing settings like ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion, that push the game's visuals beyond those offered in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game, NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 1 and 3 support, faster loading times with DirectStorage support and more. Now that the upgrade is out, we have also learned that all settings can go as high as Ultra and that the game features a Scene BVH Quality, thanks to a new screenshot provided by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/gabdeg.8633/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gabdeg</a> on the ResetERA forums. Unfortunately, HDR support is nowhere to be found, which is a shame.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GTA-V-Enhanced-RT-settings.png"></a></figure>

<p>It's too early to say if the new ray tracing features included in the Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced PC release improve the game's visuals universally, but from the <a href="https://imgsli.com/MzU1MTE5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick comparison</a> put together by gabdeg, it's clear they do have a significant impact. Another <a href="https://imgsli.com/MzU1MTIx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparison</a> put together by another ResetERA forums member, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/vic20.61250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vic20</a>, highlights how much ray-traced global illumination makes a difference. Performance also seems to be solid, according to the first few reports, so it definitely looks like Rockstar Games has done a great job improving their highly successful game.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced is now available for all PC users as a free upgrade, while the Legacy version will continue to be available to allow those with PC configurations that do not match those for the upgraded version of the game to continue playing normally. More information on the Enhanced release can be found <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/">here.</a></p>

<p>New leaks for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 have revealed that the game will release on July 11, 2025.</p>



<p>That’s according to reputable dataminer and leaker <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal details. </p>



<p>In his tweets, he revealed that the games will be released on July 11, 2025, but will come with a few different editions, including a collector’s edition that will allow you to play the games three days early.</p>



<p>The collector’s edition for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 will set you back $129.99 and will be available for the Xbox Series X\s, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. According to the dataminer, it comes with three days early access and other items included in the deluxe edition.</p>



<p>At such a hefty price tag for the collectors edition though, it’s currently unclear on if the edition will come with some sort of physical component. </p>

                <p>Capcom has announced that Monster Hunter Wilds has sold 8 million copies in three days, a new record for the company. This is the fastest-selling game in Capcom's history, surpassing the previous record-holder Monster Hunter World by a sizable margin. When it first launched several years ago, Monster Hunter World reached five million sales in three days <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240312.html" rel="nofollow ">and has so far reached 25 million lifetime sales</a>. Monster Hunter Wilds still has some way to go to reach and possibly surpass that number, but with extensive post-launch plans in place, it has a fighting chance to do so.</p><p><a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" rel="nofollow ">According to Capcom</a>, several open betas, a big marketing push, and the broad appeal of Monster Hunter Wilds have helped it reach this milestone, and the company remains "firmly committed to satisfying the expectations" of players. On Steam, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-top-5-all-time-on-steam-for-concurrent-players/1100-6529828/">Monster Hunter Wilds has set a record on that PC platform</a> by reaching the top five for concurrent players, with 1.3 million people on March 1, 2025. The other top four ahead of Monster Hunter Wilds are PUBG, Black Myth: Wukong, Palworld, and Counter-Strike 2.</p><p>Overall, the Monster Hunter franchise is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/capcoms-best-selling-game-franchises-of-all-time-and-whats-next-for-each/2900-6294/">second-best-selling Capcom franchise of all time</a>, with Resident Evil still holding the top spot. Even with Wilds adding 8 million more sales--and counting--to the franchise, Resident Evil holds a significant lead with 176 million sales in total for the franchise. It's not too surprising, given that the franchise launched several years before Monster Hunter and it has more games in its library.</p><p>"There are a few missteps along the way--of both an artistic and technical variety--but Wilds is another excellent entry in Capcom's beloved series," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/">Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.

                <p>The Mobile World Conference: Barcelona event kicked off this week, and amidst several new tech reveals from dozens of companies, one of Samsung's divisions had an interesting concept for the potential future of portable game consoles. Essentially, Samsung envisions a scenario where bulky game consoles can be made more portable, using foldable-screen technology to fold them up and make them easier to carry around.</p><p>Samsung Display--a branch of the company that develops screen technology that other firms can purchase for their devices--showed off a Switch-like device at MWC: Barcelona (via <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-shows-off-quirky-pincer-phone-folding-console-and-flexi-briefcase-concepts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNET</a>), demonstrating how a console could be made smaller by simply folding it in half. There are of course potential issues to watch out for that are common to foldable devices, as screens can only be folded so many times before they develop a signature crease, but the idea behind this concept design makes for a fascinating glimpse at what could be.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/sondesix/status/1896670398324031921" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Samsung Display shows off some crazy new concepts at MWC 2025.<br>✅ Flexible Briefcase: this cabinbag unfolds into an 18.1" tablet<br>✅ Flex Gaming: a 7.2" gaming console with a foldable screen<br>✅ Next-gen OCF OLED panel that allows for a 5,000 nits peak brightness in a 10% window,… <a href="https://t.co/XBUHE5pbJ1" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/XBUHE5pbJ1</a></p>  — Alvin (@sondesix) <a href="https://twitter.com/sondesix/status/1896670398324031921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>While current devices like the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> don't have a foldable screen, these companies could adopt this technology for future hardware. For now, it looks like the best way to carry around a portable games console will be to invest in a carrying case for it. The other alternative is to go retro, as older devices like the Game Boy, Nintendo DS, or the PlayDate are more pocket-friendly in design.</p><p>Modern smartphones are also capable gaming devices--Asus even sells one designed specifically for mobile gaming--and with a cradle device like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-controller-up-for-preorder-half-the-price-of-backbone/1100-6527392/" data-ref-id="1100-6527392">Backbone</a>, it's easy to make a session on one feel similar to a console experience.</p>

                <p>Konami has announced a brand-new entry in the fabled RPG series, Suikoden. It's called Suikoden Star Leap and it'll be on iOS and Android. Star Leap is free-to-play with microtransactions, and it's the first Suikoden game since 2012's Suikoden: The Woven Web of a Century, which was on PSP but never released outside of Japan.</p><p>The game follows a silent protagonist who's the son of the village chief, Hou. One night, the village is attacked. The hero, along with his friends Hisui, Shirin, and Shapur, embark on a new journey to restore peace to the village once again. Like every Suikoden game, Star Leap has 108 recruitable characters and the rest will be revealed at a later date.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKOZqkjPcWk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WKOZqkjPcWk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Star Leap also sees the return of pixel-art graphics, like the first two Suikoden games had, and breaking away from the 3D models of the previous three games.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/34239" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>, producer Shinya Fujimoto said that Star Leap takes place between the events of Suikoden V and Suikoden I. Additionally, the first chapter of Star Leap will heavily feature Odessa Silverberg, the original leader of the Liberation Army in Suikoden I that the protagonist eventually becomes in charge of.</p><p>While no release date has been revealed for Suikoden Star Leap, a remaster of the first two Suikoden games is releasing soon. The bundle is called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster-preorders-are-25-off-on-pc/1100-6526150/" data-ref-id="1100-6526150">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars</a> and launches on March 6 for PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It features brand-new quality-of-life features such as adjustable battle speeds and auto-saves.</p>

            <p>Inzoi - the upcoming and rather realistic looking Sims-like - is set to launch in early access later this month, and ahead of that people want to know one very important thing: what's the sex situation?</p>
<p>Sex is, of course, a pretty common feature in Maxis and EA's The Sims series, where it is known as WooHoo. And Inzoi players want to have a deeper understanding of what will be the WooHoo equivalent in Krafton's own life-sim.</p>

<p>The Inzoi team recently hosted a Q&amp;A session <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1162040845181124618/1162040845181124621/1345026317103534131">via the game's Discord</a>, where it was asked: "In Inzoi will you be able to have interactions for the purpose of creating babies?" (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/theres-sort-of-sex-in-inzoi-its-developers-explain-as-terminally-horny-life-sim-players-ask-about-getting-freaky-and-watching-their-zois-shower/">PC Gamer</a>). So, essentially, let's talk about sex, baby, but without actually using that word.</p>
<p>Here's what assistant director Joel Lee had to say about sex in Izoi: "There is a feature in the game that you obviously know what's happening, the male Zoi and the female Zoi are together, likely in bed, with the intention of creating babies. How visually apparent is that? That's where you have to go to your imagination. </p>
<p>"What you're seeing is not what you're seeing; you have to assume that's what's happening. Is that clear enough for everyone? It's there. Sort of. Maybe not to the level that everyone would have been expecting."

<p>Reading this, I assume this means Inzoi won't feature the same over-the-top interactions such as shaking bushes, love hearts popping out of rocket ships and a bombastic firework finale like we see in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>. That is perhaps understandable, given Inzoi is going for a more realistic tone (even if the characters do wear towels in the shower).</p>
<p>I am still not sure exactly what sex in Inzoi will look like, though. Also, given the game will feature same-sex relationships, I presume sex won't only be limited to - in Lee's words - the intention of creating babies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-sims-like-inzoi-delayed-into-next-year-to-give-it-a-stronger-foundation">Izoi is set to release in early access on 28th March</a>, via Steam. Our Ian along with Outside Xbox's Jane went hands on with Inzoi last year. You can check out their thoughts on the game - including its toilet animations - below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/04/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-release-date-and-editions-leak/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Trusted leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun">billbil-kun</a> has released details of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 which is set ot be officially announced later today.</p>
<p>He has revealed the game will be released on 11th July 2025, and if you pre-order the game you will get a ‘Wireframe Tony Shader’ along with the ‘Foundry demo’ when it is released, so presumably a demo of the game will be announced at some point.</p>


<p>The game has a Collector’s Edition which costs a whopping $129.99, a Deluxe Edition for $69.99 which includes Doom Slayer &amp; Revenant Skaters, the Unmaykr Hoverboard and ‘In-Game Music’, and the bog standard edition, which will cost you $49.99. The Deluxe and Collector’s Editions will get three days of early access. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 will&nbsp;be released on Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PS5, but no mention of a PS4 version.</p>
<p>This all comes off the back of long-running reports and rumours surrounding a follow-up to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/03/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-thps-ps4-xbox-pc/">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2</a> remake. Following that game’s 2020 release, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/06/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-plans-shelved-after-blizzard-entertainment-absorbed-vicarious-visions-says-tony-hawk">Tony Hawk said</a> that a follow-up was planned, but shelved after Vicarious Visions was absorbed into Blizzard Entertainment, rebranded as Blizzard Albany and set to work on the Diablo series.</p>
<p>Rumours about the project were revived recently when skater Tyshawn Jones<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3umK3xG7Ly4&amp;t=1314"> said in a radio interview</a> that he is set to be in an upcoming <em>Tony Hawk</em> game remaster.</p>
<p>Right now, it’s not clear who is working on Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4. There’s nothing stopping Blizzard Albany from working on this as they still exist within the overarching Activision Blizzard structure, and depending on workloads since the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/diablo-iv-review/">Diablo IV</a> in 2023, and surrounding the Vessels of Hatred DLC last year.</p>

<p>Looking back at THPS 1+2, we awarded the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/03/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-thps-ps4-xbox-pc/">a stellar 10/10</a>, saying “Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+ 2 is a labour of love and an ode to the series’ glory days. Every inch of the game has been perfectly restored and updated for modern consoles and it’s an absolute delight to play from start to finish. This is a must-buy for skateboarders, gamers and everyone else in between.”</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is all about crafting the best gear to perfect your build and allow you to take on some of the game's strongest monsters and in your quest for power, there will come a time when you will need more than just monster parts to craft the strongest gear. Among these items are the Hunter Symbols, which are awarded to the best hunters after completing certain quests.</p>
<p>The Hunter Symbols in Monster Hunter Wilds come in three different number variants and are awarded after completing quests involving <strong>Tempered Monsters</strong>. These monster variants, which are considerably more powerful than the base ones, will start roaming maps after you defeat them in post-game story quests, starting with the <strong>Main Mission 4.3: Wyvern Spark and Rose Thorns</strong> quest. To get <strong>Hunter Symbol I</strong>, you will have to complete quests involving 5-Star Tempered monsters, while to get <strong>Hunter Symbol II</strong>, you will have to complete quests involving 6-Star Tempered monsters.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250304123727_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To get <strong>Hunter Symbol III</strong> in Monster Hunter Wilds, you will have to <strong>complete quests involving 7 and 8-Star Tempered monsters</strong>, which are Rey Dau, Jin Dahaad, Uth Duna, Nu Udra,&nbsp; and Gore Magala for 7-Star rank, and Arkveld for 8-Star rank. Before you can actually encounter the Tempered variants of the Apex predators above, however, you will first have to complete the final story mission, <strong>Mission 6-1</strong>, and reach <strong>Hunter Rank 41</strong>. Be sure to gear up before you attempt to fight these Tempered monsters, as they are the current strongest monsters in the game!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/studio-known-for-anti-capitalist-games-shut-down-by-their-publisher-just-two-weeks-before-their-newest-game-comes-out<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The developers of workplace comedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/say-no-more">Say No! More</a> and anti-establishment roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reignbreaker">Reignbreaker</a> are closing down, and the news comes just two weeks before their final punky action game is due to come out. Studio Fizbin has been struck by ongoing cuts at their parent company Thunderful, they say, and despite pitching follow-up projects to work on after Reignbreaker's release, none of those will go ahead. Which means they'll be winding down at the exact moment you'd hope they'd be celebrating a payoff from years of work. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Our parent company Thunderful made the decision to drastically reduce internal development in November 2024, which, as Thunderful’s CEO Martin communicated in the latest quarterly report, also affected Studio Fizbin," said founder Alexander Pieper in a statement <a href="https://www.studio-fizbin.com/fizbins-last-magic-trick">on the studio's website</a>, as noticed by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-fizbin-shutting-down-after-reignbreaker-s-mid-march-release">Gamedeveloper</a>. "Since then, we’ve been exploring various opportunities to work on after finishing Reignbreaker. Unfortunately, none of these projects will move forward, leading us to make this difficult decision.</p>
<p>"This means that Reignbreaker will be Studio Fizbin’s final game."</p>
<p>Publishers Thunderful recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-makers-announce-100-layoffs-cancel-projects-and-say-theyll-publish-more-games-by-other-studios-but-fewer-of-their-own">slashed 80-100 jobs across their studios</a>, and said they'll now focus on publishing games by outside studios, rather than developing their own. It looks like the full effects of that decision are now being felt. </p>
<p>If you haven't seen it yet, Reignbreaker is a very purple and black action roguelike about bringing down a tyrannical queen with plenty of spear chuckin' and upgrade choosin'. When James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reignbreaker-is-an-anti-establishment-roguelike-thats-clearly-pro-hades">played its monarch-toppling chaingunnery</a> he noted "flashy isometric fights" and "pausing for a chat with some charismatic, lovingly hand-drawn, likely flirty side character." Sound familiar? James thought so too. "It’s so very, very Hades," he said. </p>
<p>As for the theme, it's a response to the "rise in right-wing authoritarianism all around the world, the growing class divide and exploitation", according to community manager Ian Stewart. If any of that sounds intriguing, you can play the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129810/Reignbreaker/">demo on Steam</a> yourself. The game is due to release on March 18th.</p>
<p>Before this Studio Fizbin made a bunch of games that have been well-liked by RPS staff, such as point and click adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-inner-world">The Inner World</a>, hand-drawn puzzle platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minute-of-islands">Minute Of Islands</a>, and the comedy anti-capitalist refuse 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/say-no-more">Say No! More</a> which Alice B (RPS in peace) called "short but immensely satisfying". Here's a snippet of her thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>It casts universal capitulation as a global, systemic problem, and, at the same time, being realistic and setting boundaries as a path to everyone being healthy and happy. But not in a preachy way. In an absurd way.</blockquote>
<p>Fizbin will spend their remaining time as a studio working to ship the game, says Pieper, as well as providing some post-launch support to Reignbreaker, and supporting workers in finding new work. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>All eyes are locked on Assassin’s Creed Shadows and its forthcoming review embargo date. This is one of the most important Assassin’s Creed releases ever, and the critical reception could have a huge bearing on the game’s success.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> releases in the middle of a crowded March 2025. It needs to fight off the popularity of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios</a> and its new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> release, and combat the physical forces of 2K’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>. Ubisoft has enough without worrying about other new titles.</p>



<p>Shadows is reportedly not getting delayed again and will release in March. An abundance of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-releases-statement-on-assassins-creed-shadows-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadows leaks</a> has already shown many people the game and what it has in store. But for everyone else, the Assassin’s Creed Shadows review embargo is crucial.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-assassin-s-creed-shadows-review-embargo-date">Do we Know The Assassin’s Creed Shadows Review Embargo Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The date is crawling up to us. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows Review Embargo Date is reportedly set for March 18—two days before the game’s official release date.</strong></p>



<p>In an exclusive Insider Gaming report, we revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft is confident about Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ March 20, 2025, release date</a>. Our sources have also indicated “<strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows reviews will be live on March 18, 2025.</strong>“</p>



<p>It’s fairly standard for review embargos to go live between two and five days before launch. It’s more concerning when a review embargo date is the day of the game or after launch. This is usually an indicator the developer and/or publisher isn’t happy with the product and therefore leaves the embargo until after players have bought the game.</p>



<p>Ubisoft looks to be assured, and we should be getting <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> 48 hours before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-review-embargo">What is a Review Embargo?</h2>



<p><strong>A review embargo is the earliest point where a publication can release its final review.</strong></p>



<p>In this case, the Assassin’s Creed Shadows review embargo is set by Ubisoft. Reviews can’t be posted before this embargo, and any that are likely need to be taken down and can cause complications between parties.</p>



<p>Review embargos have become a focal point of game launches in modern times. Players are eager to see, hear, and read reviews before they invest in a game. With Ubisoft’s mixed history with game launches—particularly Assassin’s Creed (look at AC Unity)—the early reception to Shadows could be make or break.</p>



<hr>



<p>If our information turns out to be incorrect, we will be sure to update this article. For now, you can start counting down the days until the Assassin’s Creed Shadows review embargo lifts. What scores will the RPG get? What average score will be enough for you to commit to a purchase? </p>

            <p>
Nintendo has trumpeted its latest legal success in the company's ongoing fight against pirated games as "significant" not only for itself, "but for the entire games industry".
</p>
<p>
The Mario maker today confirmed it had won a final victory over French file-sharing company Dstorage, which operates the website 1fichier.com, following years of legal wrangling and repeated appeals.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's victory means European file-sharing companies must now remove illegal copies of games when asked to do so, or be held accountable and cough up potentially sizable fines as punishment.
</p>
<p>
In 2021, the Judicial Court of Paris ordered Dstorage pay Nintendo €935k (£773k) in damages after it was found to be hosting pirate games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-wins-case-against-french-filesharing-service-hosting-pirated-games">Dstorage launched an appeal, which then failed in 2023, and was ordered to pay Nintendo further costs</a>. But the case didn't end there. 
</p>
<p>
Dstorage finally took the matter to the highest French judiciary court, where it argued that a specific court order was required before it needed to remove content from its hosting services. This bid has also now failed, ending the long-running matter for good.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo is pleased with the court's finding of liability against Dstorage," reads a statement from the Mario maker shared with Eurogamer this morning. 
</p>
<p>
"Together with its recent decision of 15th January 2025, confirming that a major French Bank had rightfully terminated a payment processing agreement with 1fichier.com due to lacking anti-piracy measures, the French Supreme Court leaves no doubt that sharehosting providers like 1fichier.com are not a safe haven for storing and sharing illegal content.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo promotes and fosters development and creativity, and strongly supports developers who legitimately create new and innovative software. Nintendo's message to consumers is not to download pirate copies of Nintendo games as this increases the risk that this will interfere with the functionality and experience that playing legitimate Nintendo games on authentic Nintendo hardware provides."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's campaign against game piracy has regularly hit the headlines over the past year, perhaps most notably with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">the shutdown of Switch emulator Yuzu - whose creator agreed to pay Nintendo $2.4m</a> (£1.89m). 
</p>
<p>
Last summer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-war-against-switch-piracy-ramps-up-with-two-fresh-cases">Nintendo tracked down the moderator behind the infamous SwitchPirates reddit</a> and claimed the individual ran "several pirate shops" that sold "massive libraries of pirated Nintendo Switch games". Nintendo is seeking damages in the millions of dollars.
</p>
<p>
In November 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">Nintendo filed a lawsuit against a streamer who regularly played pirated copies of Nintendo games ahead of release</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>. The streamer had previously boasted he "could do all this all day" as he had "1000 burner accounts".

			<p>The Suikoden series revival will not stop with the HD remasters of the first two entries in the series launching this week, as revealed during a livestream that aired a few hours ago.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://youtu.be/TIjGwGAJJ4s?si=sIKc_fHQknKkO5CO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live broadcast</a>, Konami confirmed that the series will continue with a new mobile game called Suikoden STAR LEAP. Set between the fifth and first entry in the series, the game will feature a story that is part of the canon of the series, beautiful 2D graphics inspired by the first two entries in the series, returning characters like Viktor, Flik, and Odessa, many of the gameplay features that define the series, such as the ability to recruit 108 characters and more. While it will be a gacha game, it has been confirmed that the 108 Stars of Destiny can all be obtained without pulls, and only legacy characters will be obtainable with the typical gacha mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Suikoden STAR LEAP | Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKOZqkjPcWk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Suikoden STAR LEAP will offer fans of the series the chance to experience a new story set in the series' universe, the aforementioned animated show, on the other hand, is clearly meant to expand the series' reach beyond its existing fanbase. In the works by Konami's animation studio and NBC Universal Entertainment Japan, the animated show will introduce new fans to the deep lore of Suikoden II. Hopefully, it will not shy away from showing some of the original game's most chilling sequences, which all involve one of the game's main villains, the iconic Luca Blight.</p>
