              <p data-start="129" data-end="916">If you’re creating content for TikTok or Instagram Reels, there’s one small tweak you can add to your workflow that will dramatically elevate your results: get a microphone. Seriously. Many creators overlook how crucial solid audio is. Whether you’re shooting laid-back vlogs from your couch or doing those man-on-the-street style interviews, viewers will pick up on your sound quality. They might not consciously notice it, but something about your video will just feel a bit lackluster. In most cases, it’s the audio. Fix that immediately with a high-quality lavalier mic that’s currently discounted. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/">At the moment, the DJI Mic Mini two-person vlog bundle is 50% off, cutting the price from $119 to just $59. Personally, saving $60 sounds pretty great to me.</a></p>
<p data-start="918" data-end="1144">These wireless mics are low-profile yet don’t compromise on performance. They’re ultralight, weighing only 10 grams. They stay discreet and look clean on camera, plus they’re simple to get working and comfortable to wear.</p>
<p data-start="1146" data-end="1306">Each microphone can deliver crisp audio to the receiver at a maximum transmission distance of up to 400 meters. That’s a quarter mile range.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1146" data-end="1306">Powerful Noise Cancelling</h2>
<p data-start="1308" data-end="1749">The DJI Mic Minis are excellent for recording in energetic outdoor settings like crowded conventions or busy streets. This is thanks to their pro-level noise cancellation. You can choose between two intensity modes. Basic works well for quiet indoor spaces, while the strong mode is ideal for loud outdoor areas. They can also automatically limit audio levels when sound gets too loud. This prevents clipping and can be a huge help once you begin editing.</p>
<p data-start="1308" data-end="1749">Switching up these settings is simple enough. Just tap the power button to enable or disable noise cancellation. In order to swap between the two modes of Strong or Basic can be done using the DJI Mimo app (supported on iPhone and Android).</p>
<p data-start="1751" data-end="1905">The DJI Mic Minis integrate seamlessly with your wider DJI OsmoAudio setup. You can pair them with an Osmo Action 5 Pro without even needing the receiver.</p>


<p data-start="1907" data-end="2139">Each transmitter and receiver has a long-lasting battery so you can film all day if needed. The DJI Mic Minis provide up to 10 hours of operation on a single charge, making them great for livestreams or long interviews. If your content only has one speaker, then you effectively have 20 hours of operation since you can always swap to the other. Heck, you can get even more than that since realistically you can start charging your first after it dies while using the second.</p>
<p data-start="1907" data-end="2139">As an additional add-on, you can pick up the DJI Mic Mini charging case. This can house both transmitters and the receiver, providing you with up to 48 hours of operation.</p>
<p data-start="2141" data-end="2261" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/">Right now, you can grab this bundle with two DJI Mic Mini microphones and the DJI receiver for only $59, saving you $60.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/anbernic-rg34xxsp-retro-handheld-review-the-gba-sp-returns/</link>
            <guid>1372729</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Sometimes modern devices are designed to inspire the most intense nostalgia possible. While many of the big-hitters have launched mini renditions of their older consoles to fill that gap, in the handheld space it’s generally been left to companies like Miyoo, ModRetro and Analogue to fill that gap. One of the clear big hitters here is Anbernic, and with their snappily named <a href="https://www.litnxt.com/products/litnxt-anbernic-rg34xxsp-3-4-inch-retro-handheld-game-console">RG34XXSP</a> they’ve released one of the best Game Boy Advance SP-like devices since… well, the original.</p>
<p>To all intents and purposes, the RG34XXSP looks and feels like a Game Boy Advance SP. It tickles all of those primary coloured gaming memories, instantly taking you back to the incredible hours spent with games like Advance Wars and Fire Emblem. However, as a modern emulation device, the Anbernic RG34XXSP is capable of much, much more.</p>



<p>Our review unit came in glorious yellow, and really, all it needs is a Pikachu face emblazoned on the top, and it’d be perfect. The main body of the case is made of sturdy plastic, while the folding metal hinge ensures that the top screen panel feels sturdy and locked in place. Compared to Miyoo’s recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/04/miyoo-flip-v2-review-a-dose-of-handheld-nintendo-nostalgia/">Flip</a>, the RG34XXSP feels much more rugged and sturdy, and where I was loathe to take that anywhere without popping it in its hard case, the RG35XXSP has bounced around in my bag for weeks without any noticeable side effects.</p>
<p>Opening it up reveals the 3.4-inch IPS screen in a 3:2 ratio which perfectly matches the original GBA screen. It’s clear and bright, with a good colour balance that feels authentic to the original games it’s displaying. With a 720×480 resolution, it’s a huge jump from the original Game Boy Advance’s 240×160, which makes it all the better for emulating more powerful consoles than simply the one it’s physically imitating, although the screen ratio means that consoles aiming for the 4:3 standard will have pillarboxed frames either side of the display.</p>

<p>There’s more controls here than you would have found on a GBA or SP. There’s a great-feeling D-pad, which instantly stands out as your key point of interaction with the handheld, while each of the four face buttons gives a strong, meaningful click with every press.</p>
<p>There are also two inset analogue sticks here, which are ideal if you want to emulate anything past the 16-bit era. They feel pretty good considering their short travel distance, but they would definitely have benefited from some grip or textured surface, just to help during more action-packed moments.</p>
<p>Around the outside edge, you’ll find four shoulder/trigger buttons, as well as a USB-C/OTG port and a mini-HDMI out for playing on a big screen. Additional controls come in the form of a volume rocker, reset switch and power button, with the front of the device rounded out by a 3.5mm headphone socket. Anbernic have packed everything you could want in here, and they’ve done it to a higher spec than their immediate rivals in the £50 price range.</p>

<p>There’s magnets installed in the top screen panel, so not only is the RG34XXSP capable of closing extremely firmly, it also initiates a sleep mode, letting you simply close your game when you want to take a break, before flipping it open to continue later on. This is a great quality of life feature, and one which made a huge difference during our testing, as it lets you jump in and out of games at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>The small form factor also helped with that, and the RG34XXSP has become my go-to device to travel with over the last month, taking up virtually no space in my bag or hand luggage, and it even fits into your actual pocket. Imagine that! It feels genuinely great to take it out on the train and be able to leap back into one of your favourite games of yesteryear. The original Game Boy Advance SP remains one of my favourite consoles of all time, and the RG34XXSP hits all the right notes in bringing a similarly flavoured device to 2025.</p>
<p>To be clear, you should only be emulating games that you already own, and emulation devices like this are just a means to collect and categorise your libraries. With that out of the way, it’s great to see the RG34XXSP capable of emulating devices up to and including the Sony PSP and Sega Dreamcast. Some titles for both of those platforms will push it pretty hard – I found things slowing down occasionally in Marvel Vs Capcom 2 when there were a lot of characters on screen – but overall, the RG34XXSP dispenses itself well thanks to its quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 chipset and 2GB of LPDDR4 RAM.</p>

<p>Really, I can imagine a lot of people using it to return to their Game Boy Advance libraries, and it’s ideal for that, particularly with two micro-SD slots for taking every game you own with you. I obviously went straight back to playing Fire Emblem, followed swiftly by Advance Wars, and the included Retroarch software worked perfectly for emulating both titles. Retroarch is also the avenue to various screen filters that might get the games looking more like you remembered them, instead of the crisp upscaled look that we’re now more accustomed to.</p>
<p>The Anbernic launcher that sits over the top of it all is basic, but functional, and if you’re not interested in tinkering with it, it’ll do everything you could want in terms of curating your emulation experience. Where the Anbernic RG34XXSP is weaker is in its speaker setup. The mono speaker at the centre of the front panel can certainly pump out plenty of volume, but it’s pretty harsh and can become distorted at higher volumes. It also seems to emphasise any emulation issues, and at times the overall audio was pretty poor compared to the rest of the package. It’s fine for quiet, everyday use, but I’d recommend using a wired pair of headphones to get the best out of the audio.</p>
<p>The RG34XXSP’s main competitor is undoubtedly the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/04/miyoo-flip-v2-review-a-dose-of-handheld-nintendo-nostalgia/">Miyoo Flip</a>, and while I think I’d give the edge to Miyoo’s stock OS – LITNXT’s own version – the build quality of the RG34XXSP is a clear step above Miyoo’s. However, if you’re looking to play titles beyond the Game Boy Advance’s extensive library, the Flip’s 3.5inch screen is bigger, and boasts a more traditional 4:3 ratio.</p>
<p><em>Thank you to <a href="https://www.litnxt.com/?gad_source=1">LITNXT</a> for providing our review unit for the Anbernic RG34XXSP.</em></p>

            <p>Revived <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y survivabuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> got a fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-early-access-release-date-set-in-stone-for-january-2026-but-its-devs-admit-the-first-impression-will-be-rough">early access release date of January 13th</a> the other week. However, the team behind it how now confirmed you shouldn't expect to see it hit Steam at that point, with the game's executive director not seeing the need to knock on Valve's pipe-laden door yet and keen to avoid an early access spent drowning in negative reviews.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This comes from the first <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq">post adressing frequently asked questions</a> that Hytale's current devs have put out since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">securing the rights to it from Riot</a>. Right off the bat, executive director Patrick 'Lyall' Derbic addressed whether the game'll be hitting the Steam platform.</p>
<p>"No, not initially," he wrote. "We want to spend our time in early access working with the community and improving the game, rather than overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren't as well-informed yet about what we are doing. Steam is a great marketing tool, but one that we might never need. This doesn't mean we will never be on Steam - just that we do not see the necessity of it yet."</p>
<p>On one hand, working with a more concentrated group of players you can grill for in-depth thoughts on the game early doors sounds like a good plan, especially since the team have been very clear what folks will be getting on day one will be quite rough around the edges and have lots of room to grow. On the other, there's perhaps an argument that initially ducking criticism from folks outside of those likely already keen on the proposition of Hytale could potentially lead to blind spots in terms of helping it appeal to a wider audience down the line.</p><p>In any case, I'm not a game developer and certainly appreciate the tough task any game nowadays faces in carving out a reputation for itself that can attract eyeballs and avoid being buried amid the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-next-fests-have-grown-into-humongous-battle-royales-and-june-2025s-was-no-different">massive avalanche of games</a> constantly competing for players' hours.</p>
<p>The rest of the FAQ post saw Derbic acknowledge things like the fact the team are working on getting region-specific pricing up and running for "a limited number of countries to start with", with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-gets-a-cheap-price-point-all-because-its-devs-dont-think-the-game-is-good-yet">$20 being the base price worldwide for now</a>. Extra cosmetics will be added, but there'll be no pay-to-win offerings as far as monetisation goes. Finally, pets, animal taming, and fishing are all in the works, but won't be there in January.</p>
<p>The full thing's also worth giving a read if you're unsure about the different permutations of the three different editions of Hytale being sold out of the gate. Derbic and co have also shared the <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-hardware-requirements">hardware specs</a> you'll need to meet to comfortably get the sandbox up and running on your machine.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-jbl-go-4-tiny-bluetooth-speaker-leftover-cyber-monday-stock-goes-to-record-low-2000650147</link>
            <guid>1372723</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon kept some Cyber Monday deals running on select items including this JBL Go 4 that punches way above its weight class in the sound department. The speaker <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6199/">is currently down to $39 from its regular $49 price, which is an all-time low</a> that makes it an easy pick for personal use or as a <strong>holiday gift at a reasonable budget</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6199/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How JBL Made a Small Package Sound Big</h2>
<p>The sound engineering that went into this small speaker is all about<strong> getting bass response that usually needs much bigger drivers and enclosures</strong>. JBL tuned the parts inside to make what they call <em>“punchy bass”</em> which means that you can feel the low-end frequencies instead of just hearing the tinny mids and highs. A single driver and passive radiators in the speaker boost the bass without needing extra power or space. This means you get fuller sound from something that weighs less than half a pound. The JBL Go 4 is great for times when you want to hear real music instead of the thin, high-pitched sound that most ultra-portable speakers make.</p>



<p>With moderate volumes,<strong> the battery lasts up to seven hours of continuous playback</strong>&nbsp;which is enough for most day trips or outdoor activities without having to find an outlet. The <em>Playtime Boost</em> feature adds two more hours by changing the audio processing to use less power. However, you will lose some volume and bass depth in exchange for longer battery life. This is helpful when you’re at the beach or camping and remember you forgot to charge it the night before and it gives you enough power to keep the music going until sunset.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP67 certification</strong> means that the speaker can stay submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes and is also completely dustproof. After a day at the beach, you can rinse it off under the tap, use it in the shower, or leave it by the pool without worrying about splashes ruining the electronics. The tough outside is made of recycled plastic and has a fabric grille that protects the driver while letting sound through clearly. This environmentally friendly construction doesn’t make the speakers less durable; the materials can handle drops and bumps that would break less sturdy speakers.</p>



<p>With the $10 off, this speaker is now cheap enough that you might buy it on a whim instead of thinking about it first. For less than the price of good wired headphones, you get IP67 protection, surprisingly strong bass, and a battery that lasts all day. JBL built their name on providing high-quality sound at reasonable prices. This is the lowest price ever for a portable speaker that doesn’t sound like a toy and it’s easy to grab one and try it out for yourself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and other global economic powers are having a significant impact on the production costs of various devices, including gaming consoles such as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, which are primarily assembled in China. With the very concrete risk that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/two-of-the-biggest-dram-suppliers-are-skeptical-about-increasing-production/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the current massive price increases for components like RAM</strong></a> may cause console prices to increase further, Microsoft is taking a significant step to mitigate these risks by expanding production in Vietnam.</p>



<p>The evidence for this crucial production shift comes directly from regulatory documents. As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/foxconn-subsidiary-plans-expand-production-vietnam-document-shows-2025-12-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Reuters</strong></a>, Foxconn subsidiary Fushan Technology is seeking permission to expand production in Vietnam to produce up to<strong> 4.8 million Xbox gaming devices annuall</strong>y. This likely includes not only consoles, but also accessories like controllers and headsets, which all carry the same price increase risk as consoles.</p>



<p>Microsoft isn't the only one, reportedly. In a related document, it's revealed that China's Luxshare-ICT is planning to produce up to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">4.5 million game consoles per year</strong> at a factory in Vietnam, starting from 2026. The brands of the devices haven't been confirmed, so it could be any of the three big manufacturers, as all are facing the same global trade challenges that have led to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">an unprecedented price increase of gaming systems, years after their debut.</a></strong></p>



<p>Amidst price increases for all components due to trade tensions that show no signs of easing and the increasing demand for AI data centers, mitigating the risk of price increases for gaming devices in any possible way is the most sensible thing to do for all manufacturers, not just Microsoft for its Xbox devices. </p>



<p>With the<a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/"> <strong>next console generation looming ahead</strong></a>, expanding production outside of China may also prevent gaming systems from reaching exorbitant prices, which would take away one of the advantages gaming consoles have over gaming PCs, including those targeting the same audience, such as <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-machine-console-price-not-much-higher/">the upcoming Steam Machine</a>:</strong> affordability.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Game Studios has released the Fallout 76: Burning Springs update across all platforms. The patch updates the game to version 1.7.22.12, with download sizes of roughly 28.8 GB on Steam, 39.3 GB on Microsoft Store, 41.9 GB on Xbox, and 40.8 GB on PlayStation.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-qa-bringing-ghoul-tv-show-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As previously covered</a>, it's a major free expansion for the online survival action game Fallout 76 that opens a new Ohio‑set region west of Point Pleasant, introduces the Ghoul from the award-winning Amazon Prime Video TV show as a recurring character, and adds a full bounty‑hunting system plus new public events and creatures.</p>



<p>According to the developers, Fallout 76: Burning Springs is one of the largest map expansions released since the game's launch in 2018, probably the biggest since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wastelanders-country-roads-take-me-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2020's Wastelanders</a>. It is accessed by crossing the Point Pleasant bridge into a rust‑scarred, war‑torn area of rural Ohio, which was never previously featured in any Fallout game. The region includes new wildlife and fishing content, including creatures like the Radhog that can be adopted as a C.A.M.P. pet, plus new fish species and at least one “local legend” catch.</p>



<p>The update adds a new questline that begins when level 30+ players tune into the Ohio Distress Signal; this story centers on Highway Town, its Last Resort saloon hub, and the ruthless Rust King, setting up a multi‑update narrative arc that will keep players engaged for some time. The patch also adds two new public events (Gearin’ Up and Sinkhole Solutions); both are located in the Burning Springs region and are built around the new enemy groups and environmental hazards there.</p>



<p>The patch applies a broad pass to weapon balance, legendary mods (including some new ones), and certain enemy behaviors. C.A.M.P. budgets have also been loosened, as several decorative and functional items receive lower budget costs.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout 76: Burning Springs Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ_SER3SwSQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Arguably, the highlight of Fallout 76: Burning Springs is the new Bounty Hunting feature, which lets players pick up basic Grunt Hunt and harder Head Hunt contracts in the Last Resort. Grunt Hunts target 1‑star Legendary enemies that can scale up to 2‑ and 3‑star as the player successfully completes more hunts, making them a structured Legendary farming path. Head Hunts, on the other hand, put the player on the trail of named targets tracked through the Challenges tab, with unique cosmetic and item rewards tied to specific bounties. Bounty Hunting is essentially a major new progression pillar, designed to be revisited for long‑term gear chasing.</p>



<p>The hook is that the quest giver is none other than The Ghoul, the popular character played by actor Walton Goggins in the TV series, who did all the voice work for the digital version as well. In the game, The Ghoul is overwhelmed by these bounty contracts and asks the player to step in and help clear them as they appear. Fallout 76: Burning Springs is neatly timed to release just ahead of the highly anticipated second season of the Prime Video show (<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due on December 17</a>), where Lucy and The Ghoul pursue Lucy's father into New Vegas.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-76-update-launches-milepost-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Milepost Zero</a> is closing down in the Skyline Valley region. The rewards that were previously available when protecting Milepost Zero caravans are now spread across the Wasteland. The developers reckon that Bounty Hunting delivers the same promise of on-demand content with legendary enemies and great rewards more succinctly and satisfyingly. They also teased 'exciting plans' for the Skyline Valley region.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout 76 - Season 23: Blood x Rust" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/70-xouZLce0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Fallout 76: Burning Springs lands right alongside the launch of Season 23, Blood x Rust, featuring a new scoreboard themed around raiders, scrapyards, and Deathclaws. The board is packed with Raider themed C.A.M.P. items, workbenches, and décor, such as raiderized workstations, metal braziers, junk‑metal fences, and scrap‑themed prefabs, aimed at giving camps a freshly pillaged look. Multiple cosmetics and utility items reference the new Burning Springs content, including bounty‑hunter icons, Rust‑themed player titles, and props tied to the Ohio region's Dino Golf attraction.</p>

            <p>The ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">chaos in RAM production</a>, with mass shortages jacking up street prices to are-you-joking levels, now has a major manufacturer casualty. <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business">Micron have announced</a> the end of Crucial, their consumer brand for PC memory and SSDs – and likely a familiar name to gaming PC builders who’ve been hooking up their storage drives and slotting in their RAM sticks for decades.</p>
<p>"Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments," wrote Micron’s Executive VP and Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana.</p>
<p>In other words, there’s a whole bunch of AI data centres cropping up, and Crucial are rudely hogging memory hardware that could be put to more profitable use than merely supplying grassroots interests in computing and games. Important uses! Like generating a thumbnail image of Mr Beast pretending to swim away from a shark, or unilaterally rewriting article headlines in Google Discover so they’re full of incoherent lies. God, you PC people are so selfish.</p>
<p>Crucial RAM and SSD shipments will continue until 2026, though expect the former, especially, to remain at silly-high prices while that data centre demand keeps shortages short and costs in the clouds. Probably worse so than before, now that there’ll be one less company trying to keep stock flowing.</p><p>After February, they’re gone for good, which is a huge shame. Crucial had been making quality, relatively affordable components and storage right up until Micron’s act of filicide, with the likes of the T500 and X9 Pro currently holding pride of place in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">best SSDs</a> list. I’ve even had a few more recent models – the T710 NVMe drive and the external X10 – in my cupboard, waiting for me to find the time to test them. The PC I’m writing this on, and have played games for years with, has a Crucial P5 as its main SSD, and I somehow remember choosing a 2x4GB Crucial Ballistix RAM set for my first DIY build after reading an agreeable review of it in PC Gamer’s then-tiny hardware section.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have a pile of to-be-benchmarked components in your house, that’s a lot of hobbyist history to just... end. And for what?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale will not be available on Steam when it launches in January, Hypixel Studios confirmed, with the developers keen to avoid negative reviews during the early access stage.</p>



<p>After being axed by Riot Games, Hytale was saved by the initial founders of the game and will be released into early access on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 13</a>, with an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-price-revealed-ahead-of-early-access-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">affordable price of $19.99 for the base version</a>, and, while Steam won’t be available at launch and may never be required, there are plans for a console release.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-skipping-steam-but-coming-to-console-in-future">Hytale Skipping Steam But Coming to Console in Future</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Wait. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Answering a series of frequently asked questions on the <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hytale website</a>, executive director Patrick ‘Lyall’ Derbic confirmed Hytale won’t be supported on Steam at launch, with the intention to avoid “overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren’t as well-informed yet about what we are doing.”</p>



<p>The intention is to spend time “working with the community and improving the game,” and, while “Steam is a great marketing tool,” it’s one that may not ever be required. However, the door hasn’t been closed on a Steam launch entirely.</p>



<p>There are plans for launches on console and other platforms in the future, though the early access period will be on PC only. Launching on console “requires a lot of work on backend systems,” and the initial desire is to “focus on making a good game first.”</p>



<p>A mobile version will also not be available during early access, and it remains to be seen whether it’s on the cards at all, as Hypixel Studios are “still evaluating what it would take to make this a feasible reality.”</p>

<p>Fortnite players are set to be treated to another new game mode, according to leakers, with a mode for five-player squads in the works.</p>



<p>Battle Royale in Fortnite currently supports 1-4 players, but larger groups have been restricted. However, that could be set to change with five-player squads on the horizon.</p>







<h2 id="h-leakers-say-fortnite-will-add-five-player-squads">Leakers Say Fortnite Will Add Five-Player Squads</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More players, more fun. Credit Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Fecooo_/status/1996365066212696385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter post from Fecoo_</a>, five-player squads are “likely coming” to Battle Royale soon, with a sub link code to the data of the playlist of the mode showing details of ‘Quints’, which also confirms that five players can be in a team.</p>



<p>The string has come in the same area where the Battle Royale modes of Solo, Duos, Trios, and Squads are shown, suggesting there is strong legitimacy to the claims.</p>



<p>Five-player squads would be the first variation to the standard Battle Royale since the introduction of Trios in January 2019, which initially came as a limited-time mode before being later added as a permanent option.</p>



<p>Since then, Battle Royale has branched into entirely separate modes with the likes of Blitz, Reload, Fortnite OG, and Delulu, but the lobby sizes have largely remained the same.</p>



<p>The leaks do not specify when to expect the addition of five-player squads to Fortnite, nor is it indicated whether the addition will arrive permanently or as a limited-time mode.</p>



<p>It does serve as further evidence of Epic Games’ plans to continually expand Fortnite to cater to a wider range of players, with the game now containing separate ecosystems with their own passionate playerbase.</p>

<p>Fortnite has confirmed an iconic character has survived the shocking attack that occurred in the trailer for Chapter 7 Season 1, with the Battle Bus poised to return and the driver being safe from harm.</p>



<p>One of the biggest shake-ups in recent history in Fortnite occurred at the start of Chapter 7, with players landing on the Battle Royale Island after surfing a wave after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-the-battle-bus-fortnite-chapter-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shocking destruction of the Battle Bus</a>. However, the iconic vehicle isn’t gone for good.</p>







<h2 id="h-battle-bus-returning-to-fortnite">Battle Bus Returning to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Survival. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1996338694383714586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Twitter</a> was shared confirming the safety of the driver, alongside a message that read “The Bus Driver, who was obliterated by an energy beam last week, just texted me this.”</p>



<p>The exchange of messages included one from the driver himself, saying “i lived *****,” and a dramatic return to Fortnite is expected to take place later today.</p>



<p>Players have been hard at work completing quests to repair the Battle Bus, including finding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-custom-battle-bus-pieces-chapter-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom Battle Bus pieces</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-bus-wheels-pump-n-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Bus wheels</a>, and the work has seemingly paid off, with Dummy successful in their repairs.</p>



<p>The return of the Battle Bus coincides with the return of additional modes to Fortnite, following a brief absence, with Reload, Blitz, and Ranked now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-roadmap-blitz-reload-og-delulu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available from December 4</a>.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG remains unavailable for the time being until the launch of a new OG Season on November 11, while Delulu is back for Chapter 7 the following day.</p>



<p>At this stage, it’s not clear whether the surfing mechanic will be removed entirely or retained with a varied approach to landing in matches.</p>

            <p>Arrowhead trusts the newly-announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film director, and has shut down any comments suggesting the director should at least try the game before taking on the adaptation.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">Fast &amp; Furious' Justin Lin would be taking the director reins for Sony's upcoming Helldivers adaptation</a>, which will be based on Arrowhead's game. On this announcement, it was revealed that Lin is not a gamer himself, and actually used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film.</p>

<p>However, while this move was clearly enough to win over those within the film business, it caused a bit of scepticism with some over on the game's Discord server. In fact, one user tagged Arrowhead's studio head Shams Jorjani asking if they could direct the adaptation instead.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Jorjani did not take the user up on the offer, and instead showed his support for Lin's work. "Let Justin Lin work his magic," <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1445530210098352138">Jorjani replied</a>.</p>
<p>In a further exchange, another member of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> Discord asked the Arrowhead exec to ensure Lin "plays the game at least once" or checks out some gameplay footage. Again, Jorjani affirmed that Lin is the right person for the job.</p>
<p>"I trust Justin," the Helldivers 2 CEO said, adding: "He did a great job on the Star Trek movie."</p>

<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after it was announced, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p><p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>

But, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> finally here, Nintendo is changing that... in Japan, at least.</p>
<p>Yes, a new wave of Metroid merch is now available <em>exclusively</em> at the Nintendo Stores in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Fukuoka and the Okinawa pop-up. Just to really rub salt in the wound, it's also available on the <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/feature/feature_met001?">My Nintendo Store</a>, <em>exclusively</em> in Japan. *<em>sigh</em>* Back to looking longingly at plane tickets, it is.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cehjxlsy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p><em>Update: Well, it looks like Nintendo has answered our wishes! Although it appeared that the merch outlined below was exclusive to Japan, many of the items have just cropped up on the <a href="https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/205546/1889570/22585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fmerchandise%2Fview-all-merchandise%2Fshop-by-franchise-merchandise%2Fmetroid-merchandise" rel="sponsored noopener">UK My Nintendo Store</a>, too.</em> <em>Time to beef up those Christmas stockings!</em></p>
<p>Simply put, the new range is awesome. There's a super cute Baby Metroid keychain, a Morph Ball zip-up pouch, a 'gadget case' for all your wires and charging banks, and even glasses so you can 'cheers' Prime 4 in style.</p>

<p>The real winners, mind you, are the Metroid ice cube tray (not available on the EU store) — because why have cube-shaped ice, when it <em>could</em> look like a tiny alien? — and the Arm Cannon pillow, which, yes, <em>you can actually wear</em>.</p>

<p>The full collection ranges in price from 2,420 yen / £12.99 for the keychain, up to 6,600 yen / £37.99 for the Arm Cannon pillow.</p>
<p>And if the above has got you in the mood for even more merch, the squishy Metroid amiibo is now back in stock on the <a href="https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/205546/1889570/22585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fmetroid-amiibo-metroid-collection-000000000002006766" rel="sponsored noopener">UK My Nintendo Store</a> for <strong>£12.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Those unable to get their hands on any of the above can still take joy in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which arrives on Switch and Switch 2 <em>today</em>, instead. We called Samus' latest adventure "one of the very best Metroid games of all time" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>, and today, the wait is finally over!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Diablo IV: Season of Divine Intervention Lands on December 11, Bringing ‘Evolved Monsters’ and Many More Changes]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-divine-intervetion-lands-on-december-11/</link>
            <guid>1372660</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard Entertainment has announced that Diablo IV: Season of Divine Intervention is going live on December 11, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-ptr-tests-big-core-changes-itemization-monster-combat-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after several weeks of testing on the Public Test Realm</a>.</p>



<p>The game's eleventh season introduces 'evolved monsters', as they were described by the studio, increasing the challenge players will face when playing the latest installment in the studio's acclaimed hack-and-slash action RPG series. Monster AI and affixes have been overhauled: enemies react more dynamically, elites and champions hit harder and come with over twenty new affixes, champion packs are formalized, and packs clump less. These changes apply across all Diablo IV content, including Nightmare Dungeons.</p>



<p>Blizzard also releases the long-awaited itemization overhaul with Diablo IV: Season of Intervention:</p>



<ul>
<li>Non‑unique items now drop with four base affixes instead of three, and Sanctification (channeling Angelic power into gear) becomes a final, irreversible upgrade that can add a bonus legendary power, Greater Affix, special Sanctification affixes, and 5–25 extra Quality while locking the item from further modification; Sanctification, which occasionally can even make items indestructible, is earned via Heavenly Anvils and Heavenly Sigils at higher tiers.</li>



<li>Tempering now lets players pick a specific affix from a recipe instead of rolling randomly; items get only one tempered affix, but charges are infinite, and Ancestral items can occasionally upgrade the tempered affix into a Greater Affix. </li>



<li>Masterworking uses a new Quality (0–25) stat that increases base damage/armor/resists and all affix values by 1% per Quality level; Masterworking adds 2–5 Quality per upgrade, with costs scaling by current Quality, and a final Capstone Bonus roll at max Quality that boosts one random affix (Greater included) by 50%.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>As previously announced, Blizzard has also overhauled the defense stats to equalize effective Health across classes better and builds. Diablo IV: Season of Intervention introduces rating‑based Armor and Resistances (with diminishing returns and Armor now reducing all damage types), a new Physical Damage Resistance, and a unified Toughness stat that summarizes effective HP against each damage type and can be compared on item tooltips. Many skills and Paragon nodes that granted generic damage reduction now give multiplicative bonuses to Armor, or all Resistances; Fortify is redesigned from DR into an extra Life reservoir that slowly heals the player character at the cost of Fortify.</p>



<p>Potions have been redesigned as well. They're now reduced to a base stack of 4, but now provide an instant 35% max‑life heal, and passively regenerate one charge every 30 seconds. Life on Hit, Life Regeneration, Life on Kill, and Healing % are buffed and more available, potion tier upgrades are removed, and Welcome Back Booster handling is adjusted for future seasons.</p>



<p>There are significant tweaks to the Season Journey, too. Season Rank is replacing Renown on the Seasonal Realm; players advance through the ranks by completing objectives and a Capstone Dungeon at each tier, earning Skill points, Paragon points, Smoldering Ashes, cosmetics, Heavenly Sigils, and other rewards. The Eternal Realm, on the other hand, keeps traditional Renown with some adjustments. </p>



<p>Five Capstone Dungeons (Vault of the Crucible, Hellish Descent, Enclave of Darkness, Den of the Apostate, Breach of Sin) have now been built into an all-new system aimed at challenging progress through the many difficulty tiers, from Hard through Torment III, as the character grows in power. Despite Capstone Dungeons stating a suggested level at which to attempt them, their difficulty does not actually scale with the character's current level.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GRZOQEKCPXRQ1764270043784-scaled.webp"></a></figure>



<p>Story-wise, Diablo IV: Season of Intervention features the angel Hadriel aiding Sanctuary's heroes. In Seasonal Realms, players follow his light in towns to start the seasonal questline. The Lesser Evils each invade a specific endgame mode: Duriel takes over Helltide, Belial corrupts The Pit, Andariel infests the Kurast Undercity, and Azmodan becomes both a permanent world boss and a summonable challenge in Hawezar with variant powers from the others; their minions gain themed affixes and visual readability updates.</p>



<p>Killing each Lesser Evil unlocks two Divine Gifts tied to that boss. Gifts have a Reward track plus Corrupted and Purified socket options that change difficulty and benefits for activities like Helltide, The Pit, Undercity, and World Bosses (for example, more socketables from Pangs of Duriel but harsher maggot threats, or extra Tower/Pit upgrades in exchange for lethal Belial eye beams). Divine Gifts level up as players farm their associated content, and Purified slots for each Lesser Evil unlock at specific Season Rank milestones (Duriel IV, Andariel VI, Azmodan VIII, Belial X).</p>



<p>Looking ahead, in Patch 2.5.2 (tentatively slated for early 2026), the multi‑stage timed dungeon The Tower and its Leaderboards return in Beta: Tower difficulty tiers will unlock independently, some problematic bosses will be removed, and class and party‑specific leaderboards will track clears by tier, time, date, platform, and mode (Normal/Hardcore) with filters for friends and clans.</p>



<p>Diablo IV will get its second expansion, following 2024's Vessel of Hatred, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at some point in 2026</a>. The original plan was <a href="https://wccftech.com/annual-diablo-4-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to release annual expansions</a>, but it ultimately proved unfeasible for Blizzard. </p>

            <p>Access to Roblox has been blocked in Russia, with federal censorship and media oversight agency Roskomnadzor accusing the platform of distributing content "justifying terrorism" and spreading "LGBT propaganda". According to Russian media reports, the state body said Roblox has become rife with content that can "negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Roskomnadzor also cited reports of sexual harassment of children and the sharing of intimate images in their accusations against Roblox. As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/12/04/russias-media-regulator-blocks-roblox-for-justifying-terrorism-and-spreading-lgbt-content">Euronews</a>, Roblox Corporation have issued a response to the ban via a spokesperson. </p>
<p>"We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone," this statement reads. "We have a deep commitment to safety and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform."</p>
<p>Roblox has faced plenty of criticism over how it protects young players in the last few years, with the US state of Louisiana <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox-calling-platform-perfect-place-rcna225144"> bringing a lawsuit against Roblox Corporation over child safety concerns</a> in August, and Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill accusing the game of being a "overrun with harmful content and child predators".</p>
<p>The company behind the blocky game that's actually many games have responded to this by pushing to limit interactions between minors and adults, introducing measures like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-to-roll-out-facial-age-estimation-technology-for-everyone-after-us-prosecutor-dubbed-it-the-perfect-place-for-pedophiles">mandatory selfie-based "facial age estimation technology"</a>.</p>
<p>"We’re taking this step as part of our long-term vision as a platform for all ages," Kaufman added. "We expect that our approach to communication safety will become best practice for other online platforms, whether lawmakers pass laws requiring age verification for all platforms in the future or not." Though, checks of this nature <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord">haven't always proven to be totally bulletproof</a> when deployed in response to the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-begin-rolling-out-xbox-account-age-verification-checks-in-response-to-uk-online-safety-act">the UK's Online Safety Act</a>.</p><p>As far as their accusation of spreading "LGBT propaganda" is concerned, Roskomnadzor have a long history of going after games which they deem to violate the Russian government's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-signs-law-expanding-russias-rules-against-lgbt-propaganda-2022-12-05/">ultra-conservative views</a>, which have seen draconian laws <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/30/russia-supreme-court-outlaws-lgbt-movement">carve away the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people</a> in the country. Just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-block-steam-game-with-queer-art-in-russia-after-state-censor-attacks-it-for-promoting-non-traditional-sexualities">last month</a>, Valve blocked Flick Solitaire from the Russian version of steam, after Roskomnadzor accused the card game of "promoting non-traditional sexualities".</p>

<p>Fortnite has revealed a surprise Nickelodeon collab with Danny Phantom is arriving in the Item Shop tomorrow, with the secret somehow being kept from the flood of leakers on social media.</p>



<p>Epic Games’ boasts a proud history of featuring a wealth of impressive collabs in Fortnite, shown by the recent The Simpsons mini-season, but keeping collabs under wraps and coming as a surprise is difficult. This time, though, they’ve managed to do so.</p>







<h2 id="h-danny-phantom-coming-to-fortnite">Danny Phantom Coming to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Surprise! Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1996323949882523779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">teaser post</a> showcasing what to expect to appear in the Item Shop on Fortnite this week, it was subtly revealed that a Danny Phantom bundle will land on December 5.</p>



<p>The bundle will feature skins for Danny Phantom and Samantha Manson, though further items like Back Bling, Emotes, or Gliders have not been showcased, nor has the price been revealed.</p>



<p>Keeping such a huge collab under wraps is a big win for Fortnite, and the fact that Danny Phantom falls under the Nickelodeon banner could open the door to further huge collabs in the future.</p>



<p>It’s already been widely reported that SpongeBob SquarePants is coming to Fortnite later this Chapter, which, along with Danny Phantom, suggests other collabs could be on the cards.</p>



<p>The potential for collabs has increased following the release of Sidekicks, which allows for smaller characters to feature in collabs, whereas previously, there were size restrictions that prevented small-sized characters from starring prominently.</p>



<p>So far, the only Sidekick collabs have come from The Simpsons, with Scratchy and Homer’s Pig, but there are plenty of options for the future.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, the fantastic musical action game, is losing Denuvo anti-tamper support early next year, according to a post on the game's official Steam page.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626840?l=english">The post</a>, succinct in scope, announced suddenly that the software would be removed in a mandatory patch on the 16th January, 2026. However, it also states the game's own anti-tamper measures will still remain in place, so it shouldn't become totally unguarded from tampering hands.</p>
<p>The reason why? Well, the post gives the following justification: "This adjustment is intended to provide a more stable and efficient service environment. We sincerely appreciate all players who continue to support the game through legitimate use."</p>

<p>So important is this update in the eyes of developer Tango Gameworks that Hi-Fi Rush will apparently not launch unless this patch has been installed. The comments responding to this Steam post are largely filled with fans celebrating the removal of Denuvo. The software has proven controversial for a variety of reasons - one of them being the online connection requirement which has rubbed folks the wrong way over the years.</p><p>We do know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-sequel-being-considered-positively-but-tango-gameworks-considering-various-opportunities">Tango Gameworks is considering a Hi-Fi Rush sequel, among other potential projects</a>. It had been in development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-2-already-in-development-six-months-when-krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks">for six months at the point when Krafton bought the studio</a>, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-newscast-hi-fi-rush-redfall-sign-game-pass-xbox-publishing-model-failing">Tango Gameworks' sudden closure by Microsoft</a>. In recent news, new-owners Krafton has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation">its intention to become an "AI-first" company</a> - good luck Tango!</p>
<p>If you've not tried out Hi-Fi, we recommend you remedy that as soon as possible. You can give <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Eurogamer's review</a> a read for an idea of what you've been missing, in which Ed Nightingale wrote: "Vibrant and self-assured, Hi-Fi Rush happily embraces the 00s' cheese - and is all the better for it."</p>

            <p>Supertrick Games, the developer of Let it Die sequel Inferno, which launches today, has issued a statement on the game's AI use following controversy from earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/made-with-ai-let-it-die-sequel-inferno-discloses-substantial-generative-ai-use">Let it Die: Inferno's AI disclosure on Steam</a>, which suggested substantial use of generative AI during development, across art, music, and voice, but it did not specify in detail exactly how AI had been used. The statement issued in response to the reaction provides that detail, and in general, the game's AI use seems less than suspected.</p>
<p>For example, the game does use generative AI to create the voices of two characters, but these characters are an AI-driven machine and a "mysterious life form", so the AI-generated voices were a deliberate, creative choice to fit the character, rather than a cost-cutting exercise.</p>

<p>"These specific cases use AI-generated voices intentionally to match the nature of the characters," the statement read. "These voices are not derived from or modeled after any human performers, ensuring no copyright concerns." Otherwise, "All in-game characters are voiced by human performers."</p><p>AI-generated art was used, meanwhile, "to generate rough base images" for background posters, InfoCast (news) insert images and in-game reading material, which the team's artists then "painted over, refined, and adjusted by hand". The AI tool also apparently helped the team observe copyright laws, although there's no explanatory detail on how.</p>
<p>Finally with regards to music, AI was used to begin the creation process for music you'll hear in the background in Iron Perch. Specifically, and I don't really understand this, so excuse my lack of sound creation technicalities, AI was used to generate stems, which I believe are collections of audio tracks, or mixes. "Once all stems were exported," the statement read, "few were manually edited, but most were rebuilt from scratch."</p>
<p>And that's it.</p>
<p>Let it Die: Inferno is the sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-is-grasshoppers-refreshingly-different-return-to-form">eccentric and asymmetrical multiplayer game Let it Die</a>, by Suda51's studio Grasshopper - Supertrick was a co-creator. This new game ditches the asymmetrical multiplayer idea for direct, real-time multiplayer, in an on-trend PvEvP framework. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/#app_reviews_hash">Initial reviews on Steam don't seem to be positive</a>, however, with a Mixed overall response.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> has been banned in Russia, accused of distributing LGBTQ+ propaganda and terrorism-related extremist materials.</p>
<p>Roskomnadzor, the Russian watchdog for communications and censorship, described Roblox as "rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children". It also flagged reports of sexual harassment of children.</p>
<p>"We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate," a Roblox spokesperson told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/">Reuters</a>, "and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone."</p>
<p>The spokesperson added Roblox has "a deep commitment to safety and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform."</p>
<p>Roskomnadzor has a track record of restricting access to Western media and tech it deems to be in breach of Russian laws, from Duolingo to WhatsApp and Telegram. Last week, the watchdog <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-threatens-full-ban-whatsapp-tass-reports-2025-11-28/">threatened to block WhatsApp entirely</a>.</p>
<p>Russia has of course long had anti-LGBT laws in place, in 2013 banning the "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" to minors.</p>
<p>Yet Roblox also has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">criticised for its questionable safety measures</a>, with a report last year claiming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">platform had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation</a>. This year, Roblox has been steadily improving its safety standards, most recently <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat">requiring age checks for all those wishing to communicate through the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Still, Russia isn't the first country to ban Roblox. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye">Türkiye also banned access to the platform last year</a> to "ensure the protection of our children".</p>
<p>"We've spent almost 20 years making Roblox one of the safest online platforms for our users, particularly the youngest, and ensuring the safety of our users is at the core of everything we do," said a Roblox spokesperson to Eurogamer at the time.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-boss-says-problem-of-predators-is-an-opportunity-for-the-platform-in-disastrous-interview-following-latest-child-safety-measures">Roblox boss David Baszucki appeared on the New York Times podcast Hard Fork to discuss safety measures</a>, but he described the problem of predators on the platform as an "opportunity", in what amounted to a disastrous interview.</p>

            <p>Dispatch studio AdHoc knew it was taking a risk releasing the game in weekly episodic installments, and was actually advised not to do it. However, the studio did it anyway, and the risk paid off.</p>
<p>AdHoc itself has been around for seven years, with its superhero workplace comedy being in full production for three of those. Dispatch is the studio's first game, so it was understandably a big deal when its first episodes were released back in October of this year.</p>

<p>"Seven years, <em>one </em>game," AdHoc's CEO and executive producer Michael Choung reflected in a recent interview with <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=788256D6-9F75-4793-8D5F-28F96B1C91A8&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1">Knowledge</a>, before adding: "But what's inside that game is basically three feature-length premium animated films and a videogame, all meshing and rubbing up against each other."</p>
<p>The studio exec noted the team decided it wanted to go with a completely original narrative driven episodic format, and was not simply about making life easy for them. "And part of it was because we weren't really thinking about feasibility," Choung said. "We were just thinking in terms of creative and player experience."</p>
<p>But, while this approach worked for AdHoc and Dispatch, Choung admitted releasing the game in one go would have been "the conventional wisdom".</p>
<p>"Everyone was telling us not to do it," Choung said of the game's episodic format. "We had internal debates about it but the story was always structured that way." So while other release cadences were floated - such as bringing the game out in two halves or even one episode per week - the studio eventually settled on two episodes, once a week.</p><p>"A lot of the reasons for it we're now seeing the results of," Choung furthered. "There would just be a longer time period for it to be covered." The developer remarked that we have been seeing this kind of release schedule with TV series for decades now.</p>
<p>"We knew that it gives a 'the train is leaving the station, but not just yet - I can still make it' kind of feeling across weeks, and people catch on. When we look at concurrent user numbers across the drops, it's exactly that - it just kept doubling every week. Again, conventional wisdom says: whatever you guys do in the first week, the second week is going to be half that number. It was literally the opposite. Those things, we anticipated.</p>
<p>"I don't think we anticipated the scale of it."</p>

<p>But while Dispatch has seen immense success with its release schedule, Choung admits this is not something every studio should now attempt, especially if there isn't the creative backbone to support it. "It's insane to do," he said. "From every metric, from a production perspective, no one should do this. If you think episodic alone is going to be the thing that dictates success for you, then good luck!"</p><p>The exec continued: "If the creative is strong, you can cut it up however you like, and it probably is going to make it through, even if it's a poor decision. If we'd said, 'We're just going to release the whole thing', it probably would have done ok. But it probably wouldn't have been as big as this… If you go episodic with a not-so-great story, you're flirting with people that aren't attracted to you whatsoever."</p>
<p>But while Choung cautioned releasing a game with an episodic format, he said if others did try, AdHoc would of course "be thrilled if it worked out".</p>

<p>Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">the studio is now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p><p>Meanwhile last month, AdHoc said it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maybe-ai-is-a-creative-solution-if-you-arent-a-creative-person-dispatch-devs-take-a-firm-refreshing-stance-against-ai">no interest in using AI to replace voice actors or game development</a>. "AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one," creative director Nick Herman said, before adding: "Maybe it's a creative one if you <em>aren't </em>creative."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> is ditching its Denuvo anti-tamper software as part of developers' Tango Gameworks transition to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-owner-krafton-have-acquired-tango-gameworks-and-the-hi-fi-rush-ip">working under new owners Krafton</a>. A fresh patch has been released swapping logos to reflect that switch in management, and you'll need to install it before mid-January if you want the game to stay playable.</p>
<p>Krafton, of course, bought up Tango after the studio's former parent company Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">announced plans to shut it down</a> back in May, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a> developers Arkane Austin and Mighty Doom creators Alpha Dog Games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Cue Hi-Fi Rush <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626833?l=english">patch 10</a>, released earlier today. It makes no changes to the game bits of the game, instead mainly handling the admin of crossing out old publisher logos in favour of Krafton ones.</p>
<p>There is, however, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626840?l=english">one key wrinkle</a> it's well worth you being aware of. The patch has removed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-the-state-of-drm-in-2020">Denuvo's controversial anti-piracy/DRM software</a> from the game, with support for it set to end in full as of January 16th. As a result of that, Tango make clear that grabbing patch 10 by that date is mandatory, as "significant changes" made to Hi-Fi Rush's "internal system structure" in the Denuevo removal mean that the game'll no longer run without this latest patch installed after that point.</p><p>"Please note that even after Denuvo is removed, the game’s own anti-tampering features will remain active and will not affect normal gameplay," Tango added, just in case you were wondering if the security guards were being permanently dismissed from Hi-Fi's door.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-fi-rush-review">our review</a> of the rhythm action romp, Hirun Cryer dubbed it "a fantastic cocktail of rhythm-based head banging and action-packed platforming". "The combat system is surprisingly deep and malleable for any style of player and meshing it gently into the musical beat without putting pressure on the player is a deft touch," he continued. "Its writing and characters might leave a little to be desired, especially when compelling narrative beats are so painfully overlooked, but that doesn’t stop the entire package from being a certified banger."</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/long-awaited-fortnite-skin-now-available-but-it-costs-170/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A long-awaited Fortnite skin has finally been made available, although the initial unlock is locked behind the purchase of a $170 piece of hardware.</p>



<p>Fortnite skins continue to flood out, with both collabs and Epic Games creations becoming hits, and the Clyde skin has been on the eyes of players for a while, providing a mix of a raccoon and a cowboy. However, it won’t be cheap initially.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-clyde-skin-initially-locked-behind-backbone-controller">Fortnite Clyde Skin Initially Locked Behind Backbone Controller</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hefty purchase. Image via Backbone</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although the Clyde skin could be available in the Item Shop at a later date, the initial option to claim the skin is locked behind the purchase of a $170 Backbone Pro Controller.</p>



<p>Existing owners of a Backbone Pro can also receive the Clyde outfit by redeeming a code, which unlocks a quick in-game Quest before Clyde is added to your Locker.</p>



<p>The code is redeemable only once per user, and cannot be resold, exchanged, or redeemed for cash, though that’s unlikely to stop some people trying to flog their codes on the market.</p>



<p>Anyone else wanting the Clyde outfit will have to fork out the price to purchase the controller, or wait for the Outfit to potentially be available in the Item Shop in the future. However, there’s no indication of how long that will be, nor is the price of such a release known.</p>



<p>The Clyde outfit can also only be unlocked by playing Fortnite on iOS, Android, PC, and cloud streaming, although it will be usable across all platforms when unlocked.</p>

The update also includes some improvements towards ongoing performance issues that sometimes cause important sounds not to play as intended, an issue that's especially prevalent on large maps.</p>

<p>Rush and Breakthrough are also getting some balance changes designed to improve the game mode's flow, and even out the win rate between attacking and defending teams. Seige of Cairo, for example, will get a few boosts to the attacking side, including one more attacker tank in Sectors 1 and 3, and an updated capture area on B. Rush attackers are also getting a small boost, with changes to M-COM locations on Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak.</p><p>More balance tweaks are coming across both modes, including changes to vehicle spawns on multiple maps, with full details still to come in the update's patch notes. Battlefield Studios says all changes made are intended to "reduce bottlenecks, remove frustration points, and create more consistent and engaging fights around objectives."</p><p>Outside of these specific changes, the Winter Offensive update will include some broader improvements aimed at increasing reliability and predictability across the game. This includes ongoing improvements to hit registration, another element that was previewed in the Battlefield Labs mini-test, as well as changes to make damage feedback feel more immediate and understandable.</p><p>Other balance tweaks include improvements to soldier visibility, with a focus on visibility in dark and low-contrast areas, and soldiers in low-profile positions. Weapons will also be getting a balance pass to improve handling, something the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1996248184381641171" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield Studios post</a> says is always a priority for the team.</p><p>When it comes to Redsec, Battlefield 6's battle royale spinoff, Battlefield Studios is lowering the availability of tanks in the mode, in response to player feedback that the vehicles feel too powerful. The team is also investigating how armor works in the mode, and may be making changes in that area in future updates.</p><p>Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.0, Winter Offensive, will arrive on December 9 on all platforms. More in-depth patch notes for the upcoming update will be inbound over the next couple of days.</p><p>In another recent blog post, Battlefield Studios revealed that its anticheat protections have been incredibly effective, leaving popular shooter is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-almost-cheater-free-studio-claims/1100-6536589/" data-ref-id="1100-6536589">98% cheater-free</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game media industry is at a pivotal crossroads. Major outlets are conglomerating and downsizing, resulting in experienced and budding journalists alike being kicked to the curb amid the homogenization of both trade and consumer publications under the umbrellas of massive corporations.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For reporters, it means constricting career pathways, wage stagnation, and the likelihood of burnout as those who remain are forced to fight for the scraps that are left—all while attempting to cover a titanic industry that only continues to swell.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That spells disaster for readers, too. Fewer voices and outlets can only lead to coverage that lacks breadth, depth, and diversity. That isn't to say those still plying their trade aren't doing important work, but it is simply impossible to cover a cultural, artistic, and economic beat that continues to grow at such a rapid pace with a resource pool that only seems to dwindle with each passing day.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The numbers—at least, as I suspect they're viewed in the corporate offices of Ziff Davis, Valnet, and others—simply do not add up. So what now?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The upshot (if you can call it that) of widespread layoffs and degeneration across the media landscape has been the rise of worker-owned (often reader-funded) independent outlets that are attempting to prove it remains possible to carve out a sustainable career in journalism in 2025 by publishing informative, engaging, and personable reporting while shunning the insatiable growth mindset.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-banned-in-russia-for-hosting-lgbtq-content" target="_self" data-discover="true">Roblox banned in Russia for hosting LGBTQ+ content</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Live or die, we'll do it blogging the way we want&quot;">"Live or die, we'll do it blogging the way we want"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One such outlet is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://postgame.substack.com/about">Post Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the solo project of former Polygon editor-in-chief Chris Plante, who established the weekly ad-supported podcast to deliver NPR-style interviews in 90 minutes or less. Post Games content is free to access, although it's possible to subscribe for $5 per month to access bonus segments, video episodes, and other perks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer, Plante explains they passed 1,000 paid subscribers at around the five-month mark but has no wish to turn that early success into infinite growth. Instead, he intends to ensure the business remains "microscopic."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don’t have a desire to grow any time soon. My only goal is to create a sustainable business that allows me to tell stories that matter to my listener," he adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Plante says going independent has enabled him to tell stories that were simply incompatible with the expectations of a major website like Polygon, which has fundamentally different business needs. "It’s not the switch to independent media that changed what I cover. What’s responsible for the shift is the change in business model and audience size," he continues. "At a large publication that depended on ad revenue, I needed to create stories that appeal to a colossal audience of gamers. At a much, much, much smaller publication, my goal is to serve a small audience, but to make things that they love enough to pay for each month.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-netflix-to-sell-spry-fox-back-to-founders" target="_self" data-discover="true">Netflix to sell Spry Fox back to founders</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For example, at Polygon, millions of readers appreciated our high-quality guides. But they were unlikely to pay for them, since other guides (while not always of the highest quality) were easily and freely available elsewhere. With Post Games, a comparably small audience of listeners wants to learn the nitty-gritty stories behind NSFW game development or the Atari CEO’s plan to save the old brand, but since they can’t find that depth elsewhere, they're willing to subscribe to the free podcast RSS or pay $5 a month for extended episodes on Patreon."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Being able to tell stories that might have been deemed off-limits in the corporate sphere was a similarly attractive proposition for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PeopleMakeGames">People Make Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (PMG) founder, Chris Bratt. The UK-based independent video publication was founded by Bratt in 2018 and currently has over 3,000 paying subscribers on Patreon.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hideo-kojima-to-deliver-keynote-at-gdc-2025" target="_self" data-discover="true">Hideo Kojima to deliver keynote at GDC 2026</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bratt says those subs pay for all costs associated with PMG's extensive reporting—which often requires the team to spend numerous months pursuing a single story. This is not normal within the world of conventional, corporate media.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We just did a story that took about six months to complete, involved flights from the UK to Croatia and we also brought on board a script editor and a media lawyer to guide us through the process as well. There's simply no way we could have requested that sort of budget in my previous job and so that story would likely not have happened," says Bratt.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like Plante, Bratt says PMG doesn't have any formal growth targets. "I suppose I'm aware that we don’t publish many videos in a year—perhaps five or six—and so if I had one personal goal for 2025, it'd be for me to be able to look back at the work we've done over the last 12 months and feel proud of the stories we have chosen to dedicate our time to. Other than that, we need to make sure our funding stays reasonably stable," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We've been very lucky to create jobs for ourselves on PMG that we really enjoy and that we really care about. For me, sustainability is about protecting that feeling from whatever other motivations may seek to disrupt it. Growth for growth's sake feels like an absurdly easy way to turn all of this into something we don’t actually want to do."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a sentiment echoed by Chase Taylor-Carter, co-founder of independent tabletop game outlet </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rascal.news/">Rascal News</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, who stresses that independence also protects writers from the fleeting whims of corporate owners.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Worker ownership means that we survive or fail on our own terms, not because an executive we've never met is 'pivoting' into the latest technology and decides they no longer need writers. It also means that we can work directly with paying subscribers—who we cheekily call our stakeholders—to fashion a version of digital journalism that understand audience needs and the mercurial shape of the internet," he says. "Our position is precarious, but the freedom earned is incredibly gratifying. Live or die, we'll do it blogging the way we want."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;The success of larger legacy publications is often placed in opposition to the interests of their readership&quot;">"The success of larger legacy publications is often placed in opposition to the interests of their readership"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In some instances, the rise of independent outlets was born out of a desire for change. In other cases, necessity became the calling card—but all roads seemingly lead back to a conflict between reporters who entered the profession to tell stories that speak to readers, only to find themselves cut adrift and admonished in a corporate landscape that actively dismantles that ideology.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The success of larger legacy publications is often placed in opposition to the interests of their readership or the welfare of their workers. Worker-owned publications typically have a greater vested interest from the people making the content, and can place those same priorities in parallel with each other," says Alice Jovanée, co-founder of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rogue.site/">Rogue</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rogue broke cover earlier this year and was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/polygon-staffers-reunite-to-establish-independent-video-game-website-rogue">formed by a group of former Polygon writers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> who were laid off after the website was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/polygon-sold-to-valnet-many-staff-laid-off">sold to Valnet by Vox Media</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Jovanée explains the website's definition of sustainability stresses "equity, transparency, and empathy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We all want the site to succeed, and we're all vested partners in that success, but that can never come at the expense of anyone's mental or physical well-being," she adds. "We provide a detailed outline of our compensation in our mission statement, but it boils down to everyone getting a mutually agreed-upon number of shares of our monthly revenue after expenses. Freelancers are paid a flat rate that will never be less than the value of a single share. No financial information is private within the members of Rogue, so everyone knows where the money is going."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://aftermath.site/">Aftermath</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is another independent, worker-owned outlet that emerge in the wake of layoffs—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-kotaku-staffers-launch-independent-game-and-culture-website-aftermath">this time at Kotaku</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Co-founder Luke Plunkett says the decision to establish the website was essentially "forced" on the team after they were jettisoned by former employer G/O Media, who he claims were "only interested in making a line go up."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like many of their peers, the Aftermath team sought to learn from everything they hated about their previous roles. "Stuff like pageviews and uniques, which we lived off at sites like Kotaku, are almost worthless metrics to us. The only numbers that really matter are newsletter subscribers and, more importantly, paying subscribers, since they're pretty much our sole source of income at the moment," he explains.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can write what we want to write. Nobody is shaping our coverage, nobody is telling us to tone something down, or 'both sides' an issue, and nobody is making us rush to hit a deadline. We're in complete control of everything that goes on the site, which is great for us, but is also a huge reason people subscribe to us; they know they're getting zero bullshit because there's nobody in a corner office telling us what not to do (we don't have an office!)."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Precarity dwarfs the capacity of every working journalist&quot;">"Precarity dwarfs the capacity of every working journalist"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Plunkett says he would love to see a decline in traditional corporate media in exchange for a rise in independent outlets, but concedes getting there might be tricky. Some of the associated challenges are universal. Almost everybody I spoke with agreed it remains hard to manage your workload when you're tasked with not only being a reporter but essentially running an entire business. Burnout, then, remains a huge risk.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is also the awkward task of convincing people to pay for something they have become accustomed to receiving for free. I doubt there is a single reporter who doesn't believe their work is worth at the very least a few dollars a month (none of these sites are charging big bucks), but consumers might feel differently.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, what's in it for them? According to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> founder Stephen Totilo, who established the newsletter (which generates an annual gross of over $140,000, before Substack takes 10 percent and payment processor Stripe takes 3 percent) after departing Axios, there is ample reason to support independent journalism.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"True, honest, earnest, fearless, curiosity-driven reporting and criticism of video games can be valuable. The highest quality execution of such work largely costs money to produce. Reporters gotta eat. Critics (most of them) need to wear clothes," he says. "But the media business–not just the games media business but the whole enterprise–is a rickety operation where profits are meager and even the mightiest publications would not be able to rake it in without the help of ancillary businesses such as recipe apps and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Therefore, all independent media really is is an attempt to produce the work I described in a way that can survive financially."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Therein lies a perhaps lesser-discussed barrier for entry. Almost everyone I spoke to was an established reporter with years (and often decades) of experience, and they all acknowledge the inherent risk of going independent. How, then, can more inexperienced writers hope to chart a similar path—or, at the very least, learn from their more veteran peers, who might not have the resources to start anything resembling a newsroom?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"While independent media can in some ways take the place of faltering corporate outlets, it has so far involved a smaller number of people, many of whom, like me, have the benefit of years' of reader recognition of my byline," continues Totilo. "A shift into independent journalism for me was risky but had decent odds of paying a full-time wage. Someone who is not known in the field faces far worse odds. That is why I cheer the sight of outlets such as Aftermath bringing aboard more writers and why I began working with freelancers at Game File earlier this year earlier than I had planned. It's crucial for independent media to find ways to lift up others who also might be able to produce great journalism and criticism."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Totilo also underlines some of the other challenges of being a smaller—and in his case, often solo—operation. "The biggest drawback is not having a second reporter to bounce stories off of, to pool resources (and sources!) to enhance my ability to get the most accurate and interesting stories to readers. It’s also hard to switch from writing brain to self-editing brain, hence typos. Not every independent outlet is a solo operation, of course, but me being solo impacts my work far more than me being independent," he adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then there are the legal risks. Often, corporate owners will have internal legal teams that can protect journalists (and by extension their sources) when publishing investigative or potentially inflammatory pieces that might rub some of the industry's more litigious companies or personalities the wrong way. Even when an independent site can afford to stump up for legal advice, the costs for even a standard pass can be eye-watering. For instance, PMG recently spent £3,000 on legal fees earlier this year before it felt comfortable publishing a documentary.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pitfalls of independent journalism are there for all to see—and yet, what else can those reporters being forced to plunge into the career maelstrom by trigger-happy corporate employers do but scramble for a lifeboat? The hope is that those who manage to find safe harbor will eventually be able to guide others to shore.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Precarity dwarfs the capacity of every working journalist, from single-person newsletters up to the damn New York Times," says Taylor-Carter. "We cannot simply job create our industry out of existential threat when the problems include fascists' ire and near-complete capture by hypercapitalists. Burdening yourself with that mantle is simply unhelpful and actively self-destructive. Instead, you do what all wise radicals suggest: focus on immediate ability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Platform one writer, one voice whose lived experience or identity would otherwise disqualify them from legacy media. Accept a freelance piece or two when the money makes sense, and treat that assignment with all the solemnity and rigor you can muster. It won't be enough to solve the problem, but our peers grow in number every day and reach out their hands, too. I am the benefactor of outlets like Into the Spine, Unwinnable, and the site now known as Endless Mode. Their dedication to fostering talent kept this industry alive, if only just. I'll be lucky if one person cites Rascal when it's their turn to wax long on their professional path."</span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-rise-and-risk-of-independent-game-media]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has recently being doing the rounds to chat about to his company Absurd Ventures, and his latest tidbit from his time at the Grand Theft Auto studio is the surprisingly revelation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> perhaps owes as much to Victorian literature as it does cowboy films.
</p>
<p>
"I binged on Victorian novels for that," he explains in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/03/i-binged-on-victorian-novels-dan-houser-on-dickens-red-dead-redemption-and-redefining-open-world-games">new interview with the Guardian</a>. "I listened to the audiobook of [George Elliot's] Middlemarch walking to and from the office every day. I loved it."
</p>
<p>
As to why Houser turned to this perhaps unexpected source of inspiration, he explained, "I wanted [Red Dead Redemption 2] to feel from the writing perspective, slightly more novelistic. I thought that was a way of doing something new on the story side – and the game was going to look so pretty, the art was so strong, I thought the story had better really set it up."

<p>
It was his search for the right tone that ultimately led him not just to Middlemarch, but other Victorian fiction, including Sherlock Holmes. And as he noted elsewhere, big 19th-century novels perhaps have more in common with open-world games than is immediately obvious, bringing a "sense of slightly spread out storytelling" that's paralleled in the likes of GTA.
</p><p>
Houser, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">departed Rockstar Games in 2020</a>, formally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-returns-with-new-media-company-absurd-ventures">unveiled his new media company Absurd Ventures</a> in 2023. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-studio-reveals-graphic-novel-and-audio-drama">currently working on A Better Paradise</a>, charting the "ill-fated development of an ambitious but addictive video game project that goes very wrong", which so far spans a novel and podcast series, with a TV series and game on the way.
</p>
<p>
It's also developing a new crime fiction universe, American Caper, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meet-absurdaverse-gta-5-writer-dan-housers-next-big-project">Absurdaverse</a>, a "story-driven action-comedy adventure game".
