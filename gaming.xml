		<p>What is your favourite piece of video game music? If we started humming the opening theme to Halo, how many of you would join in? What about if it was Tifa’s Theme or the theme to Assassin’s Creed? All of these live rent-free in our heads, and no doubt yours too.</p>
<p>This is something that the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA as we all know it, is keenly aware of, and it is to their immense credit that they realised this more than 20 years ago when they held the inaugural British Academy Games Award for Music in 2002, celebrating “excellence in composition for a game music score, through original music and/or creative use of licensed track”.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, composer Jeremy Soule won for his work on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, beating the other nominees: Command &amp; Conquer: Generals, Primal, Republic: The Revolution, TimeSplitters 2 and Return to Castle Wolfenstein. If, like us, you remember playing these games at launch, we can recommend good deals on walking sticks.</p>

<p>It’s with this rich catalogue of exceptional music in mind that BAFTA Games in Concert was produced. Its world premiere at the Royal Festival Hall on Saturday 31 January certainly felt celebratory. Conducted by BAFTA-winning composer Austin Wintory, and backed up by the 65-piece BBC Concert Orchestra and London Voices, attendees were met with iconic video game soundtracks from over the past two decades.</p>

<p>As the ensemble did what they do best, starting with Baldur’s Gate 3, a screen behind them played excerpts from the games they were celebrating. The thing that differentiates this from your average performance, however, is the game footage being cut with real-life singers, placed into a setting that reflects the game — in this case, a red-head in a green dress with Celtic jewellery singing opera.</p>

<p>What followed was a night of fantastic music. Wintory introduced Jessica Curry’s Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture before ploughing straight into Inon Zur’s Fallout 4, followed by Jesper Kyd’s Assassin’s Creed.</p>
<div id="attachment_468571"><p id="caption-attachment-468571">BAFTA Games in Concert features Helldivers 2 –&nbsp;Image Credit: Andy Paradise</p></div>
<p>As excellent as these pieces are — and they are truly excellent, the choir singing the theme to Assassin’s Creed gave me goosebumps — this is where the issues with this performance came to the fore. It could be opening night tech issues, but the human performer intercut with the footage on the screen was playing a wooden flute-like instrument. However, despite seeing his fingers moving, I couldn’t hear him playing over what was in the room. Perhaps the AV team knocked the slider by mistake, but it felt a little off.</p>
<p>The other thing that was obviously missing after Wintory introduced Curry’s phenomenal score was any sort of intro or anecdote about what was to come. This is where real value could have been given to the paying audience — small insights into what each composer thought, liked or was inspired by as they crafted the melodies that have stayed with us for decades. They were in the room, it wouldn’t have been hard to pick their brains.</p>

<p>The best video game music concerts I’ve seen all have insights and trivia from the composer or lead musician to hang the performances on. It’s never for every piece, and it doesn’t have to be, but it provides not only a structure for the performance, but also a frame of reference for those who haven’t played every game that’s being showcased that evening.</p>
<p>Absent such a narrative, the BAFTA Games in Concert felt a lot more like a greatest hits compilation than a celebration, especially in the second half. Hopefully this was just the opening-night settling into a format and future audiences will get to hear why Disco Elysium has the tone they’re hearing, which instrument you see played on the screens during Far Cry 4 and what inspired the music behind Returnal.</p>
<p>Still, it was a night of phenomenal music, played beautifully by some truly expert musicians. You really can’t beat live music, especially when a full orchestra is on stage.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> has been through a sizeable array of changes since launch in February next year, amid some very uncivilised reactions to boat-rocking features like the new age format. The next update, Test Of Time, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-big-test-of-time-update-thatll-bring-back-playing-as-one-civ-for-the-whole-game-is-set-to-drop-this-spring">will restore the ability to play as one civilization through the whole game</a>, while making changes to how victories are earned in the hope of creating some lategame variety.</p>
<p>All these tweaks and rejigs invite a more fundamental question. “Why didn’t they just launch it as an early access game?” I remember moaning to another journalist last year. I should have directed my moaning at executive producer Dennis Shirk, who says that Firaxis are tentatively open to the idea and, indeed, “jealous” of developers taking this approach.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
That’s a snippet from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/interview-civilization-viis-devs-on-the-big-update-meant-to-win-critics-back/">an Ars Technica interview</a> this week in which Shirk and franchise creative director Ed Beach look back on the transition from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization VI</a> to Civilization VII, and what they might try with the hypothetical Civilization 8.</p>
<p>One of the major changes with Civilization VI was that Firaxis had access to lot more player telemetry, compared to Civilisation V, rather than monitoring the feedback on Reddit and fansites like CivFanatics. Amongst other things, they discovered that most players don’t finish a single game, which is part of the reason for Civ 7’s more broken-up, modular historical progression.
</p><p>
Based on the reaction to Civ 7, the devs are trying to get hold of that feedback earlier in development of new mechanics or systems. “It’s the worst-kept secret in the world that we’ve had this external test team for quite a few years called our Frankenstein Group,” Beach told the site.</p>
<p>With publisher 2K’s input, the Frankenstein Group is being expanded into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-will-bring-back-the-ability-to-play-as-one-civ-for-the-whole-game-bypassing-the-divisive-age-system">a larger and more structured playtesting program, the Firaxis Feature Workshop</a>. (I enjoy the implication that a bunch of mad scientists have gone mainstream – I’m picturing Doc Brown, Doctor Octopus and Doctor Eggman at an investor fare, explaining the nutritional benefits of formaldehyde to passing soccer moms.)
</p>
<p>
Officially embracing full early access development (not just preorder-baiting ‘advanced access’) would surely make a lot of sense for Civ, even discounting the ire aimed at Civ 7. After all, even the best 4X strategy games tend to evolve a lot throughout their shelf lives. Ars Technica popped the question, and Shirk had this to say: “It’s one of those things that you can never say never. As developers, we’re always looking at that jealously because we see that it’s a great opportunity.” 
</p>
<p>
Even so, I doubt it’ll ever happen, because when you present yourself as selling an unfinished game, it’s harder to charge $70 or more for it upfront. Still, perhaps the wilting fortunes of Civ 7 will persuade 2K and Take-Two Interactive to be more calculating with the game's development process.</p><p>Civ 7 set a series record for preorders, but has struggled to match its predecessors in terms of Steam concurrent users. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-insists-projections-for-the-lifetime-value-of-civilization-7-are-very-consistent-with-our-initial-expectations-for-the-title-despite-slow-start">Speaking in August last year</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick confessed that the game had gotten off to a “slow start” with the caveat that “Civ has always been a slow burn” and “right now our projections for the lifetime value of the title are very consistent with our initial expectations for the title.” The publishers have yet to share any total sales figures.
</p>
<p>
The broader question around Civ going early access is whether “early access” really means anything, any more, inasmuch as “early access” has sort of bled into “live service". Most games of a certain scale receive a number of updates post-launch, and players have come to expect them, with a vocal minority pillorying games as “dead” if too many months go past without substantial changes. I think there’s probably a longer feature to write there – do you have any thoughts?

<p>Regular new content drops continue to take place in Fortnite, and February 2026 is stacked, with Epic Games dropping a big teaser roadmap of what to expect.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/">Battle Royale</a> behemoth is in the latter stages of the current season, but a new Fortnite Festival season has only just begun. Additionally, updates are also coming to other modes, including Reload and Fortnite OG.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for all of the dates and new content coming in the Fortnite Roadmap for February 2026, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-complete-fortnite-february-2026-roadmap">Complete Fortnite February 2026 Roadmap</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to come. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite has plenty to add in February with the month-long Love Legends event, featuring new collabs, free rewards, and more.</strong></p>



<p>The Love Legends event kicked off immediately after the update on February 5, with the first major content coming the following day with the second wave of KPop Demon Hunter Skins. </p>



<p>Later in the month, players can expect new weapons and items in Battle Royale, along with the long-awaited return of The Seven.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the major additions coming to Fortnite in February 2026, as revealed by Epic Games. New announcements will be added regularly.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Fortnite Addition</th><th data-align="center">Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">February 6</td><td data-align="center">– KPop Demon Hunters Wave 2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 7</td><td data-align="center">– Battle Royale Power Hour<br>– Pink Storm Shield</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 13</td><td data-align="center">– Nitemare Island Returns<br>– Cupid’s Crossbow</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 14</td><td data-align="center">– Battle Royale Power Hour</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 15</td><td data-align="center">– Fortnite OG Ice Storm Live Event</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 19</td><td data-align="center">– DeLorean Return<br>– Lantern Fest Reload Map</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 21</td><td data-align="center">– Battle Royale Power Hour</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 23</td><td data-align="center">– Return of The Seven<br>– New Item</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-there-more-coming-in-february-2026">Is There More Coming in February 2026?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Fortnite will definitely have plenty more to add in February 2026, including content added beyond February 23.</strong></p>



<p>Epic Games’ reveal teaser only covered up until February 23 and the additions beyond that date will likely center around the long-awaited return of The Seven.</p>



<p>There will also be a significant build-up to the first seasonal change of 2026, with Chapter 7, Season 2 kicking off in early March.</p>



<p>Players should also expect further collab skins to drop in the Item Shop, as Epic Games is on a roll of major additions so far this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite continues to drop regular updates, but the latest has caused some confusion, with some questioning whether the popular Zero Build modes have been removed.</p>



<p>Zero Build is a more accessible version of Fortnite’s popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> mode, removing all of the complicated build mechanics from the game, and it regularly attracts hundreds of thousands of players.</p>



<p>Tweaks in Fortnite’s February 5 update have raised some questions for Zero Build, but Insider Gaming is here to clear the air.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-is-zero-build-in-fortnite">Where is Zero Build in Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Settings. Screenshot by FGZ</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Zero Build is found in the lobby settings for the mode,  the same area where options for Team Size and Squad Fill are located.</strong></p>



<p>Once the game mode you want to play has been selected, the option for Zero Build can then be toggled. Here’s a step-by-step approach to the full process.</p>



<ol>
<li>Log in to Fortnite as you normally would.</li>



<li>Choose a game mode with Zero Build available (Battle Royale, OG, Reload, Blitz).</li>



<li>In the lobby screen, select the options found above the yellow Play button, where it should currently say: Build, Solo.</li>



<li>In the pop-up screen, click where it says ‘Zero Build.’</li>



<li>Select any other options as you desire, including Ranked and Team Size.</li>



<li>Hit ‘Close’ to return to the lobby, with your changes saved, or press ‘Play’ to begin searching for a match.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-did-fortnite-remove-zero-build">Did Fortnite Remove Zero Build?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Fortnite has not removed Zero Build from the game, but there have</strong> <strong>been some changes to tidy up the lobby and mode selection screen.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite has evolved significantly since Epic Games initially released the title, regularly adding new game modes for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>Additionally, there’s far too much to keep track of when all the popular Creative modes are taken into account.</p>



<p>In the update on February 5, Epic Games made a big change to the mode select screen. However, Zero Build is still available across all major modes, including Fortnite OG, Reload, and Blitz.</p>

            <p>A new report has claimed that Gears of War E-Day is eyeing a release window in the second half of 2026, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> tentatively targeting a launch some time this Summer.</p>
<p>This report, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad">written by The Verge's Tom Warren</a>, claims that Microsoft wants both Gears of War E-Day and Fable to dodge the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, with Tom Warren writing: "I understand Microsoft has a good idea of when both should launch, but it's also keen to avoid being too close to Grand Theft Auto VI's November 19th date."</p>
<p>The report also touches on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> Remake, which The Verge reports is in "active development". The article also states that Bethesda wants the game to reach a similar bar of quality as the Oblivion Remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-in-the-shadow-of-skyrims-mountains-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-still-matters">which was well-received in part due to its faithfulness and level of polish</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, The Verge reports that Double Fine's The Kiln is aiming for an April release, and new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> content is due for a reveal soon. All of this comes with a caveat, with Warren sensibly writing: "Don't be surprised if any of these game dates slip or change -- such is the reality of video game development."</p><p>If these release windows are accurate, which they may very well be (The Verge has a solid track record with this stuff), then Microsoft certainly has a packed 2026. Fable, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-finally-gets-a-release-window-following-xbox-developer-direct-will-launch-in-autumn-2026">which we already know is due to launch some time this Autumn</a>, recently got a dedicated showcase in an Xbox Developer Direct. There's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, set in Japan and landing on the 19th May.</p>
<p>If these dates and release windows are accurate, what do you reckon of Xbox line-up this year? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-hbo-series-announced-craig-mazin-creating/</link>
            <guid>1427842</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline reports</a> that <span><strong>a Baldur's Gate 3 HBO series is now underway</strong>, with&nbsp;<strong>Craig Mazin</strong>&nbsp;attached as&nbsp;</span>creator, writer, showrunner, and executive producer. Mazin is primarily known for his acclaimed work on the TV shows <strong>Chernobyl</strong> and <strong>The Last of Us</strong>, the latter of which is particularly relevant because it's also an adaptation of a game. Previously in his career, he also co-wrote the screenplays for movies like Scary Movie 3 and 4, The Hangover Part II and III, and The Huntsman: Winter's War.</p>



<p>The big difference compared to the adaptation of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us is that the Baldur's Gate 3 HBO series will pick up from the end of the game made by <strong>Larian Studios</strong> and continue from there. On the one hand, this is perfect because Larian famously <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided against doing Baldur's Gate 3 DLCs or even a sequel</a></strong>, opting to <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make a new game based on its own <strong>Divinity IP</strong></a>. Many fans who loved characters like <strong>Astarion, Shadowheart, Gale, Karlach, Lae'zel, Wyll</strong>, and <strong>Halsin</strong> were eager to learn what would happen to them next. </p>



<p>On the other hand, <strong>there's the little issue that one of the game's main features is the ability for players to influence the events in major ways</strong>. For instance, in my playthrough, I killed both Lae'zel and Astarion. Even setting aside such extreme measures, the creators of the Baldur's Gate 3 HBO series will inevitably have to choose a specific thread for each character from among the various choices originally available in the cRPG.</p>



<p>Anyway, Mazin will be helped by executive producers <strong>Jacqueline Lesko</strong>, <strong>Cecil O’Connor</strong>, and <strong>Hasbro Entertainment's Gabriel Marano</strong>. Moreover, <strong>Chris Perkins</strong>, the former Head of Story at <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>, will be involved as a consultant. Craig Mazin shared the following statement to go along with the news:</p>



<p><em>After putting nearly 1000 hours into the incredible world of Baldur’s Gate 3, it is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created. I am a devoted fan of D&amp;D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it. I can’t wait to help bring Baldur’s Gate and all of its incredible characters to life with as much respect and love as we can, and I’m deeply grateful to Gabe Marano and his team at Hasbro for entrusting me with this incredibly important property.</em></p>



<p>Deadline's report adds that alongside characters from the game, the Baldur's Gate 3 HBO series will also feature some new ones. Indeed, it does sound like the new characters could be the main protagonists, though that remains unclear at the time being. By the way, <strong>Mazin has reportedly reached out to some of the game's excellent voice cast to participate in the adaptation in some capacity</strong>. There are no dates yet, but we know Mazin is preparing to shoot <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-may-wrap-up-in-three-seasons-not-four-it-certainly-seems-that-way-says-hbo-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the third and final season of The Last of Us adaptation</a>. Presumably, his next project will be Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>Lastly, if you were wondering whether game developer Larian would be involved in any way, <strong>CEO Swen Vincke</strong> <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019646146587525143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a> that the endings were written specifically to serve as the base for new adventures, and added that <strong>Mazin has already reached out to them to have a chat about the TV show</strong>, so there's a chance Larian might pass on some of their ideas.</p>

            <p>Everything's a show! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoAhmWlS8sY">Everything's a show</a>! Everything's a show! Everything's a show! Did you know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> is a show? Well, it will be soon. One that'll carry on from the events of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and star characters both old and new. Baldur's Gate 3 developers Larian, though, don't seem to be directly involved outside of the show's boss asking if he can pop into their studio for a chat.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/">Deadline</a> report that this Baldur’s Gate HBO drama is set to be helmed by Craig Mazin, co-creator of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a>' TV adaptation, who'll write, executive produce and showrun it. As you might expect, a bunch of executive producing chairs have also been assigned to bigwigs at Hasbro and subsidiary Wizards of the Coast, the current owners of the Baldur's Gate series/name/all of its various bits.</p>
<p>According to Deadline, the BG show won't be a relatively straightforward adaption of tales the games have already told, instead aiming to be a "continuation to the games, telling a story that takes place immediately after the events of Baldur’s Gate 3, as the characters — old and new — are dealing with the ramifications of the events in the third game".</p>
<p>The site add that the show, which isn't tied to meshing with any new Baldur's Gate games in development, "draws deeply" from BG3 and "not so much from the first two games which are not official source material". From the sounds of it, the older entries' influence might be limited to wider themes/bits which form part of all three games and are key aspects of wider DnD lore. Mazin also reportedly plans to reach out to some of Baldur's Gate 3's voice actors in the hopes of potentially getting them involved in the show.</p><p>Despite the Baldur's Gate 3 emphasis here, that game's devs Larian don't look to be directly involved in crafting the show, at least in terms of having full hands-on roles like Bethesda have with Amazon's Fallout adaptation. That arguably isn't entirely surprising, given they've moved back to working on their own games post-BG3 with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">Divinity</a>, rather than agreeing to make a Baldur's Gate 4 with Hasbro's blessing.</p>
<p>Larian boss Swen Vincke's opted to take the <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019646146587525143">diplomatic approach</a> to news of the show. "The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures," he wrote, adding that to his knowledge none of Larian's writers are consulting on the show. "There's plenty of directions they could go. I'm eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He's reached out for a chat so we'll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts."</p>
<p>Larian publishing head Michael Douse, meanwhile, has opted to take a slightly less diplomatic approach. Going on a lengthy <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp">retweeting spree </a>of random folks' posts about not watching the show now they've learned Larian won't be crafting it directly. He also had a <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019586400476164184">wee shout at Deadline</a> for not asking Larian about the show prior to publishing their article and responded to a Geoff Keighley post about Larian not being involved in the series by writing: "except that we made it popular enough for it to be referred to as Baldur's Gate 3". Finally, he's gathered some thoughts into <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019572415878070680">a thread</a> that's rather less unhinged and essentially boils down to hoping the show does the work of Baldur's Gate 3's writers justice.</p>
<p>We'll see if it does, but there's no timeline been given as of yet for when the show'll arrive.</p>

		<p>It is reported that<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/baldurs-gate-3/"> Baldur’s Gate</a> will be coming to television screens, with the show following on from the end of the third game.&nbsp; <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/">Deadline</a> reports that HBO have secured the rights to make the show and also the talents of Craig Mazin, co-creator of The Last of Us television series and the fantastic Chernobyl.</p>
<p>Mazin is a big gamer and has completed Baldur’s Gate 3 on Honor mode, a single-save difficulty setting featuring smarter enemies, higher enemy health, and punishing ‘Legendary Actions’ for bosses. It is reported that the series will include existing and new characters, and Mazin will be reaching out to the voice actors from the game to try to get them into the television series.</p>


<p>“After putting nearly 1000 hours into the incredible world of&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate 3, it is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created,” Mazin said. “I am a devoted fan of D&amp;D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it. I can’t wait to help bring&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate&nbsp;and all of its incredible characters to life with as much respect and love as we can, and I’m deeply grateful to Gabe Marano and his team at Hasbro for entrusting me with this incredibly important property.”</p>
<p>Mazin is also a long-time fan of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and has been running games as a Dungeon Master for fifteen years.&nbsp; HBO have <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/hbo-casey-bloys-the-pitt-heated-rivalry-euphoria-interview-1236700801/">strongly hinted</a> that the third season of The Last of Us will be the final season, so it would be logical that Baldur’s Gate would be Mazin’s next project.</p>
<p>In an interesting twist, the Baldur’s Gate series will “co-exist” alongside another Dungeons and Dragons show that is coming to Netflix, The Forgotten Realms.</p>

<p>“We’re thrilled to continue our partnership with Craig Mazin on&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate,” Francesca Orsi, EVP, Head of HBO Drama Programming said. “His deep and long-standing passion for the source material paired with his remarkable talent for building immersive worlds filled with rich, compelling characters, promises ground-breaking results.”</p>

Craig Mazin, showrunner on HBO's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-wins-series-another-emmy">award-winning The Last of Us adaptation</a>, has confirmed he's giving <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> the TV treatment next, with the new show set to continue the story of the acclaimed fantasy RPG - although developer Larian seemingly won't be directly involved.
</p>
<p>
As per <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/baldurs-gate-hbo-craig-mazin-1236654094/">Variety</a>, HBO is developing the Baldur's Gate 3 TV adaptation, hot of the success of its live-action The Last of Us series, with Mazin serving as both as showrunner and executive producer on the new project.
</p>
<p>
In a statement accompanying the news, Mazin claimed he'd put "nearly 1000 hours" into the video game version of Baldur's Gate 3. "It is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created," he said. "I am a devoted fan of D&amp;D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it. I can't wait to help bring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> and all of its incredible characters to life with as much respect and love as we can."
</p>
<p>
Francesca Orsi, HBO's executive vice president and head of drama, added that Mazin's "deep and long-standing passion for the source material paired with his remarkable talent for building immersive worlds filled with rich, compelling characters promises groundbreaking results."
</p>
<p>
After news of the adaptation broken, The Games Awards' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2019563522339082576?s=20">took to social media</a>, claiming Larian had told him directly the studio - which officially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-bids-final-farewell-for-real-this-time">wrapped up work</a> on Baldur's Gate 3 last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">moving away from D&amp;D</a> - has "no involvement in the series." Larian boss Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019648134645957061?s=20">later confirmed</a> no Larian writers were consulting on the adaptation 'to his knowledge', but did note Mazin had reached out "to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us. From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan which gives me hope."
</p><p>
"We worked incredibly hard on making Baldur's Gate 3 worthy of its legacy," Vincke wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019646146587525143?s=20">separate social media post</a>. "Its characters and narratives are the result of many teams working together and I think I can speak for them all in saying that they'll think this is cool and hope that what comes next will enjoy the same level of passion."
</p>
<p>
"The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventure," he continued. "There's plenty of directions they could go. I'm eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He's reached out for a chat so we'll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts."
</p>
<p>
Larian director of publishing Michael Douse also <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019572415878070680?s=20">shared his thoughts</a>, writing, "I've spent the last eight to 10 years of my life with the writers and creators of Baldur's Gate 3 and they're the most incredible storytellers and creators in the space. Only hope is that they get both the credit deserved and the characters are represented at the same level as the game.
</p>
<p>
"Our stories are built by fierce comeraderie and resolve," Douse added. "I have watched them write and write and write and through respect for audience and material come up with some of the finest shit I have ever played. I hope TV allows for the same thoroughness."
</p><p>
There's no word on when HBO might be looking to bring its Baldur's Gate 3 adaptation to air, but Mazin will be tied up with his The Last of Us show for a little while longer at least. While Mazin had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">previously confirmed a four-season plan</a> for his post-apocalyptic series, insisting there was "no way" its story could be wrapped up sooner, HBO boss Casey Bloys <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-previously-insisting-there-was-no-way-hbos-the-last-of-us-show-could-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons-it-looks-like-itll-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons">recently indicated season three will be its last</a>. "It certainly seems that way," he told Deadline, "but on decisions like that, we will defer to the showrunners."

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>"I think a lot of survival games are really boring," Geoff 'Zag' Keene, founder of Deep Field Games, developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> adjacent co-op survival game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a>, said in a recent interview. However, despite these strong words, please hold onto your spit take for just a moment.</p>
<p>It's not the first time Keene's said something like it and, in fact, in <a href="https://gamemakersnotebook.libsyn.com/abiotic-factor-with-geoff-zag-keene-and-henry-feltham">the episode of The AIAS Game Maker's Notebook</a>, he's responding to a question about when he said it to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/abiotic-factor-interview-survival-immersive-sim/">cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer back in 2024</a>. So, please, calmly swallow your spit take liquid of choice, so I can explain why I'm reporting on something Keene originally said two years ago.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Abiotic Factor is a survival game that throws out a lot of what you find in stalwarts of the genre. Rather than building a life on an abandoned island by cutting down trees, planting crops, and using crafting benches to expand your toolbox until you've built a somewhat secure life for yourself in a virtual wilderness, you put on the pocket-protector-fitted lab coat of a scientist having a hell of a day in an underground facility going through a containment breach.</p>
<p>If you've played through Half-Life, the set up, at least, is a lot like the beginning of Gordon Freeman's adventure in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa</a>. There's been an incident, everything is on fire, and it's up to you to explore the facility and try to put things right. Scavenging resources from the environment to cobble together weapons and equipment as you go.</p>

<p>While Keene starts from the same place in the podcast, that original quote from 2024, he takes his answer in a different direction, reflecting on a game that only came out at the end of last year. Perhaps you can guess what it is…</p><p>"I find a lot of survival games very boring," Keene continued, ignoring the future RPS writers who would need to provide context for why they're writing a news article about previously said words. "I find a lot of them... just ticking off boxes, and going through the motions. They have hunger, thirst, and all this other stuff, but they don't have anything of substance."</p>
<p><em>[If you're listening along, I'll let you in on a secret. I'm actually skipping ahead in the interview a bit here, so I can create a structural coherence to his answer that will have a more dramatic payoff.]</em></p>
<p>"I find a lot of survival games are just doing mechanics, flooding content in, and it's so meaningless," Keene continued, definitely not skipping anything out in between. "It's iterations of the same thing. I play one game and I play another and it looks different but it's got the same mechanics that I just played and no story to set it apart. I'll try out a survival game on Next Fest, my timer is 10 minutes per game before I'm like 'Eh, not interested.'"</p>

<p>While loaded up with <em>stuff</em> to do, what's missing, Keene says, is attention paid to the world. "We've all played Early Access survival game #27. [It's] in the forest with trees chopping, picking up rocks, but there's no wind or ambience in the air because it's not finished yet," Keene said. "If you're going to ship the game to the public, make sure it has some of the mood and the atmosphere. I don't know if I'm that good of a game developer, I don't think we've turned the survival genre on its head or anything, but we know how to [establish] our tone right, our mood, and the atmosphere of the game. Look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>, that's like 90% of the battle, getting a place that people want to exist in."</p><p>Coming from a different place, I arrived at a similar conclusion when writing about Arc Raiders for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-a-good-shooter-but-its-also-where-i-go-for-a-walk-and-relax">last year's Advent Calendar</a>. Its take on a ruined Earth is somewhere I play, but often it's just a world I like to spend time in. Even with all the killer robots. There is a sometimes beautiful, sometimes mournful peace that hangs over the landscape. While there are many other extraction shooters, and several big names in the space before Arc Raiders came along, I've not found that peace playing the others. There is always a tension in the air, and, while there is a lot of fun to be had, I won't say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> or Hunt: Showdown are chill games.</p>
<p>Also being interviewed was Henry Feltham, Abiotic factor's producer and narrative designer. He says how the team landed on two of the game's defining qualities: "The obvious ones we inverted. Being inside rather than outside, and being smart rather than strong. It doesn't take a lot to give the whole thing a completely different vibe."</p>
<p>I'd recommend listening to the whole interview. Not only do the developers dive into their many attempts to make the game without guns, there's also a story about DayZ creator Dean Hall pitching his game Icarus for Google Stadia while he snowboarded down a mountain.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 physical is a Game-Key Card</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're planning on getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/digimon-story-time-stranger">Digimon Story Time Stranger</a> for the original Switch, in case you missed it, there'll be an upgrade similar to what Bandai Namco offered with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_sparking_zero">Dragon Ball Z: Sparking! ZERO</a>.</p>
<p>If you boot up the Switch version of the title on the Switch 2, you'll be able to download a free update that will give you graphical improvements, which are the equivalent of the Switch 2 version. Here's the rundown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When playing the Nintendo Switch version of Digimon Story Time Stranger on the Nintendo Switch 2 version...Graphics will be improved to the equivalent of the Nintendo Switch 2 version after downloading the update data."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<figure data-uuid="228312d27cadc"><a title="Digimon Story Time Stranger" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/228312d27cadc/digimon-story-time-stranger.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As previously noted, on Switch 2, you'll have access to 'Performance' and 'Quality' mode options, and if you return to the Switch version, the "graphics will revert" and these options will not be available. Here are the resolution and performance specs once again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On Nintendo Switch 2, players will have the option of playing in Quality Mode (4K HDR, up to 30FPS docked; Full HD, up to 30FPS handheld) or Performance Mode (Full HD, up to 60FPS docked and handheld)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to online listings, the Switch 2 version of this title is a Game-Key Card while the original Switch version is a full physical release. So if you're a collector, the Switch release might be your best option when the game launches on these platforms in July.</p>
<p>In some other Bandai Namco news from the latest Partner Showcase, the company announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tales-of-arise-beyond-the-dawn-edition">Tales of Arise</a> is on the way to the Switch 2 this May.</p>

<p>"Stop an alien threat from destroying all human life"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last year, during The Game Awards, it was announced the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/saber-interactive">talented team at Saber Interactive</a> would be reviving the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/turok-origins">Turok</a> IP with a new game known as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/turok-origins">Turok: Origins</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an update during <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo's latest Partner Showcase</a>, it's been revealed the new sci-fi shooter (featuring both first and third-person perspectives) will be releasing on the Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p>Here's some information about the intergalactic story, which will see you fighting for survival against a terrifying alien threat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In <em>Turok: Origins,</em> players will take on the mantle of the ancient Order of the Turok, heroic guardians of unimaginable power locked in a battle for survival against ferocious creatures and a terrifying alien threat that seeks to destroy all human life in the galaxy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guardians will be able to fight solo or in online co-op as they take on a variety of creatures, dinosaurs and bosses across a range of environments. There will also be the ability to unlock and upgrade advanced weaponry and DNA Powers.</p>
<p>Saber is the same team that worked on and helped out with multiple ports during the Switch generation including titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/world_war_z">World War Z</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crysis_remastered">Crysis Remastered</a>.</p>

            <guid>1427698</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Jerk Gustafsson is the studio director at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/machinegames/" id="87686">MachineGames</a>. MachineGames has been developing Wolfenstein games since 2014, and Gustafsson says he still plans to finish the trilogy.</p>



<p>During a recent discussion with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/machinegames-on-being-part-of-microsoft-going-back-to-the-office-and-wolfenstein-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry</a>, Gustafsson admitted that, because of the time it takes to make video games in 2026, he may only have a few more projects in his career, about two or three to be more specific.</p>



<p>When asked if one of those games would be a third <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wolfenstein/" id="2953">Wolfenstein</a>, he remained coy, but expressed the intent to always return to the series, saying, “We wanted to finish the trilogy. And when we do that, that is something that I don’t want to comment on. It can be now, it can be later, but we’re not done with it. That’s what I can say.”</p>







<h2 id="h-machinegames-also-worked-on-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">MachineGames Also Worked on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>While there hasn’t been a Wolfenstein game since 2019, Machine Games was hard at work for the release of 2024’s Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Released first on Xbox platforms, the game made its way to PlayStation 5 in 2025 and will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-avoids-game-key-card-on-nintendo-switch-2/" id="174746">arrive on the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.</a></p>



<p>Gustafson discussed the game’s development and its departure from Wolfenstein’s first-person action. He admitted that it’s the first game the team has ever made that’s rated T for teen rather than M for mature.</p>



<p>When discussing some of the challenges of working on the game, he admitted it was hard for him to convey the overall goal, noting that it took until the final year of production for things to click. </p>



<p>He noted that he is proud of the games they make, enjoys expanding his horizons, and even wants to test himself and his team by making a mobile game, saying, “It just requires a different skillset that we don’t have at MachineGames. Maybe sometime in the future, but who knows?”</p>







<p>For now, there’s no confirmation of a third Wolfenstein game from MachineGames, but the team’s goal is to make one more game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">House of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian Studios’ multi-award-winning fantasy RPG, Baldur’s Gate 3, is set for its own TV series on HBO, and will be helmed by The Last of Us co-creator Craig Mazin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Deadline</u></a>, a television adaptation of the acclaimed game set in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe is in development at the network, and interestingly, will be a continuation of the story from the Baldur's Gate 3 game. The television show will reportedly take place after the events of Larian's RPG and follow the characters players grew to love over time as they grapple with the aftermath of its world-changing ending.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The series will be helmed by Craig Mazin, no stranger to adapting video games to live action, following his work co-creating HBO's The Last of Us with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann. A huge fan of Baldur's Gate 3, Mazin told Deadline that "After putting nearly 1000 hours into the incredible world of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, it is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I am a devoted fan of D&amp;D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it", he continued. "I can’t wait to help bring <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> and all of its incredible characters to life with as much respect and love as we can, and I’m deeply grateful to Gabe Marano and his team at Hasbro for entrusting me with this incredibly important property."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By taking on this project that has no ties to any other Baldur's Gate game in the pipeline, Mazin will have free rein over what story he wishes to tell, but we do know that it will include both existing and brand new members of the BG3 cast. Shadowheart? Karlach? Astarion? Who are you most looking forward to seeing on your television screen? Mazin reportedly plans to reach out to the cast of the games to sound out how best to approach their roles in the TV show, and if they'd want to be involved, something The Last of Us did with Merle Dandridge reprising her role as Marlene, for example.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the ending of Larian's multiple game of the year award-winning RPG can vary massively depending on how you chose to play the game, so it will be highly intriguing to see how Mazin and co. go about choosing which ending is canon for them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may well be a while yet before we see Baldur's Gate arrive on the small screen, with Mazin still attached to complete production on The Last of Us, which is gearing up for its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-certainly-seems-that-way-hbo-boss-gives-clearest-indication-yet-that-the-last-of-us-will-end-with-season-3">third, and maybe final</a>, season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.
