              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">One of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s greatest strengths is its scalability. You can run it on the highest of high-end PCs or a years-old phone, and it's going to be playable either way. Players across all platforms can join parties and play battle royale, Creative, Fortnite Festival, or almost anything else the game has to offer--sans Saves The World mode--and each player will get a performance and visual experience tailored to their platform. Among many other reasons it's found such lasting success, this is key. You're not locked out based on where you're playing.</p><p dir="ltr">For my tastes, I still want that high-end experience, so I play Fortnite on my PC or my Xbox Series X most of the time. Switch 2 players have now joined the fray as the latest platform to host Epic's everything-game, and though it's a downgrade for those like me, for Switch 2 players, it's a sizable step forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Playing Fortnite on Switch 2 was nearly my first time playing anything on Nintendo's new hybrid console--save for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/">Madden 26 a few days ago</a>. Like that experience, I found Fortnite can't keep up with Xbox Series X|S or PS5. Textures are noticeably fuzzier; the pop-in of far-away objects, like trees as you glide down to the island, is quite common; and character models lack the same fidelity of the other major consoles. At first, this irritated me. A new console should move the needle, I felt. Why have I been frantically chasing down a Switch 2 for sale if it can't even offer me an experience the likes of which I've been playing for half a decade elsewhere?</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo, of course, is the reason. The Switch 2, like the original Switch, isn't trying to achieve performance parity with those other consoles. The Switch's debut was essentially Nintendo making it clearer than ever that it wasn't interested in the graphical arms race with Sony and Microsoft, and I can't really blame it given the success of its machine. The Switch 2 definitely moves the needle closer to those consoles, but certainly falls short.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508461-4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508461" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508461-4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508461"></a><figcaption>Switch 2 doesn't put Fortnite on par with other consoles, but neither does it have to.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508461-4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, two things began to change my mind as I played more Fortnite on Switch 2. For one, handheld mode hides some of those aforementioned blemishes. Texture fidelity is hardly noticeable when I'm playing the game in my hands. The same goes for the character models. My assortment of skins--so many I hope I'm never able to calculate the true cost--look totally acceptable in Switch 2's handheld mode. And whether I was playing on a monitor or in my hands, the game offers a smooth 60fps frame rate.</p><p dir="ltr">I've often felt like I can't easily tell the difference between 4K and 1080p. If I intently look for it, I'll spot it, but in typical play sessions, it's the 60 frames I really demand because that's what I notice effortlessly. This is where Fortnite on Switch 2 really succeeds. The game looked terrible on Switch, to be blunt about it. That's no longer the case. On Switch 2, the frame rate boost carries it a long way forward, and eventually helped me forgive some of its other shortcomings compared to my preferred platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">I said there were two things that changed my mind about Switch 2's Fortnite. The other is Lego Odyssey. The survival-crafting game that debuted in Fortnite's massive 2023 update looks awesome on the Switch 2, and it occurred to me how important that will be on the kid-friendliest console out there. Once I played Lego Odyssey on Switch 2, I felt my frustration evaporating quickly. I pictured my kids playing this mode next to me on the couch while I joined them on my Xbox, and I'm sure that use case will be a popular one for families that game together.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite has been reinventing itself for years now. With experiences like Unreal Editor for Fortnite overhauling Creative mode, music integration in the form of Fortnite Festival and a new mode that lets players have a dance party with Sabrina Carpenter, and the abundance of Fall Guys and Lego games to play, Fortnite hasn't truly been a battle royale game in a long time. That remains its most-popular mode today, but the sum total of the game's other virtually limitless games to play make up a great deal of what younger players are playing when they boot up the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Switch 2 isn't going to be where I play Fortnite battle royale, but it will surely become the go-to platform for my kids when they want to play Lego games, music games, or anything Creative has to offer. And in any case, it's going to look much nicer than the potato version that ran on the original Switch. I expect players who are siloed in Nintendo's ecosystem will be very impressed with Fortnite on Switch 2, even as I and others recognize it's still a technical half-step toward levels of detail we've been enjoying since 2020.</p>

            <p>Summer Game Fest's 2025 showcase is over for another year. Packed end-to-end with a whole slew of announcements and teasers, it even included a shadow-dropped <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> DLC, Overture.</p>
<p>If you missed part of it, all of it, or simply don't want to scrub through 120 minutes to see if the announcement you were hoping for popped up, here's every single thing announced at Summer Game Fest 2025 in the order they were revealed. Pray for my tendonitis. Enjoy!</p>
<h3> Mortal Shell 2</h3>
<p>The show kicked off by noting how many of Steam's biggest sellers this year have been from indie developers, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-shell-2-revealed-at-summer-game-fest-coming-to-ps5-xbox-and-steam-in-2026">threw us into the evening's first announcement: Mortal Shell 2</a>. The dark fantasy action game, developed by Cold Symmetry, is coming to PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series in 2026.</p>

<h3>Death Stranding 2</h3>
<p>We already knew that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-upcoming-death-stranding-2-panel-and-gameplay-showcase-will-be-streamed-online">Death Stranding 2 was getting its own premiere</a> separate from the main Summer Game Fest stage - that's coming tomorrow, 8th June - but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> accompanied Geoff on stage anyways, treating us to a "special exclusive clip for SGF", which you can check out below. The teaser lets us spend a little time with Neil and Lucy, after which Kojima reminded us that the sequel is set to release later this month on 24th June, 2025.</p>

<h3>Chronicles: Medieval</h3>
<p>"Thou shalt not kill, so the priests tell us, so the lord commands," says some gruff, disembodied voice as we zoom in on a blacksmith blacksmithing. Apparently, ambitious men do not listen, though, which is why Chronicles: Medieval invites you to forge your destiny in a host of epic historical battles when it drops in early access in 2026.</p>

<h3>Sonic Racing: Cross Worlds</h3>

<h3>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds x Minecraft World</h3>
<p>After introducing us to the latest Sonic racing game, Sonic creator officer, Takashi Iizuka took us into a CrossWorld promotion with Minecraft, where familiar Minecraft folk zoom around the place in little rectangular carts. It's quite the spectacle. There's no release date yet, just the promise that it'll be "drifting across dimensions soon".</p>

<h3>Mouse P.I. for Hire</h3>
<p>Join private investigator Jack Pepper on a guns blazing, jazz-fueled adventure in Mouse: P.I. For Hire. The inaugral title from Fumi Games, Mouse P.I. stars Troy Baker and combines "the charm of hand-drawn rubber hose animation inspired by the classic cartoons of the 1930s with the adrenaline and action of an explosive first person shooter". It's out later this year on PC via Steam, Switch, and current- and last-gen consoles.</p>

<h3><strong>Atomic Heart 2</strong></h3>
<p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/atomic-heart">Atomic Heart</a> sequel brings you back to the retrofuturistic universe, full of new characters and dangers, promising to "raise the bar for what an open-world action RPG can do". It's coming to PC and consoles, but we don't yet know when. That's not the only thing Mundfish has been busy with, however...</p>

<h3><strong>The Cube</strong></h3>
<p>From the makers of Atomic Heart comes MMO RPG shooter, The Cube. Set in the Atomic universe, a giant, levitating Cube with rotating rows and edges appears one day, and hidden within is an unknown equation capable of altering the laws of reality. The constantly rotating edges create "unique gameplay combinations." Again, there's no release window let alone a date, but it's coming to PC and consoles.

<h3>Wu-Tang Rise of the Receiver</h3>
<p>Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver is a co-op action RPG with anime-style fighting where players will face increasingly challenging battle Chambers to "the tune of reimagined Wu-Tang Clan tracks while decking out their own custom fighters". Say it with me - there's no firm release date - but it looks to be coming to PC via Steam and EGS.

<h3>Into the Unwell</h3>
<p>Dive into The Unwell as one of "several flawed and heavily medicated misfits in this delightfully despondent third-person roguelite game" that also homages 30s-style cartoons. We didn't get much more than that other than the you can play alone or with up to two friends, and a closed beta is coming to Steam soon, so sign up now if you're keen.

<h3>Splitgate 2</h3>
<p>Splitgate 2 - often referred to as "halo with portals" - is in the pink in the sequel, showing that even with a light, bright pastel palette, you can still get your arse kicked. It released at the end of May, so this is just a reminder that the follow-up free-to-play shooter is finally here.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aether-iron-sets-up-beautiful-world-for-gritty-noir-story<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine a 1930s New York where technology had been created to float parts of the city into the sky, flying cars were common, and everyone spoke with enough pulp to put Humphrey Bogart to shame. This is the world of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em>, a new detective game, by Seismic Squirrel.</p>

<p>At SGF we had a chance to sit down with Tyler Whitney, Narrative Lead, and Joshua Enz, Producer, to talk about what inspired the game, what experience players can look forward to, and even got some time hands on to explore a picturesque bar in the clouds, take on a mysterious man in car on car combat, and explore our home base.</p>

<h2>What A World To Live In</h2>

<p>In <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em>, players take on the role of Gia, a down-on-her-luck detective who has had one too many jobs go sideways. Returning to her employer, Mr Black, she's handed the job of escorting Nellie to the Lowers.</p>

<p>This job quickly escalates as both Gia and Nellie are thrown into danger and important and mysterious documents that Nellie was holding close are stolen.</p>



<p>The game is broken up into two gameplay styles, the first is exploration. As Gia you'll be able to interact with scenes and locations, having conversations with those you come across, or perhaps find an item or two to pick up for use later.</p>

<p>My first experience of exploration was in a bar with a glass floor, the view extending down to nothing but clouds below, the interior decked out as you'd expect a speakeasy of the time, but with a 'Neo-Decopunk' aesthetic.</p>

<p>When asked about what led to the idea of merging the past, of 1930s New York with a futuristic concept like that of Aether, the simple response from Whitney was that "we know that we want to have something beautiful, but was different." Whitney also offered up his love of movies like 2004's Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow, though he jokingly accepted that he might be in the minority for that.</p>

<p>Seeing the gleaming skyline of the city it reminded me of the Metropolis of Superman's Silver Age. Beautiful skyscrapers that tell you that this is a safe and glorious place to live, that's ignoring the other locations in this game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aether-iron-interior.jpg?itok=DHq_o0fO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aether-iron-interior.jpg?itok=iPyhMbLv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>After picking up a bottle of booze and prodding the passed-out drunk, I approached the bar to open dialogue with the barkeep, a fellow employee of Mr Black.</p>

<h2>Explore And Interact With The World of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em></h2>

<p>Dialogue in<em> Aether &amp; Iron</em> is fully voiced, letting you really get sucked into the noir dialogue filled with flowery phrasing and an internal monologue that exposits without feeling like it's spoonfeeding information to the player.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additional Voice &amp; Text Options On The Way<br>
It was explained to me that after <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> launches at the end of the year they will be adding Spanish and Chinese text localization, as well as working to add Spanish and Japanese Voices</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whitney attributed the passion for this genre with characters like Phillip Marlowe. He spoke about how he was given reign to write and that he then made it "flowery as hell." He wanted to write in a way that would make you feel, he laughed referencing the line "walking a knifed edge with bare feet" and how even now the thought of that made his toes curl in response.</p>

<p>At various points in conversation you'll be prompted with choices, these might be of no consequence merely moving the conversation forward, could only be possible if you have a certain item, or could be settled with a speech check.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aether-iron-taxi-rank.jpg?itok=-OlNwGYd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aether-iron-taxi-rank.jpg?itok=7agGhhh2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>An element of the speech checks that I loved were the inclusion of dice rolls. Each would prompt you to roll two dice, add your relevant stats, and any companion bonuses to try to meet the difficulty level of the check. You might be trying to fool someone, get some additional information out of them, or press your luck with an intimidating statement.</p>

<h2>The Choices… And Consequences Of Dialogue</h2>

<p>While I cleared most of the speech checks during my time playing, earning additional experience and earning additional money for Gia, there was one extremely difficult check that I failed. This didn't lead to any immediate negative repercussions but instead a funny moment where Nellie made fun of Gia and her very obvious attempt at lying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It might not have earned me experience as a character, but as a player, it showed a side to this new character I hadn't seen yet and endeared me further to her.</p>

<p>I asked about what kinds of negative repercussions there could be, and if you failed enough, if there were "fail states" where you'd have to revert to a save. The answer I got was quite surprising as there could definitely be scenarios where you keep talking back and end up getting shot because of it.</p>

<p>Each of these fail states are presented with the idea of a retro newspaper spinning up towards the screen. When one happens it's something monumental enough that it would make the front page, Whitney explained that internally they "view them as hidden collectibles."</p>

<p>The choices that you make during the story of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> each have varying weights and some can even lead to exclusive branched narrative paths.</p>

<p><em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> is expected to take about 20 hours for an initial playthrough, and Whitney mused that if you knew exactly what you were doing it would take about three playthroughs to see everything, but I'm guessing if you're going in blind it might take a lot longer.</p>

<p>Due to the way you not only interact with the world, but also pick up and develop relationships with different characters and factions of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> there are currently ~16 different endings. These aren't all wholly unique but much like a game like Fallout has endings for individual character stories, faction plots, and the overall game each of the permutations can lend to one another.</p>

<p>Outside of exploration and interrogation when making your way across the city there are events that can prompt such as road combat.</p>

<p>Here the combat is turnbased, functioning on a grid where every turn you have a certain number of actions you can perform. You can ram your car or unleash a shotgun blast, or simply shift from lane to lane.</p>

<p>A neat element of movement is that while shifting lanes left and right you'll use up a point of stamina, but going up and down (accelerating and decelerating) you have complete freedom.</p>

<p>Other dynamic elements of this combat were other drivers on the road, that you could use to get inbetween yourself and whoever you're facing, and also lanes that appear and disappear during combat. Just like real life you may be asked to merge or shift lane so as to stay on the road, be sure to pay attention!</p>

<h2>Rooted In History</h2>

<p>An interesting aspect of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> for history buffs is that there are certain characters and elements that are rooted in the real life history of New York. An example given was that of the White Wings, the group of uniformed cleaners for New York established in 1895 by Colonel George E. Waring Jr.</p>

<p>Each of the segments of New York that have taken to the skies in <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> function like company towns, with an organization at the head, and one of these factions is a militaristic group of cleaners.</p>

<p>It's by creating the world first, and then creating a story that inhabits it that the team hopes to create "a world that others feel so immersed in that when they walk away they continue to play in their heads."</p>

We wanted to create something different, a space where players can exhale. A space that values listening, empathizing, and slow, intentional conversations.

Once selected, players begin their journey across meditative locales, including a beach, woodland and a record store.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Sat on the other side of the fire is a second animal, sharing another player’s previous answers to the same questions and forming a contemplative, yet asymmetrical, conversation on the chosen topic.</p><p>To provide a highly robust level of player safety, <em>Fireside Feelings</em> anonymizes answers and the player’s in-game character name. Responses given by the other player across the campfire are not live, but chosen from a moderated database of conversations.</p><p>Furthermore, sensitive topics that might be discussed and might be triggering for players—including violence, self-harm, mental illness and more—can be avoided by removing them from the discussion at the start of the game or via the main menu.</p><p>Team Empreintes and The CoLab have worked with Safe In Our World, the games industry’s mental health charity, to integrate a link to the Safe In Our World website from within the experience, where players can access resources and support.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the launch trailer below.</p><h2><span>Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Fireside Feelings Launch Trailer - Wholesome Direct" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y3j3JRzardU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Amid news on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/007-first-light/" data-ref-id="5000-522472">007 First Light</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mindseye/" data-ref-id="5000-647385">MindsEye</a>, IO Interactive also had a lot to say about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination/" data-ref-id="5000-600315">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> during the first-ever IO Interactive Showcase. But the one that caught my eye most of all is a Hitman co-op mode. IO told me in an interview after the show how its existence is a sign of how the Hitman team is still exploring new ways to expand the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"Even the early prototypes [of co-op mode] that we showed a little bit of [on stage], it's just a different experience to play with a friend in that world," Christian Elverdam, CCO of IO Interactive told me. "And I'm sure, if you know the game, you could imagine a gazillion ways [to play differently]. Like, 'You could do <em>this</em>, I could do <em>that</em>!'"</p><p dir="ltr">Elverdam told me the game's ambitions have led to the team being on a perpetual "journey of discovery," the same journey that spawned the roguelite Freelancer mode two years ago. I asked him how long the team plans to support the game, and he didn't have a timeline. "We're not done figuring out what this thing is. Because [Freelancer was made by] a fairly small team that went like, 'We have this killer idea about what we could do with all of this body of work. What if we did this?' I think co-op will do some of the same things. And so we're super curious about that. I feel we have super fertile ground to keep innovating."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508457-ioishowcase2025-officiallivestream42-13screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508457" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508457-ioishowcase2025-officiallivestream42-13screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508457"></a><figcaption>Hitman co-op mode will change the way players interact with its intricate sandboxes, in some ways IO tells me it can't even foresee yet itself.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508457-ioishowcase2025-officiallivestream42-13screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Although Elverdam admitted that the co-op mode is far from finished and still taking shape, he made it clear that it'll be a mode within Hitman: World of Assassination, the all-in-one Hitman hub that houses everything the series has released since 2016. "It's still early days, but it's clearly inside the World of Assassination. Stone and Knight already exist as characters. So we just felt it was fun to do a little bit of a different take, and we're still exploring that. So, I mean, we honestly will come back when we know a little bit more. It's not particularly clear. It's a different dynamic. When you have two players, and it's not going to be Diana and Agent 47, it's something different, and it's super interesting."</p><p dir="ltr">The co-op mode is far off, but you can experience Hitman continuing to build on itself as early as today and continuing later this year. Two more celebrity Elusive Targets have been teased for later, while the first of this new trio is out now and free for all players. In it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/">Mads Mikkelsen reprises his role as Casino Royale's Le Chiffre</a>.</p>

		<p>Lizardcube know a thing or two about reviving classic Sega game franchises. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a> is right up there as one of the very best beat ’em up sequels, capturing so much of what made the originals great, making for a masterful modernised tribute to the genre. And now it’s time for Shinobi to take the spotlight once more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shinobi: Art of Vengeance – Another retro revival masterclass" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cgyl43tXLZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developed in collaboration with Sega themselves, this time around, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is a game that unapologetically makes you feel awesome. Where the gaming world now feels like it’s dominated by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/lies-of-ps-overture-dlc-is-out-today/">dark</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/code-vein-ii-revealed-by-bandai-namco-coming-in-2026/">fantasy</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/mortal-shell-2-is-coming-in-2026-for-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/">Soulslikes</a> and tough melee combat where you have to earn every break and opening, where you’re punished and staggered for missing any block or dodge window, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance turns the tables and has you stagger and interrupt you enemies with impunity.</p>


<p>Of course, you’d expect nothing less from a master ninja like Joe Musashi. He’s now quite literally the last man standing from the Oboro Clan, with his home town having been burned to the ground by a whole army, and with almost all his compatriots having been turned to stone, somehow. Outside of Joe’s protege, he’s apparently now the only thing in the way of world domination by Lord Ruse and ENE Corp. It’s a good thing that he’s the best of the bunch, isn’t it?</p>


<p>Right from the off, Joe feels powerful. It’s almost funny how the first ninja you meet –&nbsp;a base level goon that slings shuriken your way –&nbsp;is so confident of claiming victory, when Joe can deftly double jump over the slow-moving projectile and dispatch him in a single attack. There’s a pleasing weight to Joe’s attacks, the halts in animation as his strikes land adding to that heft.</p>
<p>And again, as tougher enemies emerge, such as the beefier yellow clad enemies, your ability to interrupt their sign-posted attacks shines through. There’s no blocking needed here, you just get your strikes in first. Of course, that does become trickier as we progress through the stage and encounter more mystical foes. Archers that fire lightning arrows up and down on your position, strange toad-like enemies, enemies that have the form of Olympic axe throwers.</p>

<p>As enemies are weakened by your attacks, you can build up the power with certain attack types to pull off an Execution Move, zipping across the screen to land deadly finishing blows of anyone that has the symbol above their head. And of course, there’s then screen-clearing Ninjutsu, coming with flamboyant animated cutscenes and feeding off your building Rage gauge.</p>
<p>Platforming is also light and fluid. Of course Joe can wall-jump and even dash up them a few feet, but once he’s retrieved them, use claws to cling on and climb walls, while there’s an air-dash to bridge larger gaps, a rapid twirl to hurdle over boxes, and more. A part of the progression will be uncovering new Ningi tools to overcome obstacles, and applying magical amulets to give even more enhanced abilities.</p>

<p>It’s all brought together by a fantastic hand-crafted art style that simultaneously feels like it draws upon classic 90s cartoons and has modern touches like dynamic edge lighting from the surroundings that you’re running through. After the opening mission, we skipped ahead to a later level, trying to halt an attack on a city in the middle of a fireworks display – with so much action on rooftops and small hanging ledges, it was just as satisfying to juggle enemies and kick them off the stage, as it was to fully defeat them.</p>
<p>It built up to a fun boss battle against a spider mech, using a charged attack to crash through its energy shield and then unleashing a string of damage, before backing off to avoid bullets and fire grenades.</p>

<p>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is shaping up to be another absolutely brilliant retro revival from Lizardcube, bringing another Sega classic back in glorious fidelity and style.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>! It's an extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>! A fact that will leave many with the question, "is this the one that'll push the genre to the mainstream?" Personally I haven't the foggiest, and I don't have a horse in that race either. That kind of nonsense matters more to shareholders than it does to little old me. Still, we've not got a huge amount of time to wait to find out if Arc Raiders is the one to make extraction shooters big, as during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pondering-geoffs-orbs">Geoff's Livestream of Questionable Quality and Orbs</a>, it got a release date.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
That date is October 30th, a little over four months away. Just in time for Halloween, too, which isn't at all thematically appropriate or relevant, but, it's a holiday? Sort of? Yeah, let's go with that. The shooter held a technical test last month to see if the thing actually works, and according to a press release, executive producer Aleksander Grøndal said it was the "best rehearsal we could get."

<p>
Grøndal explained that there are the usual things developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/embark-studios">Embark Studios</a> have to do ahead of launch like bugs, polish, and performance improvements. But there's also more gameplay oriented things like balance and the player economy to work on. Notably, he also said that they're working on "an even better onboarding experience for players who come in new to this genre." Quite clearly, Embark understand that they have some work to do to get people to stick with their extraction shooter.
</p>
<p>
For those not yet on the uptake with Arc Raiders, you'll be playing as one of those titular raiders in an alternate future of earth overrun by evil robots (the titular Arc). You'll need to scavenge what's left of the surface world to build up your home underground, either working with others, or facing off against them, depending on how co-operative you're feeling. Good looking vibes so far, but the proof will be in the pud.

Nini has provided you with a cozy rat residence, but there’s just one condition: you must solve <em>Squeakross</em> puzzles to earn furniture and fill your empty home! Your puzzle catalog contains 650 solvable <em>Squeakross</em> puzzles. Each completed puzzle will reward you with furniture for your rodent residence. The hint numbers on the sides indicate how many squares to fill with cheese in each row or column. Mark the largest hint numbers, leaving spaces as needed. Then, analyze different arrangements to complete the puzzle. Strike out hint lines one by one and repeat the process until the picture of your brand-new furniture is revealed!</p><p><strong>Get Solving!</strong></p><p>If you haven’t solved a nonogram before, don’t worry! In <em>Squeakross</em>, anyone can quickly become a nonogram natural. Nini provides in-game guidance to help players learn how to solve nonograms step by step, and players can revisit the manual at any time for additional tutorials. Whether you are a whisker away from solving a puzzle or looking for a more relaxed experience, you can ask your furry friend for assistance in Logic Assist mode. This feature shows possible solutions to help complete puzzles with two options: An “automatic case-solving” button and a “show mistakes” button. For experienced nonogram players seeking a greater challenge, “Nini’s Challenge” offers a more difficult variant of each puzzle, unlocking colorways for furniture in your home. To ensure an inclusive experience, <em>Squeakross</em> also incorporates many gameplay options for players to tweak their own experience and overall difficulty of puzzles!</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/interview/681172/gustavo-santaolalla-interview-the-last-of-us-music<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When fans nervously tuned in to watch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23543145/hbo-the-last-of-us-review">HBO’s adaptation of one of their favorite video games</a>, there was one familiar presence that immediately calmed their nerves: the mournful guitar of Gustavo Santaolalla. As certain story beats changed and beloved polygonal faces were replaced with new actors, the beating heart of <em>The Last of Us</em> — its mesmerizing, tension-ridden score — survived the transition to TV intact.</p><p>“[Series creator] Neil Druckmann has said that my music is part of the DNA of <em>The Last of Us</em>,“ Santaolalla says. “I think the fact that we kept the sonic fabric — that we didn’t do an orchestral score for the series — has been instrumental in keeping those fans of the games fans of the series, too.”</p><p>Born and raised in Buenos Aires, Santaolalla first started releasing music when he was 17. Loving both English rock bands and the traditional Argentine folk music that he was raised on, Santaolalla melded both into his own unique sound, part of a genre called rock nacional. Before he could fully make his mark, Santaolalla’s family fled the Argentine junta dictatorship in 1978, moving to Los Angeles, where his unique sound soon caught the attention of filmmakers. Snapped up to score the 2000 film <em>Amores Perros</em> and 2003’s <em>21 Grams, </em>their success led to Santaolalla composing the soundtracks for <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> and <em>Babe</em>l, both of which won him Oscars.</p><p>Santaolla’s sonic secret? Embracing the eloquence of silence. “I work so much with silence and space, because silences sometimes can be louder than a note that you’re playing,” says Santaolalla. “I remember on <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> when I first sent them the music, the producer said ‘I thought you were pulling my leg at first, because you wait so long to play the next note!’”</p><div><p>“Silences sometimes can be louder than a note that you’re playing.”</p></div><p>After winning two Oscars back to back, Santaolalla carefully considered his next career move. Despite being a self-professed “terrible gamer” Santaolalla tells me he always loved watching his son play, mesmerized by the on-screen kineticism. “I always thought that if somebody connects this at an emotional level with a player, it’s going to be a revolution.”</p><p>It turns out, the universe had picked up on Santaolalla’s newest interest. Post-Oscars, he was approached by several game companies to do music, but turned them down because “I’m very picky about the work that I do.” That includes a lucrative gaming project that he is careful not to name. “Everyone thought I was crazy!” he chuckles. Still, Santaolalla quietly hoped that a more emotionally-resonant project would materialize.</p><p>“So, I waited… and then Neil appeared,” Santaolalla says. “When Neil told his colleagues that he wanted me to do this, [his colleagues ] said, No, Gustavo is not going to be interested — he won two Oscars! But when Neil [told me] the story, and that he wanted to do a game that connects with people on an emotional level… I was sold.</p><p>What even Neil Druckmann wasn’t prepared for, however, was that Gustavo’s music would become just as crucial a presence as Ellie and Joel. In a post apocalyptic world where life is scarce and danger lurks around every corner, silence hangs in the air like a threat. Santaolalla’s scuffed notes, discordant melodies and screeching fret slides reverberate across the dilapidated city streets, feeling as unpredictable as the world Ellie and Joel inhabit.</p><div><p>“I love the use of imperfections, even errors or mistakes.”</p></div><p>“I love the use of imperfections, even errors or mistakes,” Santaolalla explains. “Any professional guitar player when they’re recording tend to avoid all kinds of noises; when you run your hand on the fretboard or little glitches in your playing. But sometimes, I’ll push those in my mix, and I think that humanizes it. That’s why many people have said that my music becomes like a character — a presence. It’s why I play things myself.”</p><div><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4">the second game</a>, Gustavo’s music becomes a physical part of the fiction, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281499/the-last-of-us-part-2-ps4-guitar-touchpad">Ellie carrying a guitar throughout her quest for vengeance</a>. She takes out the instrument during welcome moments of downtime, offering cathartic respite. And just like Gustavo’s score, these beautiful vignettes break up the harrowing silence, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/644415/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-hbo">which carries through in the second season of the show</a>.</p></div><p>“I love the TV series too,” says Santaolalla. “ For the show, Neil associated himself with another incredible talent, Craig Mazin — the guy that did <em>Chernobyl</em> — who knows that media and that language. I think it was a big, big challenge, because when you go from one media to another one, people say no, I like the original better! So, I think, once again, that the way we have used the music has been instrumental to keep that fan base attached.”</p><p>He adds that “I think that when a story is really great, like a theatrical piece — like Shakespeare — it doesn’t matter who plays the character. Obviously Pedro Pascal’s Joel is different than the Joel from the game, but the substance of the character is so powerful that those things are just superficial. They could have done this as a series, as a feature film, as a puppet theatre piece, or an animation and it will still land regardless — because it’s just great writing.”</p><p>Now as Santaolalla finds himself releasing his very own instrument — the Guitarocko — it feels like the culmination of the musical journey he started as a teen. Melding the traditional Bolivian 10 stringed ronroco with the form factor of a Fender Stratocaster, Gustavo feels a father-like pride for his musical creation: the 73-year-old is invigorated by what <em>The Last Of Us</em> has given him at this stage in his career.</p><p>“I’ve been blessed with the fact that I have connected with an audience since I was very young,” he says. “But the way I connect with the fans of <em>The Last of Us</em> and the way they connect with the music… here’s a special devotion that is really beautiful. I have this new audience which is fantastic, and I love that they didn’t know me as an artist or as a film composer! Now they look for my music, and they discover these things. It’s been a gift for me, at this point — after everything that I’ve been through — to be involved with a project like this.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now that's worth buying a console for!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="mix switch 1 and 2 controllers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0fd2ae727169d/mix-switch-1-and-2-controllers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, friends. We've spent the past few days pushing and pulling at our new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2s</a> as we get to figuring out just what this baby is really capable of. And, well, it seems as though it's capable of some quite twisted stuff.</p>
<p>Or at least <em>a bit mixed up</em>, as it turns out you can actually mix and match your Switch 1 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-differences-how-do-the-new-controllers-compare">Switch 2 Joy-Con</a> as working pairs and get stuck into playing games and browsing the Switch 2 console menus in the manner of someone wearing two completely differently-sized gloves.</p>
<p>There's no real point to it - unless you can't find the Joy-Con 2 you're looking for or someone else is using it. Indeed, we hadn't even thought to check until we saw the r/NintendoSwitch post hanging below this sentence:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yknozt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Not wanting to simply take <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l583dn/you_can_mix_and_match_switch_1_2_joycons_as_its/">u/iOvercompensate's</a> word without investigating a little further (no offence, we're just massively paranoid from existing in this timeline), we can confirm that we have achieved the same result. We were never in doubt.</p>

<p>In order to do the same, for whatever reason (maybe you've got relatives over and nobody is speaking anymore - a party trick might ease hostilities!), simply jump into the controller settings on Switch 2, then go to change your grip order, then press 'L' and 'R' to detect the Joy-Con you wish to mix. Ta-da!</p>
<p>Now. Does it work the other way, though? Can you go out and buy some fancy Switch 2 Joy-Con to use on your OG Switch?</p>

<p>Eh...no. No, you cannot. Silly us.</p>

The goal of the wolves is to murder all the lambs, while the lambs' goal is to discover who the wolves are to put a stop to their murder spree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players explore the mansion, collecting survival tools, gear, and weapons from chests and merchants scattered throughout. Tokens can be collected from quest completion and spent to unlock certain chests for better gear. There are over 20 different characters to choose from, all with different abilities that can be leveled up throughout a match, and they all can equip all sorts of different weapons from guns to knives to grenades to fend off members of the opposing team.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When a player is murdered, a clue is left on their body as to who the murderer was, which players can use to try and deduce the culprit. The clues might be hair, skin, fingerprints, blood, or clothing, all of which can help you narrow down who the wolves are. Good news, it looks like the game tracks clues for you, helping you narrow down wolves with UI markers indicating that someone is getting increasingly suspicious.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once a lamb has identified a wolf, it's their job to dispatch them before they can kill anyone else. You'll automatically be eliminated if you kill as a lamb as another lamb, so Killer Inn encourages you not to just go on a murder spree to try and save yourself. There are also safe zones scattered around where wolves are forbidden from killing lambs, because the staff in the vicinity will immediately out their identity to other lambs. There's another win condition, too: there's a boat at the harbor the lambs can unlock and use to escape, though its dispatch is challenging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Killer Inn is gearing up for a closed beta over Steam sometime soon, but it doesn't have a release date just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156545/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a> was the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yakuza_kiwami">Yakuza</a> game — after many, many attempts on my part — that finally and fully opened my eyes to the magic of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's long-running (and entirely bats**t) franchise. This was the one that finally did me in.</p>
<p>And from the moment its <em>incredible</em> opening cutscene sequence kicks in, it's not hard to see why, it's not hard to know you're in the very best of company with Yakuza 0. It's a lavish, opulent, gritty, violent and wholly adult affair, that also happens to be incredibly cheesy, almost ludicrously silly, and full of good-intentioned heart. It's a complicated old thing, is this Yakuza malarkey.</p>
<p>On the topic of 'complicated', this is also a series that, for understandable reasons, I constantly see people wondering how or where to get started with. How do you approach it? Which game should you go with first? The answer, my friends, is simple. You start with Yakuza 0.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156553/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This majestic prequel gives you the Yakuza experience in its most coherent and well-rounded form (at least it did until <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/yakuza_like_a_dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a> arrived, but that's another story). A properly epic gangster tale of the rise of Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima — two of gaming's great protagonists — as they battle on the mean streets of Tokyo and Osaka circa 1988, it sets the stage for all that follows in the series. Which is a lot. Oh boy, it's a lot.</p>
<p>Everything here, from the neon-soaked streets of its two impressively open locations, to the cast of absolute maniac criminal underworld characters you'll meet (and then likely kill), it feels, as all of these games do, weirdly authentic in its characterisations, and in the bizarre vibe it strikes, even though it's completely off-the-rails bonkers a lot of the time.</p>
<p>If you know Yakuza, you know the deal. It's a bit rough, rude, borderline pervy at times (although the devs have done very well in reigning this side in more recently), and it somehow manages to mix extremely cheesy (in the best way) dialogue, always fantastically acted, with serious real-world issues and the occasional bit of actual emotion.</p>

<p>Kiryu and Majima are incredibly likeable characters to get stuck into controlling, too. They're cool, funny, dumb as the rest of us, and incredibly desperate to be loved. Just like me. It's a winning combo, especially when they also happen to be quite excellent at beating large gangs of armed thugs in combat that, back in 2015, was the most polished and absorbing the series had seen yet. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, you understand, but it feels slicker, the animations are better, and each of our protags has got three styles to fight in, giving you lots more options in how you want to approach battles than you may expect. This is a very, very well-made brawler, is what I'm saying.</p>
<p>Did you know that one of Majima's fighting stances is breakdancing, by the way? That's a good window into how silly this whole thing manages to be at all times. And who doesn't enjoy the franchise's signature environmental and weapons-based takedowns? Bike to the face, anyone? Traffic cone to the nuts? Come and get it, mate. And bring your pals.</p>
<p>It's also tickled us forever now, how none of these folk, no matter how badly you beat them off a storefront, ever die. It's just that kind of thing. Don't feel bad. They only die during big scenes. You can go ham with that cafe chair, he can't feel it.</p>

<p>The Yakuza games have always chosen a pleasing sort of moment-to-moment depth over sheer size in terms of their open worlds, too. This most likely, of course, originates from technical limitations, but now in the modern-future-terror-world in which we currently exist, they continue to stick with this setup to an extent, and it pays dividends here (as it continues to with more recent entries, and flashy Yakuza spin-offs like the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/judgment">Judgment</a> series). Now I'm not saying the world isn't big and impressive — it is — it's just not gonna make you take a bike and cycle in a straight line for 40 minutes to your next objective.</p>
<p>With Ryu Ga Gotoku, you get locations that, whilst often a little smaller this way, come alive thanks to the fact they're stuffed full of NPCs to talk to, get to know, and have fun with. They've got bars to hang out and get drunk off your ass in. You can go play pool, darts, do some karaoke, hit a disco. And these are things you can get better at, and be rewarded for doing. They open up quests and embiggen your circle of (incredibly unstable and violent) friends.</p>
<p>Or maybe you prefer golf? Poker? Fishing? What about arcades, mate? They've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_space_harrier">Space Harrier</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/vcarcade/super_hang-on">Super Hang-On</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_out_run">Out Run</a>, to name a few. You might not know this yet if you haven't played the game in the past, but you're about to become fully addicted to the fantastic Cabaret Club minigame here. We won't spoil it.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156549/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The main narrative, which sees both our protagonists become embroiled in turf wars that push them into contact with one another, is as excellent as it ever is in these games. Like a great big OTT soap opera stuffed full of psychotic killers, men running around in nappies, a guy called Mr. Libido and...well...let's just say Michael Jackson may or may not show up and need your help killing some zombies.</p>
<p>The majesty (and sometimes surprising grimness) of the main story is offset by a ton of side stuff which, whilst sometimes quite filler-y in nature, is mostly composed of very entertaining and well-written diversions. This melding of kooky comedy, off-kilter weirdness, and serious criminal activity has served the series well for decades, and in Yakuza 0 it's perhaps at its finest, certainly in terms of the franchise before it branched out into the turn-based <strong>Like A Dragon</strong> games, which are now my personal faves.</p>
<p>In terms of this Director's Cut on Switch 2, well, we have been spoiled, my friends. In close-ups, this version looks as good, if not better, than Yakuza 0 running on a PS4. Docked mode sees slick 4K/60fps goodness, whilst in portable it looks pristine in ways I never thought possible. There are volumetric effects, shadows and reflections on advertising boards here that I definitely haven't seen before, and it all looks great.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza 0: Director's Cut Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156552/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>We also get a new mode in this Director's Cut, alongside a full English dub (it's really not good, with Kiryu being particularly terrible, but hey, at least the option is there!) and some 30 minutes or thereabouts of new story scenes. Nice! All of this stuff really is gravy, too, as this is perhaps the best of all the Yakuza games, certainly pre-Like A Dragon, and it's genuinely never looked or played nicer.</p>
<p>With regards to the new scenes specifically, I'm not gonna say anything about them, because it's spoiler town centre, but it's going to be interesting, to say the least, to see how fans who've played the game feel about the rearrangement of a certain incident. It's not a biggie to me, personally, but there is definitely going to be some push-back on this change, that much is for sure. It doesn't affect things in any way that would have me change my thoughts on the game, though, so don't stress if you're coming in fresh.</p>
<p>The new multiplayer mode, Red Light Raid, has been very quiet thus far when I've tried, but it does allow for solo raids, alongside online with randoms, or with friends locally. It's fine, a basic wave battle-typed affair that sees you earn money, which you then use to unlock and upgrade characters. It's a nice bonus, but it does feel throwaway, unless you decide to commit and rise through the online leaderboards.</p>

<p>Choosing a character (the game gives you a big juicy paycheck to get started, so you can pick a fancy one) sees you then jump into street scraps in a team of four. Enemy groups are impressively large, and there are tough bosses and other aspects thrown at you as you attempt to clear hordes before your timer/health run out. Again, it's <em>fine</em>, but I'm not gonna let it affect my overall opinion of the main game, as that's what we are all here for.</p>
<p>And so with that, it's a big score indeed for a big old package. This is a phenomenal game from opening cutscene to close, a true gangster epic that gives newcomers the perfect place to start with this evergreen series. In it's Switch 2 form, it also now represents my favourite way to play this one, reclining on my sofa whilst kicking Yakuza butt. Just like God intended.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yakuza 0 is the best of the traditional-styled Yakuza games, with the most complex story and interesting characters of the lot. It's also the ideal place for newcomers to get started with this weird and wonderful series.</p>
<p>The new multiplayer mode is a little throwaway, for sure, and the fights do get repetitive (turn-based Yakuza FTW), but otherwise, this is a phenomenal port of an epic adventure that's now my favourite way to get down on the mean streets of 1980s Tokyo and Osaka.</p></section>

<figure><a title="switch 2 battery poll" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31fdc712f2c15/switch-2-battery-poll.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With gamers across the globe now settling in to put their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> consoles through their paces, we've been seeing a bunch of media outlets, alongside eager social media and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/">Reddit</a> users, report in on how they're finding the battery life thus far.</p>
<p>For full transparency, we've yet to run a rigorous battery test here at Nintendo Life, but from this writer's personal experience it's taking around the two-hour mark roughly, to drain things right down whilst playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Our editor, Gavin, is getting about the same running <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>, too.</p>
<p>This may be disappointing, though <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-battery-life-how-does-it-compare">it falls pretty much in-line with what we expected</a> given Nintendo's officially indicated <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250402.html">2-6 hours</a> estimates and roughly the same as Switch 1 (before it saw a few model revisions).</p>
<p>Gamers online are reporting roughly the same figures in some cases. However, there seems to be a growing number of folk saying that they aren't even managing to reach the magic 2-hour mark whilst playing bigger games.</p>

<p>Of course, with the fact Mario Kart World is such a big, beautiful, online sort of deal, we expect the battery to drain faster, but it's not great news to see that, in some scenarios, people apparently aren't getting two hours out of it.</p>
<p>What's more (and we can confirm this one), the battery in standby mode — when you've set your Switch 2 down for the evening — seems to be draining seriously quickly in some cases. It seems it goes from a full charge to 59% on some consoles doing this, (as it has done with mine left overnight).</p>

<p>Judging from some of the responses to the post above, there are a whole bunch of players who are finding that the battery is draining too quickly for their liking. Obviously, there are a lot of factors at work here; screen brightness, downloads running in the background, whether you're using GameChat, and so on, but there's a pattern of complaints developing.</p>
<p>We'll be carrying out some tests of our own and will return with our own official findings in due course. But, in the interim, we'd love to hear how you have found the battery so far. How's it been for Mario Kart? What about 'smaller' games? And, if you've had time to take note, how does the battery do whilst in rest mode?</p>



<hr>
<p><em>And make sure to let us know all about your experiences with the Switch 2 battery in the comments. Are some games giving you better results?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156605/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of my favourite memories from the Switch 1 came from those opening few weeks following the launch in March 2017. Like everyone else, I was utterly glued to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, but I also poured a huge amount of time into Shin’en Multimedia’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. It was <em>the</em> game to showcase what the console was capable of in those early days, and the developer is back again with a launch title for Switch 2: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion.</a></p>
<p>Now, I know everybody has quite rightly been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> almost non-stop since the Switch 2 launched, but I’d be lying if I said it was my favourite racing game at launch (and no, it’s not <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> either). That honour goes to Fast Fusion. While somewhat slight in terms of content, this entry is the most accomplished yet, with astonishing visuals, rock-solid performance, and blisteringly fast racing.</p>
<p>At first glance, it's extremely familiar to Fast RMX veterans. You still race around tracks against CPU opponents while phasing between red and blue colours to benefit from boost pads on the ground. Picking up little energy orbs fills your boost meter, while pressing ‘R’ gives you a significant (albeit short) speed burst, quickly depleting your boost supply.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156604/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, so good, then. The biggest change with the core gameplay is the ability to jump at any point. Honestly, when I first heard about this, I thought Shin’en had lost its marbles. Jumping? In a futuristic, high-speed racer? Madness! It turns out, however, that it works wonderfully well, adding an extra layer of strategy.</p>
<p>I should clarify that when I say ‘jump’, I’m not talking about the measly hop you might see in Mario Kart. Fast Fusion's jumps launch your vehicle meters into the air, giving you time to control your direction before landing. This has multiple uses: you can either use it to cross a deadly gap on the course, reach energy orbs way up high, or swap to an adjacent road to avoid obstacles or make use of a boost pad.</p>
<p>It’s got loads of potential, and I even noticed a few moments in which I could cut corners or discover hidden shortcuts. Granted, there’s nothing quite like the astonishing feats seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/f-zero_x">F-Zero X</a>, but I reckon it’s possible to cut your times dramatically once you master the mechanic. You can also use it to land on top of your enemies, spinning them out and netting you some sweet cash. Very satisfying.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156603/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the tracks themselves, you've got a total of 12 split across 4 different leagues. It's definitely a step down from previous games, but the quality on display here is insane. The torrential rain and tornadoes in Tempesta are a real visual treat, and the gigantic robots stomping around Port Genkai can do a number on you. It's thrilling stuff, and with Shin'en confirming that free content updates are on the way, we're optimistic that there'll be additional tracks in the future.</p>
<p>Outside of races, the big change here is — as the title suggests — the ability to fuse vehicles to create completely new ones. You’ve only got a few unlocked from the start, but you can tinker with the fusion mechanic straight away, provided you have the currency. It’s simply a case of selecting which vehicle you want to alter and browsing the rest of the catalogue.</p>
<p>Completing the fusion results in a mash-up of both the designs and names. You’ll also see that some of the stats have been altered depending on your chosen vehicles’ strengths. Blending Cebra Genetics with Vasp Optics, for example, yields increased boost performance thanks to the latter’s strength in that department. There are loads of different combinations you can try out, and it’s a joy to see what kind of stunning monstrosity you can come up with; you may even find you can completely max out your acceleration or top speed.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156597/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Fusing does, however, cost money; in fact, everything in this game costs money. Not real money, before you grab your pitchforks, but in-game currency obtained by competing in races, performing well, and collecting items. You’ll need moolah to unlock new vehicles, complete fusions, and open up new Championship cups. The game is pretty generous with its cash prizes, but I felt deflated a couple of times realising I had to replay tracks I’d already won to grind the required funds.</p>
<p>Once you get over that initial hump of unlocking every track, however, accumulating currency is pretty painless, and you’ll find that playing races for the sheer thrill of it will soon result in heaps of the stuff. Another good way to spend it is via the Jukebox feature. Fast Fusion contains some awesome new music, and you can unlock it to listen to whenever you like, along with a whole bunch of tracks from Fast RMX, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu-eshop/fast_racing_neo">FAST Racing NEO</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiware/fast_racing_league">Fast Racing League</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard Championship mode, you’ve also got Time Attack and Super Hero Mode. The former is pretty self-explanatory, requiring you to beat the stages’ record time, while the latter is about as close as we’re likely to get to a new F-Zero. The stages are mirrored, and your boost bar also represents your ship's health. Boost too much (or crash out entirely) and it’s game over. Generally, you’re able to boost much more than in the standard Championship mode, but it also comes with that thrilling risk vs. reward structure that makes F-Zero so great.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156609/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And of course, you’ve got multiplayer, offered up via standard splitscreen play (up to four players) or the new GameShare capabilities (two players). Splitscreen works phenomenally well with performance maintained at a solid 60fps for all. It’s not often you get such robust performance with local multiplayer these days, so seeing the Switch 2 handle this without breaking a sweat is a joy.</p>
<p>GameShare is similarly impressive in terms of performance, though being the second player on a Switch 1 does yield some pretty fuzzy visuals thanks to the streaming involved. The whole screen also shrinks slightly for both players to provide the necessary GameShare information at the top. It’s not a huge deal, and you’re going to find the same happens if you’re using the screen-share feature during GameChat, but it’s worth noting all the same.</p>
<p>While on the subject of performance, it’s worth just stressing how incredibly beautiful Fast Fusion is on the Switch. In docked mode, if you have a TV capable of hitting 4K resolution, nailing that 4K/60fps balance is absolutely magical. Shin’en Multimedia has stated its desire to potentially add in a 120fps mode at a later date, but honestly, if this means dipping the resolution down to 1080p, I’m perfectly happy sticking to 4K/60fps.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Fast Fusion (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156611/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>As for the other performance modes, you’ve got ‘Ultra Quality’ in docked mode that boosts the visuals slightly, but brings the performance down to 30fps. It’s fine, and the added texture details and shadow maps are certainly noticable, but it's not my go-to option.</p>
<p>Handheld mode delivers more or less the same, maxing out at the screen’s 1080p display while offering up the option of either a 60fps performance mode or a 30fps quality mode. The latter again offers the same visual upgrades as docked mode, but the compromises to attain this aren’t really worth it.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fast Fusion may not have the most comprehensive collection of tracks, but it's easily the most accomplished entry in Shin'en Multimedia's series so far. The new jump ability adds a new layer of strategy to the gameplay, while experimenting with the fusion mechanic to find the perfect vehicle is a joy. The occasional grinding to save up money can be a momentary drag, but if you're after something a bit more 'hardcore' than Mario Kart World, Fast Fusion is a no-brainer, and an absolute must-buy.</p></section>
