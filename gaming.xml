		<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined isn’t just a reimagining of the late PlayStation 1 era JRPG, it’s also a fresh approach to how Square Enix’s back catalogue can be revisited. We’ve had the pixel remasters of early <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/26/final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-and-more-mana-games-are-now-on-xbox/">Final Fantasy</a>, we’ve had the HD-2D engine applied liberally to the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/29/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review/">Dragon Quest trilogy</a>, and there is, of course, the vast production for the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/"> Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy. Dragon Quest VII, though, has been treated in a new, distinct fashion, and I love how it’s turning out.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Quest VII Reimagined - Follow-Up Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wf6HMdCStmQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Simply put, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined looks like dolls wandering around a diorama. Square Enix created these characters as real-life, physical dolls and then 3D-scanned them into the game to really capture the look, giving them a slightly otherworldly feel, but one that’s uniquely charming. They’re still animated as you’d expect from characters in a video game, as opposed to bobbing around like marionettes in a Thunderbirds episode, and combined with the style of the environments you get to explore, it comes together beautifully to help this remake stand out from the crowd.</p>


<p>My hands-on demo time took me to two early portions of the game, visiting the village of Emberdale just as it’s being shaken to its core by earth tremors. They think they’ve got it all in hand –&nbsp;just go ahead as usual with the Fire Festival to head up Burnmont to tribute to and appease the gods –&nbsp;but one of the village elders thinks otherwise and enlists you to try and help. As everyone troops up to the volcano and chucks flaming headgear down into the pit, you instead skirt past and descend into the magma tunnels to find the truth of the matter.</p>


<p>Just as with the Nintendo 3DS remake of this game, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined does away with the randomised battle encounters and instead has all the enemies appearing in the overworld. It’s a significantly more modern approach that helps to ease some of the pain of running around and exploring the world, and gives you the chance to sneak up or time a Sudden Strike attack while still in the main game world.</p>
<p>This comes in tandem with a bunch of other quality-of-life improvements that are now fairly typical for RPG remakes, but always good to see. There’s a bevy of party automation which can be applied across all the characters or individually, giving them battle tactics to be more aggressive or defensive, to us magical abilities or focus on healing. This is already a massive time saver for basic encounters, but you can also speed up battles, dip in and out if battles are going to plan or not, and it’s just great to be able to cut through to the more meaningful moments.</p>

<p>You’ll still have plenty to do, though, thanks to the expanded Vocation system, allowing all the characters to ‘moonlight’ with a different class, blending their abilities together instead of entirely switching. Periodically in combat, this will also lead to characters getting ‘Worked Up’ and being able to unleash a powerful, vocation-specific attack, buff or ability that you can set up to aid your party composition. These can be really useful when toughing it out in a beastly boss battle.</p>

<p>Jumping ahead in this adventure to the town of Wetlock, and the townsfolk have been captured by a man doing his best Pied Piper impression. Another bad guy to battle, eh? Well, not all is as it seems, and after battling some real hordes of slimes and other monsters – some of which combine themselves in large numbers, call in reinforcements and more – you get the truth of the matter. Wetlock has been flooded, but it wasn’t this old chap; he was actually saving people from the evil merman Gracos.</p>
<p>Once you reach him, Gracos proves to be a stern challenge, and it’s for these moments that you really want to pull back some of the automation and take more manual control to pick the best abilities, choose when to heal or defend, and generally make every moment count. The party has become more varied thanks to the addition of the wolf-raised Ruff and the battle dancing Aishe, and being deeper into the game means that there’s a huge array of abilities and spells to choose from across the board. Finding the most effective abilities, buffing the team and staving off Gracos’ worst is a fun juggling act.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is shaping up to be another fantastic remake from Square Enix. It’s a bit bewildering just how many different styles and approaches they’ve taken to revisiting their classics, but this takes a wonderful art direction and combines it with a great set of quality-of-life improvements while tweaking it to address the biggest criticisms. All in all, it should be the best way to revisit this adventure when it arrives next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nearly two months after announcing the plans, Avalanche Studios has officially closed its office in Liverpool. This closure sees 31 people lose their jobs, adding to the ever-growing job loss count in the gaming industry.</p>



<p>In a post on its website, the company confirmed the closure and thanked the staff who were impacted.</p>







<p><strong>“The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project,” </strong><a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement reads</a>. <strong>“We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios Group.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Our focus remains on supporting the [staff] through this transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities.</strong>“</p>



<h2 id="h-layoffs-months-in-the-making">Layoffs Months In The Making</h2>



<p>Plans of the Liverpool closure was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avalanche-studios-closes-office-lays-off-staff-after-contraband-cancelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced in September</a>. They came just weeks after it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development on Contraband</a> was ending. Avalanche said the decision came after an internal review of the company and its plans moving forward after the game’s cancelation. </p>







<p>“<strong>This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations</strong>,” they said at the time, while saying it would impact all employees in Liverpool.</p>



<p>In addition to the Liverpool office, layoffs were planned for offices in Malmö and Stockholm. There hasn’t been an update on those locations, however. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Avalanche Studios for what the plans for the studio are moving forward. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite releasing less than a month ago, AdHoc’s Dispatch has sold two million copies. The last episodes, 7 and 8, only came out last week and reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-million-copies-adhoc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a million copy milestone</a> within 10 days.</p>







<p>Released in late October, Dispatch follows Robert, a former superhero working a desk job and dispatching ‘reformed’ villains in Los Angeles. Composed of former TellTale Games members, AdHoc Studios brought the iconic Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-type dialogue choices and consequences. The game quickly became&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1981416301709934652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best-selling title</a>&nbsp;on Steam with only two episodes. Then, it reached a million copies only a week and a half after release. Now, with all the episodes out, the team shared an even bigger milestone.</p>



<h2 id="h-adhoc-studios-celebrates-two-million-copies-sold-for-dispatch-with-new-drawing">AdHoc Studios Celebrates Two Million Copies Sold for Dispatch With New Drawing</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're also sad there are no new episodes this week, but thank you to the 2 million players that have joined us so far. Wouldn't be here without you.</p><p>Art by Derek Stratton. <a href="https://t.co/1Bu2MIMmh9">pic.twitter.com/1Bu2MIMmh9</a></p></div>— AdHoc Studio – Dispatch OUT NOW! (@theAdHocStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1991235043868410096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1991235043868410096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new post from AdHoc Studios</a> reveals that Dispatch has sold two million copies, a huge milestone for an indie title. To commemorate the occasion, Derek Stratton, the game’s art director, drew a new picture featuring everyone’s favorite character, Beef. The drawing is somber, as no new episodes have been released due to Episode 7 and 8 being the last ones. Still, the team seems pretty grateful for the many fans who joined in the journey.</p>



<p>Currently, Dispatch is available on PC and PlayStation 5. No ports to Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch 2 have been announced. Unfortunately, no Season Two has been revealed yet, though the team <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/11/11/a-new-update-on-dispatch-season-2-after-its-surprising-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seems adamant</a> about bringing it back. Given how it started development years ago, it’ll likely be some time before we see the Z-Team again. Still, with how popular it has become (and earning a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Award nomination</a>), the future for the title is looking bright.</p>

                <p>In August, reports emerged that Microsoft had paused development on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/contraband/" data-ref-id="5000-533229">Contraband</a>, a co-op smuggler game from Just Cause developer Avalanche. At the time, some sources noted that Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-cancels-xbox-game-pass-day-one-release-contraband/1100-6533776/" data-ref-id="1100-6533776">put a "hold" on production</a> rather than a full cancellation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been one year since STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl debuted on PC and Xbox Series S and X, marking the end of a long and troubled development phase that saw developer GSC Game World facing numerous challenges, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to reach completion.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my review of the game</a>, I rated it 8 out of 10, praising its ambitious features but also noting that it was rough and needed refinements as well as balancing tweaks. The developer has indeed released several major updates over these past fifty-two weeks, the last of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-update-1-7-adds-faction-turf-wars-expedition-mode-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went live this week</a>, significantly improving the A-Life system, adding new difficulty modes and many other improvements.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, the game is also set to debut on Sony's PlayStation 5 consoles, now that the timed Xbox console exclusivity deal with Microsoft has expired. We sent a few questions to GSC Game World to discuss this new version of STALKER 2, as well as inquire about the state of promised post-launch features and content, such as DLCs, cross-platform mods, and multiplayer. The answers were kindly provided by Communications Director Zakhar Bocharov and Technical Director Ievgen Kulyk.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>One year after the game's launch, how do you feel about STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl? Has it achieved what you were aiming for, both in terms of quality and sales?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar:</strong> We’ll strive to be as objective as possible. <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One million copies sold in under three days</a> and several million players through Game Pass on PC and Xbox can undoubtedly be considered successful figures. Over the year, the game received 7 major updates — and far more smaller ones — which not only improved performance but also added new content. The game is now significantly different from what it was at launch. Updates are a complex matter. In the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., they could probably go on forever, much like the pursuit of perfection. Nevertheless, they will continue forward on.</p>



<p><strong>I have noticed that you added gyro aiming through the controller's motion sensor on PlayStation 5. Do you believe this is a legitimate alternative to the regular method in terms of accuracy and comfort?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ievgen:</strong> This can be done on PS5, and it will add comfort for many players — so we’re doing it. Preferences for a specific control method are 100% a matter of taste, but in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, you can play with gamepads on PC, and with keyboard and mouse on consoles — if that’s your desire.</p>



<p><strong>Out of all the features enabled with the DualSense controller, which one do you feel is the most fitting addition to STALKER 2?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar:</strong> The technical team loves the gamepad radio chatter and the gyro aiming the most. To my taste, haptic feedback works great — this PS5 feature still feels fresh to me in many games, including ours. In any case, literally all DualSense and PS5 features work to multiply immersion in an immersive game — and that means they're right on point.</p>



<p><strong>How long did it take you to develop the enhancements for the PS5 Pro version? Could you please share the rendering resolution/frame rate options, as well as whether you are using PSSR?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ievgen:</strong> PS5 Pro improvements were in the same scope as the development for the platform in general — just the power of this specific console allows for graphical enhancements. Below are our targets in terms of performance:</p>



<p>Base PS5</p>



<ul>
<li>Performance: 2K 60 FPS</li>



<li>Quality: 4K 30 FPS</li>
</ul>



<p>PS5 Pro</p>



<ul>
<li>Performance: 4K 60 FPS</li>



<li>Quality: 4K 30 FPS</li>
</ul>



<p>We don’t use PSSR — only UE5-integrated TSR.</p>



<p><strong>Would it be fair to compare the PS5 Pro version to PC's High settings? If not, what are the differences?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar:</strong> Console optimization is a bit more complex and specific than just porting over PC presets. It's hard to answer the question 100% precisely, but the PS5 Pro version is definitely leaning towards PC High settings. I think comparison videos between platforms are just a matter of time, so you'll be able to form your own opinion.</p>



<p><strong>Will the DualSense features, such as speaker support, gyro aiming, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers, also be available on PC when using this controller?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ievgen:</strong> Yes, starting with update 1.7.</p>



<p><strong>In your roadmap, you've <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-2025-roadmap-includes-ue-upgrade-new-missions-anomalies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an upgrade to a newer version of Unreal Engine 5. When will this be available, and what kind of performance improvements do you anticipate?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar: </strong>Switching to a new version of Unreal Engine 5 is a very big task, which is exactly why even in our roadmap we especially noted that we cannot guarantee the exact timing. It should bring a significant boost to optimization overall, but we will keep you updated on the timing of this update through our socials. But here I would like to note that update 1.7 has already delivered a significant and very noticeable optimization gain, and it is available right now. </p>



<p><strong>The roadmap also listed new missions. What can you tell us about those?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar:</strong> This update is quite close, so the answer might end up being more of a spoiler.</p>



<p><strong>Are you still planning to deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a multiplayer mode</a> at some point? If so, could you share any information about how it would work?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar:</strong> I have no updates on multiplayer right now.</p>



<p><strong>Beyond multiplayer, you also mentioned cross-platform mods and hardware-accelerated ray tracing as two things you were working on post-launch. Do you have any updates to share on that front?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar: </strong>There are no new details right now, but we’ll share them on our social media as soon as we’re ready.</p>



<p><strong>Can we expect the first of the planned STALKER 2 DLCs to be released at some point next year?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Official <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> board games are coming next year. Renegade Game Studios will be adapting the popular LitRPG book series into two official tabletop experiences, bringing the science-fantasy series to gaming tables.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/blog/renegade-game-studios-announces-two-upcoming-dungeon-crawler-carl-tabletop-games/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Renegade Game Studios announced they will be producing two <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> board games. Both of these games will be coming to the crowdfunding platform Backerkit in April 2026.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeon-crawler-carl-book-cover.jpg?itok=dmbhOAEd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeon-crawler-carl-book-cover.jpg?itok=x5dimtCw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these board games is an official <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> TTRPG. This is obvious, since the book series heavily leans on the fantasy TTRPG trope of the "dungeon crawl," blown out into a demented, competitive reality show. The announcement does not specify which RPG system it will use, but confirms that navigating the commercialized elements of the dungeon will be a central mechanic.</p>

<p>The second <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> board game will be a co-op deck builder. The game will be based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/unstoppable-board-game-roguelike-deck-builder-is-fully-funded-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Unstoppable</em></a>, designed by John D. Clair. The game is set in the World Dungeon, where you'll battle against neighborhood, borough, and city bosses, gearing up and leveling up along the way. The game can be played solo or 2-player co-op.</p>

<p>Regardless of which <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> board game catches your eye, illustrations for both will be done by longtime artist&nbsp;<span>Luciano Fleitas, adding a layer of authenticity to these tabletop adaptations.</span></p>

<p><span><em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> is a science-fantasy book series written by Matt Dinniman. It involves Carl, a former Coast Guard, and his ex's cat, Princess Donut, being thrown into a subterranean dungeon created by the alien Borant Corporation as part of a Running Man-esque reality show, <em>Dungeon Crawler World</em>. Carl can either compete, or stay on the Earth's surface where modern amenities are gone.</span></p>

<p><span>The series is currently up to seven novels. According to Dinniman, he has plans for up to ten books in the series.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve just entered the sixth year of the latest console generation. Can you believe it’s already been that long? The Xbox Series X and S are now fully matured. Their libraries are more robust than ever, full not just of cross-gen ports and sequels but brand-new series as well. How do the games measure up?</p> <p>While platform barriers are starting to come down and it’s getting harder to tell the consoles apart in many respects, the Xbox Series X/S still has a few remnants left of a unique identity. We compiled this list mindful of the nuances around exclusivity and first-party games while also wanting to acknowledge the great games that are playable on Xbox Series X/S whether they originated there or not. Simply put: if you just got your first Xbox Series X/S and haven’t already played these games before, what follows are the top “must plays” for the platform.</p>

 <p>Yes, the Xbox Series X and S are basically souped-up Xbox Ones, which means you’ll rarely be pressed for awesome games to play. A good rule of thumb is this: If it was playable on the Xbox One, it’s playable on the Xbox Series X and S. (To that end, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-games-for-the-xbox-one-1500422046">here’s our list of the best games for the Xbox One</a>.) There’s also the matter of a little service called Game Pass.</p> <p>For $30 a month, you can also access Microsoft’s subscription library, including first-party exclusives and a rotating slew of third-party hits. (Hey, look, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-games-on-xbox-game-pass-1841477023?_ga=2.146372340.1373133010.1689166215-2090935794.1654779924">here’s our list of the best games on Game Pass</a>.) With all that in mind, here are the best games for the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>Every family has at least one nostalgia-filled retro gamer. You know, that person who still swears the SNES controller is perfection or insists that nothing beats the original Pokémon intro. And honestly? They might not be wrong. There’s something timeless about jumping back into the games we grew up with, which makes retro-themed gifts some of the best surprises you can give during the holidays.</p>



<p>Whether you’re the type of person who has to hunt down classic cartridges from the 70s, 80s, and 90s, or you just want to do something small for someone special in your life, there are plenty of gift options to make that retro gamer in your life happy. From fantastic books to novelty gifts, these are the best gifts in 2025 for your nostalgia-filled friend.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-retro-gaming-gifts-for-2025">Best Retro Gaming Gifts For 2025</h2>



<p><strong>Press Reset by Jason Schrier</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>One of the best books on games and the people that make them, Press Reset comes from veteran journalist Jason Schreier. Rather than tell you more, let’s let Schreier explain it himself.</p>



<p><strong>“The business of videogames is both a prestige industry and an opaque one. Based on dozens of first-hand interviews that cover the development of landmark games—Bioshock Infinite, Epic Mickey, Dead Space, and more—on to the shocking closures of the studios that made them,&nbsp;Press Reset&nbsp;tells the stories of how real people are affected by game studio shutdowns, and how they recover, move on, or escape the industry entirely.”</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Original Xbox: The Console and the Games by&nbsp;Jonathan Clarke&nbsp;and&nbsp;Clarke</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a long-time Xbox fan, the upcoming book Original Xbox: The Console brings you a visual history of all of the games released on the original Xbox. </p>



<p>The book comes from the team at Xbox Era and features 360 full color pages and over 790 games. <strong>“From Fable to MechAssault, Halo: Combat Evolved to the very first Forza Motorsport, this book is a celebration of the console that started it all.”</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>The 100 Greatest Console Video Games: 1988-1998 by Brett Weiss</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The 100 Greatest Console Video Games: 1988-1998 is the follow-up to the best-selling The 100 Greatest Console Video Games: 1977-1987. </p>



<p>The book features 100 games with two-to-three full pages of the game’s history, production info, details, developer quotes and more.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>A Handheld History by Lost in Cult</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The last book on this list, A Handheld History takes a look&nbsp;<strong>“into decades of gaming memories and reconnect you to that long car journey full of discarded AA batteries before speeding ahead to the contemporary days of blockbusters in your backpack.”</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Mario Heat Changing Mug</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For your coffee or tea aficionados, this mug is as straight forward as it gets. When it’s cold, it shows and overworld Mario level. Pour a hot drink in it, it goes dark with extra details.</p>







<hr>







<p><strong>Gameboy Lego Set</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are a lot of gaming-themed LEGO sets, but one of the favorites is the Gameboy set. Featuring 421 pieces, this set includes a Gameboy display, two game cartridges that can go into a Gam Pak slot, and even options for a Nintendo Start Screen or game screen placeholders. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Nintendo NES Coasters</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to show off your fandom without leaving a ring on your table, these NES coasters look like the cartridges from eight classic games: Metroid, Duck Hunt, Donkey Kong, Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3, The Legend of Zelda, and Excitebike.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Super Mario Coin Block Pillow Plush</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are plenty of plush pillows available, but the Mario coin block pillow is one that just wants you to let out some frustration. Get this pillow and just give it a few punches, but it’s unlikely you’ll get any coins out of it. You can try, though.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Subscription (12 months)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A modern-day console gift for a retro gamer? That’s right. With a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion subscription players get access to not only NES, SNES, and Game Boy classic games, but also Sega Genesis, N64, and GameCube games.</p>



<p>If the backlog wasn’t full enough, adding these games that are full of nostalgia for the gamer in your life is one heck of a gift.</p>







<hr>







<p><strong>8Bitdo Bluetooth Retro Receiver for PS1, PS2, and Windows</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you want to play your old PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 with a modern controller, then 8Bitdo has you covered. The 8Bitdo Bluetooth Retro Receiver allows you to use your Xbox, PS4, PS5, Wii U Pro and Switch Pro controllers wirelessly with your older systems. Imagine just sitting on your couch that’s more than 10 feet from your TV?</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>The Oregon Trail Card Game</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you want to get away from the screen but still relive your gaming youth, The Oregon Trail Card Game will give you dysentery wherever you go. The game supports 2-6 players and even features 8-bit style art.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Atari 2600+ PAC-MAN Edition Console</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sticking with the classics, if you grew up playing the Atari 2600 or just want to see what all the fuss is about, then the Atari 2600+ might just be the next best thing to the original classic console. The Atari 2600+ includes a wireless joystick and is compatible with both 2600 and 7800 games. The system also comes with Pac-Man 7800 and Pac-Man 2600 and has HDMI output for modern TVs.</p>

With a mix of die-cast metal, thermoplastic rubber, and engineered plastics, it’s built to last.

Each detail of this wrist-mounted computer remains faithful to the game. A fully functional IPS display delivers that vintage cathode ray tube look, complete with screen glitches and a huge gallery of media, including the Atomic Command minigame. The Wand Company spared no expense when creating this replica, from its die-cast metal front casing and memory foam cuff with a spacer to a rechargeable LiPo power cell and LED torch. It’s sure to elevate your cosplay to another level, but the included machined metal stand is ideal for displaying this exhibition-grade collectible — or using the Pip-Boy 3000 as an alarm clock; yes, it does that too. </p></div><p id="new-vegas-ranger-statue"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="New Vegas Ranger Statue">Fallout New Vegas Ranger Statue</h2></p><div catalogid="84737b41-6a12-4e0e-9a1a-40bee8f54287" id="230124"><div id="230124" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout New Vegas Ranger Statue</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The detail is incredible on this 8.4-inch resin statue of a New Vegas Ranger.

It’s hand-painted with weathered detail to make each helmet unique. A green glow even comes from the eyes, thanks to the inclusion of LED lights. Best of all, this helmet is wearable for some epic cosplay, and it comes with a stand for displaying. An enamel pin of a completely geared-up Desert Ranger is also included. You can pre-order the Desert Ranger Battle Helmet now, with shipping expected to begin in December. </p></div><p id="lucys-vault-33-backpack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lucy's Vault 33 Backpack">Fallout Lucy's Vault 33 Backpack</h2></p><div catalogid="84737b41-6a12-4e0e-9a1a-40bee8f54287" id="230120"><div id="230120" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout Lucy's Vault 33 Backpack</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While you might not be navigating the Wasteland like Lucy, you can accessorize similarly to her in the real world with this remarkably accurate replica rolltop backpack. While it’s brilliant for cosplay, this bag is well-built, durable, and surprisingly big, making it a great option for everyday use. You’ll find a 20L interior compartment, a laptop slot, pockets for various accessories, and, of course, the thick signature yellow blanket that rests on top. Given that this backpack is from the minds at The Wand Company, even the patterns and materials to create it are specially sourced to match what’s used in the show. </p></div><p id="sunset-sarsaparilla-bottle-caps"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sunset Sarsaparilla Bottle Caps">Fallout Bottlecap Series: Sunset Sarsaparilla with Collectible Tin</h2></p><div catalogid="84737b41-6a12-4e0e-9a1a-40bee8f54287" id="230126"><div id="230126" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout Bottlecap Series: Sunset Sarsaparilla with Collectible Tin</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can’t use these bottle caps for currency in the real world, they do make for one fun keepsake.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Haha. Yeah, I know. "Half-Life 3". The long-fabled, often-rumored, still non-existent third numbered entry in the Half-Life series that fans have craved but never heard a credible whisper of. It's been a pervasive joke in the industry and among fans for years, a stand-in for a thing that doesn't exist and never would.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet, for some reason, a lot of people seem to think it's being announced soon. Possibly in the next few weeks. Maybe even today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might have seen it. The sudden flurry of mentions of Half-Life 3, some humorous, some quite serious. The surge of memes. A handful of people that seem to have lost their dang minds:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update 1:09pm PT:</strong> Originally, I had included several embeds of Reddit posts of people desperately praying and begging for a Half-Life 3 announcement. However, the r/halflife mods appear to be removing them, seemingly due to the subreddit's rule against "low-value submissions", aka memes, and perhaps due to the sheer volume of these posts recently. These have subsequently been replaced by more posts wishing for Half-Life 3 - honestly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just check out the subreddit</a>, I'm sure you'll see some good ones that haven't been deleted yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Original story continues below:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's going on? Why do people think Half-Life 3 is imminent, seriously or unseriously? We investigated:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Half-Hope</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life 3 rumors have existed pretty much since Half-Life 2 first released, so that's nothing new. But the last couple of years have seen a steady trickle of interesting little threads that have lead many to believe that a third entry was actually in development, quietly, at Valve. There were vague nods, such as the Half-Life: Alyx team <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-half-life-alyx-sequel">saying they wanted to make more Half-Life games</a> and a Final Hours documentary that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-left-4-dead-3-details-cancelled-valve">actually confirmed it was in development at one point</a> between 2013 and 2014. We've also seen dataminers pulling crumbs from various Valve releases over the last few years of what seems to be an in-development game internally at Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known only as "HLX",</a> using Source 2. Dataminers have worked out that it's a full-fledged, non-VR, Half-Life game of some sort, that's been in the works since at least 2021, probably earlier. That game is possibly the same one as was accidentally leaked by a voice actor in 2024, who referred to it as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Project White Sands"</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But this year there's been a marked increase in little breadcrumbs. Right after the new year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-rumors-ramp-up-after-g-man-voice-actor-issues-cryptic-tweet-his-first-in-years">G-Man's voice actor issued a cryptic post</a> teasing "unexpected surprises" in 2025 – it was his first tweet since he congratulated Valve on Half-Life: Alyx in December 2020. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-fans-are-doing-a-gta-6-and-losing-their-minds-over-hidden-half-life-3-clues-they-desperately-want-to-be-real">Fans proceeded to tear apart the post</a>, delving deep into an album cover image and the number 197 for what they believed were even more hints that something was in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But an already simmering pot of rumors turned into a full boil with the announcement last week of new Valve hardware: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-machine-hands-on-first-impressions">the Steam Machine</a>, complete with a new Steam controller, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-frame-preview-hands-on-with-valves-state-of-the-art-vr-headset">VR headset known as the Steam Frame</a>. Notably, there were no software announcements alongside these hardware reveals, which is a bit odd given that Valve tends to release new games alongside new hardware - recall Half-Life: Alyx and the Valve Index headset. Around the same time, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1ox4jzk/more_hopium/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a number</a> of Valve and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/uwn_XYk8Is8?t=2122s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">industry insiders</a> began mentioning Half-Life 3, saying confidently that it was planned for a 2025 announcement still. One leaker, who has a good track record of getting Valve stuff right, said back in May that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-is-not-just-in-development-its-now-playable-end-to-end-leaker-suggests" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Half-Life 3 was officially "playable, end-to-end."</a> There's a <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">massive Miro board floating around</a> that has catalogued every remotely credible recent mention of Half-Life 3, and is worth digging into if you want follow along.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Go, G-Man, Go</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many other weird little indicators floating around that are leading to wild speculation. For instance, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/valve" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve's "Upcoming Releases" tab</a> on its own Steam page only lists one game (Deadlock) despite the sidebar indicating that there are <em>two</em> upcoming game releases. A <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1991101144207085644?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet/X post</a> from the official The Game Awards account commemorating Half-Life's 27th anniversary today has sent everyone into a frenzy, even though it tweets this anniversary every year. There was a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weird amount of extra security at Valve</a> during the recent Steam hardware preview events – something noticed by IGN's own representatives and contrasted with my personal experience there for Half-Life: Alyx years ago, which featured a relatively normal and relaxed amount of security.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there was an incredibly silly saga where <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990519287032000600?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geoff Keighley posted a screenshot</a> that showed he had one game in his Steam wishlist. When <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1990526450005651771?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked what the game was</a>, he responded with an eyes emoji, and then <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990894100531306531?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showed the game Dadlympics</a>. Of course, the Half-Life nerds pounced. Keighley then posted a screenshot of his wishlist showing only the game "Dadlympics," but notably, this was added on 11/18, the same day he posted the screenshot, suggesting he's hiding <em>something.</em> Is he hiding Half-Life 3? Probably not! It doesn't have a viewable Steam page! That's not how Steam works! But that hasn't stopped Half-Life 3 fans from pouncing. Seriously, the replies are hilarious.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/t5L0zHW0Il" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/t5L0zHW0Il</a></p>— arda (@lornarcoss) <a href="https://twitter.com/lornarcoss/status/1990682190263251432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever you believe is happening here, the reality is that this has resulted in the community going completely bonkers. The Half-Life subreddit is overflowing with Half-Life 3 summoning and hope posts. A quick search for Half-Life on Twitter/X reveals an overflow of discourse, prayers, and memes. It's kind of nuts, and also really, really fun:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, so let's say everyone's right, and we really are getting Half-Life 3 announced soon. When? Well, some think it's as soon as today. November 19, as The Game Awards posted, is the anniversary of Half-Life – what better time to make an announcement? We've already passed the anniversary of Half-Life 2, and the anniversary of Half-Life: Alyx's announcement, but that particular anniversary is the reason you're likely seeing so much noise around this today. The other big possibility floated by some is an announcement at The Game Awards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">which is coming up on December 11</a>. That would be a little surprising, given that Valve doesn't need an awards show to command attention with such an announcement. But Valve also has a long history of friendliness with host Geoff Keighley, so maybe it's not so far-fetched after all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the case, one thing is certain: either Half-Life 3 is getting announced before December 31, 2025, or an awful lot of folks are going to have egg on their faces come January 1, 2026. I'm personally hoping for the former, but the community has been hoodwinked before with Half-Life rumors, multiple times even. Keep injecting that Hopium, folks. Perhaps the return of G-man is right around the corner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

                <p>From a distance, the new twelve-sided tower rising in Phoenix’s Arts District looks like it belongs in a futuristic cityscape--or maybe in the middle of a very enthusiastic geometry lesson. However, ask the designers and they'll tell you there's a wink and a nod to a certain beloved racing game: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart</a>.</p><p>"To build buildings that are unique that people stop and say, 'Hey, what is that?' I think is important to any downtown," said Zac Cohen, creative director at Räkkhaus, the architectural firm behind the project, to <a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/mario-kart-inspired-apartment-complex-opening-downtown-phoenix" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fox 10 in Phoenix</a>. In other words: If you think this building looks quirky now, just wait until you learn what inspired it.</p><p>The complex takes its name from a famously chaotic, candy-colored racetrack known for sending players plummeting into the void, Rainbow Road. Obviously, you won't see any characters or trademarked symbols on the exterior--a strategic choice, given a certain company's well-known legal enthusiasm--but the references are there if you know where to look and if you look hard enough. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_BUH7rDlnU" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x_BUH7rDlnU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"One of them is that it's a 12-sided building, which represents the twists and turns of the track," he explained. "As you progress up, you level up with each floor." Even the window insets flash a spectrum of colors, a subtle nod to the kaleidoscopic visuals of the legendary course.</p><p>"The windows are obviously very dramatic; they are angled in different ways to provide sort of a twisting motion," Cohen said. "When you're looking at the building from downstairs, it almost appears to move." That sense of motion extends to the ground level, where public art elements like bike racks and benches trace the flowing geometry of Rainbow Road. A patterned sidewalk wrap will continue the motif around the block, creating a walkable ribbon of color that locals could recognize even without any game logos.</p><p>Inside, the mixed-use complex offers a public fitness area, an indoor-outdoor restaurant, and 36 apartment units, with rents starting at just over $1,900 per month. After 16 months of construction, the project opens on December 1, and Cohen hopes it will energize the neighborhood.</p><p>"We were hoping to design something fun and playful and representative of the arts in the arts district," he said. "There's a surprising lack of art-focused business here, so we wanted to be the catalyst for higher design."</p><p>If you don't live in Phoenix and/or aren't looking to move, you can still enjoy Rainbow Road like the rest of us: by playing Mario Kart World. The game was nominated for a few categories at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a>, and we'll find out if it wins in just a few weeks.</p>

Anyone order a free <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> update? Well, whether you did or not, a free update is what you're getting. This one's quite features driven, focusing a lot of challenges and cosmetics, but there's a few new weapons and the like too. Let's take a little look-see!
</p>
<p>
For starters, this update, titled Free Ride, is due out tomorrow, November 20th, so you've not got long to wait for it. It's similar to the Free Ride mode you might have experienced in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-definitive-edition">Mafia: Definitive Edition</a>, for a frame of reference. Included are different sets of challenges, unconnected to the story, which range from combat, stealth, and racing missions, taking place in some new areas, but also places from the base game. Completing said challenges nets you the in-game Dinari currency to buy things like outfits, weapons, or vehicles. You can also drive in first-person now! Not much to say about that one.

<p>
As every single game under the sun now has, there's a photo mode being added in. For those of you up for more of a challenge, the classic difficulty setting will also be available. 
</p>
<p>
Possibly my least favourite addition at just a cursory glance is the game's new "Cinema Siciliano" mode. Think something along the lines of the Akira Kurosawa mode in Ghost of Tsushima - the Cinema Siciliano mode also turns things black and white, adds film grain, and puts a filter on the audio so that it sounds a bit old and crappy. I understand that you're inspired by movies, it just feels weirdly fake and cheap when you slap some filters on top of things and call it a day! You'd need a lighting overall to really capture the appropriate feeling in the first place, but I digress.
</p>
<p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Starting this Friday, Black Ops 7’s Endgame mode will be unlocked for everyone, regardless of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-endgame-multiplayer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign completion</a> or not. Fortunately, those who beat the story will get some rewards.</p>







<p>Released earlier this month, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has had quite the rough patch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI allegations</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-metacritic-user-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negative feedback</a> have taken a lot of the airwaves for the game. Furthermore, its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwhelming player count</a> on opening weekend compared to Battlefield 6 are not the best. However, its multiplayer modes, especially Endgame, have been recieved well. It did require one to go through a ‘garbage’ campaign, so many haven’t gotten to try it yet. Now, not even a month since releasing, the mode will be available to all.</p>



<h2 id="h-endgame-mode-available-on-friday-without-campaign-requirement-in-black-ops-7">Endgame Mode Available on Friday Without Campaign Requirement in Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Co-Op Endgame mode will unlock for all Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 players starting this Friday, November 21. </p><p>Those who finished the campaign to get Endgame will receive 3x 1 hr 2XP Tokens, 2X Weapon XP Tokens, 2X Battle Pass XP Tokens, and 3x Perkaholic GobbleGums. <a href="https://t.co/i3z6j0pVll">pic.twitter.com/i3z6j0pVll</a></p></div>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1991221059119415675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post on Twitter/X, <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1991221059119415675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a> stated that, starting Friday, November 21st, Black Ops 7’s Endgame mode will be available for everyone. As mentioned before, the mode was previously locked behind beating the co-op campaign. If you were one of those who beat it to get Endgame, there are rewards you’ll be able to redeem. The list can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>3x 1-Hour 2XP Tokens</li>



<li>2x Weapon XP Tokens</li>



<li>2x Battle Pass XP Tokens</li>



<li>3x Perkaholic GobbleGums</li>
</ul>



<p>The mode is Call of Duty’s new answer to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dmz-is-officially-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DMZ from Modern Warfare 2</a>. With an open world, Avalon, you and four friends can take on missions, secure objectives, and explore. Other teams will be on the map and you’ll compete with them, as well. </p>



<p>With the mode now available to all, it’ll be interesting to see if it has an effect on the player count. Many fans do like the mode, so without having prerequisites, it may bring more people in. Either way, the move does feel a bit sudden, especially coming just two weeks after releasing. </p>







<p>What do you think of Endgame being fully available in Black Ops 7? Is it to boost engagement? Have you played the mode? Was it worth going through the campaign?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ music</span></a><span> comes from the mind of Ejae, who also provides the singing voice for Rumi, the lead singer of the movie’s titular girl group. As such, there are demos for every song in the film with Ejae singing just about every part. This includes songs like “Your Idol,” which Rumi doesn’t perform at all in the finished film, so when we get to hear these demos, it’s like listening to an alternate version of the movie in which the girls of Huntr/x were the demons singing songs to capture the hearts and minds of the masses.</span></p> <p><span>Ejae has played snippets of the demo version of “Your Idol” before, but this is the first time we’ve heard this much of it. The singer/songwriter was </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM2qmgJZPek"><span>part of an event</span></a><span> where she and co-songwriter Mark Sonnenblick talked about the making of </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ soundtrack and played a couple of demos for the audience. This included the Grammy-nominated “Golden” and the original “Your Idol” recording, which has some different lyrics than those heard in the film. Even if it only includes the first verse, it’s really cool to hear Rumi’s voice singing a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346"><span>Saja Boys</span></a><span> song. I’d take an EP of the Saja Boys singing Huntr/x songs and vice versa, but I’d settle for full releases of Ejae’s original demos as bonus tracks.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ soundtrack did get a Deluxe Edition release, but its new additions are mostly just acapella and instrumental tracks. If Taylor Swift can release dozens of versions of her albums, what’s the harm in Netflix and Sony putting out another version of the soundtrack that includes these old demos?</span></p> <p><span>For now, Ejae seems to be gearing up for her own solo debut after the success of the film. She released </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-new-song-ejae-in-another-world-video-2000638832"><span>her first single, “In Another World,”</span></a><span> last month, and will hopefully be writing songs for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-netflix-release-date-2029-2000641414"><span>upcoming </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>sequel</span></a><span> in the near future.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else.1358491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there’s one thing I really appreciate about <em>Deadpool VR</em>, out now exclusively on Quest 3 and Quest 3S virtual reality headsets, it’s how the first-person action-shooter lets you know right away what it is.</p> <p>The opening minutes of the game feature Neil Patrick Harris as Wade Wilson aka Deadpool, carrying out his wild plan to use a jeep filled with explosives to blast open a hole in a large aircraft taken over by an evil group of ninjas. If you like what this opening offers, the rest of the game only gets better. But if you can’t stand Deadpool or prefer VR games that feature interactivity, you’ll likely be ripping the headset off in minutes.</p> <h2>What is <em>Deadpool VR</em>?</h2> <p>Developed by Twisted Pixel and published by Meta, <em>Deadpool VR</em> is, as the name very clearly states, a virtual reality game in which you star as Deadpool as he gets sucked into a bonkers intergalactic reality show and quickly agrees to do evil villain Mojo’s bidding while getting as many viewers as possible. If he pulls it off, he’ll be a famous star. If he fails, he’ll be canceled, which in Mojo’s world equals death.</p>

  <p>Well, actually, to get to this part of the game, you’ll have to slog through the opening level set inside an occupied Shield helicarrier that Deadpool is being paid to rescue from the Hand Clan. And this part sucks, and is the worst bit of <em>Deadpool VR.</em> Prepare for a lot of dark grey corridors filled with the same enemies. And because Deadpool is very hard to kill, you rarely feel in danger in this section.</p>

 <p>The game is also very, very slow about offering up more ways to kill and interact with stuff during this elongated intro. So you spend a lot of time flailing your swords at baddies and watching them crumple in unsatisfying ways, or slowly walking around empty rooms. At one point, Deadpool himself pipes up to point out how dull the ship is and how easy the enemies are, and while it did make me chuckle, it didn’t change the fact that this part sucked a lot.</p>

 <h2>Swords are great, guns are bad</h2> <p>Thankfully, after a fun boss fight that combines all the tools you acquire during the intro, like a grappling hook and grenades, you are sucked into Mojo’s World. This is when the actual game starts. From here on out, <em>Deadpool VR</em> is about tracking down targets for Mojo, fighting lots of baddies as stylishly as possible to gain more viewers, and then using the cash you earn from your antics to buy new weapons and cosmetics.</p>

 <p>While combat in<em> Deadpool VR</em> isn’t groundbreaking for virtual games, it works well enough and has some solid mechanics. I especially liked being able to toss a gun at a bad guy, which reloads it and bounces it back to Deadpool. Fun stuff! I also liked being able to divekick stunned enemies to pop their heads off. Oh, and flinging Deadpool’s swords at enemies is wonderful. They fly with a lot of speed, autotarget just enough that you always feel cool doing it, and pin their targets to nearby walls.</p>

 <p>However, all the guns feel weak, and enemies don’t respond to hits in a way that feels satisfying. Picking up a shotgun, I was excited to blast fools away. But it doesn’t do that at all, and it often took more than one shot with it to take down people, who then didn’t go flying back in an explosion of blood. Boo! This is a <em>Deadpool</em> game, guns should blow people up and feel awesome and powerful.</p>

 <p>And you’ll get your fill of all the good and bad of <em>Deadpool VR’</em>s combat and then some because many fights go on way, way too long. At least during these bigger encounters, you can easily fill your special meter, letting you activate a special attack that uses various Marvel character weapons, like Gambit’s cards. During these sections, the game plays different licensed tracks, and I’ll admit I bobbed my head and smiled as I used playing cards charged with energy to slice down a dozen ninjas in a level set in Japan.</p> <h2>Shut the hell up, Deadpool</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000645535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645535"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645535">©Marvel / Meta</figcaption></figure> <p>But throughout all of this, Neil Patrick Harris is voicing Deadpool, and it is a drag. He often sounds as if he walked into the booth and did one take while reading the script for the first time and called it a day. Often his voice sounds lifeless, his quips lack emotion, and he delivers jokes as well as a kid trying to explain why that one moment in the latest MrBeast video was so damn funny.</p> <p>What’s odd is that there are times when NPH actually delivers some genuinely funny lines with emotion and care. But they happen so infrequently that it makes me think he or whoever was in charge of directing his performance decided that for most of the game, Deadpool should be disconnected and nonchalant. It doesn’t work and just makes the few moments where he does come alive feel out of place. And the writing doesn’t help, with a lot of jokes and material being the kind of dialogue that would get cut from the first draft of a Ryan Reynolds-led <em>Deadpool</em> movie. I’d say the ratio of jokes that actually got a laugh out of me was about 1 in 5.</p>

 <p>I don’t even hate Deadpool! In fact, I really liked the last two movies and that Xbox-360-era game. If someone like me was struggling with some of the writing and with NPH’s performance, I’m not sure how people who truly despise Deadpool will handle playing <em>Deadpool VR.</em> Having your head strapped into a hot machine that screams Deadpool lines directly into your ear for hours might be like torture for them.<em> *shudders.*&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Ultimately, if you mostly like Deadpool, you own a Quest 3 or Quest 3S VR headset, and you don’t mind playing through levels that lack the interactivity seen in games like <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, I’d recommend <em>Deadpool VR</em>. But be prepared for a bleh intro, bad jokes, and performance hiccups that can make the game chug hard. I have a strong VR stomach and powered through these moments, but others might not make it without feeling sick. And if you hate Deadpool, well, you’ll probably feel sick for a whole other reason. So to Deadpool haters, I’d advise staying away from <em>Deadpool VR.</em> Doubt I needed to warn you anyway.</p>

                <p>Once again, Activision has reimagined one of Call of Duty's most iconic maps, Nuketown, and it's launching on November 20 for Black Ops 7. Now, Activision has released a new trailer dedicated to the map, which shows off its new look.</p><p>The new version is called <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Nuketown_2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nuketown 2025</a>, and as you can see in the trailer, the map appears to be based on the same Nuketown 2025 from Black Ops 2. This makes sense as Black Ops 7 is a sequel to Black Ops 2. Whereas the original version of Nuketown from 2010's Black Ops was based on a '50s theme, this newest iteration has a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-maps-modes-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"retro-futuristic" vibe </a> that imagines what people thought the "neighborhood of the future" could look like.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Nuketown 2025 Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>A key gameplay difference for Nuketown 2025 in Black Ops 7 is that the game features wall-jumping, which affords players new ways to get around the map. Nuketown is a small-size map known for its fast and frenetic action, and with wall-jumping now in play, things might get even more hectic.</p><p>Nuketown has seen a number of updates and revisions over the years. Black Ops 6 also brought back Nuketown and offered multiple variations of it, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-6-patch-notes-detail-weapon-buffs-and-bug-fixes-for-bo6-and-warzone/2900-7124/" data-ref-id="2900-7124">"Boo-town" for Halloween</a> and a trippy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cods-iconic-nuketown-map-gets-a-4-20-makeover-soon-in-black-ops-6/1100-6530460/" data-ref-id="1100-6530460">"Blaze Town" makeover for 4/20.</a></p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Treyarch has announced that <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black Ops 7's Endgame will be available to everyone</a> starting November 21. Currently, players have to complete the campaign to unlock it.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launched on November 14, and, in a break from tradition, Activision's first-weekend social media post about the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-isnt-sharing-any-black-ops-7-launch-weekend-game-stats/1100-6536299/" data-ref-id="1100-6536299">did not include any mention of how the game is performing compared to past releases. </a></p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">GameSpot's Black Ops 7 review</a>.

<p>Horii began his career as a magazine writer, including his own column in <em>Weekly Shōnen Jump</em>, a popular manga publication. He saved up his money and, by age 27, had enough to purchase a computer. It was with this computer that he began "dabbling in game development," he tells me. Around that time in his life, Enix Corp, as it was called before merging with Final Fantasy maker Square to create Square Enix in 2003, hosted a game development contest – Horii won an award in it, "and that's actually the beginning of my career as a developer," he says.&nbsp;</p><p>On this personal computer, Horii played a game called Ultima 1: The First Age of Darkness, a primitive RPG by today's standards but one that, when viewed, can be seen as a clear inspiration for RPGs like Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, and more. "That really inspired me," Horii says. He remembers thinking, "If I make a game like this, it'll surely become a hit." Unlike Ultima, which was a PC game, he wanted to create something like it (or like Wizardry, another game he mentions as inspirational) for the Famicom, with its 64-kilobyte limits. Specifically, he wanted to use Ultima's 2D dungeon system (versus Wizardry's 3D approach) and combine it with Wizardry's "character growth" (which we now call RPG elements today) to create something new for this new Nintendo console.&nbsp;</p><p>"Within that limitation [of the Famicom], I wanted to make something that would resonate with people," he says. "[...] I was really fascinated by the interactive nature of computer games. I wanted to create a game that was really story-focused, or had a heavy story element, because that would surely be an interesting product."&nbsp;</p><p>That product Horii had in mind would become Dragon Quest, and he quickly got to work, drawing maps, cities, and even the world's citizens on paper before fleshing out the main scenario in his head. However, this initial foundation and his computer prowess could only get him so far – to turn Dragon Quest into a real game, he needed two more people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Horii recalls how the person who would become the lead character and monster designer of the Dragon Quest series became involved.&nbsp;</p><p>"[There] was a staff member [at <em>Weekly Shōnen Jump] </em>named Torishima-san, who was also the assigned editor of someone named Akira Toriyama," Horii says, adding that Torishima told him this Toriyama person wanted to work on a video game. Familiar with Toriyama's art, Horii reached out to him and the rest is history.&nbsp;</p><p>Though you might associate Akira Toriyama as the visionary creator of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, Toriyama is the man responsible for the visual style of Dragon Quest. Sure, his excellent on-paper art didn't translate precisely into the 8-bit visuals of Dragon Quest – how could it? – but it created the <em>vibes </em>(and some amazing box art, too), and those vibes run like blood through the series, even today, more than a year after <a href="https://gameinformer.com/obituary/2024/03/08/akira-toriyama-creator-of-dragon-ball-has-passed-away">Toriyama's untimely death</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as crucial to the Dragon Quest puzzle as Horii and Toriyama is Koichi Sugiyama, who, prior to Dragon Quest, was already renowned outside of games for his work in movies, TV, anime, and other fields.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in the '80s, Square released a Shogi (Japanese chess) game and afterward, it sent out a survey postcard to everyone who purchased the game. Sugiyama responded to it, saying he was an enthusiastic player. People throughout Square took notice – "Isn't this guy a famous composer?" Horii remembers thinking. Horii and the team used the opportunity to speak to Sugiyama and get him involved in Dragon Quest, and again, the rest is history. Unfortunately, Sugiyama died in 2021 at the age of 90, but like Toriyama's art, his music defined a critical aspect of Dragon Quest, and I imagine it will continue to do so long after his death.&nbsp;</p><h2>The First Quest</h2>

<p>Dragon Quest launched on the Famicom in Japan on May 27, 1986, and it hit the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America three years later in 1989...except with a new title: Dragon Warrior.&nbsp;</p><p>“Way back then, when it originally released outside of Japan, we weren’t able to use the name Dragon Quest; we had to do Dragon Warrior,” Horii says. If you look at the U.S. box art for Dragon Warrior, you’ll notice it features box art different from the Japanese release, too; noticeably, without Toriyama’s art.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest is arguably the quintessential JRPG, a term some Japanese developers have balked at, but one Horii gladly accepts. It is a 2D fantasy game with a protagonist named Hero who must save the world by defeating monsters and evil in turn-based combat. “I’m just really happy to see everyone feel that way and have this sentiment toward the Dragon Quest series as a whole,” Horii tells me when asked about Dragon Quest’s place in the halls of RPG greats. “Attaching that story element to an RPG was considered a fresh perspective at the time, and I think that’s what really made Dragon Quest stand out from other game titles.”</p><p>Dragon Quest, the first official Japanese version, has sold 1.5 million copies, according to this <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Quest#cite_note-magicboxjapan-2">sourced Fandom chart</a>, with Dragon Warrior selling roughly half a million copies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With Dragon Quest's success, the team officially got to work on its first-ever sequel, Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line, though Horii tells me he was already working on it before that greenlight; in fact, the team was busy making DQII before the first game even launched, "so I guess yeah, we were pretty confident."&nbsp;</p><p>I spoke to Horii about DQII and the rest of the series' sequels, but to read about his thoughts on those games, you'll need to check out my full Dragon Quest retrospective <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.</p><p>While waiting for its launch, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet to access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.

<p>Tanks for the memories</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section></header><section><p>Hamster Corporation's Arcade Archives series is back with another cabinet classic on Switch 2. I got to check out Jet Ski racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-aqua-jet">Aqua Jet</a> back in August, which was a lovingly crafted port. This time I'm revisiting the destructive tank combat of Namco's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-tokyo-wars">Tokyo Wars</a>, which served as inspiration for The 3DO Company's N64 classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/battletanx_global_assault">Battle Tanx: Global Assault</a>.</p>
<p>Aqua Jet was notable for having a cabinet containing a replica Jet Ski, something which can’t really be recreated on Switch (without some serious hardware modding). Tokyo Wars had a similar hardware quirk that provided a satisfying kickback to simulate your tank firing its payload. A feature that is, bafflingly, not emulated with the Switch 2 controllers' haptics.</p>
<p>Aside from the complete lack of feedback when unleashing shells on enemy tanks, this port is as clean and generously featured as I've come to expect from Hamster Corp.</p>
<p>The premise couldn't be simpler: Rival factions battle it out in the streets of Tokyo. You choose from White Force or Green Force and roll around the map, shelling any opposing tank you find, while avoiding your team’s armour. This was a great game back in the day and it's worth experiencing now, even if there isn't much to do in its two arenas.</p>
<p>This 1996 title looks as polished as it possibly could be, outside of being remastered. Visuals and audio are crisp and suit docked and undocked modes equally, with many format options to tweak the experience to your liking. Special mention goes to crisp presentation of Akihiko Ishikawa's insane music, which makes you feel like you're at a sweaty Japanese rave instead of a warzone.</p>
<p>Both English and Japanese versions of the game are playable in all available modes. Caravan time attack makes a return and can be played in split screen. Other modes can also be played in up to four-player local split screen.</p>
<p>Much like other games in the Arcade Archives, all the content in Tokyo Wars has to offer can be experienced in minutes. An additional Multiplayer mode is the only thing that would extend the lifespan of this slight experience.</p>
<p>Enjoyment comes from improving on your own performance and competing with others, as is usual with an arcade title. That said, the more of these Arcade Archives titles that Hamster Corp puts out, the more it becomes evident that an 'Arcade Archives 2 Collection' would be much more value for money than individual releases.</p></section></article><div><p>Ken Talbot has been playing games since they came in the form of cassettes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> new line of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459"><span>Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> has had both highs and lows. The Switch RPG’s wave of superpowered transformations has its fair share of undisputed bangers like Mega Drampa, who turns from its wise old dragon form into a younger, battle-ready one, and Delphox, who defies gravity while flying on a witch’s broom. Still, there are a handful, like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-jokes-memes-videos-art-2000638556"><span>long-legged Mega Starmie</span></a><span>, that have split the community. Another of those less widely beloved Megas is Feraligatr, one of the game’s starter Pokémon, though some fan artists have been creating their own interpretations that show the design isn’t beyond salvage; it just looks kind of dumb as it’s presented in-game.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000642463" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642463"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642463">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When Feraligatr mega evolves, it gains a large red dorsal fin on its back that, when combined with the new spikes on its arms, creates what resembles a giant Totodile mascot head. A lot of Mega Evolutions have elements of a Pokémon’s previous evolutions, like Mega Raichu’s fur reverting to Pikachu’s signature yellow or Mega Chimecho growing a massive Chingling-shaped ornament. Mega Feraligatr’s big Totodile head is one of the most extreme examples of a Mega Evolution following this design philosophy. However, it ends up looking absurd because the giant fin on Feraligatr’s back stays flipped open like a toilet lid.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>According to the Pokédex, this giant Totodile mask can bite down 10 times harder than Feraligatr’s actual jaw, so it makes sense that the water dragon would keep its fake jaw as extended as possible until it attacks. Poor guy runs around with this flapping fake jaw behind it, but as fan artists and animators have discovered, one small tweak actually improves the design significantly: just put the hood down.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">mega Feraligatr but the Totodile head doesn't flip back <a href="https://t.co/wLeCXyMCzh">pic.twitter.com/wLeCXyMCzh</a></p> <p>— doodlelotl (@Doodlelot) <a href="https://twitter.com/Doodlelot/status/1980380003952169372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">making renders of Mega Feraligatr and it would be my favorite new design if it permanently leaned into the camouflage look like this instead of the toilet seat lid <a href="https://t.co/cotsIVL85C">pic.twitter.com/cotsIVL85C</a></p> <p>— Lewtwo (@Lewchube) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lewchube/status/1983534993638089104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mega Feraligatr but it actually commits to the Totodile disguise <a href="https://t.co/eviPglsE9Y">https://t.co/eviPglsE9Y</a> <a href="https://t.co/TXlOHfRaLw">pic.twitter.com/TXlOHfRaLw</a></p> <p>— Yisuno ⚝ | MEGA ENJOYER (@TheYisusOne) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheYisusOne/status/1990072615533228531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>No matter how you slice it, Mega Feraligatr’s design looks pretty silly, but it’s much easier to buy when it looks like the alligator is using the fake head as a type of camouflage rather than as if it’s&nbsp; sporting an unclosed toilet.

    <div>
        
<p>Twitch, on Wednesday, announced changes to how the company will tracking views for clips in order to “better reflect genuine viewer engagement”.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1991208256614854719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the company is making five specific changes that will track more views more accurately. It also continues the company’s recent efforts to combat view botting that has plagued the site for a while. </p>







<p><strong>“While clip views may initially appear lower, you’ll now have cleaner and more consistent cross-platform clips data that will ultimately help provide you with better insights into clip performance,” </strong>Twitch said. </p>



<p>As far as the specific changes go, those include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixing a technical issue that was inadvertently inflating clip view counts</li>



<li>Including clip views from Stories in clip view totals</li>



<li>Making view counting more consistent across all platforms (web, iOS, Android)</li>



<li>Better filtering out of bot traffic</li>



<li>Enabling improved clip analytics and laying the groundwork for us to explore new analytics features</li>
</ul>



<p><strong> “Going forward, we’ll continue to fine-tune our clip view counting system on an ongoing basis,”</strong> they added. </p>







<p>What do you think of the changes being implemented by Twitch for views tracking on clips?

Well multiple retailers will be selling the Prismatic Evolution Figurine Collection out of the gate.

Ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aliexpress-early-black-friday-sale-2025-starts-now">Black Friday</a>, Arzopa is hosting some big markdowns on its popular lineup of portable USB monitors via its official AliExpress storefront.

Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best things Nickelodeon put out when I was a kid, and its fandom still beats strong. This Universes Beyond MTG set hasn't only got me back into Avatar, but it's got me on MTG Arena to learn the game, not just collect it when I can. Collector Boosters aren't for playing, it's for those who want some solid binder material with far better pull rates than standard play boosters. There's a premium for that of course, but Amazon won't charge until it ships, which means you'll probably have a day or two to get the money you need together.</p></div><p id="final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-annive"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Annive">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230603"><div id="230603" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (Nintendo Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For Final Fantasy fans who haven't played the 2D old school games, or for those who are fans of the sprite-based RPG vibe, this is the deal for you.

Details about the hot fix, which were published in <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991168660103180339?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X/Twitter</a>, highlight a fix for those pesky defibrillators, as well as tweaks to the new limited-time Sabotage game mode and additional challenges changes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Players took to social media to complain of inconsistent defibrillators following the launch of the Battlefield 6 California Resistance update yesterday. Where previous versions of the game had players using the Support gadget to slide and dive in for last-second saves, changes brought about by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1120-patch-notes-include-aim-assist-tweaks-and-bloom-adjustments-as-season-1-continues"><u>update 1.1.2.0</u></a> instead asked players to slowly and precisely use the tool if they wanted to revive their friends. It’s resulted only in confusion, as the demanding requirements left teammates with what has been perceived as either a new bug or a bizarre nerf without any explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At first I thought it was just a pointless range nerf,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1p0yjlv/comment/npn1bdq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a> says, “but it's also <em>much</em> more inconsistent and easy to get bodies bugged into a state where the defib doesn't work at all, and you have to grab / drag them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Overall, I hate it, but that second part of it makes me think it wasn't really intentional.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 team didn’t clarify what caused faulty defibrillators to pollute matches, but it sounds like they didn’t like the change either. Today’s hotfix reverts the gadget back to how it was before yesterday’s update by increasing hit-boxes and range.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Sabotage game mode has had its AFK kick timer increased from 60 seconds to 180 seconds.

                <p>Fortnite's Simpsons season is apparently about to become a landmark for Epic Games' metaverse for reasons nobody could have expected--by reportedly offering the first shirtless character sporting visible nipples. The skin in question is <a href="https://x.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991097774012797411" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an additional version of Homer Simpson</a>, separate from the one in the battle pass, who's wearing nothing but his tighty whities.</p><p>The discussion about Fortnite skins lacking nipples goes back to 2019, when a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/terrycarter/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-nipples" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">gigantic, shirtless and nipple-less digital version of Travis Scott</a> performed a concert in Battle Royale. Since then we've gotten plenty of other shirtless guys as skins--but none have had nipples. It's not really that hard to figure out why that's been the norm, though, since Fortnite's art style is not realistic or detailed enough for nipples to be anything other than weird. But with Homer, who's cel-shaded and not very detailed, they can draw a couple circles on his chest that don't look upsetting the way that more detailed nipples on, say, the Mr. Savage skin probably would.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4607240-underwearhomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607240" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4607240-underwearhomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607240"></a><figcaption>This mostly-naked version of Homer Simpsons is reportedly going to be an item shop skin.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4607240-underwearhomer.jpg"></figure><p>Meanwhile, Homer in his underwear is a topic because this week's update added some loading screens, like the one above, that indicate pretty clearly we'll be facing off against a Giant Homer before the season ends--likely controlled by a player, similar to the Megazord and Godzilla events earlier this year. That this Giant Homer will also be a skin sold in the item shop is just a rumor for the moment, and it's possible that the model that has been datamined is merely the giant one that will roam the Battle Royale island.</p><p>But the leaker who broke this one, Dr Cacahuette, <a href="https://x.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991079736726970702" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claims</a> it has associated accessories, a Lego style, and support for kicks, all of which point to it being a player skin. It's possible it will be free, like the cel-shaded Juice WRLD skin was before the end of Remix season a year ago, but since Epic is already giving away the Cuddle Team Rider skin in a separate event, Underwear Homer is likely to be in the item shop.</p>
