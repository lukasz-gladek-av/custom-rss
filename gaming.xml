          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-the-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-640462">Dying Light: The Beast</a> was once going to be an expansion to the main game, but it grew to be so big that developer Techland eventually spun it off into a standalone experience. It's not Dying Light 3, but the team told me it feels The Beast is the best version of what the Dying Light series has been since it debuted a decade ago. I played 30 minutes of The Beast during Summer Game Fest Play Days 2025, and though its story still seems to be a comic-booky saga I struggle to get invested in, I'm definitely on board for some of what's it's bringing--and bringing back--to the series.</p><p dir="ltr">My demo started just before nightfall, and if you know Dying Light, you know it's not so easy to survive when the sun goes down. The new map in The Beast features a lot of forest area, which I really liked playing in. A developer told me the game is meant to be scarier than before, and the signature parkour gameplay has actually been dialed back a little bit to match The Beast protagonist Kyle Crane's canon abilities. He can't jump quite as far as Dying Light 2: Stay Human's Aiden Caldwell, which grounds the game a bit, even as so much of it remains over-the-top.</p><p dir="ltr">Crane is a fan-favorite protagonist from the first game and returns to this one on a revenge mission, chasing down the man who ruined his life. The story in these games resonates with a great number of its fans, but I've not counted myself among them. I don't expect The Beast to change that, but the series has always achieved its core gameplay goals, and that aspect seems well in place once more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509291-dyinglight1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4509291" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509291-dyinglight1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4509291"></a><figcaption>The Beast is set many years after the events of the first Dying Light, and Crane still has a bone to pick.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509291-dyinglight1.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One change is the return of guns, which have never been (and still won't be) in abundant supply. But because Crane will encounter some heavily armed soldiers at times, players will be able to take their weapons, like an assault rifle, shotgun, and--totally new to the series--a flamethrower that worked well as a room-clearing tool.</p><p dir="ltr">Driving is back, too, which Techland previously introduced in Dying Light: The Following, an expansion for the original Dying Light. Instead of the buggy featured in the expansion, I drove a hefty pick-up truck, which helped me quickly transport some materials I needed for a mission. This was much better than lugging them by hand, and the driving mechanics felt great. I learned Techland used to make rally racing games before Dying Light, and the same designer in charge of those mechanics is still at Techland today and helped bring the driving gameplay to life in Dying Light: The Beast. Driving was a lot of fun, and though the map will sometimes naturally restrict where players can drive, the opportunities to do so don't feel like missing the point despite the series' emphasis on running and parkour moves.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the Dying Light's great strengths has always been the open-endedness of navigating its world. The parkour makes the landscape your playground, and I got to mess with multiple strategies for problem-solving in one encounter. Spotting some armed guards up ahead, I sneakily dashed away to scale a nearby building, dodging zombies at the ground level. When I reached the top, I pulled out a decoy grenade and sent the undead horde toward the guards. As they cut into each other's numbers, I crept onward toward my objective. Up ahead, more guards rested atop the building, and it was here I leaned into the game's best combat maneuver: the dropkick.</p><p dir="ltr">I said I haven't always enjoyed the series' comic-booky side, but here, I was all too pleased to missile-dropkick anyone and everyone who stood in my way. Like the I Think You Should Leave sketch in which Tim Robinson's character refuses to stop fake-pouring water on his colleague during a work seminar, I sensed the dev accompanying me on my demo was astounded at how committed to the move I was. My melee weapons didn't degrade, my ammo was plentiful, all because I just couldn't stop dropkicking every face I saw, be it grossly mushy or tactically masked.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509305-tp34zuby.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4509305" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509305-tp34zuby.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4509305"></a><figcaption>The game's visuals still depict dueling aesthetics of grime and shine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509305-tp34zuby.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I played the second game like this at times, too. The physics of the move is too satisfying to ignore. It's just too much fun. I know I was sort of defying how the demo was expected to go, but I've played a lot of Dying Light over the years, so I felt like I could take this moment and really indulge my base desires: dropkicking every ambulating humanoid I encountered like prime Dolph Ziggler.</p><p dir="ltr">"If you kill that guy, you'll get his gun," the dev told me before I dropkicked the armed soldier off of a roof.</p><p dir="ltr">"The bow and arrow is a one-shot if you hit them in the head," he later said, hinting I should give it a whirl, before I unequipped it and launched several guys into a vent with my feet.</p><p dir="ltr">"Now that you've enhanced the axe, it'll immediately jump to your level. It was a Level 6 weapon, but you're Level 9, so enhancing it has made it a Level 9. We wanted players to be able to take their favorite weapons with them throughout the game if they really find one they love," he explained. "I see," I replied, before I pocketed it and dropkicked several more zombies into a wall.</p><p dir="ltr">I apologized, but the move is simply too good, I said. He seemed to get it.</p><p dir="ltr">Dying Light: The Beast benefits from years of updates to Dying Light 2, while also pulling in elements from the first that Techland wanted to revisit. This mix of old and new feels like it's going to make the 20-hour game (40 to 60 for completionists) well worth it if you're already invested in the series. I'm looking forward to driving more, exploring a new, scarier environment, and testing the weapon enhancement system in those rare moments when I elect to do anything other than Roddy Piper the undead in every street, rooftop, and forest I run through.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef69b31de3c5d/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite some gripes with the D-pad, it was tough to imagine how Nintendo might improve on the Switch Pro Controller until we finally got our hands on the new one. And while it's a pricey upgrade and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-do-you-even-need-a-pro-controller-for-the-switch-2">one that you might want to put off</a> if you've got a perfectly functioning Switch 1 version, the Pro Controller 2 is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">a very nice bit of kit</a>.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, industrious gamers have been dismantling the console and its accessories since launch, and <a href="https://gametraderzero.com/blogs/news/switch-2-pro-controller-tear-down-what-s-new-inside-nintendo-s-new-controller">GameTraderZero</a> has taken the new pad apart to see what makes it tick and how easy it will be to repair should something go wrong.</p>
<p>Giving us a good look at the innards, it appears that Nintendo turned to <a href="https://tech.alpsalpine.com/e/products-info/components/">Alps Alpine</a> (a Japanese company that specialises in automotive and consumer electronic components such as switches) to supply the sticks for this pad - or at least some of them.</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lr5z4ewo622v">Nintendo Patents Watch</a>, you can see the back of the stick module bearing the manufacturer's name and what appears to be a custom stick design for the Switch 2 controller.</p>

<p>Perhaps most excitingly for people who like to repair, mod, or just fiddle with their gear, GameTraderZero points out that the design used means replacement is possible without the need to fetch the soldering iron. Hurrah!</p>
<p>However, they also point out that "more intricate internal design" of the pad and other factors make it more complicated to disassemble compared to the old version. If you've played Welcome Tour, Nintendo details the challenges of moulding the new pad in such a way that your hand wouldn't rest on grooves which would collect everyday grime and dust.</p>
<p>The intense interest in the Switch 2's analog(ue) sticks stems from the infamous '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/joy--con-drift">Joy-Con drift</a>' issues that plagued the Switch 1's controllers. Teardowns of the new Joy-Con reveal <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-switch-2-owners-are-already-stripping-down-joy-con-to-check-the-stick-tech">sticks that look quite similar to the last-gen version</a>, too, although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/the-end-of-joy-con-stick-drift-the-switch-2s-controllers-have-been-redesigned-from-the-ground-up">Nintendo says</a> they've been totally redesigned.</p>
<p>While the Pro Controller didn't suffer in the same way, it's nice to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-switch-2-sticks-might-not-be-hall-effect-but-they-feel-fantastic">these smooth-feeling upgrades</a> in the latest 'Pro' pad. Hopefully, they'll stand the test of time.</p>

			<p>One of the final events for Summer Game Fest 2025 was solely focused on Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-will-join-geoff-keighley-to-host-a-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-game-premiere-during-summer-game-fest/">'game premiere</a>' that featured a panel hosted by Geoff Keighley, with the panel featuring Hideo Kojima, Shioli Kutsuna, Troy Baker, and Woodkid.</p>
<p>The panel discussed multiple aspects of the coming game, with Woodkid digging into aspects of writing music for the game, while Baker and Kutsuna spoke about the characters they play in the game and working with Kojima as actors, in between short clips of cutscenes from the game being debuted.</p>
<p>But the highlight of the show was the live demo, during which a member of the Kojima Productions development team played bits of the game's early hours on a PlayStation 5 Pro while Kojima narrated what was going on.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH - Game Premiere - Orpheum Theatre - June 8, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZpqSt2sirRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is almost here, with the game set to release on June 26, 2025, so the panel was consistently cautious about not revealing too much. That said, a live gameplay demo is something that we rarely see in today's era of digital presentations, compared to when E3 was in full swing. Even though we've already seen a lot of Kojima Productions' next game, the live demo was a welcome showcase of what's to come later this month when it launches on PS5.</p>
<p>This game premiere was also the kick-off event for what will be a worldwide touring show, which will head to Australia, Japan, France, England, Korea, Taiwan, China, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Italy, between now and November 2025.</p>
<p>Full details and dates on the tour <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/death-stranding-world-strand-tour-2?dm_i=74N0,2ARDF,2EYVRT,6HFOC,1#m-scroll-target">are still to come,</a> and it'll be interesting to see if this panel is any indication as to what those attending the show in a few months can expect.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Thick as Thieves Preview - A Spiritual Successor to a Classic?]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/thick-as-thieves-preview-spiritual-successor-to-classic</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/thick-as-thieves-preview-a-spiritual-successor-to-a-classic.1213473/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/thick-as-thieves-preview-spiritual-successor-to-classic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What’s a good heist without high stakes? <em>Thick as Thieves</em> aims to up the ante with its PVPVE, competitive thievery. From Warren Specter’s studio, OtherSide Entertainment, this game has much potential.</p>

<p>We got a chance to see <em>Thick as Thieves</em> in action during a hands-off demonstration at Summer Game Fest 2025. Unfortunately, we were only able to see the single-player aspect of Thick as Thieves, since the venue’s internet decided to stop working.</p>

<p>Despite this, Director of Product Michael Fitch says that despite very much being a multiplayer game, the PVE aspect much also be important. So yes, you can play <em>Thick as Thieves</em> by yourself if you so choose.</p>



<h2>Pick Your Poison</h2>

<p>First things first: pick your character. Each character in <em>Thick as Thieves</em> has their own abilities; essentially, they each have one killer advantage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Spider, for instance, is quite mobile and is equipped with tools like a grappling hook to get on top of roofs and other obstacles. The Chameleon, on the other hand, can take the form of an NPC.</p>



<p>The Chameleon, in particular, sounds quite intriguing, as his playstyle revolves around subterfuge and trickery by trying to mimic the habits of an NPC.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, at the start of every match, each thief is assigned the same job by the Thieves Guild. The objective is to obtain a special book, which is purportedly hidden in a manor. We don’t know much beyond that, which is why collecting clues is crucial.</p>



<h2>Making Garrett Proud</h2>

<p>This does hearken back to games like <em>Thief</em> where you’d have to collect clues scattered around the environment to eventually find your way to the target. Indeed, <em>Thick as Thieves </em>is described as a spiritual successor to <em>Thief</em>, so you can expect it to share similar gameplay elements like reading those notes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, we find out how to obtain the book. The way in which you find your target piece of loot will change from game to game, so there is a degree of unpredictability here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grabbing the target will start a timer that alerts other thieves that someone has the item and are working their way to the exit. This is where, presumably, most players will come out of the woodwork and try to fight you.</p>



<h2><em>Thick as Thieves&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I wish I could have seen more of the multiplayer aspect, because that’s really at the heart of <em>Thick as Thieves’</em> gameplay. It simply doesn’t seem quite as exciting with one player.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And that’s related to another concern of mine: the game’s longevity. Immersive sims are already a niche genre, and <em>Thick as Thieves </em>will depend on a healthy audience. I just don’t know if that audience is there, but I really hope it is.</p>

<p>But, with minds like Warren Specter behind <em>Thick as Thieves</em>, I have faith in the project. Should it gather the numbers needed to thrive, this title has potential to create a lot of long-lasting memories.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>As soon as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman</a> devs IO Interactive were revealed to be making a Bond game, I was on board with it. Agent 47 and 007 have a bunch in common, at least in terms of the sneaky, shooty, or stabby stuff their jobs entail, so IO'd be putting a fresh twist on a kind of game it's already proven great at making. There is a difference though, and having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-soon-take-down-james-bonds-le-chiffre-in-hitman-world-of-assassinations-latest-elusive-target">killed Le Chiffre in Hitman</a> over the weekend, I feel like I understand it better than before.</p>
<p>IO exec Hakan Abrak has offered his view on how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>'s Bond will play differently to 47 in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-series-is-definitely-not-done-insists-io-interactive-ceo">IGN</a>, which I'm glad to see also saw him emphasise that the studio aren't done with the Hitman series.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In addition to Bond's humour being more British and involving less flamingo disguises than Hitman's, Abrak described the difference in how the two games feel to play like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>"You have definitely glimpses of IO Interactive, as you would know from Hitman games as well, but it's more front foot. It's less of an analytical mind, chess play, where you sit and meticulously plan. All the clockwork things in Hitman where if you do this or do this, where Bond is more impulsive, more reckless sometimes. It's more like he's just taking things and acting and handling it more as they arise."</p></blockquote>
<p>That's all well and good to say, but the experience I had half-heartedly roleplaying as Bond while taking on Hitman's Le Chiffre contract has helped convince me that this new 007 won't just feel like 47 in a nice wig. I walked into reskinned Paris as the usual bald barcode boy, dressed in a sharp tux for maximum Bond vibes. Rather than getting on with the job right away, as per usual, I decided to mess around in ways I thought befitted his Bondulence.</p>
<p>I slowly moseyed up the red carpet, pausing in order to pretend I was hobnobbing with various dignitaries, and stopping by every unattended wine glass in order to simulate taking advantage of the free drinks. Once I was inside, I had three potential opportunities to secure an invitation to a super secret Casino Royale-ish poker game. The first one I flubbed by losing ten million government-bankrolled chips in a roulette flutter-off against a billionaire.</p>
<p>Surprised a bit by that failure, I decided to take things a bit slower with the other two possible invite providers. One involved killing a guy for an American agent, which is pretty Bondy. The other hinged on serving a lady a shaken, not stirred, martini, which is even more Bondy. After spending some time chilling at the bar pretending to chat up a group of NPCs who weren't fussed in the slightest, I decided to go with the latter.</p>
<p>Then, a notification sprung up neatly informing me I'd missed the window for all three story opportunities to get into the poker game.</p>
<p>The contract didn't fail, but I still panicked a bit, wondering if I might miss Le Chiffre entirely if I didn't act fast. Cue a rush to the top floor by shimmying up the drain pipes, the hasty acquisition of a guard uniform, and the absent-minded pilfering of some random scissors. I watched Le Chiffre and his guests play for a bit, then the intrusive thoughts took over and I lobbed the scissors at his head, sending his body flying up into the air.</p>
<p>Cutting my losses rather than trying to go for the second target, I narrowly survived clambering over a balcony while surrounded by gunfire, then snuck into an evac chopper licking my wounds.</p>
<p>I got the kill, but under Hitman rules, being impulsive, reckless, and just making things up as I went along hadn't exactly rewarded me too handsomely. Sure, it was definitely because I was playing like a bumbling idiot, but had I been playing First Light, where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">the Bondiness will be not just accepted but embraced</a>, maybe things would have gone differently.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If a game is refused CERO classification, developers can either make suggested cuts and apply for re-rating from CERO, or they can try to obtain a classification from the <a href="https://www.globalratings.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IARC</u></a> (International Age Rating Coalition) instead. However, all games with 18+ content in Japan must pass CERO’s board in order to be sold on the PlayStation Store (source: <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/20220310-194938/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>) — this is likely the “platform policies” that the announcement refers to.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/full-screen-xbox-handheld-ui-is-coming-to-all-windows-pcs-starting-next-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>One weakness of Valve's Steam Deck gaming handheld and SteamOS is that, by default, they will only run Windows games from Steam that are supported by the platform's Proton compatibility layer (plus the subset of games that run natively on Linux). It's possible to install alternative game stores, and Proton's compatibility is generally impressive, but SteamOS still isn't a true drop-in replacement for Windows.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Asus' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">co-developed ROG Xbox Ally</a> is trying to offer PC gamers a more comprehensive compatibility solution that also preserves a SteamOS-like handheld UI by putting a new Xbox-branded user interface on top of traditional Windows. And while this interface will roll out to the ROG Xbox Ally first, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">told The Verge</a> that the interface would come to other Ally handhelds next and that something "similar" would be "rolling out to other Windows handhelds starting next year."</p>
<p>Bringing a Steam Deck-style handheld-optimized user interface to Windows is something Microsoft has been experimenting with internally since at least 2022, when employees at an internal hackathon identified most of Windows' handheld deficiencies in a slide deck about a proposed "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/handheld-mode-for-windows-could-make-it-work-better-on-steam-deck-style-pcs/">Windows Handheld Mode</a>."</p>

      The mock-up "gaming shell" that some Microsoft employees were experimenting with in 2022 shares some similarities with the Xbox-branded interface we saw on the ROG Xbox Ally yesterday.

              <span>

      </figure>

<p>It's not clear whether this new Xbox interface is a direct outgrowth of that slide presentation, but it pitches a tile-based Switch-style gamepad UI with some superficial similarities to what Microsoft revealed yesterday. This theoretical Handheld Mode would also have come with "optimizations for your handheld's touch screen to improve touch points and visibility" and Windows' "lack of controller support" outside of the Steam app and actual games.</p>
<p>On the ROG Xbox Ally, the new full-screen interface completely replaces the traditional desktop-and-taskbar interface of Windows, saving what Microsoft says is a couple of gigabytes' worth of RAM while also using less energy and other system resources. On a handheld running the normal version of Windows, like the regular ROG Ally, that Windows overhead is joined by additional overhead <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/asus-rog-ally-x-review-better-performance-and-feel-in-a-pricey-package/">from things like Asus' Armoury Crate software</a>, which these handhelds currently need to bridge the functionality gap between SteamOS and Windows.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Hitman developer IO Interactive officially unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007 First Light</a>, the first James Bond game for consoles since 007 Legends in 2012.

However, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak recently stressed that 007 First Light is going to be about more than just James Bond shooting his way out of trouble.</p><p>"We don't want to make a game where it's only about shooting and running," Abrak told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtd9cxV8Yvw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>. "It's also about delivering that fantasy for a Bond where he can traverse in social spaces and speak to people and figure out in creative ways how to solve the obstacles in front of him.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How IO Interactive Is Making James Bond Different From Hitman</p>
      </div>
<p>Abrak went on to explain that IO's game engine was modified to allow the team to create the "spectacular action set pieces" that James Bond is known for. That includes hand-to-hand combat as well as driving sequences, which are a staple of almost of every Bond film and video game.</p><p>While this version of Bond isn't based on any of the actors from the movies, Abrak suggested that the character still has his roots in Ian Fleming's original character, including the scar on his face. The game will chronicle Bond's road to becoming a double-0 agent, which was only briefly touched upon in the 2006 adaptation of Casino Royale.</p><p>Astute fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/who-plays-james-bond-in-007-first-light-fans-believe-theyve-worked-it-out/1100-6532125/" data-ref-id="1100-6532125">successfully identified Dexter: Original Sin star Patrick Gibson</a> as IO's James Bond even before the company confirmed his casting. 007 First Light won't arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC until 2026. In the meantime, IO is bringing in Casino Royale's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">Mads Mikkelsen to reprise his role as Le Chiffre</a> for an Elusive Target mission in Hitman: World of Assassination. That mission is available now.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-sonic-x-shadow-generations-switch-2-definitely-improved-but-segas-shafting-early-adopters.1213443/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When I originally reviewed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_x_shadow_generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> on the Switch, I went bold and called it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/sonic-x-shadow-generations">“the very best 3D Sonic game so far”</a> – a statement I very much stand by. The combination of the nostalgia-fueled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/sonic_generations">Sonic Generations</a> and the thrillingly dark, Shadow-focused expansion made it an experience that comfortably outranks even my beloved <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</a>. This remains the case on Switch 2.</p>
<p>So what’s changed with the new release? Well, hardly anything, to be honest. In terms of content, this is the exact same game you might have played back in 2024. That’s still quite a bit, mind you, with both Sonic and Shadow campaigns taking around five or six hours or so to reach the credits; more if you go for full completion. But still, if you’re hoping for a sprinkling of bonus content to justify the move to Nintendo’s new console, you won’t find it here.</p>
<p>What <em>has</em> changed is the performance and resolution. On the Switch 1, Sonic Generations managed to reach 1080p when docked, while Shadow Generations capped out at 720p. Both, however, are locked at 30fps. On the Switch 2, Sonic Generations defaults to 60fps while boasting much crisper visuals, bringing it more in line with the release on PS5 and Xbox.</p>
<p>Shadow Generations, on the other hand, offers up two choices. Quality mode keeps the 30fps gameplay from Switch 1 and bumps up resolution, while performance mode doubles the frame rate. When docked, the visuals in performance mode still look pretty nice, resulting in a good balance between attractive graphics and smooth gameplay. In handheld mode, however, the characters and world definitely look a little muddy.</p>
<p>I’m not usually one to opt for prettier visuals over higher frame rates, but coming from the Switch 1 version took the sting out of the 30fps performance somewhat, and the bump in visuals felt like a nice upgrade in comparison. Performance mode feels perfectly fine for docked play, but I’ve no qualms switching over to quality mode for when I’m out and about.</p>
<p>The biggest issue with all of this is that Sega has opted to completely shaft those who bought the game on Switch 1, with no upgrade path to the Switch 2 version at all. Given the minimal enhancements, it feels like a proper kick in the teeth for fans - I can’t imagine many current owners are keen on parting with £45 / $50 for performance enhancements. Look to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> for an idea of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/fantasy-life-i-gets-switch-2-release-date-with-paid-upgrade-path-for-switch-1-players">how this should be done</a>.</p>
<p>So, whether you take a punt on Sonic X Shadow Generations for the Switch 2 will very much depend on whether you already own it or not. If you don’t, add two points to the score below and jump in: it’s a great game and this is undoubtedly the best way to play it on Nintendo systems. If you do, however, you should think twice about double-dipping. It’s already a splendid game on Switch 1, and with no upgrade path or new content, you're missing out on very little if you skip it.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy XVI</a> took almost two years to launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but it seems like the long wait was well worth it, judging by the quality of the port.</p>
<p>New videos shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheXboxTester" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Xbox Tester</a> and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FuzionXboxTesting"> Fuzion Xbox Testing</a> provide a quick look at the Xbox Series X|S ports of the latest main entry in the long-running JRPG series by Square Enix, highlighting how the Xbox Series X version of the game is comparable to the PlayStation 5 version in pretty much every way, delivering the same image quality and performance in the two available display modes. Sadly, Square Enix did not take advantage of the late port to update AMD FSR from the old version used in the PlayStation 5 release, but that was expected.</p>

<p>While Final Fantasy XVI running on Xbox Series X as it does on PlayStation 5 is not really surprising, considering how similar the two systems are, seeing the game run on Xbox Series S is way more interesting. Despite some predictable limitations, such as lower resolution output and 30 FPS lock for its single display mode, the game seems to run rather well, keeping the framerate locked to 30 FPS consistently. Seeing how even on PlayStation 5 the game often drops way below 60 FPS in many scenarios in Performance Mode, it's undeniable that seeing Final Fantasy XVI run well on Xbox Series S, everything considered.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game's launch on Xbox consoles will be followed soon by the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Zelda Movie Delayed to May 2027, Shigeru Miyamoto Announces]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-movie-delayed-may-2027</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zelda-movie-delayed-to-may-2027-shigeru-miyamoto-announces.1213431/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-movie-delayed-may-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie will be releasing later than initially anticipated, although since the movie is such a long way off anyway, the delay likely won't mean much.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1932075231885382103" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto revealed earlier today that the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie, which was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">due to come out in March 2027</a>, will instead be releasing in theaters on May 7th. Like I said, both of these dates are pretty much too far off for the delay to be too meaningful.</p>

<p>According to Miyamoto, the movie was delayed in order to give the filmmakers and producers "extra time to make the film as good as it can be", which is a pretty standard reason for delaying a project. That famous quote about delaying and rushing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/did-miyamoto-really-say-a-delayed-game-is-eventually-good-but-a-rushed-game-is-forever-bad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wasn't actually said by Miyamoto</a>, but it feels apropos here anyway.</p>

<p>We do, however, know that the movie will definitely be live-action as opposed to an animation, and it'll be helmed by&nbsp;<em>The Maze Runner&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes&nbsp;</em>director Wes Ball, with production being handled by Miyamoto, Ball, and Avi Arad.</p>

<p>It's likely we're going to have to wait quite some time before we get more information about the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie, especially given this delay, but it's not all bad news; while you're waiting, the Switch 2 just made its predecessor's&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>library a much smoother experience.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 Edition upgrades for&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>&nbsp;bring smoother frame rates and better visuals, of course, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">free updates</a> for&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Link's Awakening&nbsp;</em>are also available, smoothing out their choppy frame rates and performance issues on the Switch 2.</p>




<p>The live-action&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie is now set to launch on May 7th, 2027. We'll bring you more on this one as soon as we get it.</p>

It’s not easy to find a monitor that balances all those factors, but a big discount can shoot one toward the top of the list. <strong>Sony’s InZone M10S</strong> is a 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED with a whopping 480Hz refresh rate, and it’s 35 percent off right now at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9R7HCVG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, selling for $714.99 (originally $1,099.99). For those who are pursuing a minimalist setup, there might not be a better choice.</p><p>The M10S features a super-thin design and a versatile stand that takes up very little desk space. The circular stand is only about the size of a CD, on which the monitor can swivel. It looks <em>really </em>nice. When I <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/469727/sony-inzone-m10s-oled-pc-ps5-gaming-monitor">reviewed this monitor</a> during my days at <em>Polygon</em>, I didn’t think its performance justified its original price, as Asus had a similarly speedy 480Hz model that sold for $999.99 (and still costs that much).

So I’ll start by saying no excuse of course like I should have been on this, we should have been on top of this.</p><p>He contionued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The second I got off that stage I called Derek our lead game designer and I said ‘Derek did you know we had an $80 bundle, this is news to me, like what the heck, that makes no sense,’ and he didn’t. Essentially what happened out former head of monetization who happened to come from call of duty was with us for less than a year and was very aggressive on price.</p><p> Actually prior to his departure we actually originally had founders packs for $100 and battle passes for $10 and the first thing Derek and I did when we revaluated everything a month ago was slash those things so founders went from $100 to $60 and we actually added in game currently that the game originally wasn’t going to have we decreased the battle pass from $10 to $5 but unfortunately things slipped through the cracks.</p></blockquote><p>In addition to shifting the blame to a past employee and once again trying to beef with <em>Call of Duty</em>, Proulx’s explanation doesn’t entirely square with the studio’s defending of the pricey cosmetics just days prior. “This pack features our most unique skins with complex animations &amp; artwork,” the official <em>Splitgate 2</em> account posted back on Friday. “We have a variety of cheaper options.  The game is free to play, &amp; you don’t need to buy anything to enjoy it to its fullest. Nothing is pay to win &amp; never will be.”<br></p><p>So did the bundle “slip through the cracks,” or is 1047 just backtracking now in the face of players revolting against a hostile monetization strategy that violates the “old school” ethos <em>Splitgate 2 </em>wants to cultivate? People have pointed out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1l576z1/splitgate_2s_ingame_store_is_a_masterclass_in/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1l576z1/splitgate_2s_ingame_store_is_a_masterclass_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the subreddit</a></span> that the problem isn’t just that the prices started out to high. The shooter’s in-game shop is also full of slimy practices like fake inflated discounts and currency mismatches so players always have to overspend to get what they want.</p><p>“Honestly, the store and its prices really feel like something out of a gacha game, except for the fact I don’t think I know of any gachas that have you <em>preorder</em> [battle] passes,” wrote one player. “Great gameplay, terrible business model,” wrote another.</p><p><em>Splitgate 2</em> is currently sitting at mixed reviews on Steam, though Proulx said the free-to-play shooter reached over 2 million players over the weekend.

            <p>Here's a new date for your bumper summer line up of video game showcases: Konami has today announced its own livestream, which will give us all a fresh look at both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>.</p>
<p>The showcase - known as Konami Press Start - is scheduled for this coming Thursday, 12th June. It will air at 2pm here in the UK, so that's 6:00am PT / 9:00am ET / 3:00pm CEST.</p>
<p>The whole thing is expected to last for around 37 minutes, Konami has said. While the studio namechecked both Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill f, it also promised "and more" during that time. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682661/nintendo-switch-2-early-hands-on-mario-kart-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Now that I’ve had a Nintendo Switch 2 in my hands for a few days, I can say pretty confidently that this feels a lot like a Switch. You know, only more. The differences between console generations have become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review">increasingly blurry</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">over the</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review">last few years</a>, and Nintendo’s latest device is the blurriest yet. It really is just a bigger, more powerful Switch. It’s not a radical update to Nintendo’s portable console — but it is a pleasant one.</p><p>There are some elements I still need to test properly for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679346/nintendo-switch-2-review-guidelines-plan-launch">our full review</a> — like the mouse controls and GameChat social features — but after an entire weekend spent playing a lot of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, and a bunch of other games, I can also tell that it’ll be pretty hard going back to the original Switch.</p><p>Here are some of my initial thoughts.</p><div><p id="a-seamless-transition"><h2>A seamless transition</h2></p></div><p>One of the best trends in modern gaming is how your library is able to move along with you when you upgrade your hardware. This has never been a strong suit for Nintendo, which historically has forced users to start over from scratch with a new device. But the company seems to have gotten it right with the Switch 2. After logging into my Nintendo account and spending 15 minutes transferring the contents of my OLED Switch over to the Switch 2, everything was there. Even my online accounts, like with <em>Fortnite</em>, were already logged in, and the old games worked just as they did before.</p><p>It may seem like a basic thing — and it is — but it’s nice that Nintendo made this part of the process much more seamless this time around.</p><div><p id="big-games-are-big-in-more-ways-than-one"><h2>Big games are big in more ways than one</h2></p></div><p>One of the promises of the Switch 2 is that larger games, particularly big open-world titles, can now run much better on the beefed up hardware. I’ve been testing this so far by putting a few hours into <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. And while it obviously doesn’t look as good as it does on a high-end PC, PlayStation, or Xbox, it still looks and runs pretty great. I haven’t noticed any major issues with the game either in docked or handheld mode. The game doesn’t look as sharp when playing on a portable, and I spotted the odd blurry texture on in-game billboards, but it ran nice and smooth otherwise.</p><p>The flipside is that the Switch 2 now has some pretty hefty file sizes to deal with. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is nearly 60GB, while <em>Street Fighter 6</em> is 49.2GB, and <em>Fortnite</em> is 37.8GB. That’s smaller than on a PS5, for example, where blockbuster games are often pushing 100GB, but it does mean I’ve already had to manage my software to make things fit.</p><div><p id="hardware-size-hasnt-been-an-issue"><h2>Hardware size hasn’t been an issue</h2></p></div><p>The other size differences — the bigger screen and heavier hardware — haven’t been an issue for me so far. I sat out in the sun playing <em>Mario Kart World</em> until the battery was nearly dead, and I didn’t really notice any discomfort, aside from the sore right thumb that is the price of playing <em>Mario Kart</em> with any degree of intensity. My 12-year-old also spent two hours playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on">the upgraded <em>Pokémon Violet</em></a> and claimed it was a comfortable experience, but that might’ve just been a ploy for more screentime.</p><div><p><cite>Photo: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="the-joy-cons-are-very-satisfying"><h2>The Joy-Cons are very satisfying</h2></p></div><p>Functionally, the new controllers are almost identical. Although I have to admit, I keep hitting the GameChat button when I mean to press Home. So there’s been a little bit of relearning muscle memory there. But the best part is the new magnetic connectors, which are extremely satisfying to snap into the Switch 2 and its controller grip. The big, chunky button on the back feels very good to press, to the point that I’ve found myself fiddling with it while waiting for things to load.</p><div><p id="shareable-screenshots-finally"><h2>Shareable screenshots, finally</h2></p></div><p>This may be a niche concern, but as someone who takes a lot of screenshots while I play games — so I can share important details about <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andrewrweb.bsky.social/post/3lr4s6qbskc2l">public transportation in the Mushroom Kingdom</a> — it’s great that they’re so much easier to share now. Before, I had to scan two different QR codes to get them on my phone. Now, I just click the upload button, and they appear in the Switch mobile app. It works essentially the same way as on the PS5, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andrewrweb.bsky.social/post/3lr2f3vmo322f">which is good news for posters like me</a>.</p><div><p id="updated-games-really-look-better"><h2>Updated games really look better</h2></p></div><p>There aren’t a lot of major Switch 2 exclusives at launch, but there are a lot of existing games that have been enhanced for the new hardware. My colleagues have already written about how much better <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/681222/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-hands-on"><em>Fortnite </em>play on the Switch 2</a>. I agree that both of those are solid upgrades, and I even played through <em>Fortnite</em>’s most recent live event on the Switch 2 without any issues.</p><p>But I’ve also been spending a whole lot of time in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678957/no-mans-sky-switch-2-launch-update"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/12/12454434/no-mans-sky-diaries">to nobody’s surprise</a>), and it really is a noticeable difference. While the game technically worked on the original hardware, it was also much slower and uglier than on any other platform. The Switch 2 version isn’t the best-looking, of course, but it still looks and runs great, even in portable mode.</p><p>I’ve found myself really getting lost in this virtual universe once again, which is much easier to do when you can just take it with you.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Obsidian RPG is one of my favorite games <em>ever</em>, and yet, I’ll still forget to bring it up when totting the best RPGs. It’s like it has a curse upon its name, fated to go unmentioned. But perhaps that’s finally to be lifted, with the fantastic news that it’s due to receive an Enhanced Edition from Aspyr.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195410" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="195410,196299,196903" data-current="195410"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20876.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> BioWare’s original <em>Neverwinter Nights </em>launched with its own solid 60-hour solo campaign, but the game was primarily about equipping players with the tools to create their own online D&amp;D campaigns. That’s where its legacy lies, certainly, and Aspyr subsidiary Beamdog gave that game the remastering treatment back in 2018. But Obsidian’s sequel, released four years later in 2006, flipped the script. Yes, this was also a game designed to make creating player campaigns as accessible as possible, but first and foremost, it was its single-player story, and <em>wow</em>. Featuring some of the best companion characters in any of the BioWare-likes that made up the glory years of the RPG genre, this was the tale of an orphan, raised by a master elven ranger, setting out to defeat the King of Shadows.</p><p>BioWare aided the development, much as it had for Obsidian’s other borrowed sequel, <em>Knights of the Old Republic II</em>, while the game had former Black Isle employees responsible for the extraordinary <em>Planescape: Torment</em> in prominent positions. It was a game created by a development supergroup, and it shone for it.</p><p>Of course, like so many 20-year-old games, it does feel awfully clunky now, so it’s excellent news to hear Aspyr is giving it a remaster. Here’s the trailer, but don’t get over-excited at the opening moments—that’s just a new rendered cutscene:</p><p>Rather crucially, this is going to ship with all the expansion packs, and given we’re talking about a game from 2006, that doesn’t mean a bunch of new outfits and a bonus gun skin—<em>Mask of the Betrayer</em>, a DLC expansion released in 2007, is a whole new three-act story featuring the same characters, but with new spells and abilities, and it was wonderful. Then, 2008 saw <em>Storm of Zehir</em>, which wasn’t quite as solid, but was a great last hurrah for D&amp;D’s 3.5 ruleset. Lastly, there was 2009's <em>Mysteries of Westgate</em>, which wasn’t created by Obsidian, isn’t connected to the previous stories, and didn’t really hit at all. But for the sake of preservation, it’s great that all three expansions are receiving the same overhaul.</p><p>There’s not long to wait—the game is out July 15 across Xbox, PS5 and PC, although no signs of a mobile edition just yet. I mention that simply because the Android version of <em>KotOR</em> from Aspyr is quite so good.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It will be some weeks later than the release timing we originally announced, and we will take the extra time to make the film as good as it can be. Thank you for your patience."</p> <div>

<p>Little else is known about the film at this point, whether it will be inspired by one game predominantly, or who has been cast as the iconic Link or titular princess.</p>
<p>Rumours have circled around Euphoria star Hunter Schafer for the role of Zelda, though reports have also emerged she is being eyed instead for a big Marvel role.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/09/abyssus-preview-shooting-stuff-underwater-together/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Abyssus is a first-person shooter roguelike that offers plenty of co-op pew-pewing, both with your friends and with randoms, but despite having some really interesting aspects to the game flow and weapon design, it might not be doing quite enough to stand out from the preposterously huge crowd that it’s a part of. To tell the truth, I don’t know how any incoming game can manage it though, so it might not be an issue.</p>
<p><iframe title="Abyssus | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vnAWfATPH3I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The standout feature of Abyssus is its setting. This is a “brinepunk” world, which basically means we’re dealing with underwater stuff and have some big old helmets protecting us. It’s a bit eldritch in its design, or at least will feel that way for anyone who’s played any of the Call of Cthulhu games. The enemies here aren’t unknowable horrors, though; they’re mostly just little golem guys.</p>


<p>While there is some enemy variety, the end result of nearly all of them doesn’t offer much actual change in how you approach them. You just have to shoot stuff, and while some will run after you and some will attack from range, it’s rare that an enemy outside of a boss encounter will actually challenge you to do anything more than start blasting.</p>


<p>Of course, a key part of any roguelike is build variety that changes how you play, and here that’s dictated by a couple of choices. The first of these is your loadout. You can choose from among a few different weapons and then augment those weapons to have different behaviours, secondary fire options, and abilities. Then, when you’re actually in a run, you find obelisks to get power from that are all elementally themed. You can diversify these for lots of different options, or if you’re lucky, you can commit to a single element and just get a huge boost in power.</p>
<p>I don’t think that these do enough to really feel diverse, though. Sure, a wind explosion looks different to a shadow explosion, but does it really matter? No, not especially. You’re not really changing the way that you play the game with any of these power-ups, that’s mostly done via your weapon selection. The result is that, as with the enemies, runs just feel kind of samey.</p>

<p>None of these feels bad, though. I realise it probably feels like I dislike this game because I’ve been complaining about it, but that’s not the case. Abyssus is a fine game with beautiful graphics and a really fun setting. Yet it doesn’t do enough to push beyond that into the realms of a truly great game. Of course, these are early days and there’s sure to be more beyond what’s on show in the Steam Next Fest demo.</p>
<p>There’s a chance that a lot of this gets mucked about with between now and the full release of the game in August, and I hope that it does, because I always want games to be good. As it stands though, Abyssus is a pretty standard FPS roguelike that’s got a lot of interesting concepts, but not enough clean execution and variety.</p>

<figure><a title="Review: Genki Sleeper Case 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/360ca88f5e6f7/review-genki-sleeper-case-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>When you've got a shiny new handheld like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a>, getting a good carry case is of the utmost importance. However, not all carry cases are created equal; some are fine when it comes to providing a modicum of protection on the move, while others are built with a little more robustness. I'm pleased to report that <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case">Genki's Sleeper Case</a> ($42.99 / £36) is definitely in the latter camp and perhaps represents one of the best Switch 2 cases on the market right now.</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me when I removed the Sleeper Case from its packaging was just how sturdy it felt. According to Genki, the case is constructed with "materials trusted in motorsport gear", and it certainly feels that way.</p>
<p>The case has surprisingly little flex when completely closed and is apparently "crush-proof", according to the manufacturer. Genki says it's "virtually indestructible" and that it has even taken hammers to the case to test its strength, although it advises against customers trying the same thing. I wasn't going to try, to be honest, but I can certainly believe the Sleeper Case is capable of withstanding some severe punishment.</p>

<p>What makes this case remarkable is that, despite its robust nature, the external wool coating feels pretty welcoming. This material is apparently specially treated to resist water, stains, and abrasions. It looks great, in my opinion, and certainly stands out from your typical Switch 2 case. On the back, there's an elasticated strip that you can fit your fingers through, giving you additional grip when you're carrying the case around.</p>
<p>The ability to resist water extends to the "incognito" zipper, which, when fully closed, is almost impossible to see. There's a tradeoff here, however; the zipper system is quite tight and often difficult to close. This way well ease up over time, but it takes a fair bit of effort to engage it fully.</p>
<p>Inside the case, your Switch 2 console is presented with a reasonably snug fit. It's not as tight as some other cases, and there's a little room for movement because the case is designed to accept your Switch 2 with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">Attack Vector modular case</a> installed (however, you can only use the smallest 'feather' grips with this case; the other two grips are too wide to fit).</p>

<p>The screen is protected by a flap which doubles as a holder for a whopping 18 Game Cards (Nintendo's official case can only hold six). It's brilliant to have that amount of game storage built into the case as it means I don't have to take additional Game Card holders on the road with me. But it also makes me somewhat worried about misplacing or losing the Sleeper Case when I'm out and about, as that's a <em>lot</em> of monetary value at risk.</p>
<p>All things considered, though, the Genki Sleeper Case is one of the best options on the market when it comes to Switch 2 storage and transport. It's smart, rugged and has plenty of space for games inside, making it a fantastic alternative to Nintendo's official offering.</p>
