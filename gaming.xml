		<p>Assetto Corsa EVO is going to get an early access release KUNOS Simulazioni and 505 Games has announced, but it will just be missing out a 2024 release window. Instead, Assetto Corsa EVO will be available on Steam Early Access from January 16th, 2025, and you can wishlist it right now by going clicking on the link, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3058630/Assetto_Corsa_EVO/">Assetto Corsa EVO on Steam</a>.

<p>In our Assetto Corsa Competizione review, Stefan said, “Where the original console release of Assetto Corsa Competizione had some huge caveats hanging over it, the game’s release on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S brings it up to spec, effectively matching the PC version. It still has some weaknesses in presentation and structure for new players in particular, but once you get into the groove, it’s one of the best sim racers you can buy right now.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-25-release-date-revealed-for-november.996363/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sega and developer Sports Interactive have announced&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>release date, and the latest installment of the management sim series is hitting PC and consoles in November.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-launching-november-26" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, the two studios say that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will arrive first on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5 on November 26th, and that a mobile version of the game, namely&nbsp;<em>FM25 Mobile</em>, will arrive via Netflix Games on the same day.</p>
<p><em>FM25 Touch</em>, a version of the game for the Nintendo Switch, will then follow on December 3rd, and Sports Interactive and Sega say they'll reveal more information about&nbsp;<em>FM25&nbsp;</em>Touch "in the coming weeks".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-25-release-date-players.jpg?itok=0Tq6ZarL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-25-release-date-players.jpg?itok=qsG-RgfK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will feature a fully-licensed Premier League for the first time.</figcaption></figure><p>As has been previously revealed,&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will be the first game in the series to feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-premier-league-licensing">full licensing for the Premier League</a>, so you won't need to spend hours editing your favorite teams anymore.</p>
<p>It's also making a switch to the Unity engine, which Sports Interactive says will power "the new era for football management", creating "a deeper, more authentic football universe". I'll be using "football" rather than "soccer" here, by the way. Blame my Britishness.</p>
<p>However, this newest installment will also lack the Create-a-Club feature, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update">several other core franchise features</a>, including Touchline Shouts and the Data Chalkboard.</p>
<p>A number of new features will be introduced in&nbsp;<em>FM25</em>, however, including the debut of women's football, overhauled tactics, and "a complete revamp of the way to set up your manager", which Sports Interactive says will lead to "more customized, unique stories".</p>

<p>In the weeks between now and&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>'s release, Sega and Sports Interactive will be <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/roadmap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">drip-feeding new information</a> about the game, including info about key features, new additions, and more.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will appear seem a little confusing. On its <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/buy-fm25?game=fm25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-order page</a>, the game appears to be available for "Xbox", which seemingly includes Xbox One.</p>
<p>However, its <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/games/football-manager-25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> simply shows images of the Xbox Series X and the PS5 under the console heading, so if you're looking to play the game on Xbox One, you may want to hold off pre-ordering. It's definitely not coming to PS4, though. Sorry, PS4 players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> is returning for its third season on Amazon Prime. Ahead of its release TechRaptor, along with a number of other outlets, had a chance to sit down and ask the core cast of Critical Role about the experience of revisiting Vox Machina once more and the task of adapting the campaign further into the TV show.</p>
<p><strong>While there are no direct spoilers a number of features about Season 3 are teased related to locations and plot, if you want to go into this season completely blind then be sure to bookmark this article and return once <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> S3 has completely released by October 24th.</strong></p>
<h2>What Fans of<em> The Legend of Vox Machina</em> S3 Can Look Forward To</h2>
<p>To begin Matthew Mercer, CCO and Dungeon Master at Critical Role, took a moment to explain the premise of the upcoming third season. "Vox Machina are still rallying against the Chroma Conclave, they managed to fell one of their numbers but others exist. There's a possible dubious conversation with one of them, there's all sorts of weird mingled stuff there, but as the search for these Vestigaes continues, part of it leads them to hell."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vm-in-hell.jpg?itok=-_97dQpi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vm-in-hell.jpg?itok=yQWOpiW- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Talking further about Vox Machina's travels to hell Mercer expanded, "It was part of the campaign to a degree and we've been able to expand upon that in some really fun and unique and surprising ways. We've gotten to spotlight some of the non-Vox Machina characters and spend more time with them."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For those not familiar with the campaign there will be a lot of really cool familiar moments and some very unique and surprising ones" - Matthew Mercer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excited for what fans, new and old, are going to see, Liam O'Brien talked a bit about the anticipation that the cast is feeling. "There are massive moments that are going to sideswipe the audience and we're just waiting in the wings for it to slide onto stage," he gestured with his hands, something coming into frame. "You're not going to be disappointed."</p>
<p>A bit of a more direct tease, Taliesin Jaffe jumped in to say "I'm excited for the cleverest thing for Laura Bailey has said in Campaign One and that's all I'm going to say." As I, and I'm sure others in the room, began scrambling through their memories of what he could be referencing Sam Riegal asked "Is it a poop joke?", Jaffe quickly swatted away that idea. While we still can't be too sure what moment Jaffe was thinking of we at least know it's not that.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vex-and-percy.jpg?itok=kzNX0a3M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vex-and-percy.jpg?itok=r87-s7PT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A Lot Of The Same, But Also New</h2>
<p>Talking deeper about the changes that some fans of the original campaign may recognize, Willingham explained that "Season Three is a big divergence for our characters. I think part of it, as we were considering story beats and how we want the show to approach this culmination with the Chroma Conclave we're always looking for ways to improve or economize, or even put a new shine on some moments now that we have a second chance at telling them, but we're also trying to tee things up for down the road, not just in this show but also in the Mighty Nein. We've had years and years of gameplay since these episodes were played the very first time and so we're always trying to go back and seed things early if we can and provide something new for an audience that thinks they know what to expect, we can unsettle them just a bit."</p>
<p>When asking the cast who felt they had the largest divergence Marisha Ray volunteered Johnson's character Pike Trickfoot. "We definitely did a lot of adjusting to Pike and I think that continues throughout the rest of the shows." During the original campaign due to scheduling conflicts with Johnson's work on Blindspot Pike would frequently come in and out of story arcs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I know personally I'm so excited to just retroactively have more Ashley Johnson" - Marisha Ray</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Johnson talked about how she was excited that there are so many moment now "specifically with Pike. Getting to see where we could have gone with the story had I been at the table. Also where we are going with the story in the animated series and how Pike can sort of fit in there. We looked for ways in a series with hundreds of hours that we have to truncate into an episode or 12 episodes and it feels really cool because I feel like I get to do things I really didn't get to do at the table and to get to go to places. I get to go to hell which is going to be really fun."</p>

<p>"I think that the character we got to alter the most is Vox Machina as a group," Riegel began "from the campaign to the screen we go to different places in different orders, we split up in different ways that we didn't do in the campaign, we reunite in different ways and so really the whole linear arc of the season differs from the campaign a lot."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Also characters that aren't main Vox Machina characters like Kima and Allura, we focus on them in ways this season that they never got that spotlight in the campaign and it's really fun to look at these characters, beloved characters, that didn't get their own campaign episode but now they get their own episode in the animated series."</p>
<h2>Recording Trials, Tribulations, and Tomfoolery From A Decade Ago</h2>
<p>"We get to pick and choose where we want to go and the moments we get to highlight," Jaffe began to explain on the topic of time in the recording booth. He highlighted just how different the situation was when they were roleplaying at a table making decisions on the fly and with the show they're able to revisit every moment and dial it up for drama.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-keyleth.jpg?itok=DodDV3Au 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-keyleth.jpg?itok=60EnOsb4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"It is this delight going in there and having that memory of the first time we were pulling this out of our butts, now allowing it to become drama, and comedy, and knowing that when we actually see it on screen it's somehow always better than it was in my head, other than in my head Vex is always hotter" Jaffe added, playing on the romance between his character, Percy de Rolo, and Bailey's character, Vex'ahlia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's really amazing to be able to give these moments to artists and then just watch it blossom"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking about the experience in the booth, reliving emotions from years ago Ray jumped into the discussion "I think at the table too, when we're in these moments all of these emotions are real. We're acting in real-time so going back and revisiting them it's still just as emotionally impactful and it is not uncommon to cry… a lot… and then you're exhausted for the rest of the day because you cried in your morning session. It's still so emotionally palpable ten years later almost."</p>
<p>Bailey remarked that she believes that when they were playing this game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons a decade ago they didn't realize just how much emotion they could bring to the story. "We were a little timid about fully going there emotionally, it's so wonderful in the animated series to allow ourselves to dive in to those really deep moments."</p>
<p>As each cast member became quite introspective of the emotions that each of their characters had gone through and the effort it took to portray that O'Brien also highlighted the time in the recording booth that they were able to spend together. "We have so many responsibilities too, we're organizing so much and tracking so much and writing and producing, the time we get together with a ring of microphones and we get to make each other laugh and cry is a playspace, a place of dream and imagination. I'm so excited the mornings I get to wake up and we're heading off to the studios, I don't ever want it to end, I love being in the Holodeck."</p>

<p>What you see on the screen of Season 3 continues to push the envelope in terms of adult animation. Speaking on their collaboration with Titmouse – whose work includes not only <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em>, but also Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and The Boys Presents: Diabolical – Willingham made sure to point out all of the incredible work being done.</p>
<p>"We have amazing partners with Titmouse Animation and it's been important to us form the beginning to really push what this Adult animated show can be so we have incredible episodic directors, board artists, supervising producers that come in and help us push the envelope at every turn. Even when we think we write something that's un-producable or un-animatable they kinda look back and say 'bet' and just blow us away."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-thordak-flames.jpg?itok=_pVnWSiJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-thordak-flames.jpg?itok=aeUGgJ8k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Ray added a note based on not only how violent the show is, but how the relationships between different characters begin to bloom this season "The romance was there in the original, we just couldn't show it because of Twitch ToS"</p>
<p>The cast burst into laughter making jokes about how without the ToS there would have been constant 30 minute romance scenes.</p>
<p>"I think it was heavily implied that Vex and Percy were doing so much boning." Ray continued "So now we just get to show it!"</p>
<p>Talking more about the core of the relationships, and a bit further away from the boning Jaffe brought up that he and Bailey had talked about their character's relationships at the time and were proud because "it's rare in television to see what feels like a real relationship and this is something I'm really proud of in what we're doing. These feel, at least to me, a lot more honest in the sorts of things that people talk about and deal with in especially stressful relationships."</p>
<h2>The Music Of <em>Vox Machina</em></h2>
<p>From music's original tie to <em>Vox Machina</em>, in Scanlan's bardic performances we've seen hit songs like "The Legend of Vox Machina", "Scanlan's Sphinx Song", and "Pull My Beads of Love" come out of each season of the show.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask what the process was like for identifying where a song should be added and what the process was like to create them. Sam Reigel, Scanlan's creator and voice actor, explained "In season 3 we're going to continue what we've done in prior seasons where there are fun songs that help to carry the vibe and there are some important songs that deal with plot and are integral and this season we actually rely on Matt Mercer more to provide us with some vocals this season in two key moments in the Season. One you might not even recognize that it's Matt's voice but it's in a pivotal emotionally gutting moment in the season and Matt sings a song that will, I hope, break your heart and then he gets to sing in character also in a totally different episode so I'm excited. I'm always excited when we get songs from characters that are not me, although I love me I also love these guys and they're so talented."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-matt-mercer-cameo.jpg?itok=s6skTqmz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-matt-mercer-cameo.jpg?itok=6pcgLHNl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A few chuckles were heard from other members of the cast including Ashley Johnson and Travis Willingham as Reigel professed his love for himself.</p>
<p>Mercer added that from his perspective "A lot of it was just playful banter in the writers room about what moments could be musical. The majority of it was Sam and the folks from production…" Mercer trailed off for a moment before doubling back "Mostly Sam and Peter basically coming up with ridiculous ideas of where to fit songs both mid-episode versus end-credit bits."</p>
<h2><em>The Mighty Nein</em> Isn't Too Far Away</h2>
<p>While the conversation mostly focused on <em>Vox Machina</em> the cast of Critical Role wasn't going to get away without a further hint about the upcoming Mighty Nein TV Show, also coming to Amazon Prime.</p>
<p>After releasing an early animatic earlier this year when asked if any more news could be given about it's release Bailey and O'Brien deflected into playful banter between their characters Jester Lavorre and Caleb Widogast about how many dick jokes there will be.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mighty-nein.jpg?itok=SPa34SaF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mighty-nein.jpg?itok=lqkAxryP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Locking in for a more serious answer O'Brien rattled off a few themes for the season including "Spy thriller, grief, thick action, budding love." From that Bailey added that "it's a story from a different perspective, that we didn't get to see in the campaign."</p>
<p>Willingham also added "One of the things we love about <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> is that we get to spend so much time with our antagonists, more than maybe what we did during the live stream. One of the things we're looking forward to the most is seeing some of these villains that we will come to learn and to hate, to meet and maybe even love in some cases. As we've teased before we're visiting these characters from more of a session zero perspective which is how they've all started, come together as a group, and what it is that keeps them together. For some of the audience this will be entirely new material. Some things they may have heard of but never seen before. We're really excited to bring that to the screen for the first time."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/caravan-sandwitch-impressions-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I just finished up playing <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em>, a sci-fi sandbox game released a few weeks ago, and let me tell you: I have not been this pleasantly surprised in a very long time.</p><p>Before I start talking about it, let's just look at it for a minute:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="CARAVAN SANDWITCH - Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTNpqsqBoWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Gorgeous, non?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzwkcxZ8zgg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> And that music, ah, c'est beau</a>. As someone whose favourite game is <em>Wind Waker</em>--and whose favourite bits of <em>Wind Waker </em>are the little chores you can perform on perfectly-formed little islands--this game feels like it was made just for me.</p><p>But what really struck me about <em>Caravan Sandwitch </em>is that it knows its scale and its scope. It's a sandbox game that is fully aware of the limitations of what that genre is increasingly known for--tedium and bloat, mostly--and ducks out on them altogether.</p><p><em>Caravan Sandwitch's</em> world is fully explorable, but it's a pretty small space. It has a cast of characters to chat with and run errands for, but not many; over the course of its six or so hours you'll get to know everyone. It has a few puzzles but not enough to overwhelm, some platforming that never frustrates and a lot of driving, but it's never too far.</p><p>It doesn't even have combat. Not a single punch or shot. This is an open world that's so uninterested in using fighting as a solution to problems--or a motivation for its story--that it doesn't feature hostiles, you don't have a health bar and can't die, not even if you fall from its highest peak.</p><p>This <em>could </em>feel reductive, like we're only playing parts of a game, but this isn't trying to be anything bigger. <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em> is more interested in putting exploration and story in the spotlight, so that's what we get. The game is long enough to make us care about those things but short enough to stop it from feeling limited. By the time I was done with the game it had felt like the perfect little diversion. I'd been whisked away to a beautiful make-believe world, met some people, helped them out then rolled some credits, never once feeling stuck or cheated along the way.</p><figure></figure><p>Too many sandbox games these days feel like a sprawl, like you're drowning in tedium and empty space for the sake of a marketing bullet point boasting about the size of a map. Here, it feels weird to even call <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em> a sandbox game at all. This feels more like a snowglobe, an approximation of something bigger, perfectly formed in miniature.</p><p>I don't want to sound like I'm reducing everything else here that's so good about this game, all its wonderful writing and visual craft, to a simple matter of me enjoying its scale and pacing, but that was just so important here! Because nobody outstayed (and nothing outplayed) their welcome, my memories of <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em> are nothing but fond ones; I'll genuinely miss my little frog friends, the rooftop cafe, the whine of my busted old van that became my best friend over the course of my explorations.</p><p>I'll also miss the sweeping visuals, the beautiful countryside, the surprisingly slick soundtrack. Now that I'm done I'll just...miss everything about you, <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em>. We parted on the very best of terms, and it's very rare I can say that about a video game, no matter its size or budget.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Football Manager 25 is going to be released on November 26th, SEGA and Sports Interactive have announced today. The release of Football Manager 25 will be the start of new era for the series, with the game now running in Unity, and an overhaul of the user interface along with some omissions from the current games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 25 | The New Era | #FM25 Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob06By9TFOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sports Interactive’s Miles Jacobson said, “It’s a great honour today to be confirming the forthcoming release of Football Manager 25. As I’ve mentioned in interviews and development updates, the FM25 cycle has been challenging for the entire SI team. FM25 is just the starting point for the studio’s next 20, 30 years. It’s also the point where the world gets to see two of our multi-year projects come to fruition: the switch to the Unity engine and the introduction of Women’s Football. It gives us a real sense of achievement to begin sharing our hard work with you and we’re really looking forward to showing you more of the game in the weeks before the game’s release.”</p>
<p>One of the new features in Football Manager 25 include the Premier League license, and for the first ever time women’s teams can be managed. There are other major changes too. The matchday information screen has been redesigned with it&nbsp; showing the pitch taking centre stage, with both team tactical line ups on either side of it. Below these are the match stats, match events, and other match scores from around the league. Under all of that is the team line up with player condition. The new Portal system, has replaced the Inbox, which was seen as outdated and has been consigned to history. With the Portal you will have an Agenda list showing tasks that need to be completed, news from the football world, the calendar, and messages from everyone you interact with. Player form screens will show how an individual player has been performing, and their contributions in the last five matches.</p>

<p>While there are a lot of changes to how Football Manager 25 will run, there have also been major elements taken out. This includes <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">international management</a>, which should return in future games, touchline shouts, create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. Fantasy Draft will be made available in Football Manager 25, but not at launch. Football Manager 25 Console edition will be be available for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 26th too, with the game coming to Game Pass day one. Football Manager 25 Mobile will also launch on November 26th, but as a Netflix exclusive, and Football Manager 25 Touch will be released for Nintendo Switch on December 3rd.</p>

		<p>Neon Blood, the neo-noir cyberpunk RPG, has been set a release date of November 26th, developer ChaoticBrain Studios and publisher Meridiem have confirmed. Alongside the release date news, Meridiem has also revealed that there will be a physical release for Neon Blood though this is limited to PS5 and Nintendo Switch. The game is also being released on PC, but there is no physical release for that platform.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neon Blood :: &quot;Introducing Ruby Emerald&quot; - Physical Edition Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XD2EoSZFloQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story of Neon Blood is set in the year 2053 following World War Three, in which much of the world has been abandoned with people now living in a huge metropolis called Viridis, which itself is made up of two cities. There is Bright City, home to the upper echelons of society, and Blind City, where the poorer and downtrodden live. The main character is Axel McCoin, a detective from Blind City, who after seeing so many injustices is ready to rebel against the societal divide and lead a revolution. He will find allies who want to see the cause succeed, along with enemies who want to see it fail. One of those enemies is Ruby Emerald, who is introduced in the above trailer.</p>
<p>Neon Blood is an RPG which will feature puzzles to solve, conversations to navigate, and scenarios to investigate, all in the interest of bringing about revolution to Viridis.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warframe%E2%80%99s-koumei-the-five-fates-update-releasing-october-2.996321/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warframes-koumei-the-five-fates-update-releasing-october-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As showcased at the Tokyo Game Show, the Warframe Devstream showcases the 58th playable namesake as well as a new game mode. Those watching the devstream were also notified of the hands-on demo for <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-out-this-winter-will-add-romance-system/">Warframe: 1999</a>, which is launching October 16. In the live stream, Digital Extremes gave players a glance at the upcoming namesake warrior, Koumei the dice-maiden. This update will be debuting on all platforms as of October 2, where players will get to try out Koumei in-game. Koumei has an RNG inspired ability kit, and to develop her, Digital Extremes partnered up with Sumo Digital to create her and her abilities. In addition to Koumei, Sumo Digital also helped them develop a new Shrine Defense mission, which is an Infested mini-boss, Infested Oni, and a slew of quality-of-life improvements. This update comes with deluxe cosmetics for players to enjoy if they want to spruce up their aesthetics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warframe | Koumei &amp; the Five Fates Official Gameplay Trailer (Japanese Version ft. Kenjiro Tsuda)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6iblGunMnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"It was so surreal to be back in Tokyo to reveal a new Warframe to our Japanese community and our players around the world tuning in virtually. Traveling the glove this year to meet Tenno in person has been rejuvenating for the soul of our team as we trek on our path towards Warframe: 1999 this year. Until then, we hope everyone enjoys Koumei and optimizing her high skill-ceiling gameplay," says Megan Everett, Community Director.</p>
<p>Koumei has a six-sided dice that can be used in conjunction with her abilities. This includes the ability to thread together Kumihimo traps, which can inflict damage and random status ailments to the enemy based on the dice rolls. Koumei can also predict the future using Omikuji, which gives her a special buff.</p>
<p>As a defensive capability, she can summon Omamori charms which orbit her and can randomly convert damage into extra health or shields. Her ultimate ability is called Bunraku and it allows her to turn her enemies into marionettes and puppeteer them with status effects.</p>
<p>Added in conjunction with Koumei's release is the Shrine Defense, where players will have to gather shrine offerings and fight off Invested enemies until the Infested Oni shows up. During this mission, you'll be able to grab Koumei's crafting parts to add her to the Arsenal with her weaponry: A "gunbrella" called Higasa and a Naginata style polearm named Amanata.</p>
<p>Those who play Warframe will be able to get a <a href="https://www.warframe.com/1999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on teaser demo</a> of Warframe: 1999, which will lead to a Protokol Longsword Skin for those who complete the chapter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-oily-depths-ex-blizzard-ubisoft-dev<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Blizzard and Ubisoft staffer Ryan R. Burns has announced&nbsp;<em>The Oily Depths</em>, his debut project as a solo indie developer, and if you're into the likes of&nbsp;<em>Lethal Company</em>, you'll probably enjoy this one.</p>
<p><em>The Oily Depths&nbsp;</em>is a "short horror game" set on a deep-sea submarine, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7246512641903312897/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Burns' announcement</a>. Your goal is to locate oil deposits and drill for them, and if you don't do a satisfactory job, "your corporate overlords will stop your supply of oxygen".</p>
<p>There's something delightfully poetic about Burns, who's worked for both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-accused-of-trying-to-stifle-albany-union">Blizzard</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">Ubisoft</a>, creating a game about how corporations will crush you without a second thought if you don't perform well enough for them, but perhaps I shouldn't read too much into that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-oily-depths-horror-submarine.jpg?itok=OqBsM2Oy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-oily-depths-horror-submarine.jpg?itok=zBPtD0BN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Oily Depths&nbsp;</em>is a horror game set aboard a deep-sea submarine.</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Oily Depths&nbsp;</em>employs a lo-fi art style that's very similar to&nbsp;<em>Lethal Company</em>'s, and it has similar themes of corporate indifference in the face of looming monstrous horror.</p>
<p>The difference, though - and it's a pretty big difference at that - is that&nbsp;<em>The Oily Depths&nbsp;</em>is a single-player experience, so you won't need to recruit any of your friends to enjoy this one with you.</p>
<p>You will, however, need to gain mastery over the tools at your disposal. Burns says you'll need to "flip levers, grab tools, set locking-arms, and more" if you want to escape from the deep-sea abyss with oil (and, more importantly, your sanity).</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Oily Depths</em>, which gives a good idea of what the game's atmosphere will be like, right here.</p>

<p>By the looks of things, you won't just be operating your sub and drilling for oil in&nbsp;<em>The Oily Depths</em>; you may also have to deal with monstrous creatures trying to sabotage your machines, so keep your wits about you.</p>
<p><em>The Oily Depths&nbsp;</em>can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3113030/The_Oily_Depths/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlisted right now via Steam</a>. It doesn't have a release date yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>

On the subject of missing bots from <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, and<em> Nier</em>, Doucet was diplomatic about why they didn’t end up in the game. “It’s difficult to comment on that,” he said. “We really respect the choice of each publisher.” Other missing bots, like<em> Twisted Metal</em>’s psychopathic clown Sweet Tooth, were at Team Asobi’s discretion. “They advised us—they didn’t force us—and we agreed that it was better to leave this character out,” Doucet said citing conversations with former<em> Twisted Metal</em> devs. “Because, if you’re playing with your kids, we don’t want you to have to explain what this character does.”</p><p>Team Asobi recently revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-free-dlc-new-bots-levels-helldivers-1851656690?_gl=1*pkjcrg*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzcwMjk3Ni4xMDcuMS4xNzI3NzA1MDQ4LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-free-dlc-new-bots-levels-helldivers-1851656690?_gl=1*pkjcrg*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzcwMjk3Ni4xMDcuMS4xNzI3NzA1MDQ4LjYwLjAuMA.."><em>Astro Bot</em>’s first free expansion</a></span> at last week’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-ghost-of-tsushima-2-yotei-1851656575&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-ghost-of-tsushima-2-yotei-1851656575">State of Play showcase,</a></span> which will include additional bots representing <em>Helldivers</em> and <em>Stellar Blade</em> among others, as well as new speedrunning challenge levels.

Project lead Victor Rubenstein and his studio peers haven't been slaving away for all that time—the game began life in 2019 as a 1v1 collectible card game with a science fiction theme, and was meant to just be a 6-month side project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2021, he and co-founder Mike Conaway decided to enter full production—but not as a multiplayer game (he called the idea of doing so with a 2-person team "insane"), beginning a three-year journey to launching in Early Access this month. They did so without any formal game development training, which isn't an unusual story in 2024, but it is notable that they did so after going to school for architecture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And beyond that, they pulled it off while operating from the Romanian city of Timișoara, where they're apparently the only game development studio in town.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rubenstein told us this tale at Gamescom 2024, and explained how Edgeflow Studios explored a host of interesting design ideas to make its game stand out in a crowded genre.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Breachway"><span>Breachway</span> was made with "form follows function" in mind</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's fair to compare </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to Mega Crit's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Both are run-based games where characters pick a "character" (a spaceship in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) with unique traits, then set out to traverse various nodes, encountering different obstacles and adding or removing cards to their deck along the way.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/what-the-heck-is-valve-doing-with-these-informal-deadlock-ndas-" target="_self">What the heck is Valve doing with these informal Deadlock NDAs?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's also a bit of</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Subset Games' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FTL</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cooked into the mix, with the physical assembly of the different ships impacting player decisions. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players load their ships with different weapons and equipment, which put different decks of cards in circulation. Those equipped objects are also displayed on the model of the ship, and can be targeted by enemies. The player also can target enemy upgrades, damaging or disabling them to secure victory. Which characters operate which systems also plays a major role.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s eye-catching ship models are a part of the appeal (the game's Next Fest demo racked up a number of players in advance of its recent Early Access launch). Robinson said he and the team wanted to go in a different direction than how many ships are designed in modern games, avoiding the all-white aesthetics of real-world spaceships but also refraining from the organic shapes of alien craft in other science fiction titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The SyFy and Amazon series The Expanse (adapted from the book series by James S.A. Corey) was a huge inspiration, with vessels like the Rocinante, the Donnager, and the Razorback looming in Robinson's mind. The ships are bulky and loaded with details meant to evoke "functionality," inviting the player to imagine how they might be used in real life.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-simplifies-social-media-linking-after-aggressive-api-updates" target="_self">Steam simplifies social media linking after aggressive API updates</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But The Expanse is just a tertiary inspiration. Robinson and the game's 3D artist are trained architects who graduated from the same school. "[Architecture] teaches you to always think within the human scale," he said. "So if you look really closely, our spaceships have doors, handrails... I was designing the art style that was like 'this is an object that people use.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said his education emphasized minimalism, on "form following function."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Edgeflow's geographic isolation from the rest of the game development world raises interesting implications. In regions with more populous game development communities, developers regularly interact with each other and learn at overlapping institutions. They're often inspired by similar games (like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">), and have to fight hard to create distinctive elements when competing in a space like say, deckbuilder-based roguelikes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But because Robinson and his team weren't so embedded in the same culture, they had a chance to enter the genre with fresh eyes—but also without the same foundational resources.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/windows-on-arm-is-not-ready-for-the-complexities-of-the-pc-gaming-landscape" target="_self">Windows on Arm is not ready for the complexities of the PC gaming landscape</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The lead developer of ">The lead developer of <span>Breachway</span> hadn't played <span>Slay the Spire</span> before starting development</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Plenty of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">sprung to life after the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The deckbuilding roguelike format is a great foundation for all kinds of games, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Griftlands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inscryption</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> all being shining, standout examples.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amusingly enough, Robinson said he hadn't heard of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> until he was well into developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Remember, the game started off as a 1v1 card game, and it was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FTL</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that was the team's greater inspiration when they pivoted to single-player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maybe that's partly why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doesn't approach deckbuilding the same way </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does. "We never saw </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">as a deckbuilder, but rather a game with turn-based deckbuilder combat," he said. "If you want to make a deckbuilder, then you're automatically boxing yourself in to the standards of the genre. You have one resource type, you play the cards...they go on cooldown, etc."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> requires players to juggle three resource types, themed around attack, defense, and cargo energy (red, green, and blue). Cards are drawn and discarded, but they also have fixed cooldown periods that create different timing windows than milling a deck through the discard pile.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The size of the player's deck was a particular sticking point for Robinson—one that led to the unique cooldown mechanic. "In most deckbuilders, having a thin deck is very powerful, so we had to come up with something to solve that issue. Instead of having cards go into a draw pile, each card has a cooldown period."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can have thin decks (they can go as low as five cards, as of this writing), but encouraging players to make their decks as small as possible doesn't feel as good in a spaceship combat game. "With spaceship games, you want to add a lot of cool weapons, and then you get more powerful. In a card game, you want to have as few cards as possible. Those two things clash with each other."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fans of The Expanse can think of it this way: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a game where players can build ships as lean as the Razorback or as chunky as a beefed-up Rocinante.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scuttling in sideways to the roguelike deckbuilder genre means Edgeflow has a slight...well, edge, on the competition, but it came at something of a cost. Romania is not a country with a large game development community, and as mentioned before, it's the only game studio in Timișoara.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So to learn how to make the game they wanted, the team had to lean on YouTube tutorials, game development forums, and GDC talks. Recruiting was also something of a challenge, since Timișoara is a city with a thriving software community, largely focused on information technology. A small independent team can't match the salaries of a company like local software firm Berg Software.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Edgeflow pulled it off (with help from publisher Hooded Horse), and is now helping build out a small local community. But it can be difficult to talk about game design, Robinson said, because developers don't have the same "vocabulary." The internet helps (Robinson praised Tim Caine's YouTube channel as a great resource) but it's hard to kick imposter syndrome to the curb when you're learning all of game design from scratch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a great accomplishment for a small team representing a growing region. Edgeflow's lateral maneuver into a popular genre is a strong case study for developers who want to make similar kinds of games.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/22/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review/">Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail Review</a></h2>
<p>Now could be a good time to get into Final Fantasy XIV, as in our Dawntrail review, Miguel said, <em>“Although it admittedly doesn’t quite hit the heights of Shadowbringers, Dawntrail’s shift in narrative focus injects a vibrancy into Final Fantasy XIV with this more lighthearted romp, while still keeping track of a greater story. With an increase in challenge of the instances, a couple of excellent new Jobs, an introduction of new characters, and the development of existing ones, Dawntrail clearly shows there’s life after averting the end of the world and I – for one – wouldn’t change a damn thing.”</em></p>

As Season 3 picks up we see Vox Machina go through some of their most troubling times as they continue to wage a war against dragons, as well as open themselves up to love and betrayal.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning even more about <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story">The Legend of Vox Machina Season 3 be sure to check out our interview with the entire cast</a> where we discussed how they approached alterations to the plot, what it was like revisiting budding relationships in the recording booth, and a small update on The Mighty Nein.</p>
<p>Much like how Season 2 exploded into action so does Season 3, picking up in the middle of an action setpiece, our heroes attempting to make a hasty escape from a powerful foe before flashing back to the tense conversation we left off with from the end of Season 2.</p>
<h2>Vox Machina Vs The Chroma Conclave</h2>
<p>It's a quick and simple way to draw the viewers attention and get them excited for Vox Machina to swing into action, it also does an excellent job demonstrating just how out of their depths Vox Machina still is in the upward battle.</p>
<p>The main goals for this season are to obtain the rest of the Vestiges of Divergence, powerful artifacts that were created during the time of the Calamity. Obtaining as many of these objects is necessary to complete the larger goal, defeating the draconic cult known as The Chroma Conclave.</p>

These overlapping story beats do a fantastic job of continuously leading the viewer on and keeping them out of step from one another.</p>
<p>By the time one plot point has been resolved another has been set up and is nearing completion. This allows the pace to always remain consistently high keeping you actively engaged. In many ways the plot delivery structure remains faithful to a traditional Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style story, seeding information to players while they seek out other story avenues.</p>
<p>At all times <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> feels like it's speedrunning to the end of it's own story. While this is in part due to the 12 episode limit it also makes sense from a plot perspective as they're trying to condense what was 100+ hours worth of Actual Play content into four hours of concise and entertaining story. While I'll always wish there were more seasons, I can also understand why it feels so rapidly paced.</p>

<p>Season 3 has also stepped even further off the well worn path as it continues to rearrange key plot points for narrative purposes or even create entirely new scenarios.</p>
<p>Of the major changes that I noticed I was happy with all of them, one even had me calling out to my TV in disbelief. There may be many who will view some of these changes with disdain or questioning as to why they didn't stick with the original idea, I think with what they know now and with a further 10 years of roleplaying completed (including 30 years of in-universe history being fleshed out) it's great to see the interweaving of these additional plots, seeding these ideas for future seasons, shows, and spin-offs.</p>

<p>Something that all viewers will notice about this season is just how much more mature the tone of the show is. Facing serious threats also comes with grave consequences as Vox Machina experiences grief and loss in a way that they only grazed against in previous seasons.</p>
<p>It's not just about the loud moments that the group can share, but the quiet and lonely moments that will sit with you long after the season has wrapped up.</p>
<p>The added seriousness isn't just from the dark moments though, as relationships among the party grow stronger we get to see two very earnest takes on companionship while the threat of impending doom looms on the horizon. For Vax and Keyleth, there is fear in what they could lose leading to hesitancy to get involved, while Percy and Vex are seeking out a relationship to experience it before they lose the chance to.</p>

There is still a lot of those kinds of moments inbetween the epic set pieces and atmospheric battles.</p>
<p>If anything, how dark the rest of the season gets makes those moments of fun and laughter even more important.</p>
<h2>Critical Role Fan's Delight</h2>
<p>This season is jam-packed with a number of 'blink and you'll miss it' references to people and places in the world of Exandria that we might see in the future, and even an amazing musical interlude dedicated to Jester Lavorre's mother from a bard in the back of a bar.</p>
<p>For fans of Vox Machina and the extended Critical Role story every episode will have you smiling or leading forward doing the Leo Pointing Meme.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-matt-mercer-cameo_0.jpg?itok=ljj3Ljre 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-matt-mercer-cameo_0.jpg?itok=Wk5vMpRl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Thankfully none of these references are ever pulling a viewer away from the story, and with so many it will take a few rewatches before you could confidently say you've seen everything that the show has to over.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> Season 3 Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> has had another successful season and with it they've been able to improve across the board. This season has managed to show character development across the board, not just as we previously new it but with added depth as each character's journey has had the chance for an additional writing take.</p>
<p>On top of character development the show has also managed to steer into a darker and more serious space without losing a lot of the charm of the original 'bumbling' adventures that we saw most predominantly through Season 1.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em>, Critical Role, and Titmouse have me excited for the continued adventures of Vox Machina, anticipating reliving the journeys of the Mighty Nein, and keep me hopeful to see other epic events from the annals of Exandria such as Calamity or Downfall animated.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami-releases-100-minutes-of-silent-hill-2-remake-music-ahead-of-launch.996282/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-silent-hill-2-remake-music<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has released almost 100 minutes of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake music to tide you over until the game's release on PC and PS5 next week.</p>
<p>In two YouTube videos uploaded earlier today, Konami provides a preview of the entire&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>soundtrack, which will be released on November 20th (once you've had a chance to get to grips with the game).</p>
<p>Additionally, the Extra Edition of the game's soundtrack, which features a number of extra compositions, has also been made available to listen to. It's not clear whether these videos will remain available indefinitely, but I'd assume not, so get listening while you can.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-konami-music-preview-toluca-lake.jpg?itok=3kHA9fS5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-konami-music-preview-toluca-lake.jpg?itok=Ofuq8fB0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake is imminent, and you can listen to its soundtrack ahead of its release.</figcaption></figure><p>Just like the original game's music, the remake's soundtrack was created by longtime&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>composer Akira Yamaoka, as were the additional tracks on the Extra Edition of the soundtrack.</p>
<p>As such, a lot of the new game's compositions will probably sound familiar to you if you're a&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>aficionado, although they've been given a more modern flavor by Yamaoka.</p>
<p>Here's the first soundtrack video, which features around 50 minutes of music.</p>

<p>Here's the Extra Edition soundtrack, which has a number of additional compositions for you to listen to. You can think of it as lo-fi horror beats to dissociate to.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake was first announced back in 2022 as part of that October's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed">Transmission event</a>. It's being developed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/medium">The Medium</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Layers of Fear&nbsp;</em>studio Bloober Team.</p>
<p>While the remake will retain the same story elements and outline as the original, it'll shift the action to a third-person over-the-shoulder perspective of the kind favored by more recent&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>remakes.</p>
<p>You'll be able to grab&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/silent-hill-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> when it launches on October 8th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Kunos Simulazioni and publisher 505 Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa Evo&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, and the hyper-realistic racing sim is landing on Steam Early Access in just a couple of months.</p>
<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3058630/view/4677641107702845653" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa Evo&nbsp;</em>launches on January 16th, and in a press release, the two studios say that the game "represents a major leap forward" for the&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>
<p>The game was first mooted back in 2021, when it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodstained-2-and-assetto-corsa-2-confirmed">revealed to be in development</a> alongside a sequel to Koji Igarashi's Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em>. Sadly, there's still no news on the latter front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assetto-corsa-evo-release-date-lamborghini-steering-wheel.jpg?itok=Ieyjlrgs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assetto-corsa-evo-release-date-lamborghini-steering-wheel.jpg?itok=deCSkThc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assetto Corsa Evo&nbsp;</em>is very much placing an emphasis on realism.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the aforementioned press release, Kunos Simulazioni has created a "new proprietary engine" for&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa Evo</em>, one that can reproduce real-world vehicles and simulate their "mechanical, electronic, and aerodynamic performance".</p>
<p>This, the developer says, will raise the bar of realism "even higher than&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa</em>", which it says is "arguably one of the most popular driving simulations of the last decade".</p>
<p>The new game will introduce several new features and gameplay modes, all of which are made possible by the new engine. It sounds like you'll be hearing from this engine again after the release of&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa Evo</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Evo&nbsp;</em>will support "a full 24-hour race cycle", as well as "cutting-edge lighting" and "dynamic weather and track conditions". Of course, you can also expect pin-sharp visuals to complement all of these features.</p>

<p>Kunos Simulazioni and 505 Games don't give any kind of indication regarding exactly how long they expect&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa Evo&nbsp;</em>to remain in Early Access, but Kunos co-founder Marco Massarutto says his studio believes in "taking the time to get things just right".</p>
<p><em>Assetto Corsa Evo&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via Steam Early Access on January 16th. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3058630/Assetto_Corsa_EVO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist the game here</a> ahead of its launch if you'd like.</p>

It included a few interesting details about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24055773/death-stranding-2-ps5-trailer-2025">the weird-as-hell sequel</a>, which the developer has helpfully split up into a series of clips in lieu of a traditional trailer. They feature some of the new characters joining the cast, some dialogue that makes little sense out of context, and what looks like a completely ridiculous photo mode to play around with.</p><p>The first includes some returning faces played by Norman Reedus and Léa Seydoux and also provides a proper introduction to one of the stranger elements of <em>Death Stranding 2</em>: a physic medium who has been turned into a marionette, who is obviously known as Dollman:</p><p>Next up we have two of the characters director Hideo Kojima has been teasing for some time, with Rainy played by Shioli Kutsuna and Elle Fanning as Tomorrow.

<p>Tony Hawk has continued to talk about the future of the Pro Skater franchise and games. </p>



<p>It was known that Hawk was talking to Activision about the series as it celebrated its 25th anniversary. Now, 25 years to the day that the first Tony Hawk Pro Skater game was released, Hawk has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAgXDa1PI8a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taken to Instagram</a> to reminisce and, once again, tease what could be coming. </p>



<p>“My intention and expectation for the game was mostly for the enjoyment of skateboarders,” Hawk said in his post. “I had no idea it would transcend a niche market to become a massive success and – as some have argued – change the course of skateboarding’s popularity (and possibly even skate trick evolution). It definitely changed the course of my life…”</p>



<p>He then closed by saying, “I’m not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future.”</p>

</div></figure>



<p>What that future is remains to be seen. Will it be the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 &amp; 4 Remake that was in development by Vicarious Visions but then cancelled when the studio was merged into Activision? Has it been quietly revived? Or, could it be a brand new Tony Hawk game altogether? </p>



<p>Earlier in September, Hawk <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-is-talking-to-activision-about-tony-hawk-pro-skater-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed that he was talking</a> to Activision again, but didn’t give much away.</p>



<p>“I wish I could tell you more,” Hawk said at the  time. “But I can tell you that I’ve been talking to Activision again which is insanely exciting. We’re working on something.”</p>



<p>Do you think there will be a new Tony Hawk Pro Skater game in the near future? Join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/619/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>"Due to some unforeseen circumstances, we cannot announce it today," he said. The developer did not elaborate as to what those circumstances might be.</p><p>Kojima is good friends with Geoff Keighley, who runs The Game Awards each December. Some had speculated that Kojima could reveal the game's release date there, but it seems that won't be the case, though of course plans can always change. The game was previously announced for a 2025 release.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 will be exclusive on console to PlayStation, as part of Kojima's partnership with the company. In addition to Death Stranding 2, Kojima productions is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-teases-death-stranding-movie-and-his-movie-ambitions/1100-6526782/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter/" data-ref-id="1100-6526782">working on a Death Stranding movie with A24</a>, along with multiple other games, including the Xbox-exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a> and the espionage game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a>.</p><p>The original Death Stranding came out in 2019 and was polarizing. It is a strange journey into extinction anchored by the performances of Hollywood stars such as Norman Reedus and Mads Mikkelsen, among others. The sequel, much like the first game, looks unique and odd. You can check out the newest gameplay footage in the video above.</p>

		<p>In October, you will need to jump to the left and then take a step to the right. Well many steps to the right and jumps in all directions, as FreakZone Games has announced The Rocky Horror Show Video Game, which is coming in the form on a retro platformer with the iconic songs from The Rocky Horror Picture Show redone as 8 bit chiptunes.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Rocky Horror Video Game Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nqwqOLSe_d8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Going by the trailer, you will play as Brad, Janet, and Dr Scott as the navigate through various trap filled levels as they try to escape from the castle of &nbsp;Dr. Frank N. Furter and his muscle man Rocky, hailing from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania.</p>
<p>This is not the first time The Rocky Horror Show has been adapted into videogame form, with the very first adaptation happening nearly 40 years ago in 1985. That version was developed by CRL Group for the Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Commodore 64, Commodore 128, and the ZX Spectrum. In that game, players took control of Brad and Janet to find pieces of the Medusa machine while trying to avoid the inhabitants of the castle. It was then remade for PC in 1999 as The Rocky Horror Interactive Show, becoming a point and click adventure.</p>

<p>The Rocky Horror Show Video Game is set to be released for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC via Steam, and Switch.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-delayed-rollback-netcode</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-delayed-to-next-year-for-rollback-netcode.996216/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-delayed-rollback-netcode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arc System Works has announced a&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>delay, but it's not for the usual "adding extra polish" reasons; rather, it's for something about which the fighting game community will doubtless be pleased.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ArcSystemWorksU/status/1840633550695231793" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Arc System Works says <i>Nen x Impact&nbsp;</i>has been delayed beyond 2024, and that it will now release sometime in 2025, with no more specific release date forthcoming right now.</p>
<p>The delay has been put into effect so that the publisher, as well as developer Eighting, can implement rollback netcode into the game. It's a feature that has appeared in other Arc System Works games, so its inclusion here makes sense as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-delayed-fight.jpg?itok=G5K3xq8f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-delayed-fight.jpg?itok=xUz3N5qd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>may have been delayed, but it's for a good reason.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're unfamiliar, rollback netcode is essentially a way by which developers minimize lag and bad connections in online fighting games.</p>
<p>I won't go into the technicalities here, but suffice it to say that fighting games with rollback netcode are generally better-appreciated by their communities than those without. There's a good reason the&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros&nbsp;</em>community <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smash-ultimate-rollback-netcode-mod-in-development">wanted to work on a rollback mod</a> for the game.</p>
<p>Fighting games that have embraced rollback netcode include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-fighterz-rollback-netcode-and-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-versions-coming-very"><em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guilty-gear-xrd-rev-2-rollback-netcode-confirmed"><em>Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blazblue-cross-tag-battle-rollback-netcode-coming-in-april"><em>BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle</em></a>, all of which were developed or co-developed by Arc System Works itself.</p>
<p>Other rollback netcode converts that aren't Arc System Works games include&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-rollback-netcode-will-be-better-open-worlds-detailed">Street Fighter 6</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/will-tekken-8-have-crossplay-and-rollback-netcode-katsuhiro-harada-responds"><em>Tekken 8</em></a>. It's clear, then, that rollback netcode is a big deal for the fighting game community.</p>

<p><em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>is, according to Arc System Works, the first "full-fledged" fighting game to be based on the popular anime and manga&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter</em>.</p>
<p>It's a three-on-three fighter in which iconic characters from&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter&nbsp;</em>duke it out with one another, and it'll be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456420/HUNTERxHUNTER_NENxIMPACT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007325" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Nintendo Switch sometime next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>
