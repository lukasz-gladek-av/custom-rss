			<p>On top of <strong>Ubisoft</strong> being under fire from all sides after its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">recent "<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>" announcement</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/enough-is-enough-ubisoft-worker-unions-call-for-strike-in-response-to-layoffs-and-mandatory-rto/">its <strong>workers planning to strike</strong></a>, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">share price dropping to historic lows</a>, and upsetting its fans by cancelling projects like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong>, the studio's social media team has seemingly gone out of its way to cause more confusion and unrest in players with a bit of an odd response to a new leak regarding the heavily-rumored <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>.</p>



<p>There have been several leaks regarding the Black Flag remake, the most recent of which (prior to today's leak) revealed the remake's supposed title: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a><em>.</em></strong> That was a result of a PEGI rating, which, compared to the new leak, is arguably a bigger deal than what we have now.</p>



<p>Today's leak came in the form of a new statue figurine for <strong>Edward Kenway</strong>, the protagonist of Assassin's Creed IV. The statue was shared online by <a href="https://x.com/TheRealZephryss/status/2016172983551984100">a user on X (formerly Twitter)</a> after being spotted on resale platform <strong>Vinted</strong>, where a seller identified it as a new figure that would be out later this year.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this leak doesn't do much beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-major-changes-rumor/">adding to the pile of leaks</a> we've already seen, which have really only proven <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">that we can expect the remake to arrive eventually</a>. The current buzz is that the statue is that it's actually what'll be included in the Collector's Edition of the remake. However, for some reason, the leaked statue has prompted a direct response from the <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252">official Assassin's Creed account on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ubisoft's social media team employed the classic Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas "<em>Ah s***, here we go again</em>" meme as its way of responding to the leak. Now, this can of course be taken positively, as if it's Ubisoft providing a soft confirmation that the remake is happening and that we're about to "<em>go again</em>" with Edward Kenway's journey.</p>



<p>But instead of Assassin's Creed fans replying with excitement to a soft unofficial confirmation, the reply has brought more ire towards Ubisoft, with multiple replies from users immediately taking the negative approach, with one saying, "<em>What? You gonna cancel it like you canceled Sands of Time?</em>"</p>



<p>As to the actual status of the remake, since the project has never been directly confirmed, we can't actually say where it stands. Following the announcement of Ubisoft's restructuring, it was reported that the Black Flag remake was one of the seven projects to get delayed, but that it was not one of the unannounced projects to get cancelled. The only cancelled project we knew about was the Sands of Time Remake, while the others were unannounced. None of the games that got delayed have been officially identified by Ubisoft.</p>



<p>If Ubisoft was even on the verge of thinking about cancelling the Black Flag Remake, then it's likely this reply never gets posted. This is much more likely a soft tease, potentially indicating that we'll get a reveal for the remake sometime soon, even if it has been delayed.</p>



<p>Still, it feels like if there was ever a time to pull back on memes and soft teases, this would be it for Ubisoft,<a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/"> as it is currently under heavy amounts of scrutiny over its restructuring</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Half Sword Have Multiplayer? Co-op & PvP Release Details, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/half-sword-multiplayer-co-op/</link>
            <guid>1418785</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Your life is on the line in Half Sword: Two combatants, two weapons, one winner, and a lot of blood spilled. Half Sword is a combat game designed to unleash the sadistic and barbaric medieval animal in you, and multiplayer or co-op would make it even more of a blood-filled blast.</p>



<p>It may seem hard to believe, but civilization is <em>slightly </em>more civilized than it was a few hundred years ago—even if that is hard to believe. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/half-sword/" id="3509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half Sword</a> takes us back in time to a more open age where duels-to-the-death were as common as bread. It requires two people, but does Half Sword require human or AI opponents?</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-half-sword-in-multiplayer-or-co-op">Can You Play Half Sword In Multiplayer or Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A crushing defeat in more ways than one. Credit to Half Sword Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The white flag needs to be waved on Half Sword co-op or multiplayer for now, with developer Half Sword Games confirming that there is no multiplayer present at the game’s launch.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming will hand it over to the official Half Sword Discord <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1043854763189600337/1272470349245579396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ</a> to clear this one up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We fully understand the appeal of multiplayer and especially PvP. However, we also wish to draw your attention to the fact that physics-based multiplayer on Unreal Engine 5 is as hardcore as it gets as far as development: it is no easy task &amp; Half Sword is our first game. We are focusing on single-player physics right now to build a strong experience aimed at offering hundreds if not thousands of hours of fun.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/half-sword-games/" id="3510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half Sword Games</a> is clearly putting a lot of time and effort into this project, with a view to this being a long-term goal. So, while there’s no multiplayer at launch, it’s not being ruled out.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-sword-multiplayer-release-date">Half Sword Multiplayer Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>According to the developer, a “polished multiplayer experience” is the long-term goal for Half Sword.</strong></p>



<p>The core focus is on single-player. Despite this being a game tailor-made for two real people, the physics and enormity of the gameplay mean a lot more work is needed to ensure a stable base.</p>



<p>The FAQ says: “Are we able to offer multiplayer at release: highly unlikely. Will we do our utmost to provide multiplayer after release: more likely.”</p>



<p>It does seem like Half Sword is destined for multiplayer, doesn’t it? There’s still plenty to enjoy, even if it is only a single-player game for now. Is a lack of multiplayer a dealbreaker?

            <title><![CDATA[Kingdom Come: Deliverance PS5 Upgrade Revealed by PlayStation Store]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-ps5-upgrade-revealed/</link>
            <guid>1418782</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The PlayStation Store was recently updated with a new production description for Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and it unveils something fans have been curious about for a while. It points to a PS5 upgrade being released <strong>soon </strong>for the sensational medieval RPG, which will include 4K resolutions, a boosted framerate, and high-resolution textures.</p>



<p>This follows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-upgrade-could-come/">a rumor that surfaced</a> in October 2025 suggesting that such an upgrade would emerge early in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-kcd-is-getting-the-upgrade-treatment">KCD is Getting the Upgrade Treatment</h2>



<p>Last year, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II was released by Warhorse Studios, several years after the first game spawned off the back of a successful Kickstarter project. The sequel was a mindblowing title, bursting with cinematic storytelling, authentic combat sequences, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-kingdom-comes-tom-mckay-labels-game-success-a-fever-dream/">some of the best acting</a> we’ve seen in a hot minute in the gaming space.</p>



<p>Following in the footsteps of that delivery, the first title, released in 2018, appears to be getting a current-gen upgrade, thanks to the PlayStation Store.</p>



<p>It was recently discovered that <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/227410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a PS5 upgrade</a> is incoming for the nearly eight-year-old medieval RPG. On the game’s PS Store page, the product description was recently updated to include:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The PS5 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance now features graphical updates including 4K resolution, improved framerate, high-resolution textures and many more. Medieval Bohemia has never been so beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/RinoTheBouncer/status/2016556945323262317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rino</a> for the spot</em>)</p>



<p>It’s a safe bet it’ll also land on Xbox, of course.</p>



<p>It’s probably a stock-standard upgrade, and it’s not the re-release that some were hoping for, but that doesn’t take anything away from the thing. Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a masterful title that simply must be experienced, as it opens the door to the adventure that is Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, which is worth every one of the <strong>many </strong>hours you’ll sink into it.</p>



<p>That’s what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">our full review</a> said about it, anyway.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to exploring a potential PS5 upgrade for Kingdom Come: Deliverance? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition - A Cracking Superhero Caper, With Some Naughty Bits Covered Up]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition</link>
            <guid>1418752</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>As a big old superhero nerd and a fan of Telltale's narrative adventure games of old, it's fair to say that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> piqued my interest when it made its episodic arrival on PC and PS5 last year. Still, I took a punt and held back on purchasing because it simply had to be coming to Switch at some point in the future. Well, Jim of the past, come to Switch consoles it has.</p>
<p>Coming from AdHoc Studio, formed by four former Telltale employees in 2018 in the hopes of capturing the episodic magic they had with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/walking_dead_the_complete_first_season">The Walking Dead</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/wolf_among_us">The Wolf Among Us</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_from_the_borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a>, Dispatch drew me in with top-notch writing, stellar voice work and a visual style that'd look right at home in an animated TV drama and didn't let me go until I reached its 'season finale'. It's not going to pick up any prizes in the gameplay department, but Dispatch is every bit as wonderful on Switch 2 as I hoped it would be.</p>
<figure><a title="Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161584/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game follows Robert Robertson, aka Mecha Man, an Iron Man-type man-in-a-suit (bar the billion-dollar backing) who, after his robo-suit is dramatically ripped from his clutches, is offered the chance to lead a rag-tag band of villains-on-the-mend at the Superhero Dispatch Network.</p>
<p>Right from the jump, you'll notice a fair few influences. There are shades of the 'super hero loses his powers' trope we've seen countless times before, and the team of reformed villains, the 'Z-Team', naturally brings the likes of <strong>Suicide Squad</strong> or <strong>Thunderbolts</strong> to mind. There's also more than a touch of <strong>Invincible</strong> in some of the visual stylings and adult themes. But through all of that noise, Dispatch manages to feel fresh.</p>
<p>It's only right I shout out the writing first, because this script <em>rules</em>. The quips and sight gags kept me giggling throughout, but damn, I did not expect these characters to get half as much development as they do. Folks were quickly drawn to the heroes' undeniable good looks at launch (in fairness, they are <em>all</em> outrageously sexy), but it's their personalities — their growth as people, not just heroes — that make them far more interesting than a set of chiselled abs.</p>
<figure><a title="Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161587/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Take Chase, Robert's childhood babysitter, whose super-speed abilities have sped up his ageing process, rendering him an old man before hitting 40. He's as potty-mouthed as anyone — if the 18+ age rating wasn't enough of a giveaway, this is not a game for little ears — but underneath that rough exterior, there's a real sense of pain and fear of reaching a premature expiration date.</p>
<p>Across all eight episodes, I became equally attached to Invisigirl and she struggled to put her past behind her, Phenomaman and his post-break-up spiralling, and Blonde Blazer with her desire to do right, regardless of the cost. If it sounds rather grown-up, that's because it is.</p>
<p>Select cartoon superhero media like Invincible or 2019's <strong>Harley Quinn</strong> have juxtaposed child-friendly visuals with gore, sex and swearing, and Dispatch similarly wears its convention-defiance on its sleeve. Indeed, the first episode wastes no time dropping some f-bombs, discussing dead dads and throwing some full-frontal in there for good measure.</p>
<figure><a title="Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161585/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Switch 2 version mostly stays true to this edgy vision, with some caveats which might water down the experience for some. The 'Visual Censorship' setting from the PS5 and PC release — which gives you the option to cover any rude bits with an obnoxious censor bar — isn't present here. From private parts to middle fingers, everything is <em>automatically</em> covered with no option to remove. A particularly steamy scene at the start of episode four also takes place in complete silence, whether you have the 'Profanity Censorship' toggle on or not.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't think this takes anything away from the experience; the scenes still exist, just with a few strange bars with often-hilarious placements, but it's odd that we can't choose to remove the restrictions. I reached out to AdHoc to ask why the setting had been removed and was told the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually. For our Switch release, we worked with Nintendo to adapt certain elements so Dispatch could be on their platform.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, the writing was on the wall for this one all along (we noted the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/censored-dispatch-artwork-spotted-on-nintendos-digital-storefront">game's 'censored' eShop artwork</a> back in December). Yet, if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>'s *<em>ahem</em>* <em>detailed</em> character customisation can slip through uncensored, I don't understand why Dispatch is forced to make omissions.</p>
<figure><a title="Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161586/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The plot remains untouched, mind you, which is great, because my love of the characters is the driving force behind my decision-making. Much like the team's back catalogue, Dispatch lives and dies on its dialogue trees. Some options are inconsequential, but the vast majority are met with a little message in the top corner of the screen as a reminder that my choice, good or bad, will have consequences.</p>
<p>I've played the game through twice now, intentionally making different choices on my second playthrough to see just how much sway they held. Certain story beats are set in stone, but I was pleased to see just how much influence I held over the journey; even the less important decisions rewarded me with some cracking unique dialogue for taking the path less travelled.</p>
<p>That dialogue really sings thanks to one of the most stacked voice casts in recent memory. Everyone from Hollywood big hitters like Aaron Paul (<strong>Breaking Bad</strong>, <strong>BoJack Horseman</strong>) and Jeffrey Wright (<strong>Boardwalk Empire</strong>, <strong>Westworld</strong>), to YouTube stars <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@penguinz0">MoistCr1TiKaL</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jacksepticeye">jacksepticeye</a> is involved. The immensely popular D&amp;D wizards at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@criticalrole">Critical Role</a> — Laura Bailey, Travis Willingham and Matt Mercer — are also part of the cast.</p>
<figure><a title="Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161590/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In short, you won't be bored during the cutscenes. And that's good, because Dispatch has a <em>lot</em> of them. Dialogue tree cinematics are broken up by your dispatching work at the SDN offices, where the game turns into something vaguely reminiscent of a management sim. Calls come in with different skill requirements, and it's up to you to pick the right hero for the job.</p>
<p>Successfully completing jobs lets you enhance your heroes' skills to have more control over the situations you're putting them in, and you can even train them to learn unique abilities. I soon began to mould the team to my liking, utilising unlocked skills rather than base abilities to answer more calls and shift the odds in my favour. Suffice to say, I became far more engaged in the call-outs' tactics than I expected.</p>
<p>Dispatching heroes with controller inputs is a little fiddly and feels more suited to a mouse and keyboard — Mouse Mode is not available in the Switch 2 version — but I soon settled into the rhythms of using the D-pad to select a call/hero. Luckily, touch controls have been implemented for handheld play, which is a nice touch.</p>
<figure><a title="Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161591/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Short 'hacking' minigames also appear while Robert is on call, tasking him with moving through a virtual maze without being caught/timed out. While it lacks the depth of the hero management side, it was a welcome change whenever I got tired of comparing the team's mobility and vigour.</p>
<p>But the beautifully animated story sequences are the real meat here. You can opt to play in either 'Cinematic' or 'Interactive' modes, the latter of which includes some mostly-pointless quick-time events for you to input in select combat sequences. It's a fine enough way of breaking up the watching, if that's your cup of tea, but I quickly turned them off to just watch the action play out instead. After all, how often can you say that you've 'binged' a game?</p>
<p>And just as a final brief note on performance, it all plays swimmingly on Switch 2. I wouldn't expect something like this to be too demanding on Nintendo's latest, of course, but a stable 60fps went a long way to convincing me that I was tucking into a juicy TV show.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thanks to the sublime writing, fantastic voiceovers, and a level of animation you'd usually expect from a big-budget streaming series, Dispatch is the kind of superhero drama that draws you in with the sexy characters and funny one-liners, and hooks you until the bitter end with the potential of its ever-changing arcs.</p>
<p>The lack of any visual censorship options on Switch is a strange one, and some will undoubtedly find things lacking in the gameplay department, but I'm already gearing myself up for a potential 'season 2'. It won't be for everyone, but if you're like me and it clicks, it <em>really</em> clicks. Is it too soon for a 'rewatch'?</p></section>

            <p>An Assassin's Creed level designer has claimed that Ubisoft have put him on unpaid disciplinary leave for speaking out publicly against the company’s recently introduced requirement that staff return to the office full-time.</p>
<p>The level designer in question is David Michaud-Cromp, team lead for level design on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> (which is cited on his LinkedIn with its older “Codename Red” working title). He started at Ubisoft Montreal in 2012, working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>, and also has credits on the best-selling Assassin's Creed Valhalla and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/watch-dogs-legion">Watch Dogs Legion</a>.</p>
<p>The backstory: last week, Ubisoft announced that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">cancelling a load of games</a> and laying off staff in the course of transforming themselves into the New Hotness with funding from Tencent. They also announced that they would no longer allow hybrid or remote working, with staff receiving a yearly allowance of work from home days, instead. An executive commented that “the one and only objective [for the new RTO policy] is to enhance collective efficiency, to drive the dynamics, the creativity, the sense of belonging.” Unionised Ubisoft developers were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-is-out-of-the-question-to-let-a-boss-run-rampant-ubisoft-workers-strike-against-disastrous-cutbacks">not convinced</a>.</p>
<p>Michaud-Cromp offered his own thoughts on the RTO policy in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7420149620619509761/">a LinkedIn post from 23rd January</a>. "Last week, So... Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office... because they "believe in collaboration"... but c'mon, we're not completely stupid... we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office…" he wrote.</p>
<p>The post includes a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D6Tml2ZTCo">a Youtube video</a> from Damon Cassidy, which argues that RTO policies are better understood as “a way to maintain oversight and reinforce traditional hierarchies”, while propping up office real estate prices.</p>
<p>According to Michaud-Cromp, Ubisoft haven’t reacted well to his taking a public stance on RTO, though I’m not sure which specific comments he’s referring to. In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-michaud-cromp-10668035_professional-update-ubisoft-informed-me-today-share-7422041590346661889-7e3C/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAAAsO93UBTZM2evkelLuCJQRZA60kwdEabuQ">a LinkedIn post from yesterday</a>, he writes that: “Ubisoft informed me today of a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension, effective Tomorrow.</p>
<p>“The measure was presented to me as being related to public comments I expressed regarding the company’s return-to-office policy, and based on an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty,” the post continues.</p>
<p>“I am sharing this information for transparency purposes. I take note of the decision and will make no further comment at this time.”</p>
<p>I’ve asked Ubisoft for a statement. I've seen a couple other Ubisoft developers speaking up about the RTO policy and wider cutbacks - in the circumstances, it's probably best not to name them. In other news, Ubisoft are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">proposing up to 200 layoffs</a> at Ubisoft Paris, even as unionised workers ready themselves for another strike.</p>

              <p><span>Streaming PS3 games through <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps-plus-essential-extra-premium-microsoft-xbox-gam-1848722178">PlayStation Plus Premium</a>, Sony’s most expensive subscription tier, has seemingly been busted for at least two weeks now. It’s especially bad timing with <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-fixing-dumb-midnight-release-time-2000663241"><em>Fallout</em> season 2</a> inspiring some PS5 owners to try to revisit the PS3 version of </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Exactly two weeks ago today, one fan on the PS Plus subreddit posted a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qct49v/got_a_problem_with_streaming_on_ps5/"><span>thread titled</span></a><span> “Got a problem with Streaming on PS5.”As they explained, they were unable to boot up 2012’s </span><i><span>Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two</span></i><span> through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud gaming service.</span></p>

 <p><span>After some attempts at troubleshooting, other players in the same thread quickly discovered they were facing the same problem. Every single PS3 cloud streaming game, for seemingly every subscriber, was suddenly refusing to load. No error message, no attempt to boot, nothing. <em>Kotaku</em> just&nbsp;tried to boot up Fallout: New Vegas and other PS3 games from the PS Plus and library menus on PS5 and had the same problem.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>From this point on, dozens more threads detailing the same issue began to crop up on the subreddit. In fact, the issue has become such a problem that, as spotted by </span><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/ps3-game-streaming-still-broken-and-sony-draws-criticism"><i><span>Push Square</span></i></a><span>, moderators have started deleting threads discussing the matter and guiding users towards a single megathread.</span></p>

 <p><span>Players have discovered a few </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qfg98u/workaround_for_streaming_ps3_games_on_ps5/"><span>workarounds</span></a><span> for the issue, such as booting a Cloud Streaming title from their libraries instead of the store, but the fix doesn’t seem to work for everyone, and appears to be temporary for others. As of today, the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qol9xu/comment/o228w5a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>top comment</span></a><span> on the moderator-created PS+ Criticism Thread claims the issue still hasn’t been fixed. “Insane this had been broken for nearly 2 weeks and no comms or fix,” reads one reply.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some fans </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qj3zs5/contacted_support_about_the_streaming_and_this_is/"><span>have opted</span></a><span> to pester PlayStation Support for answers. One member of the support team reportedly confirmed that Sony is aware of the problem, stating that the “issue only impacts PS3 titles within the Classic Catalog.” But there’s still no explanation of what’s causing the problem and when it might be fixed. Sony didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sony-interactive-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> has announced the free games coming for PlayStation Plus members in February. As per usual, the games will be available for all active PlayStation Plus subscribers.</p>



<p>Starting on February 3, members will <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/28/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-undisputed-subnautica-below-zero-ultros-ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have four games</a> from different genres to add to their library. </p>







<p>The headline game in February will be <strong>Undisputed</strong> from Steel City Interactive. First <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/undisputed-coming-to-playstation-plus-free-games-in-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported on earlier this week</a>, Undisputed joins the catalog roughly 15 months after it’s 1.0 release. </p>



<p>Also coming is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival</a> action-adventure game <strong>Subnautica: Below Zero</strong>, science fiction title <strong>Ultros</strong>, and the combat flight game <strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong>.</p>







<p>As mentioned, the games will be available starting February 3 until March 2. Simply adding them to your library will give you continued access to install them when you want, as long as you have an active subscription.</p>



<p>If you haven’t yet, you have until February 2 to add January’s free games to your library. Those games include Need For Speed: Unbound, Disney’s Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, and Core Keeper. Again, you don’t have to download them right away to add them to your account. </p>

<p>AMD has released three distinct generations of its 3D V-Cache technology, which initially appeared in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/04/review-ryzen-7-5800x3d-is-an-interesting-tech-demo-thats-hard-to-recommend/">Ryzen 7 5800X3D</a> in 2022. The kernel of the idea has remained the same throughout AMD’s efforts: take an existing desktop processor design and graft 64MB of additional L3 cache onto it.</p>
<p>This approach disproportionately helps apps that benefit from more cache, particularly games, and the size of the boost that 3D V-Cache gives to game performance has always been enough to offset any downsides these chips have come with. In the four years since the 5800X3D was released, AMD also has steadily chipped away at those disadvantages, adding more CPU cores, improving power consumption and temperatures, and re-adding the typical Ryzen range of overclocking controls.</p>
<p>AMD’s new Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which launches for $499 starting tomorrow, is the very definition of a mild upgrade. It’s the year-old Ryzen 7 9800X3D but with an extra 400 MHz of turbo boost speed. That’s it. That’s the chip.</p>
<p>But it is mildly interesting that the 9800X3D’s 5.6GHz boost clock is now 100 MHz&nbsp;<em>higher</em> than that of the Ryzen 7 9700X, the chip’s nearest non-V-Cache equivalent. It’s not nearly as interesting as an actual new chip, but it does mean AMD has closed the last major functional gap between the V-Cache and non-V-Cache Ryzen chips (the pricing gap remains; the 9700X currently retails for around $329).</p>
<p>It also means that the 9850X3D behaves more like a 9700X in other ways—differences that likely won’t matter to its target audience but which do distinguish it from being “just a faster 9800X3D.”</p>
<h2>Chip recap</h2>
<p>The biggest change AMD made to the Ryzen 9000 version of the X3D chips is that the 3D V-Cache is now stacked underneath the CPU silicon rather than on top. This has the benefit of moving the CPU cores closer to your heatsink or AIO loop, making them easier to keep cool.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The 9850X3D remains an eight-core chip based on AMD’s Zen 5 architecture. All eight of those CPU cores have access to the 3D V-Cache, unlike the 12-core and 16-core Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 9950X3D. In each of those chips, one of the CPU chiplets has access to the 3D V-Cache and one doesn’t; AMD’s chipset software is responsible for making sure apps run on the type of CPU core that will maximize the app’s performance. AMD’s software is pretty good at this, but it’s not foolproof, which can make the 9800X3D and 9850X3D more appealing and cost-effective options for PCs that will mainly be used for gaming.</p>

<p>The specs in our CPU testbed are the same as they’ve been for a while. We’ll be focused on comparing the 9850X3D to its predecessors, the 5800X3D, 7800X3D, and 9800X3D, as well as the non-V-Cache 7700X and 9700X. We’ll also include numbers from the higher-end 9900X3D and 9950X3D. Intel’s side of the fence will be represented by the Core Ultra 9 285K and the last few generations of Core i9 chips, though Intel has yet to release any chips that are truly performance-competitive with the 3D V-Cache chips in gaming workloads.</p>
<p>Though our testbed continues to rely on DDR5-6000, AMD’s slide deck takes the current (horrible) state of the RAM market into account. While DDR5-6000 or DDR5-6400 is generally still the performance sweet spot for all socket AM5 CPUs, AMD notes that game performance between the 9850X3D with DDR5-6000 and the same chip with DDR5-4800 can be as little as 1 to 2 percent. In other words, pair whatever RAM you can find with this chip and don’t worry about it too much.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<h2>Performance and power consumption</h2>
<p>The first thing to notice about the 9850X3D is that its multi-core performance is essentially indistinguishable from the 9800X3D. If anything, the 9800X3D seems marginally better behaved in our Handbrake video encoding tests, which could come down to anything or nothing—maybe it’s an actual difference between the chips, maybe it’s the silicon lottery, maybe it’s something else. Overall, it’s mostly a wash.</p>


<p>The 9850X3D&nbsp;<em>does</em> improve significantly on the 9800X3D’s single-core performance, closing the gap with both the Ryzen 9900X3D and 9950X3D (both of which have regular Zen 5 cores with no 3D V-Cache) and the 9700X (which has no 3D V-Cache at all).</p>
<p>There’s a world in which AMD can get this extra performance for “free” without changing anything about the architecture or manufacturing process. AMD could have been “binning” silicon lottery winners, or the reliability of the manufacturing process could have improved enough to allow AMD to hit better numbers that weren’t as consistently achievable a year ago.</p>
<p>But it looks like AMD improved the 9850X3D’s single-core performance mainly by making it behave more like a non-X3D chip. The chip’s power consumption while gaming suggests this is more or less what’s happening—the 9850X3D’s CPU package power while gaming is some 25 or 30 W higher than the 9800X3D playing the same games, despite the single-digit-at-best performance improvement (in both our testing and AMD’s advertising).</p>



<p>While the 9850X3D’s power consumption while gaming isn’t wildly out of step with the 9700X’s or the 9950X3D’s, it does make the tiny performance gains on display here hard to get excited about.</p>
<p>And this is on top of the cost trade-off you’re already making when you buy an X3D-series chip. Game performance is always impressive, but you notice those benefits the <em>most</em> in situations where your CPU, not the GPU, is the performance bottleneck.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Most of the time in a gaming PC, that’s only going to be the case when you’re trying to play games at extremely high frame rates at lower resolutions. It’s less useful when trying to play games at 4K or even 1440p, where your graphics card will be the limiter. If you’re building a system around any GPU slower than an RTX 4080 or 5080, going with a regular 9700X and putting the savings toward your GPU (or toward an eye-wateringly expensive RAM kit) will usually be a better use of funds.</p>
<h2>Probably not worth it</h2>
<p>The Ryzen 7 9850X3D mostly does what it says it does: It’s a mild speed bump to AMD’s best gaming processor that, in most cases, very slightly extends the company’s performance lead over Intel chips like the Core Ultra 9 285K.</p>
<p>But the vanilla 9800X3D is&nbsp;<em>almost</em> as fast, uses 25 or 30 W less power during gaming (which also results in temperatures that are 10° to 15° Celsius cooler), and is $30 cheaper as of this writing.</p>
<p>As someone who routinely runs his own Ryzen desktop chips in Eco Mode to reduce power consumption and temperatures and hit a more efficient spot on the performance-per-Watt curve, the numbers that the 9850X3D posted in our testing make it seem like an undesirable trade-off, even if you’re in the target market for a fast-as-possible, money’s-no-object, bragging-rights gaming PC.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Faster than the 9800X3D most of the time, particularly in single-threaded tasks.</li>
<li>AMD has steadily closed all of the performance gaps that used to exist between the X3D series and the non-3D-V-Cache Ryzen chips.</li>
<li>Power consumption and temperatures are generally reasonable and in line with other Zen 5 CPUs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>The price of RAM. The price of GPUs. The price of SSDs. It’s a decent time to be looking at a drop-in CPU upgrade; it’s a miserable time to be changing sockets or building a new system from scratch.</li>
<li>The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is a bit cheaper, is nearly as fast, and is cooler-running and more efficient when gaming.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>In exchange for a high-single-digit performance gain, games and some other single-core workloads can use as much as 30 or 40 percent more power.</li>
</ul>

            <p>AdHoc's brilliant superhero workplace comedy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, is gearing up for its debut on Switch later today, however there will be some censorship differences on Nintendo's consoles.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Dispatch includes a number of instances where players can see human (or, well, super-human) anatomy such as penises and breasts throughout its various chapters. Meanwhile, there are certain noises that suggest sexual pleasure. </p>

<p>In other versions of the game as it appears on other platforms, there is an option for players to have toggle censorship of this content on or off, however on the Switch version of the title, players will not have that same choice: explicit content censorship is implemented as standard, and the option has been removed from the game.</p>
<p>"Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually," AdHoc said in a statement shared with Eurogamer, ahead of Dispatch's Switch release. The studio assured, though, that the censorship on Nintendo's consoles does not affect Dispatch's overall narrative experience or gameplay.</p>
<p>"We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release," the developer stated. </p>

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer are big fans of Dispatch, and we are far from alone. Soon after its initial release last year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p>
<p>For more, our Bertie recently sat down with AdHoc studio co-founders Nick Herman and Pierre Shorette to discuss the team's episodic superhero comedy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">which includes the story of a cut Dispatch Kpop character</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This Baseus Laptop Docking Station uses a single USB-C port on your laptop to turn it into a small docking station for two screens, a wired Ethernet connection, and various accessories. It has a sleek metal bar design with a very short built-in USB-C cable, allowing it to sit along the edge of your desk and expand the number of items you can connect via USB-C. With the dock, you’ll have space to connect two HDMI displays, wired Ethernet, SD and microSD cards, and multiple USB devices via a single USB-C connection, greatly reducing the number of dongles you need.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6923/">For only $38 at Amazon (usually $64), you can purchase this Baseus Laptop Docking Station, which represents a $26 discount, a 41% savings.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6923/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A docking station perfect for connecting all your important devices</h2>
<p>With the two HDMI outputs on the Baseus Laptop Docking Station, you can connect to two monitors with a single USB-C connection, eliminating the need for your laptop screen to carry the entire load. If you wish, you can mirror your primary display onto a larger TV or monitor to increase the size of your display area, or expand your desktop to provide additional space for documents, chat windows, and web browser tabs.</p>
<p>There is an integrated Ethernet port for a reliable wired connection when you experience Wi-Fi issues on your home network, such as heavy traffic or poor signal quality. By running one cable from the dock to your router, you can keep your desk organized while providing your laptop with a consistent, reliable internet connection for downloading, backing up to the cloud, and streaming. There are also three USB ports available, allowing you to keep a keyboard, mouse, flash drive, webcam, etc., plugged into the dock so they are ready whenever you start working at your desk. The integrated SD and microSD card slots make it easier to transfer your photos, video files, and other files without having to dig for another external card reader. Simply insert the card, copy what you need, and remove the card, all without having to reach behind your tower or monitor.</p>



<p>Support for Power Delivery enables the dock to power your laptop via the USB-C connection. This means that if you connect a powerful charger, you can charge your laptop while still using the other ports on the dock to charge other devices.</p>
<p>The aluminum-style housing of the Baseus Laptop Docking Station is designed to be small enough to fit beside your laptop or monitor, creating the appearance of an organic extension of your workspace rather than a large, clunky box. With this dock, you can access nine ports via a single USB-C cable, so you no longer have to deal with the clutter of old, single-function adapters. Since the dock is portable and only requires one USB-C cable, you can easily take it with you wherever you go, whether that is to another meeting room or a different office location. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6923/">At $38 instead of the usual $64 list price, the Baseus Laptop Docking Station is a cheap way to extend your laptop’s capabilities without upgrading.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game</a> is a beat-em-up we've repeatedly gone back to over the years, always wishing there was a bit more meat and fluidity to it. Thankfully, developer (and publisher) Tribute Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/15-years-later-scott-pilgrim-ex-proves-that-torontos-most-problematic-bass-player-has-what-it-takes-to-become-beat-em-up-royalty-in-2025">seem to be delivering exactly that with Scott Pilgrim EX</a>.</p>
<p>Following the release in late 2025 of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, the experienced, retro-inspired <a href="https://tributegames.com/">developer</a> will be dropping this follow-up of sorts to the 2010 classic on 3rd March, 2026. To celebrate the announcement, an all-new, stylish trailer has been shared, and it comes with two more additions to the character roster:</p> <figure>
<p>

<p>League of Evil Exes' Matthew Patel and Robot-01, a creation of the Katayanagi Twins, are joining the fight. The former mixes fire and "ritualistic showmanship" as seen in other Scott Pilgrim stories while summoning his "demon hipsters" before going for a grand finale with burning finishing moves. As for the robotic addition, it can fly and deliver precise blows with melee attacks and long-range weapons.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/scott-pilgrim-ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a> isn't a direct sequel to previous Scott Pilgrim stories, or at least that's what creator Bryan Lee O'Malley <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScottPilgrim/comments/1lbjf5n/scott_pilgrim_ex_is_not_a_direct_sequel_to_any/">said last year</a> when asked by confused fans. Regardless, we're betting having previous knowledge of the property helps, as the new adventure starts when the members of the Sex Bob-omb band are kidnapped "as the city (of Toronto) is terrorized by demons, vegans, and robots." Scott Pilgrim and Ramona Flowers, plus five allies, lead the effort to save the musicians and the city, with "one final ally" being revealed ahead of launch. Place your bets now.</p>
<p>While physical editions have been teased to come soon, Scott Pilgrim EX will welcome fighters with a digital version only on 3rd March. It'll be hitting PC (Steam), PS4/5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

			<p>Although the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">multiple delays</strong> may have dampened the enthusiasm of some fans, the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> fever is growing each day as we get closer to the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">November 19 launch</a></strong>, as is the thirst for more information on the game. </p>



<p>While more leaks in the coming months are not entirely out of the question, Take-Two is reportedly going to limit them as much as possible by not<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-digital-only-launch/">releasing physical copies of the game at launch</a></strong>. A sensible choice, considering what some crazed fans have attempted to do in the past.</p>



<p>Speaking on X, Reece "Kiwi Talkz" Reilly, who consistently talks with former Rockstar Games employees, <a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/2016319221333164304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2016319221333164304%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=notebookcheck.com"><strong>commented on the possibility of the sixth entry in the series not launching in retail stores</strong></a>. <em>"GTA 6 is going to be the biggest launch in entertainment history and by a wide margin, nothing will ever come close to it," Kiwi Talkz said. "GTA is a way bigger beast now than it was when GTA 5 launched, and I'd bet all my money that this game would leak early if there are physical discs."</em></p>



<p>Surprisingly enough, the danger of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">copies getting into the hands of players a few days earlier</strong> could not be the real reason why Grand Theft Auto 6 may not hit retail stores at launch. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Unfortunately, there are a number of crazy Rockstar fans that would 100% break into retail stores and manufacturing facilities to steal discs, and people on the inside would leak it a</em></span><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">s well,"&nbsp;</em>Kiwi Talkz said. </p>



<p>This prediction is wholly justified.<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"I have heard stories from Rockstar devs over the years of nutty fans trying to get into their buildings to get any info they can from faking IDs to flying drones above windows to try to get images/video,"</em> Kiwi Talkz added. Talk about emulating your favorite video game characters!</p>



<p>As <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"people are breaking into card stores to steal Pokémon Cards because of the hype and demand"</em>, as X user <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/Phischer/status/2016334510795981108"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Phischer Stanley highlighted,</strong></a> it really wouldn't be surprising to see <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">crazed fans pull an illegal stunt</strong> to get that coveted early look at <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em>. And it wouldn't even be unprecedented either: back in 2023, some <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-leaker-review/">very early copies of Starfield illicitly got into the hands of people</a></strong> who did not hesitate to share more on the game before its launch.</p>



<p>Whether it’s flying drones or faking IDs, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">extreme lengths</strong> some fans are willing to go for a glimpse of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> proves that this isn't just a game launch. If Take-Two does indeed go with a digital-first strategy, it could mark a historic turning point for the industry, indicating that the risk of leaks may outweigh the rewards of a retail presence.</p>

			<p>If you've been having trouble trying to play one of <strong>Embark Studios</strong> popular multiplayer titles, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-the-finals-season-9-dragon-rising/">The Finals</a></strong>, then you're not alone, as the studio has confirmed via the official ARC Raiders Discord server (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-and-the-finals-hit-by-coordinated-ddos-attacks">Eurogamer</a>) that both games are suffering from "<em>extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks</em>."</p>



<p>The game's community manager, <strong>Ossen</strong>, shared the following message earlier on Wednesday, with players in the server to confirm they are aware of the attack and that the studio is currently working to fight it.</p>



<p>"<em>Hey Raiders, both ARC Raiders and THE FINALS have been under extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks</em>. <em>The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress - but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing</em>." </p>



<p>The good news is that the latest update from Ossen, which was shared within the last hour states "<em>We are noticing that servers are recovering. Thanks for your patience and please let us know if you notice any more issues</em>." It has not been made clear, however, whether Embark Studios has resolved the issue entirely, so you could still experience issues when trying to log in for either game.</p>



<p>That said, the ARC Raiders Discord server is the only place Embark has addressed the issue, and the lack of a post on any of its other social media channels does seem to indicate that the issue is either close to being resolved, or has been resolved, since the team at Embark doesn't seem to deem it necessary to make players who may not be in the ARC Raiders Discord server aware of the situation.</p>



<p>If you want more signs that things are improving, you can also look to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">the SteamDB concurrent player numbers for ARC Raiders</a>, which did drop to the lowest point the game has seen since it launched, but has since begun to rise back to its usual activity. That said, ARC Raiders' lowest point since launch was still above <strong>100K</strong> concurrent players, proving that not even a DDoS attack can bring the popular extraction shooter below six figures of concurrent players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> PC player and you're sick of the game's poor performance on your rig, Capcom may have the answer to your prayers, and the studio has confirmed an enterprising player's theory about the source of some of the issues as well.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on Steam, Capcom says it's released a patch for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>that includes "optimization improvements for Steam-specific processes and options to reduce processing load", so your machine should have an easier time running the game now.</p><p>Capcom points to a CPU load issue caused by "claimed content status check processes" intended to notify players if unclaimed content is waiting for them, which confirms the results of an experiment performed by a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>player <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-poor-pc-performance-dlc-check-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22239c1b-456a-474c-ab0c-9209f9d66e0c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">earlier this month</a>.</p><p>According to Capcom, this problem should only cause <em>Wilds</em>' FPS to drop "in the Base Camp and Grand Hub", and how much DLC you own doesn't matter; if you have any unclaimed DLC at all, you may run into the issue.</p><p>More improvements and optimizations are planned for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, too; in February, another patch will arrive that aims to "reduce GPU processing load by adding quality levels (LOD) to the polygon mesh for 3D models".</p><p>In case you're wondering, LOD stands for "level of detail", and, as you can imagine, it refers to the amount of complexity in the detail of 3D models for characters and other assets.</p><p>Remarkably, Capcom says this solution would involve "swapping to low-resolution models for objects farther away from the camera", which implies that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>doesn't already do this. That would probably go some way towards explaining some of the FPS issues experienced by PC players. Yikes.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and its latest update can be downloaded right now on PC.

"The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress - but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing.</p>
<p>"Additionally, the team is also working on a hotfix which will solve some of the issues and unintended changes introduced in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-update-rips-out-one-of-the-games-most-maddening-puzzles">yesterday's update</a>, we hope to have that available later today. We'll update you all on progress as we have more information to share!"</p>
<p>Since that point, Embark have pushed the hotfix live, fixing bugs which were reducing guns' rates of fire and slowing down looting. Their <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1107589599045361695/1107613897357275188/1466080648522498190">latest post</a> as of writing reads: "We are noticing that servers are recovering. Thanks for your patience and please let us know if you notice any more issues."</p><p>So, judging by that, the situation should now be on the mend if you're hoping to jump into a match later today. Naturally, there's no word yet as to the source of such attacks, which come just after the deployment of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-asks-whether-extra-xp-is-enough-to-go-solo-in-a-group-lobby">Headwinds update</a>. It's typical, isn't it. The ice of winter thaws, and boom, a swirling storm of server issues slides right in. </p>
<p>How are you supposed to check out the extra birds Embark say they've added to the Buried City map? Hang on, maybe the DDoSing's down to some Dusky Tits and Dark-rumped Swifts deciding they'd rather not have their nests nicked from.</p>

              <p>It’s 2026, and if you’re still dealing with dead zones around your home and not getting the internet speeds you’re paying each month for, it’s time for an upgrade. A mesh WiFi system can help provide high-speed, whole-home internet coverage without paying for a full overhaul.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6922/">Right now, Amazon has knocked the 4-pack eero 6+ mesh Wi-Fi system by 32%, which brings its price down to just $300 – that’s after an impressive savings of $140.</a> The offer is open to both Prime and non-Prime shoppers, plus there are no delivery charges to worry about. The offer is selling out fast, so it’s best to place your orders before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6922/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Coverage</h2>
<p>The eero 6+ mesh Wi-Fi system is Amazon’s most affordable gigabit system ever. It supports wifi speeds up to a gigabit, and is even backward compatible with previous-generation eero devices. The system uses eero’s patented TrueMesh technology that automatically routes traffic to reduce drop-offs and dead spots, letting you experience consistent speeds in up to 4,500 sq. ft.</p>
<p>It uses Wi-Fi 6 to increase your internet efficiency and reduce network congestion. There’s enough bandwidth for the whole family to work, stream, and video chat. This system comfortably supports over 75 devices, so whether you want to catch up on your favorite show in the bedroom, download the latest gaming title on your PC, and hop on a call with friends on a tablet at the same time, you won’t have to deal with slowdowns. Connect all your important devices around the house without feeling limited. Basically, it’s great for working and studying from home, plus casual use.</p>



<p>Getting started is surprisingly straightforward. You just need to download the eero app on your smartphone, which guides you through setup and allows you to manage your network from anywhere remotely. Once you’ve plugged in your eero devices, your Wi-Fi will automatically optimize for your space with TrueMesh.</p>
<p>On a regular day, you’d pay around $440 to enjoy the stability and performance this 4-pack system offers.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6922/"> The current 32% discount, however, lets you upgrade and bring one home for just $300 today.</a> This limited-time (and rare) offer is selling out fast, though. If you’re finally ready to say goodbye to slow internet speeds and dead zones, now is the time to make the move. We suggest getting your orders without wasting much time, as discounts this good don’t stick around for long. That said, now is also a good time to grab some other connectivity essentials, as we’re spotting quite a lot of highly rated accessories going for less.</p>

<p>Reigns: The Witcher by Nerial and Devolver Digital releases for iOS, Android, Mac, and PC on February 25, 2026. </p>



<p>In recent days, we have been hearing a lot about the current and upcoming instalments of The Witcher series, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-will-receive-a-new-dlc-in-may-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumoured expansion</a> for The Witcher 3 and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-could-spend-up-to-800-million-on-the-witcher-4-its-estimated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development and marketing budgets</a> for The Witcher 4. However, today we aren’t talking about any of these titles, but a spinoff within a choice-based title, Reigns. </p>







<h2 id="h-reigns-the-witcher-release-date-set-for-february-2026">Reigns: The Witcher Release Date Set for February 2026</h2>



<p>Nerial and Devolver Digital have teamed up with CD Projekt Red to introduce a new spinoff titled Reigns: The Witcher, as announced in the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9it7oMf0l00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer</a>. This game will incorporate Reigns’ signature decision-driven gameplay into The Witcher universe, featuring Geralt of Rivia as he navigates the ballads of Dandelion. Players will have the opportunity to explore a unique narrative experience, making choices that may involve running a hot bath instead of slaying monsters.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The game will also feature beloved characters from the series, including Yennefer, Triss, and Vesemir. Players can look forward to numerous combat mini-games, where Geralt will face off against familiar foes such as ghouls and rotfiends. Ultimately, the decisions made throughout the game will have significant consequences; a wrong choice could provoke the mages, while the right choice could earn you respect among the nobles.</p>







<p>In other news, The Witcher 3’s rumoured expansion could take players to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3s-rumoured-expansion-could-take-players-to-a-new-region/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new region</a>. Additionally, Netflix’s live-action adaptation will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflixs-the-witcher-series-will-end-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conclude in 2026</a>.
