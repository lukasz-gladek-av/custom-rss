			<p>First posted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com.cn/assassins-creed-codename-red/51099/video/ci-ke-xin-tiao-ying-kai-fa-zhe-ri-zhi-di-er-ji" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN China</a>, a new dev diary has surfaced online and showcases some of the gameplay in the upcoming game Assassin's Creed Shadows. The footage is just under five minutes long and shows off the dynamic world that players can expect to dive into when the game releases. Considering the popularity of the site that posted the footage, it's likely that the dev diary will very quickly be taken down. More and more leaks about the upcoming Assassin's Creed game continue to surface, including ones recently speaking about some of the features that will be included in the game. The features include a dynamic weather system, which will affect the gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: World Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zKua34QXhMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For example, when it is raining in-game, it means that enemies won't be able to hear your movements, as they will be muffled by the rainfall. Alternatively, if you have to cross a large body of water, you may have to find that you wait until winter, when the water will be frozen over, and you can traverse the ice.</p>
<p>The footage shown showcases the new animation style that is being tested out in Assassin's Creed Shadows, hoping to make a more immersive world for those who plan on playing the game. Additionally, players are introduced to their 'Hideout.' It's been described as having one acre of land, where the player will be able to build their base of operations and build something similar to an armory, as well as a dojo and an altar. The buildings will be fully customizable, allowing players to make the buildings look however they want them to, as well as being able to change aspects such as the design of the roof or the color of the walls.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-red-exclusive-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive footage shown to Insider Gaming</a>, they got to get a sneak peek further into the Hideout and what it will entail. It was said to be similar to that of the building in Valhalla, but heavily improved on.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows seems to be shaping up as <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">their most ambitious game yet</a>, despite it being smaller than Valhalla and bigger than Mirage. Assassin's Creed Shadows releases on November 12, 2024. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

In this case, that would be the single best Xbox exclusive of the past five years: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pentiment-review-impressions-obsidian-xbox-gamepass-rpg-1849774671&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pentiment-review-impressions-obsidian-xbox-gamepass-rpg-1849774671"><em>Pentiment</em></a></span>. Maybe the dialogue-heavy 2022 game about solving murders in 16th-century Bavaria isn’t what you were expecting me to say. This was a game that received widespread critical acclaim when it was released but that often goes underappreciated due to its strange premise. But the team behind it should be enough to sell you. <em>Pentiment </em>was developed by a small team at Obsidian Entertainment led by Josh Sawyer, maybe best known as the director of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a></span>. </p><p>The Team at Obsidian is known for creating intricate worlds and stories driven by player choice. That remains true in <em>Pentiment</em>, even if the medieval-inspired 2D aesthetic and lack of a sprawling open world make you think otherwise. In <em>Pentiment</em>, your choices decide not only your fate but also the fate of an entire town over the course of 25 years. It’s a stunning achievement of storytelling thanks to an incredibly fleshed-out network of characters all living their own lives in the midst of the changing times. At ten bucks, it’s a steal during the current sale.</p><p>Of course, if you’d rather grab some big-name franchises like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/every-halo-game-ranked-from-worst-to-best-1848242182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/every-halo-game-ranked-from-worst-to-best-1848242182"><em>Halo</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-xbox-360-split-screen-local-coop-nostalgia-1850753479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-xbox-360-split-screen-local-coop-nostalgia-1850753479"><em>Gears of War</em></a></span>, that’s also an option.

<p>Starting in 2025, all major Fortnite tournaments, including Cash Cups, FNCS and more, will be in Trios mode. This announcement was first revealed at the end of the FNCS Global Championship back at the beginning of this month.</p>

<p>Still, if you are heavily indulged within the Forntite competitive scene, you know that the Battle Royale does not skimp out on prize pools, giving players a large amount of cash to play for each week. It will be interesting to see how the future of Fortnite Cash Cups play out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>A lot of modern board games are highly strategic affairs, that might see you conquering lands for their resources, or trading and optimizing your way to victory with an economic engine of some kind. But if you’re one of the many who thinks that kind of subject matter is dry and boring, and yearns instead for the lure of exploration and adventure, there’s a whole group of games tailor-made just for you – role-playing board games. Like their pen and paper counterparts, they imagine you’re another person in an outlandish setting, where you’ll either compete or cooperate with your fellow players to overcome quests and challenges. But, as board games, they still have plenty of strategic meat to enjoy beneath their narrative exteriors. Here are our top picks for the best RPG board games: any should be good for untold hours of fun in 2024 and beyond. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Top Role-playing Board Games at a Glance</h2></p><div data-cy="catalog-view-trigger"><div><p><h3>Gloomhaven: Jaws of The Lion</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>WizKids Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Temple of Elemental Evil</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>The Witcher: Old World</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Star Wars: Imperial Assault</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>HeroQuest</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>This War of Mine: The Board Game</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Descent: Legends of the Dark</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Mice &amp; Mystics</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Tainted Grail The Fall of Avalon</h3></p></div></div><p>Don't have time for reading blurbs?

But that’s exactly what it is as you step into the shoes of a series of adventurers, working together, with the roster changing through the game’s labyrinthine campaign as protagonists retire or meet a sticky end in a dungeon. Powered by a compelling tactical combat system that sees you gradually building a deck of multi-use ability cards, each scenario a rising tide of tension as your deck runs down. The original game is currently out of stock, but the prequel, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review">Jaws of the Lion we reviewed</a> offers much of the same gameplay chops in a cut-down, more affordable package, while sequel <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frosthaven-board-game-review">Frosthaven</a> (see it at <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjGeLP?object_uuid=d3598ebe-dfd2-4bf5-ade9-144cfd7683be&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>) ups the ante by including an entire town you can explore, build and populate as part of the action. These also make great <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board games</a>, for whenever you find yourself without a game crew.</p></div><p id="dd-temple-of-elemental-evil"><h2 data-toc-title="D&amp;D: Temple of Elemental Evil">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Temple of Elemental Evil</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207640"><div id="207640" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>WizKids Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Temple of Elemental Evil</h3></p></div><p>Role-playing is a pretty amorphous term when it comes to board gaming, but there’s no doubt that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> adventure system series, based on the world’s most popular pen-and-paper RPG, is a fantastic marriage of the two. Each box comes with a huge stack of tiles which you draw at random to create the dungeon, and each tile in turn is peopled with a random selection of traps and monsters that operate according to simple flowchart routines. The result has an astonishing dynamism, conjuring the sense that you’re exploiting a mysterious labyrinth controlled by a dungeon master. This system powers you through an included narrative <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign</a>. They’re all great (see them at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVO17?object_uuid=d3598ebe-dfd2-4bf5-ade9-144cfd7683be&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>), but Temple of Elemental Evil, based on one of D&amp;D’s most famous, old-school scenarios, is perhaps the pick of the bunch.</p><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-dungeons-and-dragons">beginner's guide to Dungeons and Dragons</a> if you're interested in classic D&amp;D gameplay instead.</p></div><p id="the-witcher-old-world"><h2 data-toc-title="The Witcher: Old World">The Witcher: Old World</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207641"><div id="207641" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Witcher: Old World</h3></p></div><p>Let’s further muddy the waters by introducing an acclaimed board game adaptation of an acclaimed <a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-rpgs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">role-playing video game</a>. Rather than filling in another chapter of Geralt’s exploits, Old World is set years before the events of The Witcher video games and novels, casting players as other Witchers, hunting and fighting monsters, and occasionally each other, to see which of their competing styles can earn the most coin and glory. The different styles feed into a compelling game of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building</a> as you seek to create card combos and strategy synergies to boost your power ahead of your rivals, in a race to take down ever more fearsome foes. But there’s a solo mode too, for those who just want to explore this fascinating fantasy world and kill its mythical monsters. See our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-old-world-board-game-review">The Witcher: Old World board game review</a> for more information.</p></div><p id="star-wars-imperial-assault"><h2 data-toc-title="Star Wars: Imperial Assault">Star Wars: Imperial Assault</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207642"><div id="207642" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars: Imperial Assault</h3></p></div><p>Not all role-playing games fit the fantasy archetype, and if you’re a sci-fi fan, you’ll be well-served by this excellent entry that swaps the tombs and traps of its peers for starship interiors and high-tech bases. Set after the events of the original Star Wars film, one player commands the forces of the Empire while the other players work together, controlling a team of plucky Rebel operatives working to undermine the Emperor’s tyrannical rule. The engaging tactical combat system is easily good enough to support one-off scenarios, but the real draw is the game’s campaign, which links a series of battles together into a grand, cinematic narrative, allowing you to fight alongside iconic figures like Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. Many other famous figures from the big screen are available in the game’s huge range of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWdROA?object_uuid=d3598ebe-dfd2-4bf5-ade9-144cfd7683be&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">expansion packs</a>.</p><p>You can check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">best Star Wars board games overall</a> for more like this one.</p></div><p id="heroquest"><h2 data-toc-title="HeroQuest">HeroQuest</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207643"><div id="207643" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>HeroQuest</h3></p></div><p>Older readers may remember this <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon-crawling board game</a> from their childhoods, having originally come out in 1989. Now it’s back with new, improved miniatures, but its RPG-on-a-board approach, complete with games master, is still top of the range. Said GM has a booklet with the scenario secrets while the other players take the role of heroes, exploring the dungeon, which the GM reveals as they round corners and open doors, fighting GM-controlled monsters and looting treasure. It’s still perhaps the closest thing you’ll get to a true role-playing experience, full of mystery, narrative and upgrading your heroes, but with family-weight rules and the tactical chops of a board game. Once you’re done with the campaign in the box, there are plenty of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heroquest-buying-guide">additional HeroQuest expansions</a> crammed with new adventures.</p></div><p id="arkham-horror-the-card-game"><h2 data-toc-title="Arkham Horror: The Card Game">Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207644"><div id="207644" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3></p></div><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">Horror board games</a> are another popular frontier for role-playing, but it’s a hard call for board games because the players need a degree of control to make tactical decisions which, in turn, detracts from the horror. This is the best candidate: based loosely on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, players work together to solve mysterious hauntings and horrid crimes, linked to alien worlds and beings beyond our imaginations. The horror comes both from a challenging difficulty level and the bleak narratives that underpin each adventure, with an ongoing <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDVJYw?object_uuid=d3598ebe-dfd2-4bf5-ade9-144cfd7683be&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">series of expansions</a> spinning the yarn into ever-more surprising places. The strategy, meanwhile, is down to your deck-building skills as you improve your character, and staying atop the statistical probabilities offered by the aptly-named chaos bag.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-journeys-in-m"><h2 data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in M">The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207645"><div id="207645" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth</h3></p></div><p>Given the appeal of fantasy settings in role-playing board games, it’s no surprise that Middle-earth, the setting that arguably popularized the whole idea of fantasy world-building, gets a look-in. The good news is that it’s a great adaptation, nestled comfortably between Tolkien’s famous stories, so it allows players to feel a part of his epic creation without stepping on his narrative beats. The core of the game sees the heroes building card decks to represent their powers and abilities, but it's ably supported by lots of novel ideas. Some of these, like the tile scale-flipping to combine overground and underground exploration, are in cardboard while others make great use of the supporting app, such as solving carefully constructed mysteries based on clues drip-fed by the narrative text.</p><p>You can also check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-roleplaying-review">review of The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying board game</a>, which we also loved.</p></div><p id="this-war-of-mine-the-board-game"><h2 data-toc-title="This War of Mine: The Board Game">This War of Mine: The Board Game</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207646"><div id="207646" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>This War of Mine: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Not all heroes wear capes, so the saying goes, and in This War of Mine, heroism is just desperately trying to keep your friends alive against the odds in a war-torn city. It’s an unusual and powerful setting for a role-playing board game, as it was for the computer RPG that inspired it. During the day, your little band needs to scavenge the resources they need to survive, hoping against hope to find what’s required. At night, you’ll need to barricade your hideout and keep watch for raiders, soldiers and other hostiles who might come for whatever meager scraps you’ve managed to pull together. The mechanics of resource gathering and base-building are supported by a book of narrative text, the whole forming a shocking indictment of the horrors of living in a conflict zone, made personal by the way the board game places you in charge of your survivor’s fate.</p></div><p id="descent-legends-of-the-dark"><h2 data-toc-title="Descent: Legends of the Dark">Descent: Legends of the Dark</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207647"><div id="207647" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Descent: Legends of the Dark</h3></p></div><p>Part of the appeal of having role-playing on a board, rather than a screen on a paper character sheet, is the look and feel of the thing. And in terms of visuals and production values, Descent: Journeys in the Dark is king of the pile with its trays of finely sculpted miniatures and extraordinary three-dimensional cardboard terrain, allowing you to construct swamps and dungeons that pop out of your tabletop in almost magical detail. Thankfully, the game engine underneath all that window dressing is very much up to par, with a supporting mobile app sending your party on a series of quests, complete with narrative and inter-scenario links that see you shepherding the treasures you’ve found to gain access to new powers and equipment. See our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/descent-legends-of-the-dark-review">Descent: Legends of the Dark review</a> for more info.</p></div><p id="mice-mystics"><h2 data-toc-title="Mice &amp; Mystics">Mice &amp; Mystics</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207648"><div id="207648" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Mice &amp; Mystics</h3></p></div><p>Role-playing board games, with their grand tales of adventure and lovely components, are often a magnet <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">for younger players</a>, yet many of them are too long and complex for shorter attention spans. Mice &amp; Mystics aims to bridge the age gap by telling a compelling story of a band of loyal adventurers turned into mice as they try to save a fantasy kingdom from the clutches of a tyrant. They’ll still need to pull what strings they can as they seek to return to human form while thwarting evil and a worrying number of cockroaches. With simple tactical mechanics and lots of whimsical adventure, this is a crowd-pleaser for all ages.</p></div><p id="tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon"><h2 data-toc-title="Tainted Grail The Fall of Avalon">Tainted Grail The Fall of Avalon</h2></p><div catalogid="f49f5eb3-7022-45c4-9059-19c1685ce84f" id="207649"><div id="207649" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tainted Grail The Fall of Avalon</h3></p></div><p>While most role-playing board games focus on their mechanics, Tainted Grail wants to tell an extraordinary story. It heaps Celtic legends on top of its Arthurian base to create a rich world, but one beset by challenge in which your characters must band together in order to survive. Doing so means finding and managing resources in a satisfying strategic puzzle, but the real focus is the colossal, branching, narrative campaign, ably supported by superbly written and plotted text, which has so many different paths that you can play this monster game multiple times and still not see the same tales told. </p><h2>How do RPG Board Games Relate to Tabletop RPGs and Video Game RPGs?</h2><p>“Role-playing game” (RPG for short) as a term began with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, which was the first published ruleset to bring form around an experimental practice of telling narrative, character-based stories using miniature wargame rules. These new creations were distinct enough to need their own term, and role-playing seemed a succinct way to describe the way you inhabited a character very different from your own, in a make-believe world full of challenge and adventure.</p><p>These kinds of games, often differentiated from later types of role-playing by the moniker “pen-and-paper RPGs”, sell themselves on their creative and imaginative potential. The sky isn’t even a limit when it comes to what you and your group can conjure up together. But there’s no denying that a lot of players also got a lot of satisfaction from manipulating the crunchier bits of the rules – skill checks and tactical movement – and from seeing their characters gain power and advance. Early pen-and-paper RPGs also needed a Games Master to run proceedings, a role which many players were unwilling to fulfil.</p><p>These two factors lead to the creation of board games and video games based on the concept. Either the board and cards or the computer took the place of the Games Master, using either the programmer's imagination or random factors to create a world for the player(s) to explore, while the strategy-minded were satisfied by the lure of levelling up their character and exploiting the game’s mechanics in order to win. </p><p>While role-playing has become an established term for this genre in video gaming, spawning sub-genres such as JRPGs (the J stands for Japanese) and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/top-10-roguelikes">Rogue-likes</a> after one of the earliest computer RPGS, there’s no equivalent term in board gaming. That’s surprising, given that it’s a very popular category in its own right, but the games tend to be referred to as adventure games or quest games rather than role playing. That’s possibly because controlling a plastic avatar on a board, instead of the more immediate gratification of on a screen, divorces players slightly from the action they’re portraying.</p><p>Whatever the reason, this plethora of different terms can be pretty confusing for players, never mind anyone to whom they’re trying to describe their exploits! To make matters worse, there’s intense cross-pollination between these scenes. Dungeons &amp; Dragons has inspired both board- and computer- RPGs some of which have, in turn, been adapted back into material for the role-playing game. Many board game RPGs have spawned computer versions, and many computer RPGs have got the board game treatment. It’s turtles all the way down!</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

A compact USB card adapter is also included. Samsung offers free shipping on both items. Amazon offers free shipping on the 512GB model but if you're not a Prime member, you'll need to get your order total to $25 to get free shipping on the 256GB model. If you want to pick a memory card that performs well and has a reliable track record, then look no further. Samsung is one of the most highly recommended memory card brands and the Pro Plus model is faster than most cards.</p><h2>Samsung Pro Plus Micro SDXC Cards Are on Sale Today</h2><p><em><strong>Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck compatible</strong></em></p><div id="186964" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="c7d5aaab-a796-422e-9a71-e2dca168aa9c"><p><h3>Samsung Pro Plus 512GB Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><div catalogid="c7d5aaab-a796-422e-9a71-e2dca168aa9c" id="207638"><div id="207638" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Samsung Pro Plus 256GB Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><p>If you've started compiling a collection of digital games, you probably already know just how limited the Switch's base storage capacity is.

If bought digitally, those two games alone would take up all of your internal storage on the OG Switch console. There's only one expansion slot in the Switch console so you want to make sure you get the biggest card you can afford, although very few people will need more than 1TB of storage.</p><p>The Samsung Pro Plus series of Micro SDXC cards are compatible with virtually any device that accepts the Micro SDXC card standard. That includes the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, and the ASUS ROG Ally. The Pro Plus is a faster than average Micro SDXC card with a speed rating of U3 / A2 / V30. In terms of actual numbers, the Pro Plus boasts up to 180MBps sustained read speeds and up to 130MBps sustained write speeds. Besides pairing well with your gaming handheld, this card would be an ideal candidate for devices that need fast and high-capacity transfers, like a 4K DSLR or action camera. A USB card reader is also included to make it easy to transfer files to your PC.</p><p><em>Check out all of the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals"><em>best Nintendo Switch deals</em></a><em> for sales on other games and accessories.</em></p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 23, 2024 6:45 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Since then, it has released critical and financial successes like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Remains of Edith Finch </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stray</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially, Interactive was run by Nathan Gary, who then oversaw both Annapurna Pictures and Interactive. An Annapurna spokesperson told IGN the company became "refocused" toward games during his time running both divisions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the outlet, Interactive co-founder James Masi was suddenly let go in mid-March. By this point, Ellison was overseeing Pictures after she'd disappeared for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/megan-ellison-annapurna-scott-rudin-temper-1234951651/">several years,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with sources at the time alleging she would play "mind games" with staff and had several "explosive incidents."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With Masi's exit, Gary was reinstalled as the Interactive head, only to leave shortly thereafter. Annapurna told IGN he chose to leave, but other sources with the outlet alleged he was fired alongside Masi.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interactive staff believed the pair were fired without warning, which reportedly led to "confusion and fury."

As IGN describes it, this new company would oversee all of Interactive's already-signed projects, and be free to make its own separate deals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ownership would've been split between between it and Annapurna's leaders, and the entire Interactive staff was set to to migrate over to Verset.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, Hector Sanchez (an ex-Interactive leader who departed in 2019) was brought on to be Annapurna's new interactive and new media president.

Annapurna insisted to IGN that Gary never gave feedback on legal drafts, and later pushed back against the idea it had backtracked on the deal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After the Verset deal fell through, several sources told IGN Ellison became more involved in Interactive's deals, projects, and budgets, much to their concern.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the end of August, the 25-person Annapurna Interactive team signed a joint resignation letter, then left on September 6.

Annapurna told IGN it had "no time" to contact everyone, while other sources argued there was "no guidance" on who to contact (or when and how).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At time of writing, Verset has a small </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://verset.com/">website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which IGN believes is an indicator the now ex-Interactive staff are starting the venture on their own.

A list ranking the <em>Zelda </em>series is a list of bangers, and even the “worst” entry is better than most other games. So don’t get mad if your favorite is on the lower half of this list, it’s standing alongside some of the all-time greats. That said, let’s rank the mainline <em>Zelda </em>games from worst to best.<br></p></div><div><p><em>Skyward Sword </em>is very much emblematic of its time as a Wii exclusive, and by the time it hit the market in 2011, the world had gotten bored of the system’s motion control premise. For whatever it’s worth, the game is a mostly impressive display of the potential the Wii promised when it launched. It’s the most integrated the Wii’s motion controls felt in a first-party game, and Nintendo had to add an entirely new peripheral with the Wii Motion Plus to pull it off. That being said, it just felt a little too late, and the novelty had worn off. Even with the Wii Motion Plus, <em>Skyward Sword </em>can be spotty with its motion control, to the point where Nintendo opted to tweak its motion mechanics and replicate them with an analog stick on the Switch remaster. It’s an earnest attempt to build motion controls into an established format when <em>Twilight Princess </em>felt like it was bolted onto an established game. But it remains pretty divisive to this day, and that’s why it lands at the bottom of our list.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-breath-of-wild-multiplayer-mod-youtube-nintendo-1850312528&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-breath-of-wild-multiplayer-mod-youtube-nintendo-1850312528">Big <em>Breath Of The Wild</em> YouTuber Hit By Nintendo After Multiplayer Mod</a></span></p></div><div><p>The second <em>Legend of Zelda </em>game has always been a little bit of an oddball. While it does maintain the overhead view in its overworld, <em>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link </em>trades it in for a sidescrolling format that has seen controversy over the years. It feels like a detour from the first game before it gets to <em>Link to the Past</em>, which would go on to perfect much of what the original set out to do. It’s a shame the series hasn’t really revisited these ideas, but it went on to innovate in plenty of other ways as the years went on. It does mean that <em>Zelda II </em>feels like a hypothetical of what the series could have been. Had it not pivoted back into the original direction, would we talk about <em>Zelda </em>alongside sidescrolling greats like <em>Castlevania </em>and <em>Metroid</em>? It’s fun to think about, but we’ll only be able to imagine it.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/11-bad-games-well-defend-mass-effect-andromeda-ps4-1850274471&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/11-bad-games-well-defend-mass-effect-andromeda-ps4-1850274471">11 ‘Bad’ Games We’ll Die Defending</a></span></p></div><div><p>There’s a non-zero chance your feelings on <em>Twilight Princess </em>were largely painted by which system you played it on. The much-anticipated GameCube game ended up being ported to the Wii as a launch title, and if you managed to get your hands on the thing in that first year, you had a pretty different experience just playing the thing with the Wii remote. But whether you were swinging your controller around or playing with the GameCube controller, <em>Twilight Princess </em>is still widely regarded for its darker tone, innovations like the Wolf Link transformation, and for introducing one of the series’ best companion characters in Midna. There’s speculation that the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-theory-zonai-ruins-1850314256&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-theory-zonai-ruins-1850314256">may play into <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>’s lore</a></span>, so perhaps there will be a chance for the game to get a bit of a critical reevaluation in the coming months.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-breath-wild-nintendo-book-free-pdf-guide-switch-1850250206&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-breath-wild-nintendo-book-free-pdf-guide-switch-1850250206"><em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>’s Nice Special Edition Book Is Now Free</a></span></p></div><div><p>As the progenitor of everything that would follow it, the original <em>Legend of Zelda </em>still holds up as a blueprint for the story of Link and Zelda. Compared to all the games it spawned, it’s a minimalistic take on the format, but that minimalism gives it an even greater sense of mystery and adventure compared to the more overt, story-driven games that follow. While the lore has since colored in the spaces between, there’s still magic in how unknowable the first <em>Legend of Zelda </em>feels. Nintendo built a lot on these bones, but the foundation was and remains very strong.</p><p><em>Read more:</em>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lego-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-deku-youtube-copyright-1850136690&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lego-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-deku-youtube-copyright-1850136690">Lego <em>Zelda</em> All But Confirmed After Copyright Strikes</a></span></p></div><div><p>It feels like the <em>Zelda </em>series has had multiple “new blueprint moments” over its life, and <em>Ocarina of Time </em>was that for the 3D games. The original Nintendo 64 game might feel a bit generic in the face of years of innovation, but for its time, <em>Ocarina of Time </em>revolutionized the series in the jump to 3D, much as <em>Super Mario 64</em> did. Its design DNA can be felt even in games like <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, and it established baseline truths about the world of Hyrule and its cultures that became the foundation for what we know the <em>Zelda </em>name to mean.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-tactics-nintendo-youtube-retro-studios-copyright-1849944006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-tactics-nintendo-youtube-retro-studios-copyright-1849944006">YouTuber Beats Nintendo After It Tried Nuking Evidence Of A Canceled <em>Zelda</em></a></span></p></div><div><p>If <em>Ocarina of Time </em>was the moment for 3D <em>Zelda</em> to establish what the series would be moving forward, <em>Majora’s Mask </em>was Nintendo’s moment to just go nuts with the Nintendo 64 tech it had and really riff on some cool design elements and themes. <em>Majora’s Mask</em> has some of the most varied gameplay in the series thanks to Link’s ability to transform into other forms using masks. From the agile Zora form to the hulking power of the Goron form, <em>Majora’s Mask </em>just feels like one of the series’ biggest sandboxes to play in, and that’s not even taking into account how all the non-transformation masks like the Bunny Hood that increases Link’s speed factor into play. It also is one of <em>Zelda</em>’s most pensive stories as civilization deals with an impending doomsday event. It’s haunting, innovative, and hopeful by the end. <em>Majora’s Mask </em>has always been an underrated moment for the series compared to <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, which is why we’re doing right by it by putting it above its predecessor on this list.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/13-games-to-check-out-if-you-like-breath-of-the-wild-1848283621&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/13-games-to-check-out-if-you-like-breath-of-the-wild-1848283621">13 <em>Zelda BOTW</em>-Like Games To Get Ready For <em>Tears Of The Kingdom</em></a></span></p></div><div><p>It’s hard to talk about <em>Breath of the Wild </em>as this greatly influential moment in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>’s lifetime when we’re still living in its world right now. <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>is only a few weeks away, and while it will no doubt build off what Nintendo accomplished in 2017, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> has been a fulcrum point for the open-world genre ever since it launched alongside the Switch. Every developer has been trying to capture the same lightning in a bottle Nintendo did in terms of integrating deep systems that make its world feel alive rather than just a map with icons to clear. At a point in time where most AAA games are trying to be these massive, life-sucking, open-world time wasters because <em>Skyrim </em>tricked people into thinking bigger is always better, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> stands as a testament to open-world design being more than simply filling a map with stuff to do.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447">The 22 Best Games For The Nintendo Switch</a></span></p><p>There’s a craft to how Nintendo has expanded Hyrule into a living world that most studios seem to only understand on a superficial level, and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>also put the entire trend to shame once more.</p></div><div><p><em>Wind Waker </em>faced a lot of scrutiny when it was first revealed for its cel-shaded visual style, especially after Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-great-zelda-switcheroo-5768870&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-great-zelda-switcheroo-5768870">teased what fans believed to be a more traditional <em>Zelda </em>game</a></span> for the GameCube before its reveal. But time has been incredibly kind to <em>Wind Waker</em> in the years since, largely because it remains a peak moment in the franchise for its stellar combat design, charming and animated take on the world of Hyrule, and for its stunning interpretation of the conflict between our heroes and Ganondorf. There’s a youthful, adventurous heart to <em>Wind Waker </em>that, as the series has gone on to explore darker themes and worlds, remains a bright spot for the franchise even when it takes dark turns.

The first game asks you to explore its open world to your heart’s content. <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>asks you to build something in all the empty spaces. Nintendo looked at the previous game’s themes and traversal and, instead of making the world bigger for the sake of it, chose to find new ways to extrapolate those ideas into something altogether different.</p><p><em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>is all about experimentation, creative thinking, and problem-solving, and no two people play it the same way. I remember being in Discord calls playing the game alongside friends and it took days or weeks for some of us to come across certain storylines and characters others encountered right away because the paths we took were so vastly different. Then we used the Ultrahand mechanic to build vehicles, platforms, and other tools to solve puzzles with solutions that hadn’t crossed each other’s minds. Sharing a <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>clip is like presenting an art piece all one’s own, as people’s stunts, creations, and solutions were expressions of their creativity. <em>Breath of the Wild </em>told players to go wherever they wanted, and then <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>asked them to find a new way to get there. Like its predecessor, it will be hugely influential to the next generation of open-world games. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cards-against-humanity-sues-spacex-for-15-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tabletop gaming and major tech companies are brushing against one another. The publisher of the popular card game, Cards Against Humanity, has filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk's company SpaceX for trespassing on private property they have purchased.</p>

<p>According to a report <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/elon-musks-spacex-sued-by-cards-against-humanity-alleged-trespassing-texas/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by CBS</a>, <em>Cards Against Humanity</em> filed a lawsuit this week in Texas court towards SpaceX. It alleges that SpaceX treated a vacant plot of land in Cameron County owned by <em>Cards Against Humanity</em> as its own for the past six months.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cards-against-humanity-card-artwork.jpg?itok=i_IqXiZP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cards-against-humanity-card-artwork.jpg?itok=nq4mtkGh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The lawsuit continues stating SpaceX has been acquiring other plots of land near the property and has been placing construction materials, gravel, and other debris on that land without asking permission to do so. According to the company, the land even has a "no trespassing" sign.</p>
<p>The company is asking for $15 million in damages, including a vegetation loss on the land.</p>
<p><em>Cards Against Humanity</em> purchased the vacant plot of land in 2017. In an official post titled "<a href="https://www.cardsagainsthumanitysavesamerica.com/"><em>Cards Against Humanity</em> Saves America</a>," the company explains the purchase of the land was to help prevent former US President Donald Trump from building a wall on the US/Mexico border.</p>
<p>The post explains that 150,000 people paid $15 each to purchase the vacant border land. In addition, they retained a law firm specialized in eminent domain. This would make any effort to claim the land as expensive and time-consuming as possible.</p>
<p>For a company known for making a notoriously raunchy party game packed with dark jokes, this gesture cemented the company's reputation of mischievous philanthropy. Another example is when they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/us-news-blog/2012/dec/19/cards-against-humanity-wikimedia">donated $70,000</a> to the WIkipedia Foundation in 2012.</p>
<p>That mischief may now be legally plaguing another highly contentious billionaire seven years after the fact.</p>
<p>SpaceX has not officially responded to this lawsuit at time of writing.</p>

The show reportedly has Chris Mundy (<em>Ozark</em>), Damon Lindelof (<em>Watchmen</em>, <em>Lost</em>) and comics writer Tom King signed on, with filming aiming to start early next year. </p><p>This would be by far the biggest role Chandler has landed since starring in <em>Friday Night Lights</em>, the prestige sports soap opera chronicling the virtues and struggles of high school football players in a small Texas town. It went five seasons and eventually won Chandler an Emmy. Prior to that, he was best known for the CBS series <em>Early Edition</em> about a guy morally burdened by the knowledge of the future thanks to getting a magical edition of the Chicago Sun-Times 24 hours ahead of time. </p><p><em>Lanterns</em> also marks the first time fans will have gotten a live-action look at Green Lantern since the 2011 movie starring Ryan Reynolds. Despite references here and there in TV shows like<em> Smallville </em>and <em>Arrow</em>, the character has never gotten much dedicated screen time outside of animated series and movies, even missing out on Zack Snyder’s stab at a <em>Justice League</em>-fueled DCU. The <em>Lantern</em> series follows this fall’s <em>Penguin</em> spin-off, however, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-tv-series-show-hbo-review-release-date-1851647024&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-tv-series-show-hbo-review-release-date-1851647024">which has received decent reviews</a></span>.<br></p><p>Hopefully, the HBO take on Green Lantern similarly puts story and characters ahead of comic book easter eggs and action set pieces. Time for Chandler to go from practicing “clear eyes, full heart” to “in brightest day, in blackest night.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows dev diary has leaked online, showing off new gameplay and including some footage of how the world will change depending on the weather.</p>



<p><span>The leak comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com.cn/assassins-creed-codename-red/51099/video/ci-ke-xin-tiao-ying-kai-fa-zhe-ri-zhi-di-er-ji" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN China,</a>&nbsp;and while the gameplay is almost certainly going to be taken down, we’ll have mirrors of the footage available b</span>elow:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As shown in the new gameplay, Assassin’s Creed Shadows features “a new generation world,” which pushes the boundaries of a fully dynamic world. This includes a full season cycle, making the world not only appear different but also impacting your character’s movements and how you navigate it. For example, a hard-to-reach area might be blocked off because of a large body of water, but in the wintertime, that freezes over, making it accessible. </p>



<p>The new footage also showcases the new animation system used in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which creates an even more immersive world for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>The gameplay also reveals your ‘Hideout’, described as having one acre of land. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-red-exclusive-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hideout</a> is where the player can build, at their own will, the like of an armory, dojo, alter, and more. These buildings are customizable, too, from being able to pick the building location, to being able to choose your roof design to the interior layout and where you can display the likes of your weapons and armor can be displayed.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will launch on November 12th, 2024, for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

In fact, the project almost sounds like it started as a Zelda Maker title--similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-maker-2-review-make-my-day/1900-6417189/" data-ref-id="1900-6417189">the Super Mario Maker series</a>--but this time focused on dungeons to create and share. Grezzo's Satoshi Terada, who co-directed the game with Sano, discussed his team's opportunity to create a new game in the Zelda series and their different ideas.</p><p dir="ltr">"We were exploring a few different ways to play the game in parallel. In one approach, Link could copy and paste various objects, such as doors and candlesticks, to create original dungeons," Terada said. "During this exploration phase, this idea was called an "edit dungeon" because players could create their own Legend of Zelda gameplay."</p><p dir="ltr">Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma added that "while it's fun to create your own dungeon and let other people play it," what stood out to him was copying and pasting items. Obviously, that led to one of the game's main hooks: "The gameplay was shifted from creating dungeons up until then to using copied-and-pasted items as tools to further your own adventure."</p><p dir="ltr">This led to Sano mentioning that Aonuma basically upended the tea table, a phrase usually attributed to Shigeru Miyamoto. But she backed up Aonuma on the shift, saying: "Of course, creating dungeons was fun, but being able to copy various objects and use them in different places was even more fun."</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-rom-has-reportedly-leaked/1100-6526473/" data-ref-id="1100-6526473">the Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom ROM reportedly leaked</a>, so be careful of spoilers online with the game releasing later this week on September 26.

			<p><span>How long could it take to play 50 games, really?</span></p>
		</div>
	<div>
		<p>Once again, I am under siege by video games. I've put more hours into <em>The Plucky Square</em>, charmed enough by its aesthetics to overlook how boring it is. I've made progress in <em>Arco</em>, but I can feel it slipping away again after being away for two weeks. (That game is going to end up on a lot of "why didn't anyone play this" lists in a few years, mark my words.) Perhaps I should be thankful Nintendo didn't send me <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom </em>early, so that I don't have to worry about spending time with it until this weekend. And every time I think about <em>Space Marine 2</em>, at least I remember that we're probably going to just keep streaming it. </p><p>-pk, who at least can say they've finished <em>Astro Bot</em>, discourse and all</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY:</strong> We moved forward in our Francis Ford Coppola era of My Turn, as Rob picked Hearts of Darkness, a documentary about the making of <em>Apocalypse Now</em>. It's a fascinating watch, regardless of whether you've seen <em>Apocalypse Now</em>. In fact, I'd argue the movie is kinda boring (but important!) and the documentary conveys enough about for you to kinda feel like you watched it. You're certainly find to listen to the podcast if you haven't watched the movie in a little while, anyway.</li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>We're recording an early episode of HOA that you'll hear a little down the line. Our new recording schedule dictates us turning on microphones a week in advance, which doesn't really work for Sports!, which requires a faster turnaround. Our plan is to—sigh—weigh in on the Bears and the other going ons in the NFL next week. That'll record next Monday, and get out...as soon as we can? In the afternoon, Rob and Cado will be headed to <em>Frostpunk 2</em>.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>I've put a bunch of hours into The Plucky Square, though it's looking unlikely I'll have a chance to play The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom before this recording—next week, I suppose! But there should be plenty to chat about on Remap Radio, between State of Play and TGS.</li><li>THURSDAY: Maybe this time I'll pay closer attention to the clock, so that I don't end up taking my youngest to her soccer class late. But hey, such is the nature of our Wheel of GeForce NOW streams—they're a ton of fun.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY:</strong> Besides Remap Radio publishing, we're going to try Remap's demo format, where we play a game for a set amount of time on a clock, and apply it to <em>UFO 50</em>. You'll also get a new letter series from Rob on Friday, as well.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[How Much is the PS5 Anniversary Edition?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-is-the-ps5-anniversary-edition/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-is-the-ps5-anniversary-edition/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the announcement of the PS5 Pro, which everyone laughed about because of its excruciating price tag, Sony had the last laugh with the PS5 Anniversary Edition. It’s seriously gorgeous, and I, like many others, want one for the nostalgia. But it’s easy to say, “Oh, I’ll buy on day one,” when you don’t know the price tag. Well, here’s how much the PS5 Anniversary Edition will set you back!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-ps5-anniversary-edition-cost">What Does the PS5 Anniversary Edition Cost?</h2>



<p>Are you ready for this? The PS4 Anniversary Edition price is set at <strong>$499.99 USD for the PS5 Slim (Digital Edition) and $79.99 USD for the DualSense 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Wireless Controller</strong>.</p>



<p>To complete the set, you’re looking at approximately $579.98 for the console bundle and an additional controller. Of course, they’re limited edition, which means the bundle will sell out quickly.</p>



<p>Is it more expensive than the usual PlayStation 5? Yeah! By about $50, which isn’t too severe considering the system’s unique aesthetic and limited nature. It’s a collector’s item more so than anything else.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the bundle isn’t just the console and a controller, which makes it even more worthwhile. It includes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition</strong></li>



<li><strong>DualSense</strong></li>



<li><strong>Faceplate</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vertical Stand</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sticker (Collector’s Edition)</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>However, whether the price tag is worthwhile or not for you is completely up to you!</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-pre-order-the-ps5-anniversary-edition">Where to Pre-Order the PS5 Anniversary Edition</h2>



<p>If you want to score the PS5 Anniversary Edition for yourself, the best way to purchase one is directly from Sony. You’ll likely want to avoid third-party sellers, such as eBay, as there are bound to be countless scalpers trying to help you part ways with your hard-earned money.</p>



<p>Instead, visit <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony’s direct shop</a> for more information on the 30th Anniversary Edition bundles. You can purchase one starting September 26. Sony will also sell the limited-edition console via a few participating retailers.</p>



<hr>



<p>You might want to consider grabbing a PlayStation 5 sooner rather than later, especially considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-is-exclusive-to-ps5-for-a-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 is exclusive to PS5 for one year</a>!

			<p>Sony has just <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1838254671456018525" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that a new State of Play broadcast will air tomorrow on YouTube and Twitch at 3 PM Pacific Time / 6 PM Eastern Time | September 25 at 12 AM Central European Time / 7 AM Japan Time, available in English and Japanese languages. It's been nearly four months since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-featuring-14-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous one</a>, which featured the following fourteen titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Astro Bot</li>
<li>Concord</li>
<li>God of War Ragnarok PC</li>
<li>Until Dawn</li>
<li>Skydance's Behemoth</li>
<li>Path of Exile 2</li>
<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>
<li>Silent Hill 2</li>
<li>Alien: Rogue Incursion</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
<li>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</li>
<li>Ballad of Antara</li>
<li>Infinity Nikki</li>
<li>Where Winds Meet</li>
</ul>
<p>This upcoming State of Play will feature even more games. Sony remained pretty vague but confirmed there will be 'over 20 PS5 and PS VR2 games)' developed by studios from all over the world.</p>
<p>Among those, we'll probably hear about Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered (already <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rated-by-esrb-for-ps5-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a> by the ESRB) and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-is-reportedly-getting-a-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> Days Gone remaster. Other than that, it's anyone's guess, but it would be best to keep expectations in check. Sony reserves its big first-party reveals for the PlayStation Showcase events, while State of Play broadcasts are dedicated to third-party studios and minor projects like remasters.</p>

The consumable item <strong>Goddess Scales</strong> allows you to reset a character’s Elemental Plot progression, but this does not show up in bulk until Chapter Seven. For context, Chapter Seven is the start of the game’s final act, so you’ll have already seen most of the main story content by this point. Additionally, this is only a one-use item, so you can’t use these willy-nilly to test new builds. You’ll want to plan exactly how you want to respec a character before you use one of these.<br></p><p>That said, <strong>I strongly recommend holding off on using Goddess Scales until you clear the main story in <em>Visions of Mana</em></strong>. If you want to know why, let’s get into the nitty gritty of how <em>Visions of Mana</em> progresses in its post-game.</p><h2 id="h10560"><a id=""></a><strong>Where to find Goddess Scales in <em>Visions of Mana</em></strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1c4a1ccc700ce8ba846199b5b50b184b" data-recommend-id="image://1c4a1ccc700ce8ba846199b5b50b184b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Goddess Scales screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Goddess Scales screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c4a1ccc700ce8ba846199b5b50b184b" data-recommend-id="image://1c4a1ccc700ce8ba846199b5b50b184b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Goddess Scales screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As mentioned above, Goddess Scales won’t appear in <em>Visions of Mana</em> until the late game. You’ll likely first encounter this item by <strong>opening treasure chests</strong>, which are thankfully marked right on your map screen. By the time you’ve obtained all eight elementals, you should be able to collect every treasure chest you see (save maybe chests hidden in ruins, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/visions-of-mana-how-to-beat-ruins-guide-1851646843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/visions-of-mana-how-to-beat-ruins-guide-1851646843">though even those should be feasible by this point</a></span>). By my count, I was able to obtain five Goddess Scales this way.</p><p>The other source of Goddess Scales comes from the <strong>Grizzly Exchange</strong>. You know, the shop run by the Dudbear that goes “Badu badudu bub.” Starting in Chapter Seven, you can purchase five Goddess Scales for 20 Grizzly Syrups each. Then, once you enter the post-game content after Chapter Nine, you can purchase an additional five Goddess Scales.</p><p>By the post-game, <strong>I had found fifteen Goddess Scales in total</strong>. That’s three respecs per character, or five respecs for your main team if you don’t use anyone else. As far as I can tell, there are no ways to grind for Goddess Scales outside of replaying the game all over via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-visions-of-mana-square-enix-rpg-1851635405&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-visions-of-mana-square-enix-rpg-1851635405">New Game Plus</a></span>. While this should offer enough chances for you to customize your team exactly how you want, you still want to be careful before using these.</p><h2 id="h10561"><a id=""></a><strong>Why you should wait until the postgame until you use Goddess Scales</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ee22226dc4b1e359a1d6b03c445c9b2d" data-recommend-id="image://ee22226dc4b1e359a1d6b03c445c9b2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ARGH!

If you explore the world and gather Elementite as they become available, you should have plenty of Elemental Points to experiment with different classes and obtain most of the spells that each character can natively learn. Only in Chapter Seven will you start obtaining each character’s third tier of the Elemental Plot, and by this point you should feel generally decided on which classes each character can learn. Maybe your build isn’t as optimized as you like, but you should fare well if you only focus on maxing out the classes your party currently mains.</p><p>The big thing here is that Chapter Eight and Chapter Nine consist of the game’s final dungeon and final boss respectively. There isn’t a ton of game left once you start finding Goddess Scales.</p><p>After you beat the final boss, you’ll unlock the post-game of <em>Visions of Mana</em>. Visit the Dudbear’s Grizzly Exchange again, and not only can you purchase additional Goddess Scales, you can buy the Tonics to unlock each character’s final tier of their Elemental Plots for a total of 100 Grizzly Syrups. Max out the class of any character’s Elemental Plot, and, surprise, it turns out <strong>your base class can equip any of the skills of any class you’ve maxed out</strong>.</p><p><strong>That’s right, you functionally have cross-classing now, and you’ll <em>need</em> to respec every character to get the most out of this system</strong>. Instead of grabbing helpful skills from any line of the Elemental Plot, you’ll want to reinvest all your points into two or three classes to make builds that can take on the post-game superbosses.</p><p>If you already respecced everyone in Chapter Seven, you should still have two more chances to respec your party in your pocket. But this leaves you short on chances to adjust your builds, especially if you want to rethink your party after finding out a superboss resists every element in the game.</p><p>To be fair, <em>Visions of Mana</em> doesn’t sport a terribly robust post-game. If you want to use a Goddess Scale before this point, it’s not the end of the world. But when faced with the hardest content in the entire game, you’ll feel happy to have that extra security in case you need to rethink your team. Make an extra save file after the postgame to be safe!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In parts 1 and 2 of this interview, the company reveals a number of tidbits about Echoes of Wisdom, including Grezzo as the elusive co-development studio behind the project and Tomomi Sano as the game's director, and first-ever female director on The Legend of Zelda series.</p><p>You can read the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1/?utm_source=SW-AAA&amp;utm_medium=sotwnoa&amp;utm_campaign=N1141-01&amp;utm_id=N1141-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full interviews yourself</a>, but here are some highlights. First off, Sano has a rich history in the industry, earning her first credit in 1998 for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-3">editing stage textures on Tekken 3</a>. She began working with Nintendo in 2004 as a coordinator on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-party-6">Mario Party 6</a>, and over time was involved in a number of Nintendo-published and supported projects. Her first Zelda credit was in 2011 on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</a> as a coordinator, and she followed it up with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/04/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask-3d-review">same role on Majora's Mask 3D</a> a few years later. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/23/sano-zelda-1727113341689.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tomomi Sano is Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom's director. Image credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p>In 2016, Sano served as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd">assistant director on Twilight Princess HD</a>, and was also assistant director on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-and-luigi-superstar-saga-bowsers-minions">Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-and-luigi-bowsers-inside-story-bowser-jrs-journey">Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey</a>. Most recently, she was a project coordinator on the Switch version of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/19/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review">Link's Awakening in 2019</a>. According to the interviews, Aonuma apparently "almost always" asks Sano to be involved with Legend of Zelda projects at Grezzo.</p><h2>The origins of Echoes of Wisdom</h2><p>Grezzo and Nintendo co-developed Echoes of Wisdom, but in the interview, series producer Eiji Aonuma says that Grezzo had an even greater role than usual on the game. Apparently, Nintendo wanted Grezzo's take on Link's Awakening to serve as a blueprint for top-down Zelda games this generation, but  didn't just want to only do remakes. So the team asked Grezzo to pitch ideas internally for a new Legend of Zelda game, marking the first time the studio was challenged to participate in a Zelda project from the conceptual state. According to Aonuma, everyone in the studio participated across disciplines, pitching ideas to Aonuma, and it took Nintendo three days to review all the proposals.</p><p>Ultimately, the idea that won wasn't exactly what Echoes is now, though it was kind of close. The winner was a "copy-and-paste" gameplay style combining the "top-down and side-view" gameplay styles seen in Link's Awakening.</p><p>"These were the two basic elements, and from there, I asked them to think of ways to add some freedom," Aonuma says. "Having worked on games in the Legend of Zelda series over the years, we started to feel that fans may not continue playing this franchise unless they can think independently and try various things freely on their own, rather than following a set path. Even when it comes to solving puzzles – in a game in the Legend of Zelda series, having the excitement of solving puzzles in your own unique way makes the game 'Legend of Zelda-like.' Hence, we need to increase the degree of freedom to achieve that. With this in mind, I asked Grezzo to use those two elements as a foundation for the gameplay and add freedom on top of it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>What Grezzo came up with was more of a "dungeon editor" game than what Echoes of Wisdom ended up being, where Link could copy and paste objects to create original dungeons. They prototyped this version for about a year, but Aonuma "upended the tea table" so to speak in changing the premise to focus more on copy-and-paste as a gameplay and puzzle-solving tool.</p><p>The rest of the interview discusses some of the different ways in which Nintendo and Grezzo had to navigate the challenges of giving a player access to copy-and-pasting over 100 objects in the game anywhere, anytime. That includes challenges with how every object can interact with both top-down and side-view gameplay, and struggles in ensuring gameplay didn't feel too slow while the player waits for enemies and echoes to take actions against one another.</p><p>One particular sticking point, per Aonuma, was placing restrictions on what the player can do with Echoes early on, or in dungeons. Earlier in development, Aonuma says the team tried to put restrictions on Echo use out of fear players would break the game. But over time, they discovered this wasn't necessary, and gradually lifted these restrictions until the final version of the game had almost none from the start.</p><p>All this led to further enabling players to "be mischievous," which was a key phrase used during development.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We wanted to do some things that were really out there.</p></div><p>"We came up with this key phrase because we wanted to do some things that were really out there," Aonuma says. "For example, if you roll something like a spike roller along the ground, that's a lot of work, because it can hit all kinds of things, but if we didn't allow for this possibility, it wouldn't be fun. (Laughs) The development team called these kinds of ideas 'being mischievous.'"</p><p>Sano adds that the team created a document explaining what "being mischievous" meant "so that everyone could return to this concept if they weren't sure how to proceed."</p><p>"There were three rules," continues Grezzo director Satoshi Terada. "Be able to paste things however, wherever, and whenever you like. Make it possible to complete puzzles using things that aren't there."</p><p>Sano shares the third. "Being able to find uses for echoes that are so ingenious it almost feels like cheating should be part of what makes this game fun."</p><p>Aonuma concludes by referencing the Myahm Agana shrine from Breath of the Wild, an infamous motion-sensor puzzle where players had to use the Switch controller to move a platform and tilt a ball through a maze to a finish line. However, the puzzle also allowed players to flip the entire platform upside down and roll the ball across a smooth surface to the goal.</p><p>"If this kind of solution isn't allowed, then it's not fun," says Aonuma.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ara-history-untold-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ara: History Untold is the latest in a procession of turn-based 4X games trying to settle on the once-sovereign territory of Sid Meier's Civilization, and it's one of the more competent challengers to do so. The liveliness and detail of its animated towns and cities never fail to delight me – as a historical ant farm, at least. But it expects more of us as a world leader than Civ ever has, and doesn't really provide us with the tools to make it truly feel good to be the king.</p><p>On a basic level, Ara doesn't have a vastly different view of history from its 4X forebears. Starting from roughly Neolithic times, you race down a tech tree split up into three acts of four ages each along a familiar and narrow path based mostly on Europe and its colonial offshoots. One little twist I did appreciate is that the final, futuristic era has a lot more to do with general AI, transhumanism, and cybernetics than going to space, which I think is a necessary and likely step on the path ahead of us that often gets skipped over in favor of interstellar travel.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Much like Civ, Ara lets you select from an array of historical leaders who appear in a simple but expressive 3D style. Alongside familiar faces like Caesar and Shaka Zulu, we also get some less conventional "rulers" like Copernicus for Poland and Sappho for Greece, which is a nice touch. </p><p>Their bonuses are all underwhelmingly passive, though. None of them can really do anything the others can't. And there are no culturally unique units – at least, not from your leader choice. You can unlock a couple wildcards, like Berserkers from building a brewery, but they're available to anyone who meets the right conditions. There's also a system of opposing personality traits that maybe could have been interesting, because it does affect how other leaders will initially view you diplomatically, but I didn't find it to be that impactful. Also, some of them provide a negative modifier with no upside, which seems very strange from a balance perspective, since the leaders who have them don't seem to get anything to make up for this.</p><h2><strong>Wonderful World</strong></h2><p>Ara's procedurally-generated worlds are positively enthralling to look at. Everything from trees to houses are rendered at a much smaller scale than in other, similar games, which makes the world feel larger and more authentic. Every town square, windmill, and even herd of wild animals is fully animated, bringing liveliness to every corner of the map. I honestly enjoy the simple act of panning around, watching my people go about their lives.</p><p>It's not all great, though. Road-building, which is fully automated, tends to make these nonsensical tangles with too many sharp angles to look organic. You could argue this is to simulate real-world traffic engineering debacles, but it doesn't look nice compared to everything else.</p><p>Performance can also get a little bit iffy in the late game, at least on the largest map size. The more of the fog I lifted, the more frames I lost, even on a 4070 Super GPU. We never quite reached slideshow territory, but I did end up having to turn some settings down in the last 100 turns or so.</p><p>I was also a little disappointed that there isn't much difference in architecture other than which era you're in. At least judging by the civs I played, it seems like a farm or a residential neighborhood for any given time period looks about the same no matter who built it. And this just further reinforces the feeling that your leader choice is little more than a set of numerical bonuses.</p><h2><strong>The Economy, Fools</strong></h2><p>Where Ara almost literally grinds to a halt is also its most interesting gameplay innovation. While food, gold, science, and production – the usual gang – are all here, Ara features a very in-depth, goods-based manufacturing economy. You can harvest grain, which can then be made into bread at a bakery, which can then be used as an ingredient in gourmet meals at an inn. This continues all the way up to things like refrigerators and game consoles in the later eras.</p><p>You can either spend these goods as a one-time cost to slot them into a specific building's inventory, like adding plows to a farm to increase its productivity, or consume them as amenities in your city-center for a temporary benefit. In theory, I like this a lot. In bigger settlements, simply producing the generic "food" resource will eventually become insufficient to feed the masses. But if you refine your crops into grain stores and preserves, and produce enough to keep those amenity slots full on an ongoing basis, you can grow much larger. Most manufactured goods also have multiple options for what you can make them with, including just spending gold if you don't have access to the base resources. I really liked the decision-making and economic planning involved here at smaller scales.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>ARA: History Untold - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The problem is that this becomes a nightmare to manage with even two or three fair-sized cities. There's no notification I could find or enable for when a city has a free amenity slot, for example. Nor when I could potentially fill an empty supplies slot on a production building, or swap out those supplies with a better option I had recently unlocked through technology. It also won't warn you when you have idle experts – Ara's version of specialists from Civ, who appear as your population increases and can be slotted to supercharge specific buildings.</p><p>There's not even a really convenient way to keep track of your economy. There is a tooltip that will show you a basic balance sheet of everything you're producing and consuming, but it's too small, there's no way to sort the rows by anything but alphabetical order, and it eventually fills up with so many types of goods that it becomes overwhelming. Or you can look at a grid view, which is a bit easier to navigate, but doesn't include the spreadsheet and still can't be sorted.</p><p>To really optimize my economy, I had to open dozens of individual building menus every time I unlocked a new tech or gained access to a new type of tools. And since this is essentially the core mechanic in Ara, everything else starts to collapse around it. The late game really gets to be a tedious slog, unless you pull far enough ahead that you can simply stop caring about most of the mechanics, which is what eventually happened to me on the default difficulty.</p><h2><strong>To The Strongest</strong></h2><p>Combat is fine. It's very automatic, with some rock-paper-scissors unit choices and unlockable formations that can give you modest bonuses based on the types of troops you have access to, adding a little bit of tactical decision-making. Engagements play out in full 3D, which is neat to watch the first few times as potentially hundreds of troops clash, but these animations lost their appeal for me fairly quickly since they're not especially dynamic.</p><p>Ara also includes a knockout mechanic, which is something I'm generally not a fan of. After a certain number of players have reached Age 5 and Age 9, the ones with the least accumulated Prestige – your overall score based on everything from military victories to total population – are removed from the map, with their cities becoming explorable ruins.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Len's Top 10 4X Games</h3><p>The best games to explore, expand, exploit, and extol in 2024.</p></div><p>It's possible to turn this off for human players, which is nice. But I didn't really get the sense that streamlining the later eras to just a handful of great powers was worth losing the diplomatic complexity of a larger cast. In a 12-player game, eight will move on to Act 2 and five will remain competing for the top spot in Act 3. It's also just weird the second time it happens, with bustling Enlightenment-era cities vanishing overnight.</p><p>Diplomacy is as basic as it could possibly be in this type of game, with the ability to send gifts, declare wars, open borders, and broker alliances and research agreements. Trade can be useful in the early game when you don't have access to a resource you really need for a higher-tier building, but you need to heavily commit to it to have enough merchant capacity later on to even make a dent in your goods deficit.</p><p>Government, religion, and advisers are also pretty unmemorable. Like leader choice, it's just stacking more numerical modifiers. They don't typically unlock new playstyles or new ways to solve problems. They just make you marginally better at doing things you could already do anyway.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
