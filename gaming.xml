                <p>The festive season is here, and as is tradition, people have dusted off their ugliest sweaters to help celebrate this jolly time of the year. Over at Microsoft, employees are getting into the swing of things with an ugly sweater that celebrates one of the <em>ugliest</em> moments of Xbox history: the infamous red ring of death that plagued the Xbox 360 early in its console lifecycle.</p><p>In addition to a power button that can display both the green and the crimson symbols, the sweater also has an interesting arrangement of green and yellow stripes. As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318401/microsoft-has-created-an-xbox-360-red-ring-of-death-ugly-sweater" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, it's only currently available to Microsoft employees through the company's store, and stock has already sold out.</p><p>Anyone who owned an Xbox 360 early on likely experienced a red ring of death hardware failure, as this was a widespread issue that turned the console into a paperweight. This was a major problem for Microsoft at the time, and in the 2021 web series Power On, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-explains-how-the-red-ring-of-death-happened/1100-6499059/" data-ref-id="1100-6499059">the company explained how it happened</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2d6IMBS8oY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z2d6IMBS8oY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to Leo Del Castillo, a member of Xbox's hardware engineering group, the red ring of death was caused by connectors inside the console's components that broke as a result of rapid heating and cooling. This problem--combined with thermal and stress issues in the Xbox 360 related to its soldering balls--eventually resulted in bricked consoles.</p><p>Microsoft's solution at the time was to repair and return the affected Xbox 360 at no cost to the consumer--an expensive fix that became a "1.15 billion dollar problem" according to former head of Xbox Peter Moore. Future hardware revisions of the Xbox 360 mostly managed to prevent this issue from occurring, and successor consoles like the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S haven't faced any major hardware failures on this scale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-capable-emulating-playstation-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The base PlayStation 5 is more than capable of emulating PlayStation 3 games at a hardware level, a new test confirms.</p>
<p>A new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LowestLogan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lowest Logan</a> on YouTube showcases a test conducted using an AMD BC-250, a mining card that features the PlayStation 5 silicon, most likely created by repurposing chips that did not meet the full specifications required by the console, complete with 16 GB of GDDR6 RAM. The card, however, has some limitations over the actual PS5 hardware, as two CPU cores have been disabled, and only 24 compute units are available over the total number of 32 units.</p>
<p>To get the AMD BC-250 to run games like the PlayStation 5 hardware it is based on, Lowest Logan had to overcome plenty of challenges, as both Windows and Linux distros did not run properly. After some experimenting, however, the YouTuber managed to get everything up and running and has tested some PlayStation 3 games via the excellent RPCS3 emulator, proving the claims that PS3 emulation is too computationally heavy for the PS5 are false. Both Gran Turismo 5 Prologue and Little Big Planet ran well at both native and higher resolution, keeping steady framerates even with some of the hardware limitations over the actual PS5, including memory limitations, as the GPU driver only saw a single memory clock state for the GPU, 450 Mhz, which put it on the same level of an RX 480 GPU, a much weaker card than the RX 6700 GPU the PS5 GPU is close to. So, even with a lot of performance left on the table, the current generation console is more than capable of running PlayStation 3 games.</p>

            <p>The team behind Italian Soulslike Enotria: The Last Song has finally found some resolution to the game's Xbox absence.</p>
<p>As a quick recap, back in March developer Jyamma Games said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/italian-soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-delayed-avoiding-elden-ring-dlc">would not be releasing its game on Xbox</a> in order to ensure "a superior experience for PC and PS5 players". At this time, it was suggested the studio would reassess an Xbox release once the game had launched elsewhere, and the Enortria team went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/enotria-the-last-song-ceo-apologises-to-xbox-community-for-a-choice-that-was-forced-to-make">apologise to the Xbox community for this delay</a>.</p>

<p>However, if we fast forward to September, things get a little more involved. The developer announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-delayed-indefinitely-on-xbox-as-dev-says-its-being-ignored-by-microsoft">delaying Enotria: The Last Song's Xbox release indefinitely</a>, claiming Microsoft had "decided to ignore us" as it attempted to navigate certification.</p>
<p>When this comment was picked up further, Microsoft went on to apologise to the developer for this apparent oversight. An Xbox release of Enotria: The Last Song was back on the cards. But, when for?</p>
<p>Well, we now have an answer to that question. Enotria: The Last Song will be coming to Microsoft's platform very, very soon. In fact, it arrives tomorrow, 12th December.</p>
<p>"We bring great news for our Xbox players," the team wrote on <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1866521654765265387">social media</a>. "Enotria: The Last Song is finally ready to be released on [Xbox Series X/S]." Hurrah!</p>

<p>Enotria: The Last Song has been inspired by Italian folklore, and while its setting is dappled in Mediterranean sunlight, there looks to be plenty of darkness lurking within.</p>
<p>"The world has been gripped by the Canovaccio - a twisted eternal play that keeps everything in an unnatural stasis," the game's description reads. "You, Maskless One, are the only one without a given role and master of your destiny. Defeat the fearsome Authors that created it and free the world from stagnation, by harnessing the power of Ardore."</p>
<p>Will you be giving it a go on its Xbox debut?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-series-developer-monolith-soft-is-now-fully-owned-by-nintendo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xenoblade Chronicles series developer Monolith Soft is now fully owned by Nintendo, as the Japanese company has reportedly purchased the remaining shares of the company it did not previously own.\</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-now-owns-100-of-monolith-soft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automaton</a>, the development studio's <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/company/#overview">official website</a> confirmed that now Nintendo is the only owner. The studio, which was founded in 1999 by Xenogears' creator Tetsuya Takahashi after he left SquareSoft, started a prolific partnership with Nintendo with the release of Xenoblade Chronicles on the original Wii, which led to Nintendo eventually purchasing 80% of Monolith shares from Namco in 2007, which were further increased to 96% in 2011. The remaining 4% shares were owned by founders Hirohide Sugiura, Tetsuya Takahashi, and Yasuyuki Honne.</p>
<p>Given that Nintendo already owned the Xenoblade Chronicles developer, today's news shouldn't really impact the developer in any major capacity. Besides working on their franchise, Monolith Soft also supported the development of other Nintendo games, such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, so the studio has been an integral part of the development process for many first-party Nintendo titles for some time.</p>
<p>Monolith Soft's next game will be&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>, a new version of the open-world role-playing game originally released on Wii U in 2015. Launching on March 20th, 2025, the new version of the game will come with updated visuals as well as an alternate version of the post-credit scene featuring a mysterious hooded figure, which could finally tie the game with the rest of the series.</p>

            <p>
In "non-violent and poetic" 2D platformer Symphonia, you're an extremely fancy violinist exploring a realm of musical machines, where gas lanterns kindle fitfully as you approach, crotchets adorn vast cogwheels, and reams of what I really hope isn't actual catgut feed through titanic pegboxes overhead. Sampling the demo, I was immediately enflamed by the orchestral score and placed in a mood of white-gloved sophistication only slightly spoiled by the familiarity of the underlying platform moveset, and by my repeatedly falling into pits. <!--more-->
</p>
<p>
"Superbesque!" I breathed, watching myself casually tear off a violin solo to magic open a door. "Magnifissimos!" I sang, watching myself artfully bounce my violin bow off the floor and catch it to double-jump. "Bravanche!" I honked, watching myself evaporate against some spikes. While it's not a metroidvania, the cavernous, lamplit, whirring set-dressing puts me strongly in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> and the eternally-forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-everything-we-know">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Here's a trailer:

<p>
And here's some backstory: the aforementioned very fancy violinist is Philemon, who must gather the members of an orchestra and restore vitalising music to a world that has fallen into deathly silence. The levels and backdrops are a phantasmagoric, almost Cubist portrayal of instruments collapsed together into halls and shafts - I am keen to see more of them. Hollow Knight aside, it all reminds me just a little of Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> and Oddworld, which probably aren't the parallels developers Sunny Peak are going for. I mean, I assume there isn't an abbatoir level, but perhaps that's where they get all the catgut. </p>
<p>"Each area in Symphonia has its own distinct feel and characters, and each room is hand-crafted," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865960/Symphonia/">the Steam page adds</a>. "Meet prodigious musicians and try to convince them to join the orchestra."
</p>
<p>
And then there's the score, a bespoke piece of classical romance music, written by composer Olivier Esman and his partners Alexandre Bucas-Fran√ßais and Lou Corroyer. As regards the demo, at least, it's gently synched to your progress, with certain actions triggering the next movement. You'll also perform full-arsed concerts at intervals that are dedicated to a particular section of the orchestra - Strings, Brass and Woodwinds. I deduce from this that the game has a three-act structure.
</p>
<p>
Symphonia is out... now! And feels like a good festive pick if your idea of festive is a soothing melange of velvet, mahogany and candlelight. And spike pits. Here's some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJYN1d3f2dc">Disney's Fantasia</a> to wash it all down.

<p>Ubisoft has released new combat gameplay for Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows and has deep-dived into the combat mechanics.</p>



<p>Ubisoft uploaded the gameplay as part of a new Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog update</a>, but YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AssassinRaptor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JorRaptor</a> has compiled all of the clips into one quick YouTube video.</p>

<p>You can read the full blog update on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft website here</a>. </p>



<p>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shaodws was delayed from its intended November 15 release to February to give its developers time to polish the game. An <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal memo from Yves Guillemot</a> said that the delay was to ‚Äúto offer an optimal experience from launch on all platforms and various PC configurations, and to remove the small frictions we typically used to address in post-launch title updates.‚Äù</p>



<p>Following the delay, Marc-Alexis C√¥t√© announced, </p>



<p>‚ÄúAssassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows is a dream project for us; finally bringing the series to Feudal Japan with many features developed with our community in mind, such as parkour or the renewed stealth, brought by new technology, all set in a beautiful and immersive world.‚Äù</p>



<p>He continued, ‚ÄúAs such, we‚Äôve made the decision to postpone the release date to February 14, 2025. The game will be released on a broad range of platforms, including Steam at launch. Additionally, preorders will be refunded and all future preorders will be granted the first expansion for free.‚Äù</p>



<p>At the time of the delay, it‚Äôs understood that Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows pre-orders were strong, but behind that of Assassin‚Äôs Creed Valhalla which also release on past-generation consoles and thus, had a large market to release to.</p>



<p>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows launches February 14, 2024 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-stealthy-combat-and-samurai-weapons-detailed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft has laid out how <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' combat systems will work, including how its attack types, enemies and arsenal of weapons will differ between its dual protagonists: shinobi Naoe and samurai Yasuke.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview">update</a> comes a week after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-will-overhaul-stealth-mechanics-but-still-include-insta-kill-assassination-option">similar deep dive into Assassin's Creed Shadows' stealth</a>, as the game's marketing schedule begins ramping up once more following its previous shock delay. </p>
<p>Shadows is now set to arrive on 14th February 2025 as a pivotal title for Ubisoft - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">currently in the middle of talks with Chinese giant Tencent around the company's future</a>.</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, combat once again offers light and heavy attacks, but also new, charged "Posture Attacks" that can be held indefinitely (by holding down the attack button) while you adjust your target.
</p>
<p>
Defensive manouveres once again include dodges (Naoe pulls off a directional roll, Yasuke has a directional dodge-step), parries (Yasuke forces enemies to step back, Naoe pivotes around them) and blocks (unique to Yasuke).
</p>
<p>
The stealth-focused Naoe can become outnumbered when surrounded by enemies, while Yasuke can last longer and pull off a guard-breaking final attack at the end of a combo without pulling off a Posture Attack.

<p>
Both characters can carry two weapons, though Yasuke can also switch between them mid-combo. He can also pull off a unique Sheathed Posture Attack, where he's able to charge up an opening attack while his katana is still sheathed.
</p>
<p>
Naoe has a katana blade, the extendable kusarigama ball and chain, and the tanto dagger - which can be dual-wielded with her Hidden Blade to pull off double assassinations.
</p>
<p>
Yasuke has a long katana, naginata pole arm and kanabo war club for close-up combat, as well as the yumi bow and teppo flint file for ranged fighting - with the former quieter than the other.

<p>
Who will you be using all this weaponary against? Well, the game boasts basic outlaws, Ashigaru conscripts and volunteer army footmen (more aggressive towards Naoe, fearful of Yasuke), roaming samurai ronin, the Samurai Daisho found in military castles, and finally the Guardians - described as "an elite group of badass samurai used as reinforcements".
</p>
<p>
As in past games, flurry attacks will show a blue weapon glint, meaning you'll need to defend an entire sequence in quick succession, while unstoppable attacks again have a red glint. 
</p>
<p>Last month, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Cot√© discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">the "devastating" impact of Shadows' diversity and inclusivity backlash</a>, and explained the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">reasons for Shadows' delay to ensure it arrives with another layer of polish</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hazelight Studios has shared a little behind the scenes video, filmed within its HQ in Stockholm, and in the process dropped a few teasers for its next game.</p>
<p>The game in question is yet to be officially named, with the only word from Hazelight itself being a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-developer-teases-next-project-s-n">mysterious post on social media from October</a>. This post showed a stack of papers and a collection of post-it notes with various annotations scrawled about. The studio's founder Josef Fares was, in fairness, <em>a little more</em> forthcoming with information, adding its name will be "S*** ******N".</p>
<p>Now, though, we are getting closer to The Big Reveal, and the team has released a little video presented by the always entertaining Fares himself, who noted people had called him out for being "cocky". He, however, is fine with this, as he believes when a game is as good as the one Hazelight is cooking up, well, of course he is going to be cocky.</p>

<p>In this same video, Fares also introduces us to the actors playing Mio and Zoe - two characters from the upcoming game, based on Fares' daughters - and gets the team to play some "cool sounds" from the project. The sound they choose to play? It's kind of a squelchy fart noise.</p><p>Then, when one of his fellow developers states the Hazelight team is "fucking shit up", Fares fistpumps his colleague. "We fuck shit up, without fucking up," the founder proclaims, before getting a phone call from The Game Awards' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, Hazelight will be revealing its next project at The Game Awards on Thursday night (or very early Friday morning if you are here in the UK). We here at Eurogamer will be covering the show live, so be sure to join us with a festive tipple or two! Other games also confirmed to be at the show include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-mafia-the-old-country-lead-the-charge-as-more-game-awards-showings-confirmed">Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country</a>, to name but two.</p>

<p>The hedgehog will be available from 18th December and comes with unique abilities to shake up gameplay, once he's been unlocked.</p>
<p>His iconic Chaos Control and Chaos Shift moves will lock enemies and the environment in place. The update will also bring new powers for all characters, including Quick Grind, Perfect Jump, Chain Attack, and Perfect Boost.</p>

"The vision was to make a game that allowed players to get into an exhilarating flow state.

			<p>Stealth games, if you ask me, are a bit stupid. In fact, the term stupid doesn‚Äôt do justice to their inherent preposterousness and borderline obtuse behaviour, as your character crouches down like a bear in the woods, doing the side-crab shuffle for mile after virtual mile, because apparently ‚Äì despite being some muscle clad badass weighed-down by weaponry ‚Äì crouching makes you harder to see? Have you ever tried crouch-walking around in your day-to-day? If not, let me assure you, it does not make you harder to see. Everyone will spot you and they will mock you.</p>
<p>Then there‚Äôs the incoherent rules, with enemies spotting players lurking behind walls because<em>,</em> well, <em>reasons. </em>Maybe your vision didn‚Äôt have the right kind of vignette?&nbsp;And don‚Äôt get me started on goldfish brained henchmen on patrol who are not concerned that the three people they have been speaking to on a loop for the last twenty minutes have inexplicably disappeared. Thankfully, Shadow Tactics: Aiko‚Äôs Choice, is a stealth game that bucks the trend. Smart, challenging, and immaculately crafted, <em>this</em> is the kind of stealth based action I‚Äôll crab-walk in the shadows for.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadow Tactics: Aiko's Choice | OUT NOW on Consoles!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/al9rQDa_Ic0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Played from a top-down isometric perspective, Shadow Tactics: Aiko‚Äôs Choice gives you control of a merry-band of iconic feudal-Japan archetypes. There‚Äôs a Ninja who can throw shuriken and clamber across rooftops, a heavily armoured Samurai who can go toe-to-toe with any foe, a kunoichi&nbsp;who can don disguises and murder death kill with only a hairpin, you get the idea.</p>
<p>Your team are tasked with protecting the Shogun, which usually means carefully and strategically stealth killing your way across immense and intricate levels. You are, for the most part, left to carve you own path across the environment, completing a few objectives on the way.</p>


<p>Shadow Tactics: Aiko‚Äôs Choice is a standalone expansion to 2016‚Äôs <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/02/shadow-tactics-ps4-xbox-review/">Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun</a>. Released way back in 2021 on PC, this substantial expansion has now made its way to console around <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/29/shadow-tactics-developer-mimimi-games-is-shutting-down-following-shadow-gambit-release/">a year after Mimimi Games closed down</a>.</p>
<p>Taking place towards the endgame of Blades of the Shogun, Aiko‚Äôs Choice unapologetically throws the player in at the deep end. Because of this, the storyline never lands ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to be invested when you honesty can‚Äôt remember any of the backstory that is being liberally referred to. Additionally, from the get-go, you have near every character, every ability, and every game mechanic at your disposal. It is overwhelming, and the developer makes little to accommodate to those, like me, who last played the original game some eight years ago.</p>
<p>As such, you really just have to figure things out as you go. Which, admittedly, isn‚Äôt for everyone. Indeed, considering the timescales between the original game‚Äôs release and this (again) standalone expansion, a new tutorial level, drip-feeding characters and concepts, would most certainly have been welcome. Yet, stick with it, persist, and you‚Äôll be rewarded with one of the best stealth-strategy games out there.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs the clear rules of Shadow Tactics that sets it apart from many of its stealth contemporaries. Being able to see the view cone of any enemy with a click, or to know which foes on the entire map can see a certain location, is glorious. It‚Äôs a stealth game that doesn‚Äôt prat about, if an enemy can see your player character, then they see them, if they can‚Äôt, they can‚Äôt. Even better, your foes have just enough brains to make them interesting. Kill every soldier on a samurai‚Äôs path and they‚Äôll soon get wise, going in search of the mysterious culprit.</p>
<p>Because of these coherent and well sigh-posted rules, you don‚Äôt get naffed off when you are spotted and everything goes to hell, you know that it‚Äôs because you went wrong and there will be an optimum way through that section, you just have to experiment to find it. That said, when you are spotted, it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs all over. Part of Shadow Tactics charm is when things get bombastic, you must think fast and improvise, hacking your way through foes and somehow emerging alive at the end.</p>

<p>The difficulty is steep in Aiko‚Äôs Choice, and progress is slow, but having an intelligent enemy who pushes back challenges you to best utilise your character‚Äôs abilities and tools. To have your varied heroes work together in perfect synchronicity. This is made easier thanks to the superb controls and display ‚Äì if only every PC port could be this well thought through ‚Äì and made enjoyable thanks to the sheer brilliance that is Shadows mode.</p>
<p>Shadows mode enables you to set a series of inputs and commands for every character. Then, with the tap of a button, you can see your finely honed plan carried out ‚Äì there will be fist-pumps of delight when it works, sighs of despondency and a quick load when it doesn‚Äôt.</p>
<p>Seeing five different characters, all performing their contrasting actions together coherently, wiping out a host of enemies in one collective and fluid motion simply never gets old. As Hayoto leaps from a rooftop to pin down a foe lured by Yuki‚Äôs decoy, Aiko strikes under covering fire from the marksman Takuma, whilst Mugen fends off a pack of ambushers that you spotted lurking nearby. I‚Äôm not sure strategy video games get more satisfying than this.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bulletstorm">Bulletstorm</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/outriders">Outriders</a> developer People Can Fly has announced that they are laying off 120 employees, as they reduce a self-publishing strategy and suspend or scale down work on multiple projects.</p>
<p>Posting the public announcement on social media, People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski said:</p>


<p>‚ÄúThe videogame market is still evolving, and we have to adjust with where things are today. We are redoubling our efforts with new work for hire engagements and focusing on the development of a single independent game.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe believe in our teams, games, and their potential, and we remain extremely committed to continuing that journey, but we need to tailor our plans to our financial capacity. [‚Ä¶]
</p><p>‚ÄúWe recognize this is a profoundly challenging time for our team members, as we say goodbye to valued colleagues who have contributed so much. We are focused on supporting those impacted during this transition providing them with resources and assistance to navigate this change, and are equally committed to caring for those staying, who are managing the challenges of losing coworkers and friends. Our priority is to approach this moment with compassion and to ensure our team feels supported as we work together to build a stronger future.‚Äù</p>
<p>People Can Fly had over 700 employees before the layoffs ‚Äì <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241128230626/https://peoplecanfly.com/#who-we-are">the most recent headcount update</a> on their site came at the end of last month ‚Äì spread across multiple locations in Poland, the UK, Ireland, and North America. The company had grown massively over the past decade, numbering around 40 when they regained independence from Epic Games in 2015. It‚Äôs not clear where the layoffs will be coming from, with PCF Publishing HQ in Dublin, Ireland, a likely position, and whichever studios were heading up the affected projects.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a trying time for the games industry as a whole, and a truly sucky time of year to be making layoffs, so we wish all those affected the very best.</p>
<p>The company had six codenamed projects in development and two of the self-published efforts are affected: Project Victoria, which is being completely suspended, and Project Bifrost, which is being scaled back. Other projects that have external backing are seemingly unaffected at this time, named Project Gemini with Square Enix, Project Maverick with Xbox and Project Echo with Krafton. Project Bison is still self-published, but as a VR title it could potentially have some external funding or exclusivity to assist it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-executive-says-exclusivity-will-be-considered-on-a-case-by-case-basis/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft's Xbox finally has a Game of the Year contender in a popular category such as action/adventure (or, as I called it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a>, adventure/action) with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. It's a bit ironic that it launched a couple of weeks too late to be considered for The Game Awards show that goes live tomorrow.</p>
<p>Regardless of that, Microsoft and all parties involved (Bethesda, MachineGames, LucasFilm) are very happy about the great reception of the game. Speaking to Variety after the reviews hit, Xbox president of game content and studios Matt Booty also discussed the exclusivity topic, suggesting that it will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><em>We are very much making the exclusivity and windowing decisions on a game by game basis, and each of our studios is in a little bit of a different position. There‚Äôs also the production timeline on a game, so the decision on spacing comes there first. We want to make sure there‚Äôs a great experience for our Xbox players, and then the gap between when it becomes available on PlayStation is as much a production decision as it is anything else. This is a game that was in production before we acquired Bethesda, even.</em></p>
<p>This sounded like a partial backtrack compared to Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest statement</a> that there were no 'red lines' when it came to Xbox exclusives being ported to other consoles.</p>
<p>With Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, the situation was a bit more complex. As mentioned by Booty, the game started development ahead of Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax. As such, it was originally<a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesdas-indiana-jones-game-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> not planned</a> to be an Xbox exclusive. That changed later as Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-game-will-be-pc-xbox-exclusive-and-day-1-on-gp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to launch the game only on Xbox and PC to boost its Game Pass subscription service. To do so, they had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-exclusivity-indiana-jones-made-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amend the contract</a> with Lucasfilm (and Disney).</p>
<p>However, Microsoft's stance on exclusivity toward rival consoles has changed drastically in the last few months, beginning with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ports of Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, and Grounded</a>. Consequently, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle got a simultaneous <a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?q=indiana+jones+timed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release date announcement</a> for PC and Xbox and a release window for PlayStation 5, leaving some Xbox fans a bit baffled.</p>
<p>Following Spencer's statement, it seemed like there were no barriers anymore, but Booty's words leave some room for Microsoft to potentially keep some exclusives close to its chest. The general trend is clearly to maximize revenue by releasing games on as many platforms as possible, though.</p>
<p>Their next big console exclusive is Obsidian's <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a>, due to launch on February 18 for PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/short-trip-browser-game">First covered by Alice O</a> (RPS in peace) in 2017, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">Short Trip</a> was a chill hand-drawn game about driving a tram through a mountain populated by cats. Back then, it was only available as a free-to-play browser or itch.io experience. Seven years later, though, and on this very day, it's out on Steam. Not only that, it's arriving with all the tramming of the original, with an added "scheduled mode" that adds more charm to an already lovely game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Hand-drawn "over five years", Short Trip is the work of developer Alexander Perrin. And in it, you use the left and right keys to drive a tram across a sketched mountainscape. As you trundle past trees and nice cottages, you'll drop off cat passengers and pick up new ones. There's no ultimate aim here, besides chilling out, absorbing the wonderful aesthetics, and feeling more zen once you've had your fill.</p>

<p>The new "Scheduled" mode syncs up with your computer's clock to create a "tram timetable". This means you'll need to reach each station at the right time, with a view to chasing a high score. I imagine this takes away a little of the zen, but then again, nobody's forcing you to play the mode. Who needs to follow a timetable, anyway? I know that UK-based trains certainly don't.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that you can still play the free web version over on <a href="https://alexanderperrin.com.au/paper/shorttrip/">Alexander Perrin's official site</a> - it just won't contain the new scheduled mode.</p>
<p>Short Trip looks like a really nice way to decompress and you can find it over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3187700/Short_Trip/">Steam here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ever wondered what the intro cutscene to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver</a> would sound like voiced by Solid Snake actor David Hayter? Quite specific of you, but a new documentary from Noclip might just have what you‚Äôre looking for. The Past, Present &amp; Future of Soul Reaver interviews key developers from the action adventure game, and about halfway through host Danny O‚Äô Dwyer gets hold of some archive materials, including old audition tapes. These include Mark Hamill reading for Janos Audren, and Jennifer Hale for Ariel.</p>
<p>The biggest treat, of course, is hearing Hayter read for Raziel, especially as it‚Äôs that excellent opening monologue. You‚Äôll find the video below, with Hayter around 37:30.</p>

<p>Hayter and Hale aren‚Äôt the only <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> actors that read for parts across the Legacy Of Kain series. There‚Äôs also Colonel Campbell‚Äôs Paul Eiding as the Elder God, Liquid Snake‚Äôs Cam Clarke as Blood Omen 2‚Äôs Marcus, and another Raziel reading by Psycho Mantis‚Äôs Doug Stone. They‚Äôre all fantastic, of course, although it‚Äôs hard to imagine Soul Reaver voiced by anyone else. You can toy with fate, chronology, and destiny, but you don‚Äôt <a href="https://youtu.be/4DOKzTHaPfM">mess with perfection</a>.</p><p>Noclip‚Äôs entire documentary is very much worth a watch, featuring interviews with the series‚Äô art director Daniel Cabuco, programmer Scott Krotz, and also Ben Starr for some reason. It‚Äôs a great reminder how much technical wizardry and clever comprimises went into getting Soul Reaver running on such limited hardware.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legacy-kain-soul-reaver">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</a> 1 &amp; 2 Remastered released yesterday, and seems to have had a broadly positive reception. And, just personally speaking, it‚Äôs quite special to see the long-dormant series getting some love again. I‚Äôm a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ode-to-kain-from-blood-omen-and-his-legacy-including-untitled-goose-game">Blood Omen hipster</a>, of course, but the entire series means a great deal to me.

            <p>Marvel Rivals game director Thaddeus Sasser has said he believes PlayStation sci-fi shooter Concord failed because it didn't bring anything of "unique value" to its players.</p>
<p>Sasser's own game Marvel Rivals released last week across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-hero-shooter-marvel-rivals-off-to-heroic-start-on-steam">confident start on Steam specifically</a>, the free-to-play shooter went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">welcome over 10 million players on its debut weekend</a>. In contrast, and despite high hopes from Sony, Concord failed to take off in the same way. Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">a lacklustre launch</a> in August, the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PC and PS5 debut</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/marvel-rivals-dev-concord-failed-it-didnt-bring-any-unique-value/">VideoGamer</a> <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/podcasts/new-videogamer-podcast-3-marvel-rivals-interview-w-thaddeus-sasser/">podcast</a> prior to Marvel Rivals' release, Sasser said he believed Concord didn't bring anything original to the table which would entice players to jump over from other popular shooters already on the market. "There's a switching cost," the director said. "I've already invested in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, I've got 15 skins for Pharah, I'm not going anywhere."</p>

<p>"As a game developer you're always worried until the audience has responded," the Marvel Rivals director continued, admitting he was cautious about releasing another free-to-play hero shooter into the wild.</p>
<p>"The truth is that I don't think anybody can accurately predict this or the game industry would be radically different today. There's a lot of games that come out that people are like 'it's going to do well' then it flops or people come out and go 'it's going to flop' and it succeeds amazingly. So, I think it's really hard to tell ahead of time and you're always worried about that."</p>
<p>Sasser believes Marvel Rivals has the fact that players can take on the guise of well known superheroes in its favour, and this hook gives people a reason to check out the game.</p>
<p>"I don't know about you, but when I heard the concept of the game I was like 'Oh my God I want to go be Storm in a game', 'I want to go be Doctor Strange in a game'. I want to be those heroes in the game, that sounds awesome," he said.</p><p>"And of course my mind immediately leapt to all the cool possibilities you could have with that. That's what I think will pull people in as well too. If we've done our jobs well, they'll love what they play and they'll want to play some more."</p>
<p>The numbers speak for themselves. At the time of writing, there are still 197,120 Steam players in the game, with a 24 hour concurrent player peak of 441,152. Its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a>, meanwhile, sit with a 'Mostly Positive' average.</p>

						<h5>Fairy Tail 2</h5><p><span>December 11th, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch</span>
						</p></div><div>

			<p>Despite some of its shortcomings, such as the excessive amount of busywork for quests, guild development, and other mechanics that dragged the experience down, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fairy-tail-review/">the first proper adaptation</a> of Fairy Tail in JRPG form developed by Gust managed to be rather successful, mostly thanks to the faithful rendition of the charming characters created by Hiro Mashima. Still, no one expected the game to receive a sequel, so its announcement earlier this year came as a complete surprise.</p>
<p>Adapting the Alvarez Arc, the seventeenth and final story arc of the main series, Fairy Tail 2 also attempts to address the most glaring issues of its predecessor by reducing the amount of busywork and introducing a new combat system that combines turn-based and real-time elements to feel more involving and engaging. In some ways, the changes are quite welcome and make for a snappier experience, but not every drastic change has been for the best.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241202194349_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As mentioned above, Fairy Tail 2 adapts the Alvarez Arc in its entirety, starting from the Fairy Tail guild's fight against Ajeel of Spriggan 12 until the final confrontation against Acnologia. To improve the narration in JRPG format, some events are moved around while others are unsurprisingly glossed over or removed altogether, but the story is exactly the same as the manga and anime at its heart, so fans of the series should expect some of its most important moments to be present in all of their glory.</p>
<p>Adapting the final story arc in a very long story, Fairy Tail 2 doesn't waste any time introducing characters as if they were appearing for the first time. Natsu, Lucy, Erza, Gray, and every other member of the guild is a well-established character at this point, and they are only further developed if the story calls for it in some way. While this was expected, it makes the game not particularly well suited to newcomers, as right from the first few minutes, a barrage of concepts, terms, and locations are thrown at the player, with only the Terminology, which allows players to learn more about certain highlighted terms without having to go through menus, and Glossary features to help them. While these features work well for the most part, there was no way they could provide the same level of engagement or information as actually experiencing the events they summarize, and, as such, they cannot solve an issue that was essentially unsolvable, everything considered.</p>
<p>Even though newcomers to Fairy Tail will inevitably feel lost among all these references to past events and concepts they should already be familiar with at this point in the story, the Fairy Tail 2 story still manages to be engaging, thanks not only to a very fast pace which has events moving rather quickly, and the incredibly charming characters that Hiro Mashima created. While not every member of the guild has their time to shine, those that do are instantly likable, even if the player previously did not know anything about them. At the very least, Fairy Tail 2 does a very good job of getting players interested in Fairy Tail, and it wouldn't surprise me if anybody who didn't know about the series before started reading the manga or watching the anime after experiencing the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241204195006_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After completing the main campaign, Fairy Tail 2 continues with a new journey, Key to the Unknown, which comprises four additional chapters. Compared to the main campaign, the story of the extra campaign, an original tale written in collaboration with series' creator Hiro Mashima, is more lighthearted, but it's still rather enjoyable, providing some hilarious interactions between the vast majority of characters that appeared in the main campaign. At the end of the story, Key to the Unknown also somewhat ties back with the main campaign, so it is definitely worth playing for all Fairy Tails fans. The four chapters are also not particularly long and take two hours tops to play through, so it's not a major time investment, as is the entirety of the game.</p>
<p>A single playthrough of the main campaign and the extra chapters at Balanced difficulty took me around 15 hours and might have taken me even less if I didn't spend some time exploring maps to gather crystals to unlock nodes on the Magic Origin skill trees, three for each character which include passive and active combat skills, stats improvements and more. By all accounts, Fairy Tail 2 is undoubtedly a very short game, especially for a JRPG, but at least the brief playtime allowed for tight pacing that is a breath of fresh air in the genre, considering how many modern games are just padded with filler to extend the playtime.</p>
<p>While Fairy Tail 2 mostly succeeds with its portrayal of story and characters (which shouldn't have been surprising for anyone with some familiarity with the source material), the gameplay is another story. It's not bad by any means, but it's extremely basic and essentially centered on combat. Unlike its predecessor, which twisted features and mechanics from the Atelier series that did make the experience a little more varied even when adding too much busywork that got in the way of enjoyment, Fairy Tail 2 goes the opposite way. All the fluff is gone, and all we are left with is the straightforward exploration of some open-ish fields filled with enemies, items that can be exchanged to "purchase" consumables and Lacrima, special accessories that provide a variety of beneficial effects, and treasure chests. At the beginning of the game, some areas are closed off and will only become explorable later on with some abilities unlocked via story progression, but other than this, traversal and explorations are as basic as they get and pretty unexciting.</p>
<p>The game also only features a couple of towns, including Magnolia, where the Fairy Tail guild resides, but they essentially function as the open fields, and no dungeons whatsoever. Considering the story it tells, it's not surprising to see the gameplay be so constrained by it, but it's still a little disappointing, as the lack of anything meaningful to do outside of following the story, completing some boring fetch quests, collecting Plue clones scattered all over, experiencing Character Episodes at campfires, and fighting enemies, makes the entire experience rather linear and one-dimensional.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241205185056_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>With the experience centered around fighting enemies, the combat system, at least, does not disappoint, being one of the best features of Fairy Tail 2. Doing away with a traditional turn-based system, Gust went with a very interesting system that gives players more agency during both offense and defense. Controlling one character in a party of up to three characters, it is possible to use regular attacks to fill up an SP bar, which can be spent to use a variety of special skills that target single or multiple enemies, buff, debuff, or heal party members. Using skills also increases the Fairy Rank, and every time it does, not only does the maximum amount of SP that can be stored increase, but it also becomes possible to use more powerful Extreme Magic attacks. Using skills appropriately, it is also possible to Break enemies by depleting another gauge and unleashing Link Attacks with other uncontrolled party members, which grant some beneficial effects, and Assault Raids against enemies that have more than a single Break bar, which deal a lot of damage and grant even more beneficial effects.</p>
<p>Add the ability to guard against attacks at almost any time, elemental weakness and resistances, Support characters whose attacks are triggered by fulfilling certain conditions, Awakening mode, which increases the power of characters and lets them unleash even more powerful skills, and the ability to switch between all ten playable characters on the fly, and you get a rather dynamic combat system where changing characters constantly is the way to go. In many ways, the Fairy Tail 2 combat system feels like a more turn-based variant of the combat system of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy</a>, so if you have mastered Remake and Rebirth's combat mechanics, you will probably feel right at home in the game.</p>
<p>From a visual and technical standpoint, Fairy Tail 2 also delivers, for the most part. While locations are not particularly well detailed, sporting average lighting, designs, and texture work, the cel-shaded character models are a joy to look at. With great animation work to boot, seeing characters in action in both cutscenes and combat feels like watching an episode of the show. The generally undemanding visuals, which are not surprising at all since the game is also releasing on Nintendo Switch, mean that most PC players shouldn't have trouble running the game at high resolution, quality setting and framerate.</p>
<p>The machine used for the test (i7-13700F CPU, RTX 4080 GPU, 32 GB RAM) had no trouble running the game at native 4K resolution, and the settings in the screenshots below at 100+ FPS most of the time. During a benchmark session held in the Clover region running around and fighting enemies, the game ran at an average of 128 FPS, 65 FPS 1% Low, with no noticeable stuttering, although there were times during my playthrough where I experienced some minor performance hiccups which didn't impact the experience in any way. Those who cannot run the game decently on their machines at high native resolution can also enable the Intel XeSS upscaler, which is, quite surprisingly, the only upscaler supported by the game at launch.</p>

<p>From its announcement, Fairy Tail 2 clearly looked like a labor of love crafted for fans already enamored with Natsu, Lucy, Erza, Gray, and the rest of the guild, and in this regard, Gust delivered an enjoyable, albeit one-dimensional, experience. However, the game's short length and lack of meaningful side activities limit its appeal, making it hard to justify the full price for those unfamiliar with Hiro Mashima's charming characters and their adventures.</p>

				<p>Adapting the final explosive story arc of the original story, Fairy Tail 2 is a game that goes straight to the point, featuring charming characters and a well-crafted combat system that makes fighting the forces of the Alvarez Empire incredibly fun. The lack of any involving side activity, lackluster world design and very short length, however, limit the appeal of the experience only to fans of Hiro Mashima's works, as there simply isn't enough for those who are already in love with Fairy Tail to justify a purchase.</p>

            <p>
Xenoblade studio Monolith Soft is now 100 percent owned by Nintendo. 
</p>
<p>
Based in Tokyo, with a second office in Nintendo's home of Kyoto, Monolith Soft has become a key partner studio for the Mario maker over the past two decades, and has provided development support for some of Nintendo's biggest titles, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, Nintendo has increased its stake in the company to fully own it, after initially purchasing 80 percent of Monolith Soft from Bandai Namco in 2007. Nintendo then increased its stake to 96 percent in 2011, while the company's original owners retained a symbolic four percent stake.

<p>
Nintendo has not officially announced the change, but its 100 percent ownership of the company was recently added to Monolith Soft's website, as spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-now-owns-100-of-monolith-soft/">Automaton</a>.
</p>
<p>
Monolith Soft began its era as a Nintendo-exclusive studio in 2008 with a range of smaller titles, including Wii shooter Disaster: Day of Crisis and RPG Soma Bringer for Nintendo DS.
</p>
<p>
But it was the 2010 launch of Wii RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> which saw Monolith Soft find its new niche. Three sequels have followed, with Wii U game re-release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>: Definitive Edition set to launch on Switch in March 2025.
</p><p>
In the background, Monolith Soft has also provided extra development support to Nintendo's own internal development houses. It has assisted Nintendo with all three <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> titles, the past three Animal Crossing games, and is now a regular co-developer on The Legend of Zelda series, with credits on Skyward Sword, A Link Between Worlds, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
What could the studio be working on next for Switch 2?

            <p>Employees at FromSoftware owner Kadokawa are reportedly optimistic about a potential buyout from Sony due to frustration with current management.</p>
<p>Kadokawa suffered a ransomware cyberattack earlier this year, but employees were left disappointed by the response from current president and CEO Takeshi Natsuno.</p>
<p>As a result, employees are said to be "thrilled at the prospect of an acquisition by Sony", according to a new report from Japanese outlet <a href="https://bunshun.jp/articles/-/75402">Bunshun</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/kadokawas-employees-are-reportedly-optimistic-about-a-sony-buyout-because-theyre-itching-for-a-change-in-leadership/">Automaton</a>).</p>

<p>"The people around me are thrilled at the prospect of an acquisition by Sony," a veteran Kadokawa employee told Bunshun.</p>
<p>"That's because there's a certain number of employees who are dissatisfied with the Natsuno administration, which didn't even bother to hold a press conference after peoples' personal information was leaked in the cyberattack. They expect that if Sony were to acquire the company, they would get rid of the president first."</p>
<p>The cyberattack against Kadokawa included video streaming platform NicoNico, as well as personal employee information as part of 1.5 terabytes of stolen data.</p>
<p>Former chairman Tsuguhiko Kadokawa - part of the company's founding family - was reportedly "surprised, but appeared positive" about a Sony acquisition, according to a Bunshun source at the company.</p>
<p>Kadokawa himself resigned from the company in October 2022 following allegations of bribing an official of the Tokyo Olympic Games. Kadokawa denied the charges.</p>
<p>Conversely, economic analyst Takahiro Suzuki told Bunshun Kadokawa had little to gain from the acquisition. "Kadokawa will lose its independence, and management will become stricter," he said. "If they want to keep developing their business as freely as they have until now, [the acquisition] would be a bad choice. They'd have to be prepared for publications that don't lead to IP creation being put under scrutiny."</p>
<p>News of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony possibly acquiring Kadokawa</a> emerged from a Reuters report last month. The following day, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">Kadokawa acknowledged the takeover interest from Sony</a>.</p>
<p>"The Company has received an initial letter of intent to acquire the Company's shares, but no decision has been made at this time," said Kadokawa at the time.</p>
<p>Still, the news has in part led to a <a href="https://x.com/xMBGx/status/1866510846098338042">sharp increase in Sony's stock value in Japan</a>, which is currently the highest since 2000. As the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/sony-group-shares-hit-record-closing-high-3035c869?">Wall Street Journal reported</a>, stock value has been on the rise for the past month following strong financial results from Sony and its profitable game segment.</p>
<p>As for what's next from FromSoftware, president Hidetaki Miyazaki stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-2-is-not-in-development-says-fromsoftwares-miyazaki">a sequel to Elden Ring is not in development</a>, but the company does have multiple projects in the works.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Despite having previously said they were done with developing and improving <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, CD Projekt Red has just release Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.2, which brings with it a fresh set of customisation options and an overhauled photo mode‚Ä¶ and some bonus secrets.</p>
<p><iframe title="REDstreams ‚Äî Cyberpunk 2077 | Update 2.2 Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIlOthAEggI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The photo mode overhaul is going to be the biggest new feature for keen video game shutterbugs. It now gives a fully independent Drone Camera that‚Äôs no longer set to orbit around V, and has an increased range. You can also toggle collision detection on and off, lock it, set a precision mode, spawn up to 3 NPCs to adjust and pose how you wish, spawn light sources, set effect intensity, and more.</p>
<p>That will go nicely with the expanded character customisation options with more eye colours, lip make up types, nail colours, scars, eyebrows, tattoos and on and on. The character creator randomiser now has a Plain-to-Punk slider as well, if you just want a vibe quickly.</p>
<p>More cars can use the Rayfield CrystalCoat tech, which lowers NCPD wanted level, and Twintone lets you scan a car you‚Äôre driving past and zap its colour scheme to your car in a flash.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there‚Äôs a smattering of other bug fixes and quality of life tweaks, and the curious note, ‚ÄúAdded more secrets to discover in Night City.‚Äù</p>
<p>Intriguing.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the full Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.2 patch notes:</p>
<h4><strong>New Features</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rayfield‚Äôs CrystalCoat‚Ñ¢ technology, initially designed for Rayfield vehicles only, has now been adopted by other car manufacturers. You can now change the paint jobs on Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra and Villefort vehicles. Pro tip: Use CrystalCoat‚Ñ¢ to fool the cops and lower your NCPD wanted level!</li>
<li>Kiroshi presents TWINTONE‚Ñ¢! As CrystalCoat‚Ñ¢ continues to in gain popularity, TWINTONE‚Ñ¢ takes your paint jobs to the next level. Simply scan a car with your Kiroshi optics, switch to the TWINTONE‚Ñ¢ tab, then save the vehicle‚Äôs color scheme for a small fee. You‚Äôll then be able to select the scheme in the TWINTONE‚Ñ¢ database under the CrystalCoat‚Ñ¢ menu. There, you‚Äôll also find generic color schemes for all CrystalCoat‚Ñ¢-compatible vehicles as well as unique color schemes exclusive to the vehicle model from which they were copied. Please note that color scheme cloning is not authorized on vehicles that are linked to quests, belong to the NCPD or that are incompatible with CrystalCoat‚Ñ¢ tech.</li>
<li>All vehicles compatible with CrystalCoat‚Ñ¢ and TWINTONE‚Ñ¢ are marked with a spray can icon on Autofixer.</li>
<li>The ten most requested vehicles from the streets of Night City are now available for purchase on Autofixer:
<ul>
<li>Mizutani Shion MZ1</li>
<li>Mizutani Shion Targa MZT</li>

<ul>
<li>Following Act 1, Johnny will now sometimes appear in the passenger seat while V is driving to comment on and react to what‚Äôs happening.</li>
<li>We‚Äôve overhauled Photo Mode and added multiple community-requested features:
<ul>
<li>Drone Camera is now a free camera instead of an orbital camera centered around V.</li>
<li>Increased camera range.</li>
<li>Full Collision (ON/OFF) ‚Äì determines whether the camera respects in-game object collisions.</li>
<li>Lock Camera (ON/OFF) ‚Äì locks the camera to avoid misclicking and ruining the frame.</li>
<li>Precise Camera (ON/OFF) ‚Äì slows the camera down for easier aiming.</li>
<li>Aspect Ratio (PC-only. Custom-resolution screenshots are not available on consoles. Console systems can only export images in the standard 16:9 format.)</li>
<li>Characters tab: Spawn up to 3 NPCs for your photo, with a list of over 20 characters to choose from. You can adjust their expression, pose and position.</li>
<li>Lighting tab: Spawn and adjust light sources.</li>

The Gallery pulls .png images from the screenshots folder on your PC or from your console gallery.

<li>Added more secrets to discover in Night City.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Quests &amp; Open World</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rephrased objectives for quests that tell you to wait a specific amount of time to progress. The game is designed in a way that doesn‚Äôt always allow players to simply skip in-game time to advance the objective, instead requiring them continue playing to trigger the next event.</li>

<li><em>I‚Äôve Seen That Face Before</em> ‚Äì The garage door preventing players from reaching the meeting point will now be open.</li>
<li><em>Run This Town</em> ‚Äì The elevator in the Heavy Hearts club is now back in service, so V can finally meet with Mr. Hands.</li>

</ul>
<h4><strong>Gameplay</strong></h4>
<ul>

<li>Fixed ray-traced shadows for V in Photo Mode.</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-controller-showcased-in-great-detail-in-new-video.1057653/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A great new look at the alleged Nintendo Switch 2 form factor and screen has arrived today, thanks to a new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago.</p>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SwitchUpYt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SwitchUp</a> was recently sent a detailed 3D-printed mock-up of Nintendo's yet-to-be-revealed new console by a Chinese <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-case-possibly-leaked-through-alibaba/">case</a> manufacturer, so it is safe to assume that their accessories have been produced based on this design. In the video, the 3D-printed mock-up and Joy-Con controllers are also compared with the current OLED model and controllers, highlighting the design, screen, and feel differences.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ok So Someone Sent Us THAT Switch 2 Mock Up &amp; It‚Äôs CASE‚Ä¶We Have Thoughts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nacn4yqUY1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At this point, it definitely feels like we know everything about the Nintendo Switch 2 before its official announcement, as this isn't the first time we have seen a 3D-printed mock-up of the system. We also know much about what it will be capable of, thanks to the leaked specifications of the NVIDIA Tegra T239 chip that will power the system. However, it will still be interesting to see if the system will come with any feature that hasn't been leaked and how it will use those that have, such as NVIDIA DLSS, which will likely be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-may-not-target-4k-1080-resolution/">widely used in games</a> but won't be able to target 4K and the screen's native 1080p resolution output in the most demanding titles.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-end-of-the-year/">revealed</a>. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> has joined <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-selling-refurbished-steam-decks-and-theyre-dirt-cheap">Valve‚Äôs Certified Refurbished</a> programme, offering a much cheaper way of getting your hands on the best handheld PC around. Provided you don‚Äôt mind it being in someone else‚Äôs first, anyway. As with official refurbs of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, "certified" Steam Deck OLEDs are formerly-broken models that have been returned to Valve, fixed up and tested in-house, then <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished" target="blank">put back on the market at steep discounts</a>. You‚Äôre looking at ¬£389/$439 for the 512GB spec and ¬£459/$519 for 1TB, down from ¬£479/$549 and ¬£569/$649 respectively.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I‚Äôve not used one of these freshened-up Decks myself, but I have had broadly good experiences with professionally refurbished tech ‚Äì a gamepad here, a monitor there ‚Äì so I‚Äôve nothing against the concept. Especially when it makes the already-worthwhile Steam Deck OLED even more attainable, next to increasingly pricey rivals like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zotac-zone-review">Zotac Zone</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review">Asus ROG Ally X</a>. There are, however, a couple of catches. One, this doesn‚Äôt include either of the limited edition OLED models Valve have released, including that eye-catching <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time">white version</a>. And two, stock availability is going to be unreliable. Both 512GB and 1TB variants are currently out of stock in the UK, though the US seems to have some still going.</p>
<p>The problem is that supply is wholly reliant on Steam Deck OLED owners returning their on-the-fritz handhelds under RMA. The more that selfishly continue to work normally, the fewer opportunities there‚Äôll be to pick up a certified refurb at a bargain price.</p>
<p>As such, if this deal does interest you, it may need to be... <em>provoked</em>. Here are some ideas on how you can get the process moving along:</p>
<ul>
<li>Befriend a Steam Deck owner, then Sellotape over the rear air vents when they aren‚Äôt looking</li>
<li>Start an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/fake-restaurant-tips-on-reddit-a-reminder-of-google-ai-overviews-inherent-flaws/">Angus Steakhouse-style psyop campaign</a> wherein you convince Steam Deck OLED users that it will run faster if fully submerged in a vat of ghee</li>
<li>Walk up to people in the street, slap their Stream Deck OLED out of their hands, then run off laughing</li>
</ul>
<p>You're welcome.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/black-white-photography-sequel-toem-2-is-in-development/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-white-photography-sequel-toem-2-is-in-development.1057644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/black-white-photography-sequel-toem-2-is-in-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Toem 2 was teased during the Wholesome Snack stream, revealing that a sequel to the black and white game of photography is on the way.</p>
<p><iframe title="TOEM 2 Teaser Trailer | Wholesome Snack 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ze4DSeIhYAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There‚Äôs just a little bit of blurb about the game from developer Something We Made:</p>
<p>Step back into the shoes of a curious photographer and set off on a brand new adventure all about uncovering hidden details, helping friends along the way, and documenting the world‚Äôs little wonders in TOEM 2, the sequel to the acclaimed TOEM.</p>
<p>Yup, it‚Äôs a straight up sequel and looks to be following very much in the photographs of footprints of the original. You‚Äôll play as a keen shutterbug who‚Äôs keen to explore the world around them through the lens of their camera, as you explore there‚Äôs plenty of people to help out with your photography skills, earning stamps needed to get the next free bus trip to another place.</p>

<p>All of this, of course, is in black and white, which gives the game its distinctive look.</p>
<p>For our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/27/toem-review-a-delightful-photo-adventure/">the original Toem</a>, Nic said, ‚ÄúToem might be short, but with the number of challenges, and you can finish it an afternoon if you‚Äôre looking for something fun and relaxing to throw yourself at, or dip in and out to complete every little side mission. With the winter evenings drawing in, Toem is the kind of game I can see myself coming back to with a hot chocolate and a blanket, as I settle in to bring a little joy to the denizens of the world of Toem.‚Äù</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulletstorm">Bulletstorm</a>, Painkiller and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outriders">Outriders</a> developers People Can Fly are "suspending or parting ways" with over 120 people, shelving one video game project, downsizing another, and "restructuring some of our support teams" in the face of market turmoil.</p><!--more-->
<p>"This action became necessary as external market pressures persisted beyond our forecasts," writes chief executive officer Sebastian Wojciechowski on <a href="https://x.com/PCFPeopleCanFly/status/1866531267464007759">Xitter</a>. "The video game market is still evolving, and we have to adjust with where things are today. We are redoubling our efforts with new work for hire engagements and focusing on the development of a single independent game."</p>
<p>Based in Warsaw, People Can Fly date back to 2002, finding early success with FPS Painkiller. They collaborated extensively with Epic Games during the noughties, and became a subsidiary of the Gears studio in 2012. Since splitting from Epic in 2015, they've expanded significantly, founding a satellite studio in Newcastle in 2017, another Polish studio in Rzesz√≥w in 2018, and a fourth studio in New York in 2019. They became a public company in 2020, subsequently acquiring Phosphor Studios, Game On, and Incuvo Studios. By 2023, People Can Fly had over 600 staff, with seven projects on the books that July.</p>
<p>But People Can Fly haven't escaped the industry's on-going economic troubles, which have led to thousands of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a> this year as company leaders "realign" in the wake of a gaming boom created by pandemic lockdown conditions. In January this year, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/people-can-fly-and-black-forest-games-hit-by-layoffs-according-to-sources-and-leaked-emails">dismissed 30 developers</a> who were working on an unannounced Square Enix game. In April, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-outriders-studio-have-cancelled-development-on-a-co-op-action-rpg">announced the cancellation</a> of a co-op action-RPG codenamed Project Dagger, which was once to be published by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> company Take-Two.</p><p>People Can Fly's last release was Bulletstorm VR, an updated, magic-headset version of the shooter in which you boot mooks into cacti or swing them around with an energy leash. In theory, their next one will be Project Gemini, which is expected sometime in 2026. Best of luck to everybody who has lost their jobs this week, just a couple of weeks before the seasonal holidays.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>We're just one day away from The Game Awards 2024, Geoff Keighley's end-of-the-year ceremony that crowns the best games released throughout 2024 and also serves as a veritable hype machine for what's coming next in the industry.</p>
<p>Video Game Chronicle's Andy Robinson already <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2024-will-have-big-news-says-vgcs-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyped up this year's show</a>, and now Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has doubled down on the claim. Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8_XQdX8cEE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest Kinda Funny videocast</a>, Schreier said:</p>
<p><em>What can I say without getting in trouble... so I know about a couple of announcements that'll be there, and they would qualify as big announcements. That said, like, big announcements are games that won't be out for years. I think there's a good chance that you'll see one or two teaser trailers for a game that is like 2026 or even later in many cases.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] I mean, yeah, there are at least two things that will make you guys reacting be like holy [ __ ], like, I can't believe this thing is here. At least two things, I'll say that.</em></p>
<p>Schreier namedropped Quantic Dream's <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-announced-by-quantic-dream-and-lucasfilm-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars: Eclipse</a> and Monolith's <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-single-player-open-world-game-in-development-at-monolith-will-use-the-nemesis-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonder Woman</a> as the type of announcement he's referring to: very big games, but several years away from being available. Still, they should get people excited.</p>
<p>However, if you're one of those pining for a Bloodborne sequel or remaster for PlayStation 5 and PC (although emulator ShadPS4 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-reduced-vram-dynamic-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making great strides</a>), Schreier already axed that possibility with a brief 'It's not' post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hb95p2/comment/m1evpg7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>We do <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> for a fact that we'll be getting trailers for Take-Two's Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4 at The Game Awards 2024. As a reminder, the pre-show goes live at 4:30 PM Pacific Time from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. The whole thing will last around three hours and a half, which is a bit of a nightmare for us Europeans, unfortunately.</p>

            <p>I am a Winter baby. My birthday is very close to Christmas, and so you‚Äôd think this might make me immune to the serotonin-sapping effects of the greyest season in a ‚ÄúI was born of the cold. Moulded by it‚Äù kind of way. No such luck, I‚Äôm afraid. So, since there‚Äôs only so many Vitamin D supplements and delightfully festive lunchtime Gin and Tonics one can consume, I figured I‚Äôd ask: what are your favourite comfort games for the bleaker months? The special places you can always rely on for an escape when the weather outside is frightful, and the Cosy Fireplace Ambience 4K (10 hours) keeps getting interrupted by adverts for crypto scammers and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/war-thunder">War Thunder</a>.</p>

<p>As Graham recently touched upon in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naiad-review">brilliant Naiad review</a>, relaxing games mean different things to different people, and it‚Äôs often those with more demanding rules and consequences that feel realer, more engaging, more emancipatory. Some of my favourite winter gaming memories in recent years were stocking up on Shin Ramyun for a glorious fortnight spent popping heads in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, or spending weeks in an unwashed Oodie exploring Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth. A happy place in which you brain goons with bicycles is still a happy place. The happiest place, even.</p>
<p>But I also love reading about all how games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> have meant so much to so many people, even if it's never quite caught me the same way. That‚Äôs more towards the self-consciously ‚Äòcosy‚Äô end of the spectrum, but I think something that maybe gets underrated when we talk about games and mental health is what how powerful it can be to have access to a clearly-defined set of tasks that are manageable but still rewarding - something that offers structure and accomplishment when doing anything realer feels too overwhelming to contemplate.</p>
<p>There are also just the games I think we all have, the ones we know we can return to pretty much whenever we need them for a joyous escape. Games that feel wintery and warm. For me, that‚Äôs 90‚Äôs PlayStation JRPGs: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden">Suikoden</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, Wild Arms. Grandia. So, how about you? Which games help you get through the winter? Or, if you love winter - and despite it all, I sort of do too - do you have some winter gaming traditions that just feel as if they suit the season? Do tell!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
