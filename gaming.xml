			<p>Build a Rocket Boy's MindsEye is an unlikely candidate for the worst video game ever, but the closer we get to the end of 2025, the likelihood of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=15">it being regarded as the worst game this year</a> increases. To say the game has had a rough journey is an understatement, and following <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/">an open letter from 93 Build a Rocket Boy (BARB) employees</a> calling out the studio's leadership for mismanagement, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzn34gwvwo">a new BBC report</a> further details just how Leslie Benzies and BARB's leadership failed their staff and MindsEye's players.</p>



<p>BBC spoke to several former BABR employees, who offered new details about what made MindsEye's development such a poor process. One developer, who the report addresses as Jamie (not their real name) directly points to Benzies lack of direction, saying "<em>Leslie never decided on what game he wanted to make. There was no coherent direction</em>."</p>



<p>Two other former developers, Ben Newbon and Margherita Peloso, added what are arguably the most damning details with how Benzies and management responded when issues from the development team were brought up.</p>



<p>"<em>A lot of the points that we were hammering home on were just ignored and just never actioned,</em>" said Newbon. Peloso adds that when they or other employees would attempt to raise issues, management reportedly "<em>laughed at</em>" the raised concerns.</p>



<p>Issues that Benzies and management did care about, however, were ones that Benzies would spot himself during his own playtesting sessions, a process that BARB actually showed to the public in a promotional video for MindsEye.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MindsEye - Quality Assurance with Leslie Benzies - Dev Diary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ztKumy2bpk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In fairness, it's not an abnormal thing for the director of a game to playtest and point out issues that ought to be taken care of, as the above video shows Benzies doing. The issue that this video doesn't show, that Newbon and Peloso point out, is that the tickets Benzies would call out would suddenly take precedent over everything else. Developers even began calling these tickets "<em>Leslie tickets</em>," "<em>Leslie bugs</em>," or even just "<em>Leslies</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>It didn't matter what else you were doing, what else was being worked on. The Leslie ticket had to be taken care of</em>," said Newbon.</p>



<p>Benzies demanding focus on whatever was most important to him in any particular moment also extended beyond quality assurance and playtesting, as Jamie regarded that, with what was meant to be BARB's first project, Everywhere, Benzies would demand new features be added into the game faster than they could be properly implemented.</p>



<p>This kind of haphazard working style, with no clear vision and new features being implemented before they've been given the necessary time to ensure they're ready is an unfortunately common story we've heard before regarding development cycles that burned out developers, whether the end product was a success or not. </p>



<p>The development of BioShock Infinite is a now infamous story of how Ken Levine was unable let anything be declared 'final,' causing a hectic development environment, to say the least. More recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-details-dragon-age-the-veilguards-troubled-development-and-how-eas-attempt-to-turn-bioware-into-a-live-service-studio-plagued-the-game-all-the-way-to-launch/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a game that suffered from grave mismanagement</a> and a development process that lacked a solid direction.</p>



<p>In both those cases, as with MindsEye, the result was weeks of crunch time for developers. "<em>People just felt like they were being commanded to give a lot to the company without too much in return,</em>" added Peloso. Another former developer, Isaac Hudd, added how in the run up to launch, everything piled up at once, with new bugs appearing the moment a different one was squashed. </p>



<p>"<em>And it does mess with you,</em>" Hudd said. "<em>You really do start to see the morale go down, the little arguments starting to happen. People are burning the candle at both ends and starting to think: 'What's the point?'</em>"</p>



<p>The report does add that Benzies and the leadership team of BARB "<em>take full responsibility</em>" for MindsEye, and added, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-commited-to-refininig-mindseye-major-update-4/">as we've heard before</a>, that the studio is working towards making it up to players and putting out "<em>the game we've always envisioned, and one that players are excited to play</em>."</p>



<p>Those former developers the BBC spoke to, however, don't think the game will ever actually get there. In July, BARB told players <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-updates-less-frequent-hitman-crossover-delayed/">that updates for MindsEye "<em>may be less frequent</em>."</a> It's last update arrived on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3265250/view/515222130291376715?l=english">September 25</a>, with no word as to when the next update will come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Barcelona-based independent developer Epictellers Entertainment came a bit out of nowhere with Starfinder: Afterlight, an upcoming cRPG adapted from Paizo's science fantasy tabletop franchise. Epictellers <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight/description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has sought funding through Kickstarter</a> and, <a href="https://wccftech.com/turn-based-crpg-starfinder-afterlight-reaches-minimum-kickstarter-goal-80-mins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as reported earlier this month</a>, quickly reached the campaign's minimum goal. With sixteen days left on the campaign, they already gathered over €530K, unlocking multiple stretch goals.</p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight already caught our attention, which is why I reached out to Epictellers and set up an interview with the two co-founders, Ricard Pillosu and Albert Jane Goset, to discuss this project, the ongoing Kickstarter campaign, and more.</p>



<p><strong>Tell me a bit about your studio, Epictellers Entertainment.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Albert and I founded the studio in 2023. We come from AAA companies, and we wanted a bit more of creating our own concept of a studio, smaller, and also doing a genre that is not receiving enough pay attention, which is cRPGs. Even after the enormous success of Baldur's Gate 3, not many studios are jumping into these kind of games, and we wanted to give it a try. We are fully independent, and we don't have a publisher; everything we do is by ourselves, and that was the idea.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have prior experience making cRPGs? Or did you use to make other types of games when you worked at triple-A companies?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> No, we have never done a cRPG. We come from very big studios with big productions like Crytek and Smilegate, where normally teams are on the hundreds and technology is very complex and so on. One of the main reasons is that we have always wanted to do a game like this. We always ended up doing shooters and things like that, which are cool, but not really close to our heart. Albert and I have known each other since we were teenagers, and we play tabletop RPGs weekly.</p>



<p>We have both been Dungeon Masters for tons of different games and we always wanted to do it, even from the very first time that we saw Baldur's Gate 1, which was an enormous influence for us and probably one of the reasons we joined the big game industry, but we never got the chance to do one because there are very few studios that work on this genre. So in the end we said, okay, let's create our own.</p>



<p><strong>Like you said, there was kind of a milestone in the genre with the release of Baldur's Gate 3, you could say. After that launch, other cRPG developers said they were worried players would suddenly expect AAA-like values from the genre. What do you think about that? Do you see it as an issue, or are you more focused on the fact that such a big title made more people interested in this type of game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> We were asking ourselves the same question last week. We do not know if people are only now going to pay attention to Baldur's Gate 3 level of quality, which is absolutely unattainable for us. Because we are a very small studio of 30 people, of course. We were very clear about Starfinder: Afterlight. When we <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-pc-early-access-release-date-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced it in August</a>, we put up the screenshots quickly. We aim for the kind of games Owlcat has been doing with this quality, and we see that Owlcat is performing very well commercially. We talked to them, too. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader is a fantastic game</a>, and those are on the AA level. I think that if anything, Baldur's Gate 3's coming has been positive, because there are some things you can translate to AA level. Of course, we are not going to reach that level of audience, that's for sure, but I think there is still a big enough, underserved audience for it, and they are reacting very well, and the Kickstarter is proof of it.</p>

<p><strong>Awesome. And did you cultivate a community base through Discord prior to the launch of the Starfinder: Afterlight Kickstarter? Because it seems like a lot of players were immediately eager to help with the funding</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Albert Jane Goset:</strong> Actually, no, we launched Discord when we started the campaign. No, what we did was announce the game at GenCon, where, actually, Paizo, the IP holders, released the second edition of Starfinder. Pathfinder had already had a second edition a long time ago, and Starfinder's second edition book was released this summer in August, so we announced it together with them. That actually pushed a lot of people already towards the Kickstarter pre-campaign. Then we started showing some bits of information, and with the help of our PR agency, we did some interviews with Polygon and other publications, so that actually helped just carry a little bit the ball forward. We were not expecting that level of contribution. But the idea of the Kickstarter was actually to build a community that can go with us during this journey.</p>



<p><strong>Several cRPGs, like Pillars of Eternity, Divinity: Original Sin, Wasteland 3, and many others, were funded through Kickstarter for a while. Lately, it seems like Kickstarter is being used more rarely, I'd say. Were you nervous before going to Kickstarter with Starfinder: Afterlight? Did you evaluate other options?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Albert Jane Goset:</strong> I mean, I think anyone not nervous about Kickstarter is lying. Kickstarter is a big milestone for us. We are fully funded, so Kickstarter was more about collecting that community and reaching the stuff we couldn't have. For instance, right now, we will add more voice acting because that's one key part of our game. The characters must feel alive, so we need directors to do that. We wanted as much as possible to have voiceover, and Kickstarter is helping. I think that one of the reasons why we did Kickstarter was actually because we knew that a big part of the cRPG community had a Kickstarter account. That helped us decide, okay, let's do that. Let's see how people react. Let's gather this community. That was a big hit. But I think that, being our first Kickstarter and everything, you get nervous because you never know what to expect. Even if you have like 7,000 followers, as we did, you never know what the result will be. So it's always a gamble. But yeah, we are super happy with the community. They reacted super well. We have over 9,650 backers. It's going great.</p>



<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about the partnership with Paizo? Did you consider making your own IP? How did you choose the setting, and how did you approach Paizo for getting the license?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Since we decided that we wanted to do cRPGs, we were looking into getting an IP that could resonate and we were looking for something that was different enough, that felt fresh, something that is a bit uncharted territory. We love Paizo products. We didn't know if they were going to want to work with us, so we knocked on the door, but from the very first meeting, they were fantastic people. They helped us look into all their IPs, not just Starfinder. It was tough to choose, but when we asked about Starfinder, they said, yes, why not? Pitch us, what are your ideas about it? So we went into the cave and crafted what we would like to do with this, showed it to them, and they liked it. The rest is history. We have known the IP since the first edition, and we loved it. At that moment, I think everything clicked with everybody on the team. Everybody's like, wow, Starfinder will be awesome. We were also lucky that they were launching the second edition, so it was a bit of a reset of the whole concept.</p>



<p><strong>Of course, most cRPGs are, as you know, based on fantasy settings. Do you think this will help you, as it is a bit of an underserved niche in sci-fi or science fantasy?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> This was one of the reasons that we wanted to do Starfinder, but we were also scared of sci-fi. It's a niche inside the cRPG, which is already a niche because you normally do fantasy. But this IP is really not hard science fiction. It's more of a fantasy moved into the world of science fiction. It's called science fantasy and allows you to blend magic. In this world, there are gods. There are priests who pray to those gods. But you also have interplanetary travel, spaceship combat, and things like this in the game. So you will have a lot of stuff that Starfinder brings to the table that is fresh, but also resonates with players who are used to fantasy.</p>

So you will have a lot of stuff that Starfinder brings to the table that is fresh, but also resonates with players who are used to fantasy.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>I guess it is more like Star Wars than Star Trek.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Yes, yes. It's more of an adventure. We really resonate more now with Guardians of the Galaxy, which is, again, craziness in space. Let's just have fun. Get our spaceship around and fight the bad guys. But it could be crazy stuff like big creatures roaming in space and magic and doing crazy stuff. It's this kind of tone.</p>



<p><strong>Are you going for a slightly comedic tone with Starfinder: Afterlight? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Yeah, which is quite hard because comedy is complex in video games. But when we play Starfinder ourselves, we have so much fun. It doesn't mean that it's a comedy game. It's the same as in the Guardians of the Galaxy movie. You would not describe it as an actual comedy. It has a comedy element, of course, but it's really an epic adventure in space. But it does not take itself very seriously. And that's what we are aiming for with this game.</p>



<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about the story premise for your game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Well, there are lots of things that are a bit too soon to speak about, but I can say, for example, that the name of the game is Starfinder: Afterlight. And the Afterlight is really a bad thing. It's something that happens that affects the whole galaxy. It's an extinction event you witness, yet somehow, without going into details, you will still have time to prevent. But nobody believes you. So you are there like, this is going to happen. People think you are crazy. So you need to find a new crew and try to see how to ensure it never happens. This involves undead people from a planet called Eox, but that's as much as I can say. At the beginning of the game, you will experience this kind of epiphany and then you get some time to prevent it before it happens. Then you land on a planet called Aquiton, and you need to find a crew there.</p>

People think you are crazy. So you need to find a new crew and try to see how to ensure it never happens.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>I see here on the Kickstarter description that you mention branching narrative and choices. How do you approach this common CRPG feature? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Carefully. That's a lot of work. We have invested quite a lot of time in creating a set of tools for the narrative team to iterate very fast. They normally iterate with the game open. They keep writing and rewriting and adding new lines and removing lines until it feels good. We do a lot of playtests internally until everything is understood and clear. And we make sure that we do, besides the main story, then we do runs expecting other kind of characters and other events. Like, I do this quest first and then this dialogue here changes. If I am a Borai, for example, or I am a soldier, then I have this option and then we do a pass on, okay, option for the soldier, option for this new ancestry. Until it has a lot of variety and every time somebody plays, it feels a very personalized experience. So, long story short, it's just a lot of work. It's really like that.</p>



<p><strong>Will it be possible to complete quests in multiple ways in Starfinder: Afterlight? For example, sometimes without having to fight, via persuasion and stuff like that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Yes, we have some internal rules for all the quests. You need to have quite a few spots to enter the quest, not only one, so you could find four or five sources to get the quest, and then the quest normally needs to have at least three ways of being finished. Fighting your way through is one of the obvious ones, but then we always try to have one that is about talking, that it's about maybe buying something, that it's about maybe circumventing the problem, and going and talk to someone, or complete another quest that will help that person align with you. So we want, as I said, people who will speak about their experience in the game with their friends, and they will be like, oh, you did that? Is that possible? Okay, maybe I will try in my next Starfinder: Afterlight run. We are actually creating more content than the players will experience. Hopefully, as much as time allows, and our budget stretches, we'll have so many options that the players will feel that each run is different.</p>



<p><strong>You estimate a 40-60-hour campaign. How much of that is the critical path, and how much is side content and stuff like that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Compared to what we have worked on before, this type of game is very difficult to measure in time because there are so many ways to play it. The critical path can be done in 40 hours if you move forward very quickly, but it's difficult to move forward very quickly because it's a turn-based combat. You have to upgrade your gear. You need to raise your characters to a higher level and make a lot of choices. So it depends on where your interests are. If your interest is in the narrative, or is in combat, or is in optimizing, or you want to try combat a different way, or save and load again, the experience is going to be slower or faster. But we estimate that in around 40 hours, you will be able to finish the game, but we are internally building way more than that. We are building around 80 to 100 hours of content. Maybe you decide not to take any of the companions. Perhaps you choose to fly solo, maybe you decide to get a mercenary and two companions, and that changes the experience. So we are going to build lots of content, and you will experience around 40 to 50 percent of it.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned that Starfinder: Afterlight is kind of like Divinity Original Sin meets Guardians of the Galaxy. So, with regards to the first part, are you perhaps referring to Larian's environmental interaction? Original Sin had a lot of that, where you could interact with surfaces and other objects in combat to make different reactions. Is that something that you have in the game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> I don't think we will reach the enormous amount of variety that Divinity Original Sin 2 has, but we can do a lot, especially since the science fiction environment allows us many approaches to do things. So first, our game has longer ranges. When you are shooting, you have really long ranges, not like bow and arrow. And you have computers, you can sometimes control machines. We have some classes that allow you to handle magic and handle mechanics and hack computers easily. So there are many ways to do things that are normally not that intuitive in a fantasy setting. Our goal is that you will have as many interactions as we can, but it's our first game and we want to be realistic with the scope.</p>



<p>Let's see how much we can get. For example, one of the things that we sadly need to cut from the scope is flying. In science fiction, it's common that you go into areas without gravity or you have jetpacks and things like this. But again, we're a small team, humble, doing our first game. We decided to keep it to levitation only. Also, bear in mind that we aim to drop a set of modding tools shortly after launch. So if people can expand that and add more variety, they will be more than welcome. But I think that we will ship with a decent variety for the game. One thing that, after Baldur's Gate 3, will be totally unacceptable to ship without is the ability to push people down. Sometimes it is a shortcut to actually kill someone who is very powerful, but if you manage to push them off the cliff, you actually immediately kill them. This is one of the things that absolutely will be there in the game. But others, we are discussing how much we can get there because those are quite complex. </p>

Our goal is that you will have as many interactions as we can, but it's our first game and we want to be realistic with the scope.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Was it hard to adapt the triple action system from the tabletop to Starfinder: Afterlight? Did you have to make any big changes, or just small tweaks?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> Actually, no. One of the things that we loved about Starfinder is that the second edition was going to use Pathfinder second edition rules. When we tried them on tabletop, we always thought those rules are meant to be in a video game because they are well-balanced, they are well-thought, mathematically make a lot of sense, and just moving them into a video game, it's actually not that difficult, especially the three-action system. But there are other things that are complex, especially things that are funny to play around in your imagination when you're in tabletop, but in video games are very difficult to handle. For example, the Ysoki, which are like rat-like folk ancestry, at some point there is one ancestry feat that they can have their tail handle guns. This is actually very simple to just write it, and in tabletop it's very funny to imagine. But the moment we look at it animation-wise and for the rig, that's quite a lot of work. Now we need to have some sort of tail that can handle guns. How do we handle that? Suddenly this could explode into a lot of work. So what we are doing is evaluating what is more feasible, what is less feasible, and then deciding which battles we want to fight. But the core of the system, it actually was fantastic. I prefer to adapt this one than the first edition or, for example, old versions of D&amp;D.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a reaction system similar to D&amp;D or Baldur's Gate, where anyone who faces a foe entering gets a free reaction?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> In Starfinder 2nd Edition, not everybody gets an opportunity attack, you actually need to have a feat, or you need to come from a class that can do it, but yes, we do. And in this case, we are going the Baldur's Gate 3 route, which I think is the best one, which is, by default, you can configure which kind of reactions you want to trigger automatically, which ones you want to ignore, and which ones you want the combat system to ask if you want to use them or not. But yes, there is a full reaction system. </p>



<p><strong>You mentioned the mod support coming later to Starfinder: Afterlight. Do you think players will eventually be able to create full campaigns with this tool? Is that the goal? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> That's what I wish for. I miss the days where with the engine from Neverwinter Nights, you could do amazing things. Again, our scope still needs to be kept realistic, and modding tools are quite a bit of work, but we have been doing all our coding with this mindset. We are using an engine that is not traditional. We are using Godot for this game, and in the spirit of open source, we use Blender for most of our art pipeline. So we are aiming to have those tools that people could use and have some documentation out there so that people may want to add a new animation, a new character, a new thing. Modding goes step-by-step, you need to decide which areas you want to allow modding and then keep growing them. Even Larian added modding later, after shipping its base games, so it's a big, big endeavor, but we have been thinking about it from the start, so I think we will have an easier time. I cannot commit to a date, but our aim is that it will be as moddable as we can. If we can have it our way, people will be able to do a Pathfinder game with it if they want.</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to make Starfinder: Afterlight compatible with Steam Workshop?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> That's the idea from scratch, to work with Steam Workshop and have the game basically connect directly with that backend and allow you to add mods into your game directly connected to Steam Workshop.</p>



<p><strong>Some other games, even Baldur's Gate 3 itself, have integrated with mod.io to allow cross-platform mods that also support consoles. Is that something that's out of your scope for Starfinder: Afterlight, or do you wish it would happen at some point?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> I would say that, I mean, mod.io is fantastic, but it made a lot of sense for Larian because they already were multiplatform when they were targeting that. We are not multiplatform as of right now, we are very PC-oriented. Maybe if the game commercially makes sense, we could make a console version later on, and then we will need to, of course, have those modding tools, if possible, move to those platforms. But for us, it's too soon to look into it.</p>



<p><strong>What about controller support? Will it be available on PC?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> I was shocked personally that people want to play on PC with controller. It seems that it's more and more common that people use this controller, maybe have a PC next to the big TV and then play games like that. We got asked that several times and we were like, no, we are not going to console. They were like, yeah, we know, but we want controller support on PC. Actually, it's not simple. cRPGs are complex with gamepads and we know how different cRPGs try their best, but still it's a difficult marriage there. One of the things that we have in mind is that Starfinder: Afterlight will be shipping on Windows and Linux. We will be able to do a native build for Steam Deck. I don't know when, probably after launch, we'll look into it, but it will be one of the easiest moves for us to make the game running on a Steam Deck. And if you go to a Steam Deck, then you need to make it compatible with gamepad, and that process probably will allow us to have a gamepad compatible mode into the PC version itself. So I suspect that, not for launch, but pretty soon after it.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Romance is a way to go deeper into knowing that character, so we try to have it as an amplifier of certain emotional moments when you are completing quests that are about companions. If you have been romancing this companion, then they will talk to you as a romantic partner and ask you what we can do here, what you would be doing, and the emotion in that moment probably could be amplified because of that factor of the previous romance connection. Also, we try to have romance not in a simplistic way. We try to make them complex and each companion will have a way to judge the things you are doing, and they will be driven a bit by your decisions. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Can you speak a bit about your approach with romances in Starfinder: Afterlight? There are some developers that are not very fond of romance in cRPGs, for example, Obsidian's Josh Sawyer openly said that, but other games have implemented the romance very successfully for their player bases, so what's your take?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> The first take is that they are optional. You could even not take your companions, or you could take your companions and play through the game without romance being a thing in the game. It's very important that it feels optional. Then the second thing is, romance is a way to go deeper into knowing that character, so we try to have it as an amplifier of certain emotional moments when you are completing quests that are about companions. If you have been romancing this companion, then they will talk to you as a romantic partner and ask you what we can do here, what you would be doing, and the emotion in that moment probably could be amplified because of that factor of the previous romance connection. Also, we try to have romance not in a simplistic way. We try to make them complex and each companion will have a way to judge the things you are doing, and they will be driven a bit by your decisions. Romances will be starting in the first act, but you need to be with that companion up until the end when you really get to fully fledge that kind of romance. But we try to make them to take that thing very seriously and make sure that each romance feels different and feels very specific to their personality and even the ancestry of the character, because Starfinder has a big variety. Even yesterday we were still having a discussion on how we deal with a romance, for example, for the Shirren, which is an insect-like ancestry species. </p>



<p>That species understands romance and relationship in a totally different way, and how do you interface with that? Actually, you could be also a Shirren, you could be a different kind of character. Some characters are telepathic, so how does this influence romance? It's quite a big endeavor. But since we understand that cRPGs are an emotional thing, even if I am a very hardcore player of optimizing my characters and do very complex combats and I enjoy combat very much, you need to have this kind of connection with the game. And in that connection normally is the emotion that you beat up, how you imagine those characters in that world or how invested you are with them. Romance needs to be taking care of that factor very seriously and optionally. But I really cannot say much more about it because we don't want to spoil any of the romances in Starfinder: Afterlight. But it's not an easy thing. Let's see how we do it.</p>



<p><strong>One of the big topics nowadays for everything, but specifically with regards to game development, is the usage of AI. So, what's your take on this? Do you think it can be a valuable tool, and do you plan to use it in some ways?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ricard Pillosu:</strong> The problem with AI is that AI should be doing the things that we don't want to do, and it seems that it wants to do the things that we want to do. We want to do games. We want to invent characters. We want to invent worlds. We want to draw them. We want to invent them for that. Why? We don't want AI for that. I mean, this is the fun part of video game development. I would like an AI that does my dishes and cleans my apartment. Then I can stay creative. But we don't have the AI for that. It seems that the AI that we are being pushed into is the AI that removes this kind of creativity. So, no, no. We could be doing other stuff, but we jumped into making games because we truly love inventing those things and seeing how we connect those things. There is no point in using AI for any creative endeavor. So, no, we don't like it. </p>



<p><strong>Just another thing about the Starfinder: Afterlight Kickstarter campaign. Is there a limit to how many stretch goals you've planned?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Albert Jane Goset:</strong> We have a finite number of stretch goals, and yeah, we are not that far off. So I think we still have some of them. We might reach them before the end of the campaign. And that will be like, okay, that's everything we wanted to have for this game, at least for now. So yeah, there is a limit to it.  We don't want to keep adding things. But we wanted to have at least full voiceover, you know, all these kind of things that we are adding as a stretch goal. It's stuff that we feel like it's going to make Starfinder: Afterlight a better game and a full experience for the players. </p>



<p><strong>Indeed, one of the issues with some Kickstarter campaigns for games was that they kept adding a lot of stretch goals and then the project became bloated and everything.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Albert Jane Goset:</strong> Exactly. It's a great thing to just keep pushing things and to get the people engaged, but I think we have a very clear idea of what we want to do with Starfinder: Afterlight, and keeping our scope and our milestones and roadmap in check, it's something that we don't want to change. That's why a lot of stuff will come after, actually, the game is released, and we already said, this is what we're going to ship with, everything else will come later on, but for now, that's what the game will have.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You know, about 24 hours ago I had every intention of pitching a post for </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> about how I could finally forgive </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-alolan-raichu-1851777665"><span>Alolan Raichu</span></a><span>, the surfing, psychic, pancake-loving regional variant of my favorite Pokémon, for its crimes. For many years, I have looked upon Alolan Raichu with disdain as it usurped the Kanto original as The Pokémon Company’s favorite Pikachu evolution. The Alolan mouse was featured in </span><i><span>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</span></i><span>, is a playable character in the MOBA </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite</span></i><span>, and received some significant promo in the anime and </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>. Meanwhile, my boy’s legacy </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>has mostly seen him overshadowed by his own pre-evolution</span></a><span>, and this all began with an episode of the anime that painted him as inferior to Pikachu in battle decades ago. Then, Game Freak announced he was getting not one, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>two Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s DLC</span></a><span>. For a moment, it seemed Raichu would finally get some respect put on his name. I’d decided I could finally forgive Alolan Raichu for stealing the spotlight and let the electric rats coexist in my mind…until this little shit showed up in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> with the audacity of someone who’s never been told “no” in his life.</span></p> <p><span>If you’re wondering where Alolan Raichu is in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, know it is only available in the post-game. I hadn’t given the regional variant much thought until I was heading to do a quest in Lumiose City. There I was, walking toward the Quasartico Inc. building minding my own business, Raichu by my side, when all of a sudden, I see this agitating, dopey, maple-syrup-smelling twerp hovering alongside a woman on the way in. “Pshaw!” I say in my mind as the side quest marker hovers above them, as if inviting me to inquire about this odd-looking rodent when I have spent 30 hours having only seen Raichus that are orange and have their feet planted firmly on the ground. I know who you are, Alolan Raichu, and you’re a war criminal. But then I think, maybe if I do this side quest, they’ll go away and I won’t have to see them next time I come to Quasartico’s office. So I speak to the woman. She introduces herself as Griddella, a member of CHARGE, or “Committee to Highlight Alolan Raichu and Generate Excitement.” I guess even serial killers have fandoms.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637260"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637260">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Griddella asks if our Raichus can battle, and she wants to make some ceremony of it. I have to remove all my other Pokémon from my party before I can complete the quest, so it’s just me and Raichu against Griddella and the Pocket Monster equivalent of Bizarro from </span><i><span>Superman</span></i><span>. The Alolan Raichu we face is decently powerful at level 64, but my guy’s at level 70 and we just finished the endgame, so we’ve faced much tougher foes than this imposter. Raichu smacks Alolan Raichu around the field a bit and then Griddella congratulates us on our win. Alright, cool. Kanto Raichu supremacy has been established. Let’s get back to what we were doing, Raichu. But no, Griddella’s not done with us yet, as she then asks a baffling question: “Let’s trade: your Raichu for my Alolan Raichu! What do you say?”</span></p> <p><span>What do I say, Griddella? I say “Hell fucking no, are you kidding me?” But the game only lets me say “No thanks,” so you will never hear the disgust with which I decline your insult of an offer. Not only have I gone to hell and back with this guy throughout </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s story, but he also just whooped your faker’s ass in the middle of a crowded area of Lumiose City. Why would I reward my king’s loyalty and strength by giving him to you for this second-rate phony? He’s been with me since Day One, and we have journeyed through every region of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe together, saving the day while this guy serves pancakes to people in Alola. When the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC comes out, he’s finally going to undergo Mega Evolution like he should have a decade ago. The Pokémon Company may not respect him, but I do. I’ll never trade my OG for a pretender. Even if it means I’ve gotta see him every time I go to Quasartico’s building because they will not leave unless I make the trade. Guess that quest’s not getting finished. “Ken, just catch another Raichu and trade it.” No! It’s the principle!</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-was-helped-by-last-years-cancellation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-26-was-helped-by-last-year%E2%80%99s-cancellation-developer-says.1329496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Football Manager 26 wouldn’t have reached its current level of polish and quality if last year’s entry hadn’t been scrapped, so says Sports Interactive Design Manager Ant Farley.</p>



<p>The game marks a significant step for the franchise as it leaves behind the Sports Interactive Operating System engine in favor of the Unity engine. This change saw Football Manager 25 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/">suffer through</a> multiple delays <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and feature cuts</a> before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-cancelled-after-multiple-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately being cancelled</a> to focus on making sure the game was up to the standards that players have come to expect from the 20+ year franchise.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/interview-football-manager-26-definitely-benefited-from-fm25-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Gaming Zone</a>, Farley says that canceling last year’s game wasn’t an easy choice to make, but it was necessary.</p>



<p><strong>“There’s no way we’d have been able to reach the same level of quality that FM26 currently has if we shipped FM25,” </strong>Farley said. <strong>“Some of the decisions where we rethought and changed direction, we’d have had to push them out there if we released FM25. And, once they’re out in the world, it becomes difficult to rethink it. We probably would have needed to fix them, rather than rethink them.”</strong></p>



<p>He added that instead of building a complete game, they would’ve been spending more time fixing bugs than anything else. But with the focus shifting towards Football Manager 26 instead, it gave them even more determination to make the best game possible. </p>



<p><strong>“The original disappointment [of the cancellation] “was tangible, but it quickly made way to an attitude of ‘let’s crack on now, we’ve got a chance to make something we are really proud of, ‘”</strong> he said. <strong>“We weren’t proud of FM25, we didn’t think it offered good value for money for our playerbase, and that’s our real motivating factor.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“When we had news of the cancellation, it gave us the determination to get it right for FM26.”</strong></p>



<p>Football Manager 26 launches on November 4. An open beta will be <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/exclusive-football-manager-26-open-beta-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking place starting October 24</a>, with progress being able to be brought over to the full game post-launch.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-feature-i-want-back/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-great-but-there%E2%80%99s-still-one-feature-i-want-back.1329490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 continues to impress gamers, and there’s still an immense amount of life left in a roadmap that’s yet to deliver the game’s first multiplayer season and a free-to-play battle royale component. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my review</a>, I rated Battlefield 6 highly on account of its stellar multiplayer platform, but points were detracted for the less-than-desirable campaign portion of the game.</p>



<p>As I play Battlefield 6, I can’t help but find myself lusting after a feature from bygone days that hasn’t been seen in a Battlefield game since 2018’s Battlefield 5. It’s something I adored in the World War II shooter that added a layer of immersion and ownership, but it’s not present in Battlefield 6, and I mourn the loss of it.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-want-to-fortify-objectives-in-battlefield-6">I Want To Fortify Objectives in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>In Battlefield 5 (2018), users could take over an objective in a mode like Conquest or Breakthrough and set about <strong>fortifying it</strong>. They’d pull out their toolkit and construct everything from tank traps to sandbag walls. They could board windows, dig trenches, install machine gun nests, and set up barbed wire fences.</p>



<p>It was all pre-determined and linear, but it gave players a sense of ownership over an objective. They could capture the spot and then fully fortify it, preparing for the inevitable retake attempt from the opposing team.</p>



<p>It was also a nice way to earn an extra chunk of experience points, with the game’s support class having abilities that allowed them to craft fortifications faster.</p>



<p>Sadly, this feature was removed going into Battlefield 2042 (because the game lacked destruction), and it hasn’t resurfaced in Battlefield 6, which was released on October 10.</p>



<p>This is a shame, as Battlefield 6 has wonderful destruction that can see buildings razed to the ground, and I could imagine fortifications becoming progressively ramshackle as objectives crumble to dust under the weight of incoming fire.</p>



<h6><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-should-battlefield-6-take-from-battlefield-5/">What Should Battlefield 6 Take From Battlefield 5?</a></strong></h6>



<p>The idea came to me again while occupying objective ‘D’ on Liberation Peak, which is a site set in the middle of a road flanked by houses, all of which are begging for fortifications. It would be the best spot to lay some tank traps to prevent vehicular pushes from either end of the street, and the ruined houses are perfect for sandbagging and trenches.</p>



<p>I can fully appreciate why this <strong>isn’t</strong> a thing, of course. Battlefield 6 is a fast-paced game with immense destruction mechanics, and any fortifications would likely be taken out the second they’re built. It’s not worth the development time to implement something that can so quickly be destroyed.</p>



<p>Being an objective player, I’ll forever wish for the integration of fortifications. It’s the perfect way to gain a sense of ownership over an objective, and it’s a way for players less skilled in the gunny space to earn extra experience points and complete challenges.</p>



<p>Do you wish Battlefield 6 had fortifications? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

"Then in late December 2021, when I had like 550 crowns, I started grinding a show called Finals Marathon [...] I was playing every single minute of my free time, refusing to play other games even if a friend wanted to."</p><p dir="ltr">By April 2022, he had achieved the game’s Golden Knight costume, a symbol of prestige among fans. He quit the game several times throughout his journey, only to come back to the grind.</p><p dir="ltr">"I wanted to reach top 1 Europe or top 10 world," they wrote. "But deep down I was really dreaming of claiming the top-1 spot."</p><p dir="ltr">That dream turned into a grueling marathon of near-constant play. During one stretch in 2023, he played Fall Guys for 15 hours a day across the entire summer. His parents even grounded him after he went without sleep for two school nights. He came back to keep playing.</p><p dir="ltr">After submitting screenshots, videos, and leaderboard evidence, his Guinness record was confirmed on September 10, 2025. Yet when he shared the achievement on the Fall Guys subreddit, the reaction wasn’t all celebratory--many accused him of using in-game glitches. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FallGuysGame/comments/1nlzyzj/finally_got_my_guinness_world_record_after_9000/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a> includes a picture of his certificate and a number of comments that accused him of cheating.</p><p dir="ltr">"I used glitches," they wrote. "My main opponent who was #1 at the time used them too, so I had no other choice if I wanted to surpass him."</p><p dir="ltr">Though he says he’s since quit the game, he calls the journey "a phenomenon," adding that he's never been motivated like this before.</p>

<p>"It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen," he said. "It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out."</p><p>Marathon had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-alpha-update-allows-players-to-talk-about-the-game/1100-6530975/" data-ref-id="1100-6530975">an initial closed alpha test</a> in late April that resulted in a smattering of issues, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bungie-employees-claim-toxic-corporate-culture-is-killing-the-studio-from-the-inside/1100-6531737/" data-ref-id="1100-6531737">an alleged toxic work culture at Bungie</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">stolen-art allegations</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">an indefinite delay out</a> of its September 23 release date. Meanwhile, Arc Raiders had a successful playtest, raking in 189,668 concurrent players and dominating Steam's top 10 most-played games during that "server slam" weekend.</p><p>For Watkins, the disparity between Arc Raiders and Marathon provided Embark Studios the chance to learn about the genre, player expectations, and the game the team is building. Of course, Watkins isn't dragging Marathon despite it not receiving a warm welcome from Bungie and extraction shooter fans. Instead, he's rooting for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny/" data-ref-id="5000-38799">Destiny</a> makers, saying Marathon's art style is "evocative" and that he wants to see more from Bungie.</p><p>"[It] was quite interesting to follow in what players thought about those certain things, or what did work in their context and didn't, and what may have worked in ours," he said. "[...] I'm personally curious to see how that ends up. I hope to see more of that in the future."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Things haven’t been great on Bluesky lately, where <a href="https://aftermath.site/bluesky-charlie-kirk-dead-rest-in-piss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">questionable moderation decisions</a>, unpopular changes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/bluesky-rolls-out-massive-revamp-to-policies-and-community-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Guidelines and Terms of Use</a>, and the recent arrival of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/18/us/politics/trump-administration-bluesky.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official White House and other government accounts</a> are all making it feel not quite like the refuge from Twitter many initially saw it as. For as long as there’s been Bluesky there’s been Bluesky bots, sometimes called “resistance bots” for their bios full of liberal buzzwords and their tendency to repost political content or reply to users’ own political posts in strangely aggressive ways. I don’t get bots on my politics posts very much, but they do come flooding out of the woodwork whenever I post about the Irish language.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This first happened in late September, when I found out that the Netflix show <em>House of Guinness</em> is the first show on the platform to feature Irish language subtitles. Since I’ve been slowly <a href="https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learning Irish</a>, I thought this was neat, so I posted on Bluesky that I thought it was neat.</p><p>This post immediately broke containment, racking up 269 reposts and 2.2k likes, which for an account of my size is a lot of engagement. At first I wondered if there was some huge <a href="https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/gaeilgeoir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaeilgeoirí</a> contingent on Bluesky, but the responses were weird. Many were far more enthusiastic about this than I was, but some of those responses came from accounts with long lists of generic interests or American political slogans in their bios, people I wouldn’t expect to have opinions about the Irish language. Several mistakenly called the language “Gaelic,” which in fairness is not an unusual mistake. A few were weirdly derisive, making fun of the concept of Irish subtitles or spamming weird gobbledygook which just seemed needlessly mean.</p><p>After a few days, the buzz around the post died down, and I went on with my life. But then on Saturday morning, I was working my way through a chapter of the book <em>Gaeilge Gan Stró </em>and came across what I thought was a funny, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Ionesco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eugene Ionesco</a>-esque dialogue in which two new coworkers discuss their marital statuses with far more intimacy and passive-aggression than seemed appropriate for an imaginary workplace. As with any funny thing I see in the world, I swiftly posted it to Bluesky.</p><p>This post got 99 reposts and 1.6k likes, which again is quite a lot for me, and definitely a lot for a terribly niche topic. Again, the responses ran a weird gamut: more than my <em>House of Guinness </em>post this time seemed real, and it was actually cool to talk about Irish with some folks and explain my very nascent grasp on its grammar. But the post was also appreciated by an account for “refined platinum,” and more people with a host of resistance interests in their bios, and some accounts claiming to be learning Irish that seemed off to me (though in fairness, you wouldn’t think I’d be learning it from my bio either). There was, again, some ire; a self-described anti-Tesla account was mad at me for learning Irish, and a few were just bafflingly mad about the conversation in the book.</p><p>Scrolling through the engagement on both these posts, it’s obvious the likes aren’t coming from me being good at social media; as far as I can tell, the posts reached the bot ecosystem and then just pinballed around it racking up likes. But it’s the responses that gnaw at me. You’ll notice I haven’t linked to any of them, though you can find them in the posts. That’s because of what I think is the most insidious part of the Bluesky bots– I’m never <em>100 percent sure</em> they’re bots. This is by design, of course, but it’s also indicative of my own struggle with the rampant rise of AI. I’m uncomfortable with the tendency to label anything bad or weird or off as “AI,” and I tend to be overly generous with my benefit of the doubt. Maybe some Appalachian grandma who hates Trump and likes to kayak really <em>does</em> have strong feelings about Irish? Thanks to the popularity of the Irish-speaking band Kneecap and their <a href="https://the-flytrap.ghost.io/censorship-of-pro-palestine-speech-in-the-music-industry-shows-the-power-of-demands-for-decolonization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support for Palestine</a>, there could plausibly be American liberal interest in the language I <em>guess</em>. Even as I write this, I’m imagining some real person seeing me suspect they’re a bot and feeling guilty about how bad they might feel, which of course is exactly how the bot creators hope you’ll feel so that you don’t just report them and end… whatever it is they’re doing.</p><p>Because that’s the thing that’s killing me: <em>what do the bots want?</em> A bunch of busty women slid into my DMs with their traditional greeting of “hello,” and those were easy to identify as bots and block. I could imagine the likes are to encourage me to post more on a topic by giving it the illusion of popularity, thus <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-twitter-bots-help-fuel-political-feuds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shaping the conversation</a> on the platform. That makes sense for health misinformation or politics or crypto, but far less for learning a niche language. I suppose it’s <em>possible</em> there’s some bot-driven conspiracy to grow the Irish language masterminded from some tech-savvy grandfather’s cottage in the <a href="https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/Gaeltacht" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaeltacht</a>, but now I’m just scripting a <a href="https://www.tg4.ie/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TG4</a> show instead of actually getting to the bottom of things.&nbsp;</p><p>But it’s the angry responses that baffle me most. What are they after? In his <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=rpOkrxxpTcE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 video on Bluesky bots</a>, YouTuber Hank Green said, “If there's someone out here on the internet that's making me mad, there is a high probability that that's not even a real person.. What's the incentive? The only incentive is, like, [to] take up my time, distract me, make me have less faith in my society and fellow people.” It’s possible the bots are here just to help users have a bad time, something real people on social media certainly don’t need any help with, and that they have just enough grasp of the Irish language’s place in Ireland’s <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/irelandHouse/documents/0111-0126_PoliticsOfTheIrishLanguage.pdf?challenge=d06e90d7-4d8f-4b88-9d8c-10b73beb60f1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">political</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/01/28/a-student-should-be-able-to-communicate-well-through-irish-by-15-the-reality-is-very-different/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">educational</a> landscape to see it as fertile ground for bad feelings and decide they want me to be unhappy about learning it. But if they just want to sow beef and waste my time, why not seize on my posts about US politics, or video games, or being trans? Why not pick something I’m far more likely to have the kind of strong feelings about that would lead me to engage with them, thus getting them closer to their mysterious ends? Why <em>Irish</em>? What kind of mid-tier endgame do their creators imagine that requires me to be mildly befuddled and generally annoyed?</p><p>I haven’t replied to any of the bots or suspected bots (apologies if you are a real person I am ignoring because I’m afraid you’re a bot; see graf six of this post), but I <em>have</em> now written a whole blog on their movements, which is arguably worse than just getting into an argument with them. So much of our lives, both online and in real life, just feels <em>bad</em> these days, the <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rot economy</a> coming for every online platform and streaming service and tech-mediated interaction. Maybe <em>that’s</em> the bots’ real end: to suck just enough to make me feel like everything sucks, even my least consequential of interests. We’ll see how they feel about this post.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/matt-leone-shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history-aftermath-hours"><h3>A History of Histories</h3></a><p>" I don't think there is always a canonical version of, like, the development story of a game."</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/imdb-review-scale-bad-broken"><h3>The Sweet Spot Of IMDb Is 6.3-7.6&nbsp;</h3></a><p>Please enjoy my arbitrary and unscientific system for accounting for IMDb's awful rating scale.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope"><h3>I Will Go Down Swinging Against Windows 11</h3></a><p>The end of support for Windows 10 is a mess</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/bluesky-resistance-bots]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has received some fairly mixed reception so far, though it seems most are in agreement that although it might not be the prettiest game ever made (far from it!), the new real-time battle system is pretty solid. The Switch 2 Edition is currently sitting at 80 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Metacritic</a>.</p>
<p>In our own 7/10 review (for the Switch 2 version), we said that Z-A "should be celebrated for its fabulous real-time combat and its largely smooth jump to the Switch 2, but in condensing things down to one single location, it loses part of the Pokémon magic that Arceus and many other entries managed to amplify".</p>

<p>So, have you picked up Legends Z-A on the Switch or Switch 2 yet? If so, we're eager to hear what you'd personally score it out of 10. And don't worry if you haven't bought it yet or you feel you haven't progressed very far – you can always come back at a later date and provide your score when you're ready.</p>
<p>If you've already rated the game in our database, good job! You won't need to vote in the below polls since your will have already counted. Again though, feel free to change it if you like.</p>
<p>We've got two polls this time: one for the Switch 2 Edition, and one for the OG Switch, so be sure to vote in the correct one!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re out there making content for TikTok or Instagram Reels, there’s one small change you can implement to your work that will make a world of difference. Get a microphone. Seriously. Creators underestimate the importance of good audio. Whether you’re filming simple vlogs from the comfort of your couch or conducting one of those man-on-the-street styled interviews. Those watching are going to notice your sound quality. They may not even be directly aware of it, but on an unconscious level, they might get the feeling your content seems subpar, but can’t exactly point to why. 9 times out of 10, it’s the audio. Nip that in the bud with a set high-quality lavalier microphone that’s on sale.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/"> Right now, the DJI Mic Mini two-person vlog bundle is down 34%, bringing the price from $119 top just $79.</a> I don’t know about you, but saving $40 sound pretty good to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiny But Mighty</h2>
<p>These wireless microphones are low-profile without sacrificing quality. They are ultralight, weighing only 10 grams. They are discreet and aesthetically pleasing on camera, plus they’re easy and comfortable to wear.</p>
<p>Each mic is capable of delivering high-quality sound to the receiver at a maximum transmission range of up to 400 meters. That’s a quarter mile away from the receiver you can be.</p>



<p>They’re great for recording in bustling outdoor environments like a busy street or a crowded convention. That’s because each mic is capable of pro-level noise cancelling. It can be set to two different mode of intensity. Basic is good for quiet indoor settings while the strong mode is ideal when outside in a noisy environment. They are also able to automatically limit the volume input if it detects the sound being too high. This prevents clipping and can be an absolute lifesaver when it comes to editing your content.</p>
<p>The DJI Mic Minis can be connected to your own greater DJI OsmoAudio ecosystem. pair them easily with an Osmo Action 5 Pro without even needing the receiver.</p>
<p>Each transmitter and receiver come with a long battery life so you can stay out there and film for as long as you need for the day. The DJI Mic Minis offer a maximum operating time of up to 10 hours on a single charge. Great for interviews and livestreaming that may go on for a while.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/">Right now, you can get this bundle of two DJI Mic Mini microphones and their DJI receiver for a discounted price of just $79, saving your $40.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-wild-zone-3-spawns/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-wild-zone-3-spawns-alpha-pok%C3%A9mon-locations.1329454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A has a different approach to other Pokémon games regarding spawn locations, with some fixed odds available across Lumiose City, and we’ve got a breakdown of all the Pokémon you can encounter in Wild Zone 3.</p>



<p>In total, Lumiose City has 20 Wild Zones to explore in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which are unlocked periodically throughout story progression, with unique spawns scattered throughout, with many Pokémon only being obtainable at one specific location.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for missing Pokémon from Wild Zone 3, we’ve got all the important details here.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Lots to find. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Just like Wild Zone 2, Wild Zone 4 is unlocked in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A as soon as you reach Main Mission 5 and progress through the introductory points of the game.</strong></p>



<p>There are six species in total that are found in Wild Zone 3, all of which need to be caught to complete Mable’s Research Tasks, one of which has Mega Evolution potential later in the story. However, others can still be core members of your party, particularly through early periodsd of the game.</p>



<p>In the table below, we’ve listed all the Pokémon that spawn in Wild Zone 3, the time of day they appear, and notes on the specific location where they can be found.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon</th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Espurr</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Northeast corner</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Flabebe</td><td data-align="center">Day</td><td data-align="center">Central</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Litleo</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Northwest corner</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pancham</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Northwest corner</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Southeast corner</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Skiddo</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Southwest corner</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>Wild Zone 3 in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A has one guaranteed Alpha Pokémon</strong> <strong>that is present in the same spot both day and night.</strong></p>



<p>However, every Pokémon in Legends: Z-A has a fixed chance of spawning as an Alpha, while others have set spawns that can be rotated with other Pokémon. In WIld Zone 3, however, there’s only one guaranteed Alpha spawn that you will encounter whenever you visit the area.</p>



<p>All the details you need on Alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 4 are below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon</th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Alpha Litleo</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Eastern building</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Among the finest action role-playing titles ever crafted, possibly even the finest, and a game that absolutely no RPG fan should miss."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote, from our 2009 review of the 1995 action-RPG, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/terranigma">Terranigma</a>, should give you <em>some</em> idea of just how highly we regard the third slice of what's known as the "Gaia Trilogy" — that's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/illusion_of_gaia">Illusion of Gaia</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/soul_blazer">Soul Blazer</a> and then this bad boy — all developed by Quintet.</p>
<p>Whilst some experiences, especially when it's been three decades since the game first released, tend to crumble and fade with time, Terranigma (and its predecessors) looks and plays as fantastically as ever. They're all-timers this lot, and Terranigma might just be the best of the three. Facts.</p>
<p>Quintet's third slice of Earth-resurrecting action sees players assume control of Ark, a young lad who, as things tend to go in action-RPGs of the anime/manga style, soon becomes embroiled in some very serious, world-altering business. As the very first human to leave his village to explore the "underworld" Ark is off on an absolute cracker of an adventure, one in which he must seek out and resurrect the continents of a long-lost surface world, in a narrative that serves up some real emotional gut punches.</p>

<p>Of all three games in the trilogy, Terranigma is the most emotional, unafraid to deal with death, loss, and our own mortality. The existentialism and philosophising gets you properly hooked into what's happening; the game also gives you loads of variety in its locations as you progress and, most importantly of all, the combat still holds up.</p>
<p>Ark is a surprisingly capable little scrapper who can easily go toe to toe with Link circa <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">A Link to the Past</a> (a game that's very similar in its combat overall). Our red-headed hero is perhaps a little more nimble than Link, and there's lots to explore in special attacks and different gear as you go. It's got all the good bits where they need to be.</p>
<p>It's also an adventure that continues to benefit greatly from the SNES's graphical style and fancy Mode-7 effects. This stuff just hit a real sweet spot in never looking old. Its style refuses to be diminished by the years passing, and it therefore sits with the likes of A Link To The Past, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/secret_of_mana">Secret of Mana</a>, and the rest of the games in this trilogy, lest we forget, in belonging to a very special reserve of properly timeless Super Nintendo titles.</p>
<p>If you've never played it, you might want to sort that out, is what we're trying to say basically (easier said than done in the US, we know).</p>

<p>There's also the small matter of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9H29TkDkjM">a soundtrack</a> that gives Chrono Trigger (this writer's number one choice of SNES score) a very close run for its money. It really does sound that great, and it's a fitting backdrop for writing, characterisation and a sense of scale and adventure that's as good as anything you'll play on the 16-bit console.</p>
<p>It's mad, then, that Terranigma never released in the US, arriving in Japan this very day in 1995, and a year later to Europe and Australia. Therefore, loads have never played it. Even folks who've been around since back in the day. It's just one of those games that ended up being unavailable a lot of players whom we reckon, should they find the time to fit in a playthrough in the here and now, might just earn themselves a brand new SNES favourite.</p>
<p>As the conclusion of our 10/10 review back in 2009 puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are honestly very few role-playing game experiences quite as enjoyable or engrossing as the one found in Terranigma. It does for action RPGs what games like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger did for the more traditional RPG market. And while it might not have the brand recognition of the aforementioned titles, it's one of those RPGs that once you play it, you'll never forget the experience. It's also the kind of game that will remind you why you love RPGs in the first place and one you'll find yourself coming back to time and time again."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well now. Excuse us as we head up into the loft to hook up the old Super Nintendo...</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-clip-3-bluetooth-speaker-finally-drops-to-an-almost-free-price-after-months-without-a-discount-2000636703</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl-clip-3-bluetooth-speaker-finally-drops-to-an-almost-free-price-after-months-without-a-discount.1329421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A good Bluetooth speaker is one of those things that everyone should just have. Whether you’re heading to the park with some friends and planning to listen to some music while you hang or are just at home folding laundry and catching up on the latest episode of your favorite podcast, you’re gonna want a solid speaker. The JBL Clip 3 isn’t the latest model, but it still produces quality sound at an inexpensive price point. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4870/">Amazon has the Bluetooth speaker on sale right now so you can get one for 16% off</a>. It’s normally listed at $45, but for a limited time you can grab yours for just $38. That’s not too steep of a savings, but hey, $7 is still $7.</p>
<p>JBL has a built a name for itself in the world of portable Bluetooth speakers. With the JBL Clip 3, you can expect big sound from a small speaker that can clip onto your bag or belt. Yes, that’s where the name comes from. This ultra-compact speaker has a carabiner clip built into the side of it so you can hang it on your person or perhaps the back of your beach chair so it doesn’t have to sit in the sand.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4870/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bring Great Sound Anywhere</h2>
<p>Take it to the beach or even poolside as the JBL Clip 3 is waterproof. No need to worry about a little splash, spill, or rain. Heck, the whole thing can even be fully immersed in water and come out fine. The exterior is made with a durable fabric material and a rugged rubber house to protect it, even if it gets dropped onto hard concrete.</p>
<p>Battery life is reliably long. It wouldn’t be that great of a portable speaker if it had to spend most of its time plugged into an outlet. Well, the rechargeable lithium ion battery can hold onto a full 10 hours of playtime on a single charge.</p>



<p>If you want to take a call form your phone, you can do so while connected to the Bluetooth speaker. The JBL Clip 3 even has noise and echo-cancelling so when using it as a speaker phone, the folks on the other end will be able to hear you crystal clear.</p>
<p>JBL speakers come in a large assortment of colors and the JBL Clip 3 is no different. A couple are out of stock, but you can still pick between gray, blue, red, sand, white, yellow, green or even camo patterns in both black or green. All of which are currently on sale for the low price of just $38.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/has-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-playtest-end/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/has-the-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-when-does-the-playtest-end.1329418/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s no secret how popular ARC Raiders has been all year. The extraction shooter has undergone a bunch of playtests and betas, and the Server Slam open beta arrived just before launch. If you’re wondering whether the latest ARC Raiders playtest is still going, when it ends, and if there’s another on the way, we’ve got answers to every question.</p>



<p>You only have to look at how many playtests Embark Studios has conducted this year to see how steadfast the developer is in its desire to get <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> right. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Tarkov is finally ready for its 1.0 release</a>, but this has possibly been pushed forward by the success and interest in ARC Raiders—its new extraction shooter competition.</p>



<p>If you’ve enjoyed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-final-open-beta-server-slam-test-start-date-how-to-play-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam playtest</a> and want to play more, we’ve got details on the beta and the game’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-over">Is The ARC Raiders Server Slam Playtest Over?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You don’t have to look over your shoulder for a while. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The ARC Raiders Server Slam Playtest officially ended on October 20, and confirmation came from official ARC Raiders social media to end all hopes of the beta being extended.</strong></p>



<p>There’s always an optimistic instinct in all of us that we might get more. An extra day off, a bit more money in a paycheck, or anything equivalent. That was the feeling in the ARC Raiders community with the Server Slam test. Even though this was a last-minute beta before launch, the thought of waiting nearly two weeks for the game is probably an eternity.</p>



<p>We’ve seen people frantically looking up to see if the playtest had been extended. This is where we break your heart and say that this particular beta has conclusively ended.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-another-arc-raiders-playtest">Will There Be Another ARC Raiders Playtest?</h2>



<p><strong>Embark Studios’ stance is that the Server Slam playtest was the final beta of any sort before ARC Raiders finally launches on October 30.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s what the official <a href="https://x.com/arcraidersgame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Raiders</a> account on X had to say: “The Server Slam has now officially ended. Thank you so much for joining us to test the servers before the big day. Speranza awaits you on October 30th, Raiders!”</p>



<p>As you can see, there’s no mention of a final final playtest. It’s safe to say we’re ready to go for launch. It’s been a long journey to get there—what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-delay-explained-embark-game-not-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay</a> and all—but, hopefully, it’s all worth it!</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📡The Server Slam has now officially ended.<br>Thank you so much for joining us to test the servers before the big day.</p><p>Speranza awaits you on October 30th, Raiders! <a href="https://t.co/U3rCPTjctn">pic.twitter.com/U3rCPTjctn</a></p></div>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1980191120442441772?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Could the team spring one final playtest on us as a tease? If they do, you know where to go to find out: Here on the Insider Gaming official website, or by keeping up with the wider IG community via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

                <p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 co-director Naoki Hamaguchi has responded to criticism about the pacing of the first two games in the trilogy. Addressing fan complaints of certain sections in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth being too long, Hamaguchi said that the development team was "striking a balance" with regard to the overall pacing of the upcoming threequel.</p><p>While Hamaguchi felt these segments were as long as they needed to be for the game, he did acknowledge that modern-day Final Fantasy fans are currently spoiled for choice when it comes to video games.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Biggest Changes In Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p>
      </div>
<p>"Regarding time management in certain sections, especially in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, I honestly don't believe that they were longer than necessary," Hamaguchi said to <a href="https://screenrant.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-bgs/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ScreenRant</a>. "I feel like nowadays, players just have too much to do and too much to play--so they often feel the urge that something has to be concluded quickly. As we work on the conclusion to the trilogy, we are striking a balance on how story arcs are told and spread out so as to ensure that the game feels a bit more concise."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-get-proper-high-quality-part-3-despite-rebirths-disappointing-sales/1100-6535048/">Development on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3</a> kicked off at full speed following the launch of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth in 2024. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-get-proper-high-quality-part-3-despite-rebirths-disappointing-sales/1100-6535048/">Square Enix is aiming to deliver a "high-quality" finale</a>, and the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-release-date-confirmed/1100-6534646/">expected to launch for multiple platforms</a>. Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-release-date-confirmed/1100-6534646/">will be launching for Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S consoles</a> early next year, with Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth arriving at a later date that has not yet been revealed.</p><p>Meanwhile, PS5 owners who haven't checked the games out yet can preorder the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-REBIRTH-Physical/dp/B0FVGHMMMQ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="nofollow ">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade &amp; Rebirth Twin Pack</a> ahead of its release on December 4.</p>

<p>They're very good, y'know?</p>

<figure data-uuid="5376a2b039629"><a title="Absolum / Ball x Pit" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5376a2b039629/absolum-ball-x-pit.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a> recently launched on the Nintendo Switch, and they're both bloody brilliant.</p>
<p>They're very different games, mind you, with the former being a self-described 'rogue 'em up', blending roguelike mechanics with classic beat 'em up action, and the latter being a very deliberate cross between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> and <strong>Breakout</strong>.</p>
<p>Folks seem to be lapping them up, however, as both have recently posted solid sale milestones, with BALL x PIT surpassing 100,000 sales, and Absolum surpassing 200,000. Well done, both!</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mnhrjg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>


<p>A great start, then, but we sincerely hope this is just the beginning of something special. They genuinely fantastic games, and they deserve to see sales in the millions. We reckon word of mouth will do them both a world of good.</p>
<p>As for BALL x PIT specifically, it's possible some may be holding off for the Switch 2 version, which has been confirmed to be in the works, but has yet to receive a firm release date. Thankfully, the game runs very well on the original Switch, so you're in for a treat no matter where you play it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Emily “Emiru” Schunk says she’s pressing charges and won’t be returning to TwitchCon after being assaulted by an attendee in a security lapse that’s bringing renewed scrutiny to Twitch’s safety and security policies for its biggest event of the year. “Twitch security is nowhere near me,” she said in a statement after the incident went viral on social media. “I can see them, but they don’t do anything.”</p> <p>Emiru, an online creator with over a million subscribers best known for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwSsUVn3Ws">her cosplay livestreams</a>, was in the middle of a fan Meet and Greet at TwitchCon 2025 over the weekend when a man seemingly cut in line and grabbed her before leaning in toward her face. Footage shows her personal security running over to grab the individual and get him away from Emiru, at which point the man walks away from the Meet and Greet area.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">So some freak just assaulted Emiru at <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TwitchCon</a> . This behavior is fucking disgusting. I’m amazed that she still came back to finish the Meet and Greet line, honestly she deserves the utmost of respect. THIS HAS TO STOP!!!<a href="https://twitter.com/EmiruUpdatess?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EmiruUpdatess</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/emiru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@emiru</a> <a href="https://t.co/pyO2QHQ9Pv">pic.twitter.com/pyO2QHQ9Pv</a></p> <p>— BaconCrumbz 🥓 @TwitchCon SD (@BaconCrumbz) <a href="https://twitter.com/BaconCrumbz/status/1979387279149068577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>She said her first thought when the assault occurred was that it may have been a Twitch staff member coming to tell her something about the event but once he grabbed her she knew something was wrong. “I’m still, like, freaked out because he grabbed me,” Emiru <a href="https://x.com/emiru/status/1979602519967060414?">said in a video</a> released after the event. “That’s not normal. And then he grabs my face and he leans in and lips puckered tries to kiss me and I start screaming. You can’t hear it in the clip, but I’m fucking screaming my head off.”</p>

 <h2>Emiru claims Twitch lied</h2> <p>But as bad as the initial incident was, Emiru said Twitch’s response to what happened is what’s made her angrier. “I’m obviously shaken up by what happened and it’s not the first time I’ve dealt with something like this, but to tell you honestly, I am a lot more hurt and upset by how Twitch handled it during and after the fact.” She claimed that Twitch’s first move was to ban the suspect from the platform for 30 days, and it was only after her manager pressed the Amazon-owned platform that it made it a lifetime ban from Twitch and TwitchCon.</p>

 <p>“The safety and security of all those attending TwitchCon is our highest priority,” the company <a href="https://x.com/Twitch/status/1979464697364779065?t=tjsgoIXfiG7ec7GXK6uuOg&amp;s=19">wrote in a statement</a> over the weekend. “The behavior displayed by the individual involved in the incident yesterday involving a high profile streamer was completely unacceptable and deeply upsetting.” Emiru also took issue with Twitch’s framing of its response, claiming that no one from security immediately tracked down the suspect to escort him out of the convention.</p>

  <p>“In line with existing TwitchCon security protocols, law enforcement and event security were on site and responded to the incident,” the company’s statement read. “We immediately blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events.” The statement, published on X, has since been community-noted by Emiru’s fans.</p> <h2>The TwitchCon fallout</h2> <p>The incident comes in the wake of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">Charlie Kirk assassination</a> earlier this year that left some of Twitch and YouTube’s most famous content creators afraid that they could be targeted at public events by violent actors or unhinged fans. Korean TikToker and livestreamer Yoon Ji-ah <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/korean-streamer-murdered-after-arguing-with-vip-viewer-who-donated-70000-to-her-3264111/">was murdered earlier this year</a> by a stalker who had allegedly donated roughly $70,000 to her under the user alias “‘Black Cat.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This was my 12th TwitchCon and I’m not going to lie it might have been my last. I love seeing friends but it really just doesn’t feel the same. After seeing what happened this weekend I feel better about canceling my meet n greet and going home early</p> <p>— Lulu (@LuluLuvely) <a href="https://twitter.com/LuluLuvely/status/1980015610689171867?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Do you know how much I spent on security to be able to come to this event in the first place?” Emiru said in her latest video. “I’m not just talking about yesterday. I’m talking about my security for like my RV trip that I did with my friends and stuff. I spent over $10,000. Some people who stream on Twitch don’t even make $10,000 in a year. What the fuck are they supposed to do? Like if you watch the clip, the security guard who pushes the guy away is my security. The woman who pulls me to the back, my manager. If you’re a small streamer and you don’t have those resources or&nbsp;someone in your line’s not filming, what the fuck do you do? No one would have known.”</p>  <p>The streamer said Twitch had multiple representatives from Amazon speak with her following the incident but it’s not exactly clear yet how Twitch will revamp security. Multiple high-profile female streamers had previously <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/pokimane-valkyrae-qtcinderella-afraid-to-attend-twitchcon-due-to-safety-concerns-3255650/">shared their fears</a> about attending the event. “It does worry me that it might not be safe and it’d be better to skip out on it,” Imane “Pokimane” Anys told her viewers last month. The comment was in response to both Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter and Blaire “QTCinderella” voicing their own concerns. So far at least, Twitch has only proven just how founded those fears were.</p>

            <p><span>If you’ve played any of the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games, you know the series is a heavily iterative one. Each new game makes some notable (or not so notable) strides over the last that build on, rather than overhaul, what came before.&nbsp; But each new game also finds ways of departing significantly from its predecessors, giving them all their own strengths and weaknesses. This is especially true of </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, which is one of the most significant departures from the old formula that Game Freak has ever put out. So let’s run down the best and worst parts of each </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game, starting with the original Game Boy games.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-price-explained%E2%80%94will-arc-raiders-be-free-to-play.1329382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios is bringing serious competition to the extraction shooter genre in 2025 with ARC Raiders. The futuristic shooter has all the hallmarks of a classic PvPvE experience, and it would score more points if it were free to play and didn’t have a price to pay. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-steams-most-popular-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders became Steam’s most popular Extraction Shooter</a> with the release of its final test phase before launch—the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-final-open-beta-server-slam-test-start-date-how-to-play-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta Server Slam Test</a>. Developer Embark Studios (known for The Finals) has worked very hard to ensure it learns from its mistakes and stands a chance of survival at release.</p>



<p>One way to get more people on board is to make ARC Raiders free-to-play. Foregoing a price might be a financial gamble, but there would be benefits. Let’s raid the information cabinet for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-arc-raiders-free-to-play">Is ARC Raiders Free-to-Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nothing is free in this world. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders will not be a free-to-play online multiplayer experience, and you will have to pay an initial one-time fee to set foot in Speranza and beyond!</strong></p>



<p>There’s a definite line in the sand when it comes to online shooters now: Those that are free-to-play, and those that want a fee upfront. Naturally, games like Concord have only stoked the fires of the debate more. When you have a Warzone, a Fortnite, a Marvel Rivals, or an Apex Legends charging nothing to play the base game, it’s only natural to question if other new releases should follow suit.</p>



<p>However, EA and Embark Studios have decided against making ARC Raiders free-to-play. It doesn’t mean it won’t make the transition in the future, but for now, you need to dip into your pockets to play it.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-price-explained">ARC Raiders Price, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The base edition of ARC Raiders costs $39.99 or £30.99, whereas you need to stump up $59.99 or £49.99 for the more expensive Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, you don’t need to buy the upgraded version, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-deluxe-edition-content-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deluxe Edition content and bonus rewards</a> are pretty tempting. The Standard Edition offers the thing you’re after the most—the game. If you go early, you might even be able to get your hands on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-pre-order-bonuses-revealed-prices-explained/">ARC Raiders pre-order bonuses</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s a mini-breakdown of what’s included in each edition of the game, and a reaffirmation of the cost.</p>

That’s enough to make it the sixth most-played game on Steam right now. Only Delta force, Battlefield 6, PUBG, Dota 2, and Counter-Strike 2 are more popular right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Escape from Duckov is a PVE top-down looter-shooter game in which you scavenge for resources, build your hideout, and upgrade your gear. “Start from nothing and rise to the top,” reads the official blurb. “Outwit hostile ducks, survive, or make it out alive.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following its launch on October 16, Team Soda’s game sold an additional 500,000 copies over the weekend. Its Steam user review rating is sitting pretty at 'Overwhelmingly Positive.' “At this moment, the entire dev team is quacking with joy and flapping our wings in excitement!” reads a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Escape from Tarkov, meanwhile, hits Steam on November 15. It will be interesting to see if it beats Escape from Duckov’s concurrent player peak on the platform. A console version is in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Extraction shooters might be having a moment, particularly on PC. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-ends-server-slam-playtest-with-big-steam-concurrents-suggesting-strong-launch-ahead">Arc Raiders, for example, recently enjoyed big Steam concurrents during its 'Server Slam' playtest</a>, which bodes well for its late October release date. Then we'll have Escape from Tarkov join the fun half a month later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Just a few weeks later, however, Liu tweeted to say <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-star-simu-liu-says-hes-working-to-get-sleeping-dogs-a-film-adaptation"><u>he was working with the rights holders to bring the much-loved video game to the big screen</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: Who's Who in the Cast</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sleeping Dogs was first released in 2012 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC and tells the story of detective Wei Shen as he infiltrates one of Hong Kong's notorious Triad crime syndicates.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom's upcoming, unannounced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-zero-hd">Resident Evil Zero</a> remake will reportedly launch in 2028 and feature the lead actor from Square Enix's Guardians of the Galaxy video game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, IGN verified a report by noted Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem that claimed Capcom would continue remaking its classic Resident Evil back catalog with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-reportedly-in-the-works-at-capcom">new versions of both Resident Evil Code Veronica and Resident Evil Zero in development</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MP1st</a> has suggested that the Code Veronica remake is targeting a Q1 2027 release window, while Resident Evil Zero will follow a year after. And there's word, too, of Zero remake's codename — "Project Chamber" — which is also listed on the <a href="https://resumes.actorsaccess.com/jonmclaren" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resume</a> of Far Cry 5 and Guardians of the Galaxy (video game) actor Jon McLaren.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">McLaren's resume describes Project Chamber as an "upcoming AAA video game", for which he is providing performance capture at Beyond Capture Studios. The codename would be an obvious nod to Resident Evil Zero's Rebecca Chambers, while MP1st notes that Beyond Capture Studios was previously used by Capcom for both the Resident Evil 4 Remake and Street Fighter 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Zero originally launched in 2002 on GameCube, and served as a prequel to franchise's classic first entry. It covers the events surrounding the S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team in the Arklay Mountains, with the player switching between Chambers and escaped convict Billy Coen. (This is, presumably, who McLaren is playing.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new remake is expected to add fresh scenes to the original game's story — in a similar manner to how Capcom has fleshed out its previous Resident Evil remakes. In Zero, it's reported that this will include a larger role for the conductor in the game's infamous train sequence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's likely still plenty of time to go before fans see anything of Capcom's new Resident Evil Zero remake for themselves, though today's fresh report provides a little more detail of what to expect — and when. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, of course, Capcom is busy getting ready for the launch of next year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> — which is set to arrive on February 27, 2026 in time for the franchise's 30th anniversary. The game is designed to act as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">something of a send-off for some of the series' long-running plotlines</a>, including the fate of the Umbrella Corporation and Raccoon City. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-resident-evil-requiem-interview-why-the-games-monster-got-supersized-why-its-probably-not-lisa-trevor-and-a-tease-for-areas-beyond-raccoon-city-just-dont-talk-about-leon">But will Leon S.

Asked if he agreed with the feedback that "certain sections" in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a> felt a little long, he disagreed, saying: "Regarding time management in certain sections, especially in FF7 Rebirth, I honestly don’t believe that they were longer than necessary. I feel like nowadays, players just have too much to do and too much to play; so they often feel the urge that something has to be concluded quickly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Hamaguchi is at least mindful of the criticism, adding: "As we work on the conclusion to the trilogy, we are striking a balance on how story arcs are told and spread out so as to ensure that the game feels a bit more concise."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same interview, Hamaguchi — who was inspired to become a developer after playing 1994's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vi"><u>Final Fantasy VI</u></a> — spoke of other games that have provided inspiration, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt"><u>The Witcher series</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable"><u>Fable</u></a>. He's particularly taken with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei"><u>Ghost of Yotei</u></a> at the moment, admitting: "I can't wait to get home to continue playing it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG fans have been on the hunt for news about the next entry in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy since its last installment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>, launched in early 2024. We know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-in-development"><u>development started as early as June 2022</u></a>, with Square Enix saying last year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027"><u>its goal was to see it launch by 2027</u></a>.

Co-director Tetsuya Nomura similarly acknowledged he'd heard the cries for updates on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a> last month, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-director-tells-fans-not-to-worry-about-rebirth-sales-insists-the-trilogy-ender-will-be-a-proper-high-quality-send-off"><u>happily reported that development was “progressing really smoothly.”</u></a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait, you can read up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-we-will-not-cheat-with-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-airship"><u>why the Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 team “will not cheat” when it comes to Final Fantasy 7’s iconic airship</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
