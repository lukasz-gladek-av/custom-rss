			<p>Sometimes you can tell how a game will play at a first glance, with the huge explosion of Hades clones generally easy to recognise. I went into my first experience with Hell Clock fully expecting a take on Supergiant’s classic but what I found was actually something far more original and interesting, albeit not without some issues and flaws. While it shares the general rogue-like approach of Zagreus’ adventures, the actual gameplay is far more in keeping with classic Diablo, and scratched a nostalgic itch I didn’t realise I had.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell Clock | Launch Trailer | Play Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EXoQ_s6ppw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of the game is its real historical backdrop, taking place 8 years after Brazil’s War of Canudos, a tragic event in which tens of thousands of refugees were slaughtered by the new Brazilian Republic in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. This is a historical event about which I was totally unaware before coming across this game and it shows how well games can educate alongside entertain. This is exactly the kind of experience that my erstwhile colleagues are looking at in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/03/playing-with-history-now-live-on-kickstarter/">‘Playing With History’ book</a> and I’ll be recommending they take a gander at Hell Clock.</p>


<p>This real world context doesn’t mean that the game is hyper realistic, however. Indeed, such is the depth of historical trauma surrounding the War of Canudos that the game’s dark fantasy aesthetic feels like a metaphorical attempt to come to terms with those memories. This is most obviously seen through the monstrous bosses that represent major figures in the invading army. These are truly grotesque and prove extremely challenging until you’ve refined your build.</p>


<p>While the general tone of Hellclock is dark the graphics benefit from an excellent balance of light and shade. A cel-shaded comic book effect helps enemies and backgrounds to stand out and there is a decent range of environments across the various stages – although the layouts themselves tend to repeat relatively quickly. Depending on your choice of skills and powers there can be a vast amount of visual effects on display soon and this can be both a blessing and a curse. Fully powered up attacks look incredible but can bring the framerate crashing down – particularly in the last main area of the game.</p>
<p>Performance as a whole here was decent until that last area (one that I won’t spoil here) where the solid 75fps gradually dropped until it fell off a cliff. The one time I beat the final boss was a battle of attrition with 5fps and took fully 35-40 minutes whilst watching a YouTube video. This is not what the game is intended to play as though and says a lot about my general stubbornness and desire to see the ending for this review.</p>

<p>In fact, the main loop of Hellclock is all about speed and min-maxing your builds. The standard mechanics include the titular Hellclock which constantly counts down towards your death – only pausing during boss battles. At first you have a measly 7 minutes but there are upgrades to unlock that increase this and bosses also drop extra time pick-ups when defeated. This mechanic ensures that every run is a test of your dps rather than skill which clearly appeals to the Path of Exile and Diablo players but is a far cry from the Hades style I was expecting.</p>
<p>There is an option to disable the clock and play the game in a more strategic way but after completing the game this way I would advise against it. While this mode does prevent the constant time pressure it ends up becoming a war of extreme attrition and the resultant drawn-out kiting of damage-sponge enemies can quickly sap your enjoyment. I would go so far as to suggest that the devs should probably remove this option and stick to their preferred approach.</p>

<p>Playing as a resurrected victim of the massacre, you’re armed with a revolver that serves as your primary weapon. I was a little disappointed that there are no alternatives here (rifles, shotguns, or sabres could have mixed things up build-wise) but you can level it up and apply buffs through equipped relics to increase your damage. Basic shots are free but all other attacks require mana to activate so there is a balance to be drawn between attacking and allowing your mana to recharge. The real build strategy comes in choosing from a wide range of spells to add to your arsenal.</p>
<p>These skills range from support effects such as dash and shield to more offensive abilities such as rapid fire and high damage explosives and all are well designed to fit in with the general aesthetic. Each set of skills is unlocked as you progress through the game’s acts but some of the early skills remain useful right up to the end. I found a combination of magical crosses that surrounded my character and life steal from equipped relics was overpowered as it meant I survived far longer than my damage output should have allowed but I think this has been balanced in part through patches (and of course would not have helped with the Hellclock in play).</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Hellclock is a solid game that offers something new to both the roguelike and Diablo genres but may not have the wider appeal of titles such as Hades due to its focus on min-maxing and DPS over skill. The confused approach of offering game modes that actively undermine the title’s central gameplay mechanic, and the current performance issues in the latter stages, are real negatives but the first can be avoided and the second is being worked on. If the idea of a roguelike Path of Exile appeals, then Hellclock may well be the game for you.	</p></div>

            <p>CD Projekt have rolled out a fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> patch with fixes and tweaks for some of update 2.3's additions. The most noteworthy is what sounds like a pretty hefty revamp of how the autodrive function goes about conveying your ride from A to B.</p>
<p>If you missed it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more">arriving back in July</a>, update 2.3 was the final set of new stuff CD Projekt plan to add to the first Cyberpunk, a game they've been physically unable to stop themselves from delving back into over the past couple of years, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">Cyberpunk 2 having been in the works for a little while now</a>. To be fair, most of its contents were vehicle and photo mode-related, with the autodrive function and similar Delamain taxi system heaflining alongside some new rides.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you might guess from this <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51794/patch-2-31">patch 2.31's notes</a>, autodrive's a feature that's come with a few kinks for anyone who's tried it. I've been able to rely pretty well on it to get me where I want to go in the on-and-off Cyberpunk playthrough I've had going for about a month now, but it has suffered from constantly jamming the brakes on in a very jarring fashion, as well as occasionally getting stuck or rear ending some poor fellow in a tiny Makigai MaiMai.</p>
<p>The devs have clearly been at work on those hangups, writing that as of this patch: "When driving to a selected point, the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtakes blocking vehicles, and no longer stops at traffic lights. Free Roam mode has also been upgraded to follow traffic rules and navigate the city more reliably." Sounds great, assuming other traffic have been se to automatically give way at junctions, otherwise there'll be a rise in Kiroshi dashcam footage of Thortons being t-boned in the near future.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Patch 2.31 for Cyberpunk 2077 is being rolled out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Mac and Nintendo Switch 2!</p><p>This update includes an AutoDrive upgrade and Photo Mode adjustments. It also addresses common issues encountered by players. For details, check the full list of… <a href="https://t.co/Jdpx1DI4V5">pic.twitter.com/Jdpx1DI4V5</a></p></div>— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1966081108199809196?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Aside from that, there are some fixes for the quests surrounding update 2.3 vehicles like the Semimaru and Muramasa, as well as on that saw Johnny Silverhand always spawn in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cabs. He's always been in back for me, so I must have gotten lucky.</p>
<p>Moving to photo mode, CD Projekt have made "most" of the character poses added update 2.3 work with folks of any gender and disabled NPC collision in the mode. That collision removal's in an effort to "make it easier to position NPCs on top of other objects with collision", such as perching Rogue or Kerry on the bonnet of your car.</p>
<p>The last couple of bits I'll highlight are PC-specific fixes. One's for "an issue where NVIDIA Reflex could be disabled while DLSS Frame Generation was enabled, causing the screen to turn pink", which is an equally hilarious and horrifying hardware happening. The second's for path tracing not activating properly in "certain scenarios".</p>
<p>Obviously, patches are the enemy of load orders, so it's worth checking or waiting for mod updates if you don't fancy disabling the likes of this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-gets-its-most-effective-horror-mod-yet-a-story-driven-rent-system-featuring-landlord-selfies">story-driven rent system</a> if you've got them installed. Don't want the landlord selfies being borked next time you chip in, you know?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s grand keynote happened only two days ago, and though <a href="https://gizmodo.com/airpods-pro-3-blur-the-line-between-health-wearable-and-wireless-earbuds-2000655557">the AirPods Pro 3 were the highlight</a>, Amazon had a different idea: clear out the remaining AirPods Pro 2 at an unbeatable price. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">they’re down to $199 instead of the usual $249, and that’s as low as it gets for one of Apple’s most popular earbuds</a>. Amazon wants to move the last of its stock, and if you don’t care about extras like heart rate monitoring or calorie tracking, the AirPods Pro 2 are more than enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See offer</a></p>

<h2>Advanced ANC Earbuds</h2>
<p>The reason the drop is so tempting is that <strong>these earbuds remain some of the most advanced true wireless earphones</strong> Apple has ever produced. They pack the H2 chip which powers improved sound quality and smarter noise cancellation. Active noise cancellation works to block out the hum of traffic, chatter on your commute, or background noise in the office, and Transparency Mode lets the world back in whenever you need to stay aware. On top of that, Personalized Spatial Audio adapts sound to the shape of your ears for a immersive surround-like feel.</p>



<p>The earbuds’ sound profile is accurate and detailed, with bright, even balance between highs, mids, and bass. If you’re looking for audio quality without the bulk of over-ear headphones, this remains one of the best everyday choices.</p>
<p>Apple overhauled the fit to be more comfortable with several ear tip sizes in the box that help create a snug seal. That makes it more effective at noise reduction and reduces ear fatigue during extended listening sessions. Battery life is more than adequate for daily use, <strong>with up to six hours of continuous use on one charge and 30 hours total if you count the charging case</strong>. The case itself charges through USB-C now, so you can charge it with the same cord you’re using for a MacBook or iPad.</p>
<p>There’s the convenience factor, too: <strong>Pairing with iPhone, iPad, and Mac is virtually instantaneous</strong> and technologies like automatic switching mean you’ll remain connected without further tapping or change-of-setting crap. If you’re engaged in a FaceTime call on your MacBook and then get up to answer a call on your phone, the AirPods Pro 2 switch just along with you.</p>
<p>It’s rare to see Amazon cut the price this aggressively on a flagship Apple product. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to grab a pair, this is pretty much it. At $199 instead of $249, the AirPods Pro 2 bring high-end Apple features to your daily routine without asking you to overspend.</p>

<figure><a title="Review: Genki Dual Wield Joy-Con Charging Dock For Switch 2 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b2b8b2977436/review-genki-dual-wield-joy-con-charging-dock-for-switch-2-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Genki — which recently made headlines by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-and-accessory-maker-genki-reach-settlement-in-switch-2-lawsuit">settling a lawsuit with Nintendo</a> after it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/accessory-maker-genki-to-discuss-switch-2-info-and-products-at-ces-2025">showcased 3D-printed mockups of the Switch 2 during CES 2025</a> — has supported the arrival of the new hybrid console with a selection of accessories and cases. The <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/joy-station">Dual Wield ($39.99)</a> follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-force-field-2-and-energy-pack-the-ultimate-switch-2-on-the-road-combo">Force Field 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">Attack Vector</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects">Sleeper Case</a>, and offers a means of charging four Joy-Con 2 controllers at once.</p>
<p>This isn't a new or groundbreaking concept, of course; we saw similar controller charging docks during the original Switch's lifespan. These products certainly have their uses, especially if you have one Switch 2 console but multiple Joy-Con for local multiplayer sessions, but is this worth the $40 asking price?</p>

<p>The Dual Wield certainly ticks all of the boxes when it comes to basic functionality. It consists of the charging dock (which is powered by a USB-A to USB-C cable, included in the bundle) and a pair of 'Delta' Joy-Con controller grips. These can charge your Joy-Con in two ways: there's a USB-C port on the top and a charging port on the bottom, which magnetically interfaces with the dock.</p>
<p>When charging on the dock, you'll see a pair of red LEDs light up for each Joy-Con – these turn to green once each Joy-Con is at full capacity. To eject the Delta grip, you press the button in front.</p>
<p>So far, so good, right? Sadly, the Delta grips themselves leave a little to be desired. It's not that they're uncomfortable to use – in fact, I'd go as far as to say they offer decent ergonomics when it comes to long play sessions. The bigger issue is that there's a lot of 'flex' on each Joy-Con, and it's actually possible to pull them off the grip without too much effort.</p>

<p>While a good, hard yank will also dislodge the Joy-Con from the official grip, it's much easier with Genki's offering. Nintendo's grips also avoid the 'flex' issue by including built-in prongs, which are what your hands grip during play. With the Genki Delta grip, you're mostly holding onto the Joy-Con themselves rather than the grip, hence the worrying amount of movement.</p>
<p>I also don't like how hard it is to see the Joy-Con's LED lights through the dark, transparent casing of the Delta grip. The light is dim, and it's sometimes hard to make out if the Joy-Con are switched on.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Genki Dual Wield isn't a total miss; the Delta grips are comfortable to use, and the dock itself looks attractive enough to integrate into most AV setups. My biggest gripe is how unstable the Joy-Con feel when they're attached to that Delta; Nintendo's official grip is far superior.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> Relaxed Mode mod is now available for download, featuring plenty of QOL improvements that can make the game more enjoyable for those struggling with some of its elements, such as the high challenge level.</p>



<p>The mod, which has been developed by didrio and can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/92?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, features a selection of balance and quality-of-life enhancements that can be fully configured, allowing users to only use some of the features the mod offers. Among these are balance changes with all damage reduced to 1 mask, Rosary Beads and Shards multipliers, healing changes, Swift Step and Clawline no longer consuming silk, health bars for enemies and bosses, increased iframes after receiving damage, and more. Although some of these changes undoubtedly make Hollow Knight: Silksong a little easier, the vast majority of them make for a more enjoyable experience, especially for those who never played the first entry in the series and were unprepared for the high level of challenge the new game shows right from the beginning.</p>



<p>Team Cherry seems to be aware that Hollow Knight: Silksong presents a high challenge level right from the beginning, and has confirmed that some balance changes will be included in the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-team-cherry-first-patch-makes-early-game-easier/">first patch</a>. Specifically, the patch will reduce the difficulty of early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter, reduce damage from Sandcarvers, reduce mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices and more. Personally, I didn't find the two bosses mentioned by Team Cherry to be particularly challenging, but I can definitely see how they can be difficult to take down for players who aren't used to the sort of balancing that's more common in Soulslike games, rather than Metroidvania titles.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch worldwide.</p>

To celebrate the highly-anticipated launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> this Friday (12th September), 2K are unleashing a huge takeover of the capital's transport hub across the weekend, with game imagery, interactive elements and a tonne of loot flooding the space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On your approach, look out for a number of billboards between the BFI IMAX and the station, featuring spoof fragrance ads and a Ripper bursting through the glass on the side of the railway bridge. As well as 3D chains and shards, this poster lights up, with the character's eyes glowing throughout the night.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the main concourse, the massive digital screens will feature character art and the game's "break free" messaging, while cosplayers decked out in Vault Hunter gear roam amongst the crowds, interacting with passers by. Head down to get your hands on your very own Ripper mask and a share of the free Borderlands 4 merch on offer, including hoodies, t-shirts, caps, Claptrap totes, lanyards and keyrings.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/10/roadside-special-build-1757492892927.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The 3D Borderlands 4 billboard outside London Waterloo station</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also set to be two Snapchat experiences live across both Friday and Saturday. Activate an AR lens to transform head to toe into a Ripper, and try your luck with an interactive vending machine, which will be spitting out prizes for those who score enough points in its integrated Borderlands 4 mini-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The domination will continue at the tube line level, with wanted posters and wraps spouting "Keep Order" propaganda on behalf of the game's villain, The Timekeeper. Resistance will of course peek through, with signature Borderlands-style graffiti and artwork plastered across the walls and ticket barriers, showing rebellious Rippers breaking free from their shackles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Kairos influence extends down the escalators, with The Timekeeper watching over the summit, and Synths following passengers down on the digital screens.

It looks like Sonic and Shadow are heading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, though perhaps not in the way you'd expect.
</p>
<p>
Known Fortnite leaker Wenso has shared datamined evidence on social media of Kicks themed around the two Sega hedgehogs based on in-game data, suggesting in-game trainers will be added to the game. 
</p>
<p>
The designs resemble <a href="https://sneakerbardetroit.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-puma-collection-release-date/">Puma's forthcoming Sonic the Hedgehog collection</a>, which will be available to purchase from 30th October - perhaps that's when they'll be added to Fortnite too, though Wenso noted there are no shop assets yet.

<p>
The Fortnite shop already includes <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?game=br&amp;type=kicks">Kicks</a> for brands like Nike, Adidas, Vans, and Puma.
</p>
<p>
Puma's collection also includes sneakers themed on sidekick Tails, though these are yet to be discovered in the game.

<p>
Does this mean we'll also get full skins to play as? That does seem unlikely, in part due to character proportions but also that Sonic canonically has not wielded a gun - although Shadow, of course, has.
</p>
<p>
Still, I think Sega is likely to go the way of Nintendo and not want its characters shooting each other. Perhaps we could see more clothing items in addition to those Kicks?
</p>
<p>The Fortnite crossover could also coincide with the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, due out later this month. Indeed, the racing game's premise is crossovers with other series, so perhaps it works both ways.</p>

<p>And an old foe returns in a timed in-game event</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="DxM gyro and live event" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a4892c75f309f/dxm-gyro-and-live-event.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Marvellous</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> has been out in the wild for around about a week now and, if you checked out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">our 6/10 review</a> of the game, you'll know that gyro controls were missing from action at launch. Boo!</p>
<p>Now, producer Kenichiro Tsukuda, <a href="https://x.com/dxm_game/status/1965228970770596351">via the game's official social media account</a>, has dropped some details on an upcoming patch that will sort our gyro woes, alongside a bunch of other fixes. Here's the post, plus the accompanying text detailing the upcoming patch notes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Planned Bug Fixes<br>
- Fix Rebellion’s behavior in the Teos Omos Desert.<br>
- Fix a bug where a violation of the End User License Agreement was incorrectly displayed when a network error occurred.<br>
- Fix for character models failing to load during event scenes.<br>
- Fix for Supply Bases becoming inaccessible.<br>
- Fix a bug where battle music fails to stop playing.<br>
- Fix other minor bugs.</p>
<p>Planned Additions and Adjustments<br>
- Added option to enable gyro controls for Nintendo Switch™ 2 and PlayStation®5.<br>
- Added options to adjust strength of camera acceleration and inertia.<br>
- Changed camera sensitivity settings to be separately adjustable for vertical and horizontal axes.<br>
- Changed early-game quest “The Bout With Ash” to allow players to pick up weapons inside the arena.<br>
- Improved loading times during online play.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no date on when exactly this patch will drop, but we're excited to see gyro-aiming get sorted so quickly. The other standouts are reduced loading times and camera improvements, which could make for a less stodgy feel to proceedings as we all keep our big metal fingers crossed for more meaningful performance gains and upgrades down the road.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, while awaiting the patch, you can also brush up on your mech-fighting skills against an old foe, as one of the original game's toughest boss battles has returned as a timed event that's running from right now until September 15th.</p>
<p>Yep, if you're a long-time fan, you'll need no introduction to Zeruchroar, who is back and looking for a scrap (cheers for the heads-up, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2025/09/11/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-brings-back-old-boss-for-a-new-event/">Forbes</a>). Now this was quite a nasty battle back on the first game, so luckily, if you are intending to try it, know that there is at least a reward in the form of some new blueprints and a "glitched fusion upgrade" should you best the rotten beast. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>Oh, and just head to your base in-game to get an alert to start the timed event.</p>

			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing features such as AutoDrive upgrades, Photo Mode adjustments, fixes, and improvements.</p>



<p>The 2.31 patch, which went live earlier today, updates AutoDrive so that the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtaking blocking vehicles and no longer stopping at traffic lights when driving to a selected point of the map. Free Roam mode has also been improved to follow traffic rules and navigate Night City more reliably. The patch also introduced some Photo Mode adjustments, as mentioned above, making most of the new poses introduced in the previous update work with any gender, disabling NPC collisions, and more.</p>



<p>The new Cyberpunk 2077 patch also brings a slew of quests and open world fixes, localization issues, adds a toggle to disable vignette, and addresses some PC and Mac specific issues, such as an issue were NVIDIA Reflex could be disabled while DLSS Frame Generation was enabled and an issue where path tracing didn't activate properly in certain scenarios, ray-traced reflections not displaying correctly under certain conditions, stability and performance improvements and more. You can learn more about everything the 2.31 patch brings to the game in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1091500/view/503961862016073928?l=english">official patch notes.</a></p>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, Mac, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch 2. You can learn more about the excellent Phantom Liberty expansion and the 2.0 update, which massively overhauled most of the gameplay systems, by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>

			<p>During Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment revealed Road Kings, the latest chapter in their successful series of racing simulation games after MudRunner, SnowRunner, Expeditions: A MudRunner Game, and Roadcraft.</p>



<p>Whereas most of the previous games focused on off-road driving, though, this one is squarely aimed at delivering the definitive trucking experience. Players will start out as rookie drivers behind the wheel of a 40-ton semi, hauling cargo across the coastal plains of the American South, from Jacksonville to Savannah. They will have to keep an eye on everything that real truck drivers do, from regulations to fuel, unpredictable weather, and much more. There's even going to be a narrative component that ties everything together, exposing the human element to the drivers and everyone involved in trucking.</p>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, I had the opportunity to chat with Saber Interactive Porto Game Director Peter Mack and Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits about Road Kings, which is scheduled to launch at some point in 2026 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2141130/Road_Kings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X consoles (a Nintendo Switch 2 port is still under evaluation).</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>Peter, which game did you work on before this?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> This is the first project I've worked on at Saber Porto. My experience before this was working with smaller LEGO games at another company, but I've now been with Saber Porto for many years.</p>



<p><strong>Okay, so this is the first project you've been doing.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> With Saber Porto, yes.</p>



<p><strong>How long have you been working on this game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> This project started production around three years ago and was in pre-production for a year before that.</p>



<p><strong>Does this run on your proprietary engine?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> No, it's Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p><strong>Are you using any of the signature features, such as Lumen and Nanite?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes, we're taking advantage of a lot of features that are now available.</p>



<p><strong>I don't know if you can share that, but is Road Kings also coming to the Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I would have to get back to you on that.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> We haven't quite decided that. Yeah, we're investigating it, but we're looking at our pipeline and stuff. One of the things to add to his answer about technology is that yes, it runs on Unreal, but we are leveraging the knowledge and experience that Saber has developed with Snowrunner, road crab, Mudrunner, you know, and any fantastic. We know vehicles. We know big vehicles, and we know trucks. You can really feel that it's solid, real, when driving. We have been praised for our realistic simulations.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>At its core, it's a truck simulator. But we also understand that the interesting things are really the people and the lives surrounding trucks. It's about human relations and how the trucking business affects the people in it. It's history, it's tradition. It's all important, all part of the experience. It's not just about the gearheads and the machines, so we try to incorporate as much of that as we can.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Saber has done many racing simulation projects about trucks and stuff like that. Where does Road Kings sit in this portfolio?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I feel this is a spiritual successor to all of the simulation-centered titles that have come before it. It's inspired by them and it makes a very nice complement to Saber's other racing simulations.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> Yep. Right in the middle! We are very proud of it. We've added that Saber spirit to it, where you are the hero of the open road. It is a true truck simulator, but you do so much more. You help people in need, you help communities in need...</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> It's very human.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> It's about trucks. At its core, it's a truck simulator. But we also understand that the interesting things are really the people and the lives surrounding trucks. It's about human relations and how the trucking business affects the people in it. It's history, it's tradition. It's all important, all part of the experience. It's not just about the gearheads and the machines, so we try to incorporate as much of that as we can.</p>



<p><strong>You said there is a story in Road Kings. Can you talk a bit about that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Sure. As I was just saying, trucks are a huge part of society, so they are involved in a lot of very important things to a lot of people. We tried to create a story that touches on these facts and what we've learned by talking with truck drivers and understanding their lives. We tried to create a narrative that the player, as part of an immersive simulation, can engage with or not. If you like to just sort of work and drive for long-haul trips over the road, you can, but if you want to engage with a sort of narrative experience, you can do that, too.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> Especially in America, where trucking is very important. The country is really big, and we don't have trains like in Europe, so the trucking culture in America is very unique. Tapping on what Peter said about that spirit and human factor, that is really important.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> There are also all the changes that are happening in the industry right now. When we were doing research for Road Kings, we were reading about and speaking with people about their fears about the impact technology has on trucking. If you look at blogs lately, it's about autonomous trucks and when they are coming and what they are going to do to this very important aspect of society that has existed in the United States for hundreds of years, and how it's going to be affected. Along with that, there's the change in the technology of the trucks. There is a change going on in the climate and the increasingly unpredictable weather, which often affects drivers and puts them in danger. All these things are for us narrative components to bring into stories you encounter in the game..</p>



<p><strong>Can you share how long the story of Road Kings is going to be?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I understand it's topping out at about 10 hours of gaming, but that's pretty much if you sail right through and if you do story beat after story beat.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> I mean, it's a simulation game. You can play forever beyond the story.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> There is also a layer of procedurally generated conditions and stories that you can encounter. For example, the dispatcher can call you up. Again, taken right from the pages of drivers, blogs, and diaries, they call you up and tell you that they made a mistake and the job you're doing is wrong, and can you do them a favour and take it to the other side of the state? And if you say yes, if it's convenient and makes sense, you get a reputation with the dispatcher, and if you say no, you get paid as normal. So, in addition to it being endless in terms of the simulation, there's even the sort of endless aspect to the small stories you can encounter.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Right now, we have an online mode in which you can create and customize your own company and invite your friends to join. Each of you can do jobs in your own environment, which contributes to your company's success, growing its worth and capital. But it's asynchronous, so you don't see them driving around, although they do appear in the game, I believe, with their liveries and such that they've chosen for their truck.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The weather is dynamic, right? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Does it include icy conditions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Let us get up toward Missouri and we can talk about that, but right now you're in sort of north Florida to southern Georgia. So, we don't have snowstorms for now, but we're looking at it.</p>



<p><strong>Can you talk about the asynchronous multiplayer mode?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Sure. Right now, we have an online mode in which you can create and customize your own company and invite your friends to join. Each of you can do jobs in your own environment, which contributes to your company's success, growing its worth and capital. But it's asynchronous, so you don't see them driving around, although they do appear in the game, I believe, with their liveries and such that they've chosen for their truck.</p>



<p><strong>Is there a leaderboard for the player-created companies?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Is it cross-platform? Can you invite a friend who plays the game on another platform?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Indeed!</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to support Road Kings post-launch, with more content and features?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Absolutely. 100%. We already have a lot of content planned for after launch. We find that this game lends itself very easily and naturally to expansion, not just in terms of geography, but in terms of truck types and customizations. All is expandable post-launch, but we also see very easily that we can add more stories and more narratives and more dispatchers, and more companies. I think we have fifteen more companies already lined up to be considered.</p>



<p><strong>Would these be premium DLCs, or possibly some free DLCs, too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I think we're looking at a plan that includes all of the above.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. Thank you both for your time.</strong></p>

            <p>Watch out! EA claim to have created "the most dangerous ring in gaming" for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s battle royale, and they won't stop waving their lethal hoop around in a post that runs down the mode's features ahead of its first Labs playtest.</p>
<p>Prior to now, all we've gotten battle royale-wise have been teases, with the devs busy seeking feedback on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s more standard multiplayer bits during the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">recent open beta</a>. Oh, and showing off their campaign's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-firmly-anti-helicopter-trailer-and-no-release-date">rampant helicopter destruction</a>, lest we forget the great sacrifice of those poor metal birds.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In that <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing">blog post</a>, EA insist their battle royale'll still be plenty Battlefieldy, since it doesn't ditch the gadgets, explosives, environmental destruction, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/better-for-battlefield-6-vehicles-to-start-off-too-weak-says-producer-to-players-sore-about-tooled-up-engineers">vehicles</a> you usually have at your disposal in field battles. There'll be 100 players crammed into a specially built new map, armed with "two default gadgets" their chosen class to kick off the hunting for loot and experience points. Oh, and obviously the killing, can't forget about that.</p>
<p>Enveloping this gaggle is the usual battle royale contracting boundary, but EA claim to not have settled for any old harmful circle, as they outline below:</p>
<blockquote>We set out to bring the most dangerous ring in gaming to Battle Royale that instantly kills players upon contact. With urgent warnings as the fire approaches, soldiers will be pushed into more intense firefights as the game space continues to shrink. There’s no jumping in and out of it, no using it for cover, no walking through it - if you get caught in it, you are done. We’re excited to see how the ring affects the pace of the game and how it creates spontaneous showdowns.</blockquote>
<p>Jiminy crickets, a brim of bad times so deadly you've got to describe it like an obstacle from the classic children's tale We're Going on a Bear Hunt. I like the idea of instant murder over a countdown or gradual damage in theory, though that'll probably go out of the window the moment I'm a bit too slow to migrate towards the middle of the map melee.</p><p>Another detail worth noting is the makeup of the goodies players'll be able to grab during these fights. "There are five tiers of weapons to loot along with attachments, throwables (Ex. Frag Grenades), gadgets (Ex. RPGs), Strike Packages (Ex. Air Strike), armor, upgrade kits, and custom drops of favorited weapons," EA outline. The mode also packs support class revives and "mobile redeploy options" that can bring you back if you snuff it because you've been blasted into oblivion while trying to snag your most beloved of bullet-dealers.</p>
<p>The battle royale testing is set to begin at some point this week, and you can sign-up to be given access <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs">here</a> if this'll be your first jaunt into Labs ahead of Battlefield 6's release on October 10th.</p>

            <p>Sony has released a new PlayStation Family App on iOS and Android, giving you more - and more immediate - control over a number of aspects of your child's gaming.</p>
<p>What catches my eye is the ability to manage how much time a child is spending on their PlayStation machine, and to do it dynamically. This means your child has a time balance per day to play, which you can up or down whenever you wish, and you can see how much they have used in real-time. They can even pitch you for more playtime via the app, so you don't even need to talk to them! You need only approve or decline.</p>

<p>Also useful: real-time notifications that show what they're playing, spending controls, customisable content filtering, and managing access to social features. And graphs, which are always useful, I think.</p>

But it also "poses a fundamental threat to creativity and innovation in the games industry.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It suggests any game that makes use of the mechanics listed below could now potentially trigger an infringement lawsuit from Nintendo:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>There must be a PC, console, or other computing device, and the game is stored on a drive or similar storage medium.</li><li>You can move a character in a virtual space.</li><li>You must be able to summon a character. They call it a “sub character” by which they mean it’s not the player character, but, for example, a little monster such as a Pokémon that the player character has at their disposal.</li><li>Then the logic branches out, with items 4 and 5 being mutually exclusive scenarios, before reuniting again in item 6.</li><li>This is about summoning the “sub character” in a place where there already is another character that it will then (when instructed to do so) fight.</li><li>This alternative scenario is about summoning the “sub character” at a position where there is no other character to fight immediately.</li><li>This final step is about sending the “sub character” in a direction and then letting an automatic battle ensue with another character. It is not clear whether this is even needed if one previously executed step (4) where the “sub character” will basically be thrown at another character.</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the patent is a mix of shock and concern about what it might mean not just for existing games that use similar mechanics, but future titles. IP lawyers, too, have criticized the development. IP expert <a href="https://x.com/Florian4Gamers/status/1965991376681664655" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Florian Mueller took to social media</a> to say Nintendo “should never” have received a "summon character and let it fight" patent in the first place, while video game patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/an-embarrassing-failure-of-the-us-patent-system-videogame-ip-lawyer-says-nintendos-latest-patents-on-pokemon-mechanics-should-not-have-happened-full-stop/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> "these claims were in no way allowable."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">These types of patents are too often used in bad faith <a href="https://t.co/89972KD6NB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/89972KD6NB</a></p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1965722965636776444?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">According to Mueller, the problem is global. “The Japan Patent Office also granted Nintendo an outrageous patent,” he said. “They ‘amended’ one of the patents they're using against Palworld in Japan.

"I wish Nintendo and Pokémon good luck when the first other developer just entirely ignores this patent and, if those companies sue that developer, the developer shows decades of prior art," he said: "This isn't <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-now-allowed-auxiliary-mini-games-during-loading-screens" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bandai Namco with the loading screen patent</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo also now owns U.S. Patent No. 12,409,387, which relates to the "smooth switching of riding objects" mechanism.

The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three patents</u></a> granted by the Japan Patent Office (JPO): two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May this year, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment.

We spoke following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals (a claim that the person who originally made it has since retracted). He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

But there's one section of the game that is proving to be particularly devious.</p>
<p>Before we go ahead, please note that although this article won't cover anything related to Silksong's story, we will be <strong>spoiling a key gameplay surprise</strong> that you might want to discover for yourself. If you'd like to maintain the mystery, consider coming back at a later date.</p>
<p>So essentially, as covered by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-traumatized-hunters-march-bench-trap/">The Gamer</a>, a single bench located in Hunter's March – one of the most demanding areas of the game, no less – doesn't offer the usual respite that you might expect. Instead, sitting on it (and keep in mind the usual 'Rest' prompt will still pop up) will actually trigger a deadly trap, causing spikes to swing down from the right and, should be low on health, kill you.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tvsoul&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Such_Food4915/">Such_Food4915</a> highlighted this with a simple caption that states "i have no words. this is the most anger i have ever felt for any game ever. i had one mask".</p>

<p>Similarly, X user <a href="https://x.com/DazrTheKing">Dazr</a> has posted a video showcasing exactly what the bench in question will do should you sit in it. <strong>Last warning if you're still here</strong>, this will show you everything:</p>

<p>The first thing that comes to mind for us when looking at this is that it's remarkably similar to how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> played a mean trick on gamers with the Mimic enemy. These things disguise themselves as chests which, when opening, triggers a pretty devastating attack.</p>
<p>It's a pretty clever – albeit naughty – way to lull players into a false sense of security, and it shifts your mindset going forwards. Nothing is truly safe within the world of Silksong, and you'd best keep your wits about you at all times.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> contains what could be a cheeky reference to this year's prior headline success story from a smaller developer, Sandfall Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. Are you playing Team Cherry's new metroidvania? Here's how to find that Easter egg. Beware mild area and equipment spoilers from this point on.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Briefly, you'll need to head west of Wormways and play your needolin at the nearby Weavenest Karn. Alas, you might need to cough up 500 rosaries for a Simple Key in order to access the place, if you haven't already. The needolin, for context, is a musical instrument that sometimes reveals apparitions and other ghostly activity, when plucked in the right area - read our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong walkthrough</a> hub for more. In this case, Hornet's lonely ditty will trigger some phantom text about sleep and entrapment, which includes the phrase "for those who come after".
</p>
<p>
We first <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Q1cQyr5">learned of this</a> from Reddit, spawning ground for any and all videogame Easter egg reports and also, any number of fakes. Our James then dug out his savegame from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Hollow Knight: Silksong review</a> and confirmed that the sequence is real.
</p>
<p>
"For those who come after" is the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWate4IdV7M">a beloved orchestral track from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. It's a key phrase in the game's story, uttered by characters laying down their lives in the quest to stop the Paintress. It's also, of course, a fairly everyday bit of writing, the kind of line that adorns many a memorial work, and the reference could be accidental. But the shared musical context inclines me to believe that Team Cherry intended the connection.
</p><p>
I do hope it's intentional. I love this kind of embedded compliment. It reminds me of when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> devs wrote a whole in-game skit about hairdryers to express their fondness for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/07/alien-isolation-preview">Cara Ellison's Guardian preview</a>. (My equivalent for that is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/high-on-life">High On Life</a> devs derisively including my Eurogamer "Avoid" in their accolades trailer.)</p>
<p>I also very much like that the apparent link is revealed through music, as though Hornet's soulful string-plucking had flittered across the void of commerce and raised an echo from the art nouveau necropolis of Expedition 33. There you are, I've overegged the pudding now.
</p>
<p>
Sandfall Interactive appear fond of Silksong themselves - they've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1ndhpxh/expedition_33_devs_celebrating_silksong/">posted some congratulatory art</a> featuring Hornet and Clair Obscur's Maelle. Let's see if the good vibes persist come GOTY voting time.
</p>
<p>Silksong's other secrets include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-out-hollow-knight-silksongs-hiding-a-sneaky-stardew-valley-creatorman-cameo">a mystery cameo from Eric Barone, creator of Stardew Valley</a>, and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-hollow-knight-silksong-does-have-another-difficulty-mode-just-not-the-one-you-probably-want">hidden mode that probably isn't the kind you're hoping for</a>. I think it's safe to say that there's much else to discover.</p>

But there was a small segment of people who had a somewhat different reaction:&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>oh no</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/7-games-have-pushed-publishing-dates-in-response-to-silksong">At least eight different developers or publishers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;saw the news and were forced to make a decision, because their own games were scheduled right in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silksong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s path.

Those studios (and others) opted instead to delay their games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Release dates aren't idly dropped onto a calendar. Developers and publishers meticulously&nbsp;plan their development schedules and release calendars well in advance of a public announcement.

"'We look at making sure we're spacing our own projects, because the resources of the marketing team, production team, localization, whatever it is, needs to be spaced out. Then, as you might imagine, we're looking at competition. What else has been announced for that time period?"'</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lowrie said that includes other games, yes, but also hardware launches, big promotions like Steam sales that take over the platform, and major events like Summer Game Fest. "We try to look at both the storefronts themselves, but as well just what might be happening in games and making sure we're giving our games the best possible chance at their own time in the spotlight," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A lot of big games are predictable. It can be easier to predict where annualized games like Call of Duty will fall on a calendar, but then there are the titles that come out of nowhere and cannibalize attention—stuff like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silksong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunted Chocolatier</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Those are the sorts of games that publishers like Devolver Digital are always mindful of. "They have earned the right to have their own spot and may push you out, and that's OK," Lowrie said. It's about more than just consumer dollars, he said. It's consumer time. Creators' time. It's a platform's availability to promote your game.

Should they stick with September or move to November? The problem with September is&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">; a direct, big competitor that would certainly eat up people's time.

"Steam, they're probably a little bit more easy going about that sort of thing. Let's just say, the week—the seven days following the announcement of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silksong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s release date—I think I aged maybe five or six years."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silksong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s release date was announced, Devolver Digital's Lowrie said the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;team reached out: "Hey, I guess we should talk," he said of the call. "We discussed that while they're not the same genre, it's important to take into account your audience and the kind of people that like to play your games—players, creators, press.

The teams pitched around ideas, but Cuzzillo ended up mocking up a version of what would eventually be released, and Boch used&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' complex soundscape as inspiration for the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hollow Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sounds that play with the video.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It ended up being one of Devolver Digital's most watched videos for&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;on its channels.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-has-sold-200k-units-so-far-and-there%E2%80%99s-no-plan-for-a-sequel.1294464/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, Bloober Team <a href="https://ir.blooberteam.com/report/espi-30-2025-wyniki-sprzedazy-gry-cronos-the-new-dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed with a brief notice</a> that its new sci-fi horror game Cronos: The New Dawn has sold 200K units digitally in the first three days. It's not terrible, but it's not great, either, especially since the game was released on all major platforms, including the record-breaking console Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>It's way too early to spell doom for the Polish studio, anyway. CEO Piotr Babieno told <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Bloober-nie-widzi-zagrozenia-dla-Cronos-The-New-Dawn-w-zwiazku-z-debiutem-Hollow-Knight-Silksong-wywiad-9003011.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankier.pl</a> that the budget of Cronos: The New Dawn was lower than estimated by investors, which means it won't take that much to recoup the investment:</p>



<p><em>We also noticed that the costs of creating Cronos: The New Dawn were estimated at over PLN 100 million ($27.4 million). I can assure you that the development budget was certainly not that high, and even though we are counting on very good sales results, the break-even point is not as high as analysts indicate. We are completely confident about the company's investment growth and earnings. All our analyses indicate that things will be fine, but we will of course report on sales levels when we reach significant milestones.</em></p>



<p>Babieno also confirmed that there are no current plans for a sequel, although a transmedia expansion to cinema or TV is certainly possible. On the development side, Bloober is preparing even larger titles for the next couple of years, which Babieno believes will be even better than 2025 for the studio.</p>



<p>For those still on the fence for Cronos: The New Dawn, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here's our review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo, who thoroughly enjoyed the experience and rated it 8 out of 10.</p>



<p><em>Although its first hours do a frankly bad job of getting players involved from a gameplay perspective, Cronos: The New Dawn is ultimately a very engaging game, and one of Bloober Team's best games alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake. While its flaws remain evident throughout the adventure, the game's unique setting, engaging mystery-filled story, and gameplay, which starts coming together after the very first boss battle a few hours in, make The Traveler's mission one worthy of embarking on for all survival horror fans, especially those who love the Dead Space series.</em></p>

            <p>There's another message about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>'s Coronations DLC for you to read, sire. Developers PDS Black have apologised for the update not being up to par, and issued the first of multiple patches aimed at rectifying its issues.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To recap, this add-on fleshes out ascending to the throne in the crown-heavy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game a bit more, as well as letting you set a key goal for your regime. It arrived earlier this week, and the Steam reviews <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-debuts-to-boos-and-jeers-from-the-steam-review-court-largely-thanks-to-broken-oath-breaking">quickly sank to mostly negative</a>. The main gripes were buggy oaths - you can swear oaths at the end of coronations, earning rewards if you fulfil your oath on time - and whether gating some relatively small-scale yet significant features behind paid DLC was justified.</p>
<p>Paradox have now responded to that backlash, with a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/update-1-17-0-1-a-long-overdue-apology.1858561/">statement penned by Riad</a>, a QA manager at Crusader Kings 3 developer PDS Black. Writing that the Coronations wasn't "up to the standard you deserve", the developer continued: "It is clear we didn’t give the project the resources and attention it needed, and the result was a release that let you down. You have every right to be upset, and I want to acknowledge that openly."</p>
<p>According to Riad, the upcoming All Under Heaven DLC, which'll expand the game's map into China, Japan and southeast Asia, has required the vast majority of the studio's attention and resources. As a result, the team working on the smaller Coronations had to get by with "limited resources" and less staff.</p><p>"As a studio, we’re taking a hard look at how we assign resources, and support our developers so that every release meets the expectations you rightfully have," the QA manager wrote. "For example, we will be more stringent about allowing last-minute changes to the game (which can cause issues like broken oaths). We will also ensure that we dedicate more time towards full-length playthroughs throughout the entire development cycle, to ensure that issues like these can’t slip through."</p>
<p>Riad added that it "hurts so much when we fuck up like this", and that the studio will be aiming to earn back the trust of players. That'll likely be a very tall order given that this is hardly a one-off for Paradox. The publishers have acquired a bit of a reputation for regularly releasing DLC which is either <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-apologise-for-releasing-the-worst-reviewed-game-on-steam">low quality</a>, viewed as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">unnecessary extra monetisation</a>, or some combo of the two. The latter's been front and centre recently with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>'s paid DLC clans, a mess we're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-take-first-step-in-response-to-bloodlines-2s-dlc-clan-backlash-with-playstation-refunds-promise-more-info-next-week">currently waiting to see the full extent of Paradox's cleanup plans</a> for. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether you're ready to trust Paradox again, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a> devs have quickly put out a patch aimed at fixing the main issues with Coronations' oaths. Riad also specified that there'll be "at least one more patch" for the DLC coming, "to fix many of the issues we encountered ahead of the release, but didn’t have enough time to fix". You can find the full notes for the first patch, which is out now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/517472660906573991?l=english">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Grit &amp; Valor 1949 is set, fairly obviously in 1949, but it’s not the 1949 that our grandparents experienced. This is an alternate history, and one where WW2 still rages on. It’s also an alternate history drawing on Steampunk ideas and aesthetics, where battlefields clamour with the sounds of mechs and unlikely weaponry. Grit &amp; Valor takes this setting and turns it into a real-time tactical roguelite, fusing ideas from games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/19/advance-wars-1-2-reboot-review/">Advance Wars</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/31/into-the-breach-review/">Into The Breach</a> with small scale RTS games like Bad North into a new, mostly cohesive, whole.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grit and Valor - 1949 | Official Console Launch Trailer: XBOX X|S and PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sv2Cs_oZhl4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You’re part of the Resistance, fighting back against the evil Axis from a small island outpost off the coast of Scotland. Your task is to liberate each region from its Axis occupiers, forcing them from the British Isles, back into France and Western Europe, before finally facing the enemy’s seat of power in New Germany. Each area has multiple stages, and multiple pathways through which, as this is a roguelite, you’ll be hoping to pick up the best enhancements along the way.</p>


<p>The tutorial is suspiciously straightforward, and extremely quick before sending you over the top into live combat. While you move around each battlefield by stomping through a fixed grid, you don’t select individual targets for regular attacks; instead, you rely on your mechs targeting the nearest villain in their sights.</p>
<p>Just like Fire Emblem, there’s a weapon triangle at work here to distinguish who will have the upper hand, so Ballistic Class is strong against Fire, Fire is strong against Explosives, and Explosives beat out Ballistics.</p>


<p>Each Mech has a different class then, but also its own pilot, with each driver having their own special ability to help you out in the field. Archie Miller, the chap in control during the tutorial, has a Jump Jet ability that lets you leap across the battlefield and cause damage to enemies in a wide area, while Emilia Rochefort can heal her Mech. The third starting pilot, Jan Nowak, can lay traps, leaving mines in the path of advancing enemy vehicles. You need to know when to deploy these skills, not least because they have a limited number of uses, and they’ll often mean the difference between success and failure.</p>
<p>During each battle, there are crate drops containing enhancements for your mechs. Each crate gives you three options to choose from, with different levels of rarity denoting the most powerful or unique abilities. You might also pick up repair packs here, letting you regain some health for one of your team, while you steadily try to create an arsenal that will see you through to the very end.</p>
<p>That’s unlikely to happen in one run. As you fight you’re also earning currency to spend on permanent upgrades, and it’s these that will fundamentally raise your chances of success.</p>

<p>There’s a lot going on in Grit &amp; Valor’s diorama-like levels. You have to juggle grabbing objectives, taking cover, protecting your Command unit, and taking out the Axis forces, all the while making sure you’ve got the best matchups going on through the weapon triangle. As it takes place in real time, it can be a little chaotic, and while the pad controls do a good job, I can’t help but feel that a mouse makes these things easier. Now, if they happen to drop a Switch 2 patch with mouse support, that might be the perfect answer.</p>
<p>It’s all a lot of fun though. While the game on Switch isn’t as detailed or high resolution as on other platforms, I still appreciate the Steampunk comic-like visuals. The action is easy to parse, but challenging, and there’s a clear sense of progression, as every run grants you new Mechs, new parts or the ability to upgrade something that will make your life easier next time out. It’s fast-paced and it doesn’t waste your time, and as a Switch game, it’s an ideal title to pick up and play, get a run in, or a couple of stages within one, and then head off to do something else.</p>

<p>There were a couple of times where the game crashed while playing, with it soft-locking in the menus and preventing me from advancing. However, a quick reset let me progress, and it didn’t get in the way of things too much – it’s possible that it might have been an oddity compatibility support when playing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>By its very nature, Grit &amp; Valor becomes quite repetitive. It’s carried through by your steadily expanding arsenal and abilities, and that search for an ideal run into enemy territory, but you have to be completely sold on the fundamental gameplay early on. Personally, I think it pulls it off, with the visuals and alternate history setting really drawing me in, but I could see some players losing faith with the repetition and chaos-tinged battles.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-high-difficulty-game-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> yesterday, FromSoftware has now released a free update for Elden Ring Nightreign, adding the brand new Deep of Night mode to the game.</p>



<p>This was designed as an endgame challenge for experienced players. Deep of Night can hide the Nightlord and Shifting Earth from players until battle begins. Enemies across Limveld will be more challenging, and random enemies will be mutated, potentially presenting greater dangers to players, who, however, can oppose these strengthened foes with new weapon enhancements. Beware, though, as some of these weapon enhancements could also have detrimental effects, such as increasing the amount of damage players take. </p>



<p>Players must be highly selective if they hope to survive the night and ultimately defeat the Nightlord. Three new relic slots have been introduced exclusively for Depths Relics, a new reward players can earn while playing the Deep of Night game mode. These Depths Relics can provide powerful enhancements, but, as with the new variant weapons, they also come at a cost. Victory will require skillful calculation and execution. Deep of Night mode is meant explicitly for the bravest Nightfarers, providing an extreme challenge and showing players the darkest depths of the game, including the dreadful possibility of unknowingly facing an Everdark Sovereign Nightlord.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is the latest in a series of successful game releases by FromSoftware. While not quite as critically acclaimed as its predecessor, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already sold five million units in the first month of its release</a>. Meanwhile, the Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree reached 10 million units.</p>



<p>Even Hollywood noticed the franchise's popularity. In late May, a live-action film was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rumored-a24-elden-ring-movie-with-alex-garland-writing-and-directing-is-reportedly-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>; it will be produced by A24 and Bandai Namco. Alex Garland, the man behind 28 Days Later, Dredd, Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War, and Warfare, is attached to direct and write the script. </p>
