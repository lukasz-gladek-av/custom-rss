<p>Gearbox is about to launch Borderlands 4, a new installment in its most lucrative franchise by far. It's been six years since Borderlands 3, although there were the spin-offs fantasy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> and the forgettable adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/new-tales-from-the-borderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Tales from the Borderlands</a>, both released in 2021, in between.</p>



<p>Let's recap everything we have learned about the game from the developers since its <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/">unveiling</a> at Gamescom 2024.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions<br></h2>



<p>In February, Gearbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-to-release-on-september-23rd-on-pc-and-consoles-new-gameplay-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Borderlands 4 would debut on September 23. However, in late April, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought it forward to September 12</a>. At the time, most believed that publisher Take-Two Interactive had dictated the move due to the imminent launch of Grand Theft Auto VI, then still scheduled for Fall 2025. However, Gearbox president Randy Pitchford was quick to state that the date change <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-denies-rumor-that-borderlands-4-launching-early-has-to-do-with-the-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had nothing to do with GTA VI</a>, and he was proven right mere days later, when Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> GTA VI's delay to May 26, 2026. </p>



<p>Borderlands 4 will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2, although users of the latter platform will have to wait a bit more to play the game. Unlike most games nowadays, there won't be any 'early access' for those wishing to purchase more expensive editions. However, said editions do come with many perks.</p>



<p>The Standard edition is priced at $69.99. The Deluxe Edition costs $99.99 and includes the <strong>Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin</strong> and the <strong>Bounty Pack Bundle</strong>, which consists of the following post-launch Borderlands 4 content:</p>



<ul>
<li>4 unique areas, featuring new missions and unique bosses</li>



<li>4 Vault Cards with unique challenges and rewards</li>



<li>New gear and weapons</li>



<li>New Vault Hunter cosmetics</li>



<li>4 New vehicles with new cosmetics</li>
</ul>



<p>The Super Deluxe Edition is priced at $129.99 and adds the following to the above:</p>



<p><strong>Ornate Order Pack</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>4 Vault Hunter Skins</li>



<li>4 Vault Hunter Heads</li>



<li>4 Vault Hunter Bodies</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Vault Hunter Pack</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>2 new playable Vault Hunters</li>



<li>2 new Story Packs, featuring all new story and side missions</li>



<li>2 new map regions</li>



<li>New gear and weapons</li>



<li>New Vault Hunter cosmetics</li>



<li>New ECHO-4 cosmetics</li>
</ul>



<p>All editions of Borderlands 4, if pre-ordered, will provide access to the <strong>Gilded Glory Pack bundle</strong>, which consists of 1 Vault Hunter Skin, 1 ECHO-4 Drone Skin, and 1 Weapon Skin.</p>

<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>The franchise can be considered the original looter shooter, and this new installment will be no exception. </p>



<p>However, the setting is different from the previous titles. Long gone is the planet Pandora, which had been the focus of every game in the series except for New Tales from the Borderlands. This new entry follows directly from the ending of Borderlands 3, where Lilith uses her Siren powers to teleport the moon Elpis away (saving Pandora in the process). An unintended consequence is that Elpis's arrival in the orbit of the planet Kairos destroys the planet's protective barrier, making it visible to everyone after a very long time of staying hidden.</p>



<p>Kairos is a planet ruled through fear and oppression by a dictator named The Timekeeper. However, the uncloaking caused by the moon Elpis sparked chaos and uprisings. Players take the role of a Vault Hunter who ends up leading the resistance against The Timekeeper while, of course, seeking various alien artifacts. Borderlands 4 is also going to shift the series' trademark humor a bit. It will still be there, mostly in side content, but the main storyline will be a bit more serious than fans are used to due to the dictatorship theme.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Like its predecessors, the game will focus heavily on shooting and looting. However, the new installment offers several enhancements. To start with, Gearbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-more-vertical-and-lets-you-go-anywhere-and-thats-why-it-doesnt-have-a-minimap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the map is the biggest and most seamless in the franchise, allowing players to explore freely. There's a lot more verticality, too, which players will be able to exploit thanks to climbing, the grappling hook, and gliding. Other movement options include dashing, sliding, and double jumping. </p>



<p>Because of the exploration changes, the developers have opted to use a Bethesda-style compass rather than the mini-map seen in previous Borderlands games. They did not completely close the door to adding the feature post-launch if the fans really want it, though. Exploring Kairos will be spiced up by dynamic weather and events. Furthermore, players will be able to command their own vehicle to reach further destinations more quickly.</p>



<p>In terms of combat changes, Borderlands 4 introduces a new ordnance slot, which groups together grenades and heavy weaponry, including rocket launchers. These weapons can be fired or thrown until the ammo is depleted. Then, they possess cooldown timers that refill the ammo and the ability to activate again over a short timeframe. There are also new repair kits that can regenerate health or provide other benefits, such as increased elemental damage, fire rate, and movement speed.</p>



<p>At launch, Borderlands 4 will offer four playable characters to choose from:</p>



<p><strong>Vex the Siren</strong> - She had a hard life, fending for herself for her entire life. This perhaps explains her cynical and sarcastic nature, but beneath her rough exterior and general pessimism, she still believes in helping others. If helping means blasting oppressive jerks, all the better.</p>



<p><strong>Rafa the Exo-Soldier</strong> - He was born and raised in microgravity, which altered his bone density and musculature so severely that he could not survive anywhere else. However, Rafa was desperate to explore and enlisted in Tediore's military. In exchange for a tour of duty, his body was modified to fit a new exosuit. However, when it became clear that Tediore never intended to release him from service, he went on the run, planning to enjoy whatever time he has left before his Tediore Deadframe ends him for good.</p>



<p><strong>Harlowe the Gravitar</strong> - A former Maliwan combat scientist, she is driven by the need to understand how things work. This initially made her an outcast among her Traunt relatives, but she has used her intellect to bring new technology and gadgets to the battlefield as a Vault Hunter. Her brilliance is evident in everything she does, as is her enthusiasm and love for life.</p>



<p><strong>Amon the Forgeknight</strong> - He was raised in a Vault monster-worshipping cult until the Vault opened and the creature turned on everyone he loved. The only survivor of the ensuing carnage, he dedicates his life to finding and killing as many of these beasts as he possibly can. At heart, Amon is a warrior-poet who is introspective and unflinching in his duty. Despite his rugged appearance, he has a warm attitude and often shares stories and advice from his travels with his comrades.</p>



<p>At least two additional playable characters will be introduced to Borderlands 4 at some point after launch. As with previous franchise entries, the game will support cooperative gameplay for up to four players, this time with cross-play between all platforms.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Borderlands-4-characters-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5. Gearbox has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassured</a> fans that the Nintendo Switch 2 is powerful enough to run the game well.</p>



<p>Indeed, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official PC system requirements</a> aren't the most taxing we've seen for an Unreal Engine 5 game:</p>



<p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em><br><em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br><em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br><em>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</em><br><em>Memory: 16 GB RAM</em><br><em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</em><br><em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br><em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8 CPU Cores for processor. Requires 8 GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Recommended</strong>:</em><br><em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br><em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br><em>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</em><br><em>Memory: 32 GB RAM</em><br><em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</em><br><em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br><em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8+ CPU Cores for processor. Requires 12+ GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>



<p>So far, Gearbox hasn't officially partnered with AMD or NVIDIA for Borderlands 4, but that may change before launch. If it does, we'll update this article.</p>

		<p>The Witcher 3’s Blood &amp; Wine introduces players to the almost fairytale duchy of Touissant, a region of the world that owes fealty to Nilfgaard but has its own independence under the rule of Duquessa Anna Henrietta. It is a world that has rolling hills, vineyards, knights, and a beautiful castle that dominates the skyline. This too good to be true Duchy is under threat from a Beast that is targeting individuals and is putting fear into the population, especially in the city of Beauclair. However, while the story is about a beast that is sowing terror, Blood &amp; Wine can be considered a commentary on class disparity within society.</p>
<p><em>Spoiler Warning: It should go without saying, but this article contains spoilers for The Witcher 3 and its Blood &amp; Wine DLC.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine | Launch Trailer [GOG]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b7YtrkeSMGs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h2>Rich and Poor in Toussaint</h2>
<p>When we as Geralt first venture into Toussaint, we do so in the company of knights giving a sense of splendour to the journey. You come across a new victim of the Beast, de la Croix, another knight and are soon on the way to be meet the Duquessa in Beauclair. The sense of splendour remains as you walk through the winding streets and steep hills of the city until you are in the company of Anna Henrietta, in royal regalia and surrounded by other rich and other influential people. They stand at the top of the societal ladder, but it also reflects in the city’s layout and further afield.</p>
<p>Beauclair Palace sits atop the hill of the city and it is the pinnacle of power and wealth in Touissant. However, as you make your way down the hill you see not everything is well in this almost unreal looking location. Go a few tiers down and you are still in a relatively wealthy part of the city with nice inns like The Pheasantry, shops that sell expensive paintings, and a master blacksmith. Keep going down the hill and you start noticing a difference where the paint isn’t so colourful, the types of establishments in the area more run down, and beggars asking for alms in the shadow of the castle. It reflects reality in that the richest cities in the world have an endemic situation of homelessness, coming from a variety of causes like unaffordable homes and unemployment.</p>


<p>In Toussaint, people who rise do so at Anna’s discretion, while others will never have such favour placed upon them. The only real employment, aside from working in stores, seems to be limited to working on the region’s vineyards which is back-breaking. It also does not seem to pay well, and we see in one quest that at least one vineyard owner does not even care that one of his workers has been killed, commenting he will just replace him with another peasant. It is an attitude the rich and powerful have in Toussaint, of seeing those not of their class as lesser and expendable. This plays in to events later in the main quest but more of that in a bit.</p>
<h2>Higher and Lower Vampires</h2>
<p>Humans are not the only society ruled and divided by class hierarchy. In Blood and Wine we get more insight into vampire society, and how this is also divided between Higher and Lower. The Higher Vampires that exist in Blood and Wine includes Regis, an ally of Geralt, and Dettlaff, who we also learn is in the Beast. Both of them are known as Higher Vampires because they employ things like reason, have deep emotions, and are capable of living in plain sight within human society. Lower vampires are those like Bruxa, Alps, Ekimmaras, and Katakans. They are represented as being more animalistic, acting on instinct rather than any sort of reason.</p>
<p>This reflect the way human society also structures itself. Those at the top would consider themselves as reasonable and intelligent, while those lower in social standing are considered less intelligent, less reasonable and prone to rashness. It is seen across representation within TV shows as well as how certain groups are portrayed within factual media like the news, with headlines and perspectives altered based on the subject’s class and background.</p>
<p>Both Regis and Dettlaff are shown to have some reason, though Dettlaff also represents what happens when those who consider themselves to be reasonable and smart collapse under the weight of strong emotions and instinct. He shows how desperate those with any sort of power, possession, or even love will go to hold on to that, and what they will unleash if they are wronged with consequences felt by those with no say in the matter.</p>

<h2>The Vampire Attack on Beauclair</h2>
<p>The events of Blood and Wine culminate in an attack on the city of Beauclair with Dettlaff and Anna Henrietta at war. This is a war between two of the most powerful individuals of their respective societies, because neither gets what they truly want. Dettlaff wanted Syanna, his former lover and Anna’s sister, to come meet him to get some closure on the whole thing. Anna instead locked her sister in a tower, leading to a massacre.</p>
<p>On both sides, we see a lack of care and compassion for the lower classes. Anna will still not agree to anything that would jeopardise her sister or even her power. From Regis we learn lower vampires do not usually follow the will of higher vampires, but Dettlaff has compelled them to attack Beauclair. What this represents is the ruling and political classes forcing the poorer classes of their societies to engage in violence with each other, while the rulers stay hidden and behind layers of safety to protect them from the violence they have commanded to be unleashed. The vampires attack is primarily focused on the lower districts of Beauclair, with a couple of attacks on the main castle, so the majority of people killed are from the lower and middle classes with the higher classes relatively unscathed. &nbsp;This is war the world over. Political classes from across the globe make demands of each other and when they are not met, wars are declared with the majority of the suffering being bared by those who had no say in any of the decision making, left to pick up the pieces as their lives are shattered.</p>

<p>The Witcher 3’s Blood and Wine is not just a story about a vampire killing certain targets in a fanciful society, it is a commentary on class and social disparity. It exposes myths of power and reason being the sole purview of the higher classes, but it also shows how the actions of the most powerful in society can have a devastating effect on the lower classes.</p>
<p>The attack on Beauclair shows the lower classes of both human and vampire society thrown into the meat grinder. Class and social disparity will not be solved overnight and we will likely go through many more generations before there is a re-evaluation on societal structures, but it is important to be aware of these issues and try to contribute to improving society no matter how small your contribution.</p>

<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f75f64ff116d8/magical-quest-3-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Looking back at last week, we checked out Star Wars: Rogue Squadron for the N64, pitting North America and Europe against Japan. It wasn't even close either, with the western design winning with a resounding 89% of the vote. 89%! We quite like the Japanese design too...</p>
<p>This week, we're looking at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/disneys_magical_quest_3_starring_mickey_and_donald">Disney's Magical Quest 3 Starring Mickey And Donald</a> for the GBA. Why? Because that's the one I found first, okay? Released in 2005, it was a port of the original 1995 SNES version and received fairly middling reviews, with most finding it to be a lesser game than its predecessors.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97fgvzrij&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhK3W_3CW7w" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>But let's cut to the chase. It's a full blown brawl this week with three combatants. So let's get cracking!</p>
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9399360f08982/magical-quest-3-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Disney / Launchbox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Europe and Japan share similarities this week, but it's North America that went down a different route with its approach. It's still got Mickey and Donald front and centre, but they're chilling out in a forest area, and Mickey is all kitted out in his knight's armour. Rad.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f0d9879bc381f/magical-quest-3-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Disney / Launchbox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design seems slightly more action-packed, and Donald's wearing a different costume here too. Both characters are punching and whacking enemies, while the logo design itself is similar to North America's albeit with a dark shadow surrounding the letters.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Magical Quest 3 - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e8c60871b7bf/magical-quest-3-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Disney / Launchbox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's design uses the same artworks as Europe's, but you can see a bit more of it this time. We love the logo design here too, but we must admit that the yellow background is kinda gross.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/tony-hawk-reiterates-decisions-behind-song-choices-in-pro-skater-3-plus-4</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> rolled out on multiple platforms this week, and while it's a fantastic throwback to the glory days of the series, there are obviously some differences. Apart from the changes to THPS4, <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-full-soundtrack">the soundtrack</a> is missing some notable classics.</p>
<p>The Birdman himself <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?hl=en">already explained to fans months ago</a> how he wanted to include "some different songs" – including different songs by some of the same artists.</p>
<p>Now, in a <a href="https://youtu.be/W_PvXRze24U">recent interview with BBC News</a>, he reiterated how this decision was apparently about introducing players to new music they might not have heard before. He also reminded fans how he's not the only one who makes the calls about the game's soundtrack – acknowledging the team's input, but he did manage to get at least some of his picks in the latest release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tony Hawk:</strong> "These days, just what I think fits, and what I'm interested in – I'm not the only decider in these soundtracks, but I did manage to throw a couple of bands in... I also picked songs by artists that were already in the game, but a different song, and not everyone agreed with that decision, but I feel like 'let's keep it fresh' and also 'here's help discovering other music', and I think in the beginning that's what people expected of it – once the soundtrack was a prominent part of the game, people were like 'ok' what are you going to throw at us now?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His latest comments about the game's soundtrack also respond to a question about why <a href="https://youtu.be/-NPLYBIwjjg">Alien Ant Farm's song 'Wish'</a> was excluded from the latest release – with the reason, supposedly, once again tied to the concept of making room for "new acts and new songs":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wasn't zeroing in on them per say, it was more we're trying to make room for new acts and new songs as well, and not everything makes the cut, it's nothing personal, and I appreciate that people have a fondness for that song [Wish], especially in relation to our game, so you know, just fire it up on your streaming service if you're so inclined."</p>

<p>The previous release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tony_hawks_pro_skater_1_plus_2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a> adopted a similar approach with the soundtrack, and <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/au/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-new-skaters">the character roster in the latest game</a> follows the same format (like the previous game) – mixing legends and new pro talent. Tony touched on this in the same interview, along with the selection process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was trying to keep it modern obviously, whilst still respecting the legends that we had in the previous games, and also it was a matter of who was still actively skating, who was still in the scene. It's a delicate balance, but I'm really excited to have people like Chloe Covell, to have Rayssa from Brazil, and Andy Anderson."</p>

<p>Skater and Jackass star <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/bam-margera-officially-confirmed-for-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Bam Magera also made it in at the late stages</a> of development, and so Tony "immediately hit up Activision" asking it to include him.

			<p>Nintendo is about to launch the second big first-party exclusive Switch 2 game: Donkey Kong Bananza. Earlier this week, the development team confirmed that Donkey Kong Bananza started development on the original Switch just like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>. </p>



<p>Why did they make it an exclusive, though, rather than a cross-generation title? Here's an answer provided by Nintendo EPD Game Director Kazuya Takahashi in an interview with Spanish website <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20250710/10876902/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-entrevista.html">Lavanguardia</a>:</p>



<p><em>As we mentioned before, we wanted to create continuity through the chain of destruction, and to achieve this, we needed to include a large number of destructible objects. This was only possible on Nintendo Switch 2, which allowed for the placement of so many elements on screen, as well as various materials and large-scale destruction. Additionally, to enhance the sense of satisfaction of destruction, we put a lot of effort into the effects and sounds, as well as the appearance of the objects being destroyed.</em></p>



<p>The interviewer pointed out that, after going hands-on with Donkey Kong Bananza, it looked like there were some frame rate issues in the preview build. Here's what Takahashi had to say about that:</p>



<p><em>There are several factors to consider. First, we intentionally used effects like hit-stop and slow motion to emphasize impacts. Second, because we use voxel technology, there are times when there are major changes and destruction in the environment. We're aware that performance may drop slightly at these times. However, as you say, overall the game is smooth, and at points where large-scale changes occur, we prioritized fun and playability.</em></p>



<p>It doesn't sound like they are at all worried about it. We'll know more about the severity of the performance problems and indeed about the game as a whole next week, given that Nintendo is launching Donkey Kong Bananza on Thursday, July 17.</p>



<p>Look forward to our review when the embargo drops. In the meantime, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our hands-on preview</a>.</p>

<p>Cracking down on piracy</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38585bf10eedc/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this week, a major Switch ROM site known as 'nsw2u' was seized by the FBI as part of a 'law enforcement operation'.</p>
<p>Now, we've got an official statement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, highlighting the other sites seized. Here it is in full (via the official FBI website):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>FBI Atlanta Seizes Major Video Game Piracy Websites</strong></p>
<div><p>The FBI's Atlanta Field Office announced today the seizure of several online criminal marketplaces providing pirated versions of popular video games.</p><p>

In addition to the seizure, the FBI has dismantled the infrastructure of these websites.</p><p>

For more than four years, the websites contained pirated copies of highly anticipated video games days or weeks before their official release date.</p><p>

Between February 28, 2025, and May 28, 2025, records indicate a total of 3.2 million downloads occurred on these sites from the most used download service. These actions resulting in an estimated loss of $170 million.</p><p>

As part of the actions announced today, the FBI has obtained authorization to seize the domain of multiple sites, to include nsw2u.com, nswdl.com, game-2u.com, bigngame.com, ps4pkg.com, ps4pkg.net, and mgnetu.com. These domains hosted and facilitated access to the pirated video games. Anyone visiting these sites will now view a seizure banner that notifies them the domain has been seized by federal authorities.</p></div></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xmvlir&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The game's director Kazuya Takahashi has now reportedly acknowledged these issues in a chat with the <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20250710/10876902/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-entrevista.html">Spanish outlet Lavanguardia</a> – seemingly confirming these frame rate drops will be in the final build during more destructive moments of the game. For Nintendo, it was instead apparently about prioritising "fun and playability".</p>
<p>Here's Takahashi's full response (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/donkey-kong-bananza-frame-rate-drops-director/">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8zsphlq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Although there will be some slight drops, as Takahashi mentions, the "overall" experience is still smooth.</p>
<p>In our recent preview of Donkey Kong Bananza, we noted how the experience in this new release felt a bit like a "TOTK situation" where the performance might not be perfect, but you forgive it for its ambition. So, if you're jumping into DK's new adventure on release and encounter changes in performance, don't be surprised.</p>
<p>We'll deliver our full review for Donkey Kong Bananza next week, so you can find out then how the final build performs.</p>

<p>Latency, performance and resolution investigated</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>GameCube has joined the Switch 2's library of classic games, and it was recently updated with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Mario Smash Football</a>. While the service's experience has been fun so far, there have also been some reports of underlying issues with the emulation.</p>
<p>Now, Digital Foundry has tested GameCube emulation and backward compatibility – investigating latency, analogue stick issues, frame drop issues on Switch 2, and resolution and performance improvements. The verdict is "certain details clearly need attending to by Nintendo".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For arcade-perfect accuracy in the likes of F-Zero GX, the extra input latency on Switch 2 should ideally be addressed, and likewise the sensitivity of those analogue sticks, the pattern of single frame drops in all games is also an obvious blemish but fundamentally the four games released on the GameCube classics page so far are faithfully represented."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows a video from game developer and YouTuber Modern Vintage Gamer about GameCube games on the Switch 2 – summing up the initial experience as "very good" but also having some "obvious" differences from the real experience.</p>
<p>To access this latest Switch Classics library, you'll need to have access to a Switch 2 and an active Expansion membership.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-survival-unit-is-a-global-multiplayer-experience-set-in-a-parallel-universe-featuring-leon-jill-and-the-resi-4-merchant">IGN</a> explains it, Survival Unit's story begins with your character's recovery as an Umbrella Corp test subject. In a bid to fight back, you'll meet and recruit Resident Evil characters, upgrading their skills and inventories with the now customary visits to the Merchant.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit may be set in a parallel world and explore a new storyline, but players can expect to bump into familiar faces from across the main series, too, and make up their ultimate dream team, including series stalwarts Leon Kennedy and antagonist, Albert Wesker, as well as Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, and Barry Burton.</p>
<p>You can also connect, and compete with, other players and set up and manage a base of operations in the guise of a mansion that long-time fans may recognise.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit is expected to release in 2025, but we don't yet have a solid date.</p>
<p>As for the other recently-announced Resident Evil game, Resident Evil Requiem? Anticipation is evidently high, as Capcom recently announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-already-looks-set-for-massive-success-as-it-hits-significant-wishlist-milestone">over a million of us have already added Resident Evil Requiem to our wishlists</a>.</p>
<p>We got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem last month, when Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. The developer once considered having Leon Kennedy take on the protagonist role for Requiem, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">in the end decided he was "actually quite a bad match for horror"</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-survival-unit-stars-a-bunch-of-your-favourites-including-leon-jill-claire-and-the-real-mvp-barry-burton]]></content:encoded>

            <p>IO Interactive has confirmed it is "addressing" Hitman: World of Assassination issues on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>While no specific time scales were provided for when players can expect an improvement to the Switch 2 launch title, the team is reportedly "working on some of those performance issues right now" and continue to do so "over the summer".</p>

<p>“So for Hitman, the team is working on some of those performance issues right now, and they are addressing it over the summer,” franchise director Jonathan Lacaille told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/io-addresses-hitman-switch-2-performance-issues-and-says-fixes-are-on-the-way/">VGC</a>.</p>
<p>“It's, of course, good learning for us to bring to First Light as well – so all of this will be learnings we bring to the next title."</p>
<p>While the news may not contain a specific timeframe or much detail, it should be good news nonetheless for those struggling to play the game on Nintendo's latest handheld. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/1lroncb/i_hate_the_switch_2_port/">Some</a> are reporting issues with interactionable objects, opening doors, and crashing, while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/1lnz7bo/switch_2_performance/">others</a> complain of "horrible" frame dips and stuttering.</p>
<p>ICYMI, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive">developing a co-op mode for Hitman: World of Assassination</a>. Announced last month, the mode is still relatively under wraps, but does feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode.</p>
<p>On this co-op mode's release, players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side, "challenging" how players approach things now they are going in as one of a pair.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/io-interactive-is-working-on-some-of-those-nintendo-switch-2-performance-issues-right-now]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatched by the crown as part of a secret expedition to a remote island part of the realm, you're ready for a life of adventure. But in third-person RPG Of Ash and Steel you're not one of the highly-trained, well-armored holy knights trying to enforce the will of the king… you're the clever orphan-turned-cartographer along for the ride because the maps of the island, Grayshaft, are pretty bad. Perhaps they're bad because the island suffers periodic volcanic eruptions so devastating that it's blanketed in deadly ash that cakes inside your lungs and kills you, eruptions so awful that ships avoid the island for the entire year when one seems imminent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is obviously why brave cartographer Tristan has agreed to go there. And so like many fantasy protagonists, Tristan will soon be in way over his head—all because he wanted a bit of adventure—when the holy knights are all dead and he's the only one left to deliver the urgent missive. At least, that's what a hands-on preview with a beta build tutorial and first few hours of Ash and Steel told me.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Of Ash &amp; Steel - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of Ash and Steel looks like a pretty traditional RPG, reminiscent of classics from the 2000s. It's unapologetic about not giving you quest markers or anything but in-world directions, but at the same time it does highlight loot on the ground or chests you can interact with when you're near them. It's somewhere between Gothic and the first Witcher game, in its own way, with a nod toward the survival-centric games of the last decade or so. While it doesn't go all-in on survival and encumbrance, Ash and Steel still has something of the 2019 RPG Outward in it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's unapologetic about not giving you quest markers or anything but in-world directions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More than anything, Of Ash and Steel feels like a game in the legacy of dearly departed mid-tier RPG studio Piranha Bytes, creators of the Gothic, Risen, and Elex series. That includes the signature campy acting mixed in with some decent drama, as well as plenty of oddball and unexpected humor. (One early quest has you finding the soiled trousers of a man who, when drunk, just craps himself and leaves the pants right there to clean up later.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps its most old-school feature is how it has no level scaling in its world—creatures are a fixed level in a fixed location, forever. You're warned early on that going off the path can be dangerous, and each new enemy encounter is often a question of getting close enough to see if it massively out-levels you before you decide to try and take it on or not—and hope for good loot when you do. Coupled with that lethal-but-rewarding exploration is the rudiments of a survival system, where staying fed and watered is a must to survive, and setting up shop at pre-determined campsites lets Tristan rest and cook to regain hit points and pick up buffs. It also passes time, which is useful in a world where the NPCs and monsters follow a schedule of their own as to when and where they appear, or even when they're taking a nap and won't talk to you about your very urgent quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tristan has three skill trees, and perhaps the most pressing one is Combat. Investing in combat skills lets you pick up to three different stances to fight from, each of which looks to have different effects based on what kind of weapons you're wielding—there were axes, swords, clubs, daggers, and a crossbow. Sadly, poor starter Tristan wasn't strong or competent enough to wield most of them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is a big part of what I think the story developer Fire Frost is telling with Of Ash and Steel. This isn't a fantasy hero game where your character starts as competent at any useful skills relevant to his current situation. It's going to be a zero-to-hero story, with other characters in the world reacting to Tristan as he grows stronger. "If at the beginning of the game you were treated like a ragamuffin," said Fire Frost, "by the end of the game the characters will literally bow to your feet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a hint of that in action during the preview play, as characters who previously saw Tristan dressed only in threadbare clothing later had complimentary things to say about a suit of basic armor I'd purchased. Where before they'd just asked: "Are you really wearing <em>that?"</em> they later said, "Ah, I had a sturdy suit like that when I was younger."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And a sturdy suit of armor is much needed, because the fighting can get pretty brutal. Armor will help you survive a few hits, but the stamina-based combat was really based around perfectly timed dodges and parries. Tristan's attacks, at least at the start of the game, are slow and clumsy—he's literally never fought before. As he got combat skills, though, he moved more confidently and picked up the ability to parry in a way that opened up enemies for counterattacks. That blended well with a fast knife, which let him get in those hits before quickly going back on his guard. Still, there's some tweaking to do on the early stages of the fighting—some people will definitely bounce right off of how clumsy Tristan was, or just won't be familiar with the time-honored strategy of "train the difficult enemy into a nearby powerful NPC."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A sturdy suit of armor is much needed, because the fighting can get pretty brutal.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of trying to survive, that's the focus of Tristan's other two skill trees: Survival and Crafting. They're much more down-to-earth, practical skillsets simply due to their nature. Survival lets you keep yourself fed and alive, while Crafting lets you upgrade and upkeep your equipment. Crafting also does one very important job: Makes you money. Quests and other odd jobs are a great source of experience and cash, sure, but paying people to train Tristan in all these new skills ain't cheap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was cool is that investments of money and skill points into the Craft and Survival trees actually did pay off in combat. A good craftsman can better sharpen their weapon for bonus damage, or reinforce their armor for extra defense. Survivalists, meanwhile, could pick up nasty tricks like thrown daggers and the use of poisons on their weapons—though poor preview Tristan was a bit too intellectually dull and low-level to get to try those skills out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with all the advantages of level and time, however, Of Ash and Steel is definitely going to be a game where you get your butt kicked. A lot. Quicksave, I expect, is Tristan's greatest friend in the world. Enemies hit hard, and enemies that are higher level than you hit extremely hard—or even so fast that poor low-level Tristan simply stood no chance of reacting in time, let alone getting a single attack in. As a result, he got splatted by a lot of things. He got mauled by a giant rat-thing. Trampled by a big bug. Eaten by a lizard-thing. Dismembered by all manner of bandits, both living and apparently undead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the only dang reason Tristan didn't get splatted by this giant troll is because when everything can splat you, well, you get pretty good pretty fast at running and climbing your way out of danger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some people might find that kind of thing frustrating, Of Ash and Steel was pretty nice on that count. The action-RPG combat was somehow clunkier than a FromSoftware game but settled into its own rhythm after a while, and hopefully gets more and more fluid with more skills and abilities in the full game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't expect miracles from Of Ash and Steel, but the preview was evidence of a promising mid-tier RPG that'll likely enthuse ye olde genre purists while still being accessible and interesting enough to draw in lovers of more modern character-driven action.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/of-ash-and-steel-is-an-old-school-rpg-with-on-the-job-training-for-fantasy-adventurers]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-are-there-no-good-superman-games.1242192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman may be widely regarded as one of the greatest pop culture icons of all time, but there’s one area where even the Man of Steel has struggled to fly. Why, after all these years, aren’t there any good Superman video games? Where is Superman’s answer to Rocksteady Studios' Batman Arkham series or Insomniac’s Spider-Man games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With James Gunn’s Superman movie putting Kal-El back in the spotlight, let’s take a step back to explore Superman’s incredibly rocky gaming history, and why there still hasn’t been a great Superman game after all this time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">DC Universe: Every Upcoming Movie and TV Show</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman’s Ugly Gaming History</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, the problem with properly depicting Superman in games isn’t so different from movies or TV or even the comics. He’s an incredibly powerful character. Some would argue that he’s overpowered. When a guy has this level of strength, speed, and invulnerability, not to mention all the other handy powers like flight and heat vision, it’s hard to paint him as the underdog. How do you build a game around a guy who’s basically all-powerful and still create challenges for the player to overcome? </p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Problem With Superman’s Powers</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/maxresdefault-1752260901743.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Some Superman games have made the mistake of weakening Superman or walling off his powers. That problem dates all the way back to the very first Superman game, 1978’s Superman for the Atari 2600. Like a lot of licensed games on that system, you’d have to squint to even recognize the source material in those blocky, primitive graphics. But that’s not the core issue with the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman tasked players with repairing Lex Luthor’s damage to Metropolis and capturing the villain and his henchmen in as short a time as possible. Exposure to Kryptonite would cause Superman to lose his powers, with the only cure being a kiss from Lois Lane. Not the most auspicious start for the Man of Steel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The NES game is the perfect example of this frustrating trend. Similar to contemporaries like Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest and The Legend of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, the NES Superman featured a top-down overworld map that transitioned into various side-scrolling action levels. However, the game committed the same sin as many superhero games of the time by locking Superman’s various powers behind limited-use special meters. That, combined with a generally obtuse and punishing difficulty level, ensured the NES Superman was never much fun to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When your flight, heat vision, X-ray vision, and other powers are tied to rapidly depleting special meters, you don’t really get the sensation you’re playing as Superman. It’s not as if he normally has to ration his powers in the comics and films. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Superman’s Generic ‘90s Phase</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The late ‘80s and early ‘90s saw a handful of new Superman games released, including the 1988 Superman arcade game from Taito and the 1992 Sega Genesis side-scroller. These games weren’t as egregious as their predecessors about walling off Superman’s powers. The problem during this period was more that Superman was relegated to generic side-scrollers and beat-em-up titles - the same fare gamers were being inundated with across the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most notable release in this crop is 1994’s The Death and Return of Superman. Based on the popular comic book crossover, that game cast players as both Superman and his replacements from the comics like The Eradicator and Steel. It was basically DC’s answer to Spider-Man: Maximum Carnage, coming in an era when the prevailing wisdom for superhero games was “when in doubt, make an arcade-style brawler.” Fine for keeping Superman in the public consciousness, but not for forging games that truly take advantage of his vast powerset. It’s tough to truly feel like a Man of Steel when you’re just moving left to right and punching endless waves of generic enemies.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Infamous Superman 64</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/superman64-1649369538183-1752260801225.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman’s gaming fortunes seemed to be on a slow upswing in the ‘90s, only for the franchise to reach its nadir with 1999’s Superman: The New Adventures. Or as we all know it, Superman 64. Put simply, Superman 64 is still widely regarded as one of the worst games ever made, with clunky flying controls, frustrating difficulty, and more bugs than even Superman’s heat vision could hope to melt. It’s not exactly a looker, either. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman 64 highlights the issue that no game has really nailed the art of controlling Superman in flight in a 3D environment. Superman 64 forced players to steer a clunky Man of Steel through an endless series of rings and obstacle courses in a fog-covered Metropolis. Much later, Superman Returns would emerge with a somewhat better and more intuitive system of flight control, but the lack of Superman games since means no one has iterated on that design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, the franchise did bounce back a bit with the release of 2002’s Superman: Shadow of Apokolips on the PS2 and Gamecube. Compared to Superman 64, that game did a much better job of capturing the look and feel of the animated series. That said, the gameplay never matched up to the production values. If this is generally considered to be the best Superman game of all time, that’s still damning it with faint praise.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Superman the Protector</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the more modern games have veered in a different direction by making Superman himself invulnerable but centering gameplay on rescuing civilians and protecting Metropolis. In some ways, that feels like a step in the right direction. The key to understanding Superman is realizing that, as powerful as he is, he can’t save everybody. He does have limits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, the Xbox got its own Superman game in 2002 courtesy of Infogrames in the form of Superman: The Man of Steel. Based on the comics rather than the animated series or movies, this game pitted Supes against Brainiac. While the game succeeded in giving players control of a wide variety of super-powers, the lousy controls and emphasis on protection missions served as a one-two punch of doom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s 2006’s Superman Returns, a game with interesting ideas but subpar execution. The game featured most of the cast from the film reprising their roles, along with other iconic Superman villains like Bizarro and Metallo for good measure. To its credit, the game didn’t put many limits on Superman’s abilities as it introduced an open-world version of Metropolis. In fact, the Man of Steel himself was effectively invulnerable, with Metropolis itself having a health meter. But between the poor controls, equally bad graphics, and the fact that the game’s final boss was a literal tornado, Superman Returns was ultimately panned.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building a game around rescuing innocent bystanders (like Superman: The Man of Steel) or protecting Metropolis itself (like Superman Returns) can be an exercise in frustration. Protection missions in games are always a tough sell. Without fine-tuned controls and an NPC AI smart enough not to be actively fighting against the player at all times, these missions can be aggravating at best and downright rage-inducing at worst.    </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How Should the Superman Franchise Move Forward?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Shockingly, that’s it for Kal-El’s gaming career. It’s been almost 20 years since the release of Superman Returns, and the Man of Steel has yet to star in another dedicated game. His subsequent gaming appearances have been limited to Justice League-centric series like Injustice: Gods Among Us and LEGO Batman. Superman is also playable in Fortnite, but there he’s basically just a dude that flies and shoots lasers. At some point, developers seem to have given up trying to crack the Superman code. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gaming world has yet to deliver that satisfying Superman experience that embraces all his incredible powers while still creating a sense of danger. What’s the key? Do you load up enemies with Kryptonite weapons? Do you follow the example of the Injustice games and create a super-strength-bestowing MacGuffin that levels the playing field? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe there’s a better question to be asking. Does a Superman game even really need combat in the first place? Certainly, Telltale found success with the Batman franchise in an adventure game setting. Could Superman benefit from a similarly narrative-driven approach? Is a full-blown Superman point-and-click adventure game the way to go? Maybe, but there are other ways of downplaying action in superhero games.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Does a Superman game even really need combat in the first place?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re seeing modern AAA games like Death Stranding start to deemphasize combat in favor of other mechanics (some would argue the Death Stranding games would be better if they eschewed combat entirely). Maybe the key is to pivot away from a traditional action game focus in favor of finding other ways to explore and utilize Superman’s powers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2005’s Shadow of the Colossus offers another possible path forward. That game isn’t devoid of action, but it does break the traditional mold by focusing on exploration and limiting combat to the battles with a handful of massive boss characters. Maybe that’s the key to getting Superman right. Rather than pitting him against generic goons like Parademons or Intergang agents, perhaps the goal should be to focus on a handful of epic, prolonged boss battles. Picture Kal-El’s fight with the kaiju in James Gunn’s Superman movie and you’ll have some idea of how a Superman game could play out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, flight, not combat, is the most important component of a Superman game. Flight in Superman games is really as key to the overall success as web-slinging in Spider-Man games. Activision nailed that element in 2004’s Spider-Man 2, paving the way for Insomniac to cut loose in their Spider-Man games. We can’t say the same for Superman. Without more modern Superman games to take risks and explore the possibilities, the character has completely stagnated in this medium. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s probably going to take some trial and error before a developer hits upon the perfect, Arkham-esque formula for Kal-El. And that requires DC to prioritize Superman in the video game arena once more. With any luck, James Gunn’s Superman movie will be a major success, thereby serving as the catalyst the character needs in the gaming world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wolverine-history-marvel-video-games-x-men">Wolverine's clawful history in video games</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-video-games-history-arkham-asylum-telltale">the long road to perfecting Batman in games</a>.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/why-are-there-no-good-superman-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>The Playdate is easy to forget about. It’s colorful and weird, but it’s also <em>tiny</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/26/3494628/status-symbols-game-boy-micro">Like the Game Boy Micro before it</a>, sometimes I toss it in a bag and then can’t remember where I put it. But over the past few weeks, the yellow handheld has been in constant rotation in my house, despite being up against big distractions like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5"><em>Death Stranding 2</em></a>, thanks to the <a href="https://play.date/games/seasons/two/">Playdate’s now-complete second season of games</a>.</p></div><p>The seasonal structure is one of the unique aspects of the Playdate. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">When the handheld first launched in 2022</a>, owners got access to a curated selection of 24 games that were released over time. It was a great introduction to the device and its unique features — the crank, the little display, the black-and-white graphics — but it wasn’t until earlier this year that a second season kicked off. (I should note that this doesn’t mean there weren’t any new games for the Playdate, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/7/23627413/playdate-catalog-store-launch-date-best-games">a digital shop launched in 2023</a>, and there are plenty of titles to sideload from marketplaces like <a href="http://itch.io/">Itch.io</a>.)</p><p>Season 2 kicked off in May, and while it’s smaller — you get 12 games for $39, plus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/682711/blippo-plus-now-in-color">whatever the heck the FMV-based <em>Blippo Plu</em>s is</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/677197/playdate-season-2-game-review">it also got off to a very good start</a>. And since then it’s expanded with quite a variety of games. There’s a post-apocalyptic adventure called <em>The Whiteout</em>, and a point-and-click exploration game called <em>Shadowgate PD</em>, which is actually a remake of a game from the ‘80s. The dozen titles in season 2 do a solid job of showing off the range of possibilities on the Playdate.</p><p>But what has struck me most are the games that make clever use of the handheld’s signature feature: its crank. For instance, <em>Tiny Turnip</em> is a climbing game where you play as a turnip with arms. Getting around means using the face buttons for grabbing on to things, and then moving your body around with the crank. It felt a little awkward at first, probably because I hadn’t played anything quite like it before, but eventually I was able to get into a solid rhythm of cranking my way across perilous terrain. It’s really satisfying smoothly moving your way through the world by twisting a crank around.</p><p><em>Taria &amp; Como</em> offers something similar within a more typical side-scrolling platformer. You can move and jump through a pixel art world, but in order to navigate the most perilous areas, you’re aided by a sort of drone / grappling hook that’s aimed with the crank. You fire it off and then swing yourself where you need to be. You can also use the crank to pull yourself up or down. <em>Taria &amp; Como</em> is a relatively slow-paced physics-based platformer with some challenging puzzles, and the inclusion of the crank adds a satisfying layer of tactility to the experience.</p><p>Perhaps my favorite game is also arguably the strangest. It’s called <em>Long Puppy</em>, and it’s almost like a spiritual successor to <em>Noby Noby Boy</em> (albeit one not developed by Keita Takahashi, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/674577/to-a-t-review-keita-takahashi-ps5-xbox-pc">who is off doing his own weird stuff</a>). The goal is simple: you are a dog who needs to fetch a ball. But it always seems to be in some hard-to-reach spot, and the only way to get to it is to stretch. In order to stretch longer, you need to eat lots of food. And so each level becomes a race to eat as much as you can so you can get to the ball before a weirdly angry ghost dog shows up.</p><p>Naturally, you use the crank to both grow and shrink, so even though <em>Long Puppy</em> is a game about a pup, you move more like a caterpillar inching its way through the levels to gobble up everything they can quickly. Again, it takes some getting used to, but the time limits forced me to get really good at stretching and it was a blast. Also, at the end of each level you use the crank to go poo.</p><p>Of course, these games would’ve still been enjoyable if I stumbled across them in the Catalog store. But there’s something exciting about the big moment the Playdate seasons create. Each week I anticipate something new, and am never really sure what it will actually be. It could be more channels for a bizarre fictional television service, or it could be the most challenging (and adorable) game of fetch I’ve ever played. That steady cadence of weird and fun makes the Playdate much harder to forget about.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/705348/playdate-season-2-review]]></content:encoded>
