			<p>Blanket statements are rarely a good idea for several reasons, chief among them being that they can often be disproven almost immediately. That's the situation Nexon's chief executive officer, Junghun Lee, finds himself in after an interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html">Game*Spark</a> (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">translated by Automaton</a>), where, while discussing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">controversy surrounding ARC Raiders</a> and Nexon's subsidiary Embark Studios using generative AI, he claimed, "<em>It's important to assume that every game company is now using AI</em>."</p>



<p>Whether it's "<em>important</em>" to make that assumption largely depends on where you're sitting. If you're the CEO of a big games company, then perhaps it is important if you're concerned about staying ahead of competitors. But for that to work, you'd also have to consider using AI and generative AI technology as an advantage over your competition. </p>



<p>Which Nexon and its subsidiary, Embark Studios, certainly do, not just because Embark has used it in both of its major titles, ARC Raiders and The Finals, but also when Embark was founded back in 2018, it was done so with <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-ea-dice-exec-starts-embark/">the promise of leaning on advanced AI technology to make games</a>.</p>



<p>The full quote from Lee, per Automaton, reads, "<em>First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI. But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness</em>."</p>



<p>We also know that Nexon and Embark are not alone in considering it an advantage, as other major companies, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-ceo-says-generative-ai-is-the-very-core-of-business-not-a-buzzword/">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">Blizzard</a>, have not shied away from using generative AI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/">forcing it into their developers' work pipelines</a>.</p>



<p>Nexon, EA, and Activision Blizzard are some of the bigger companies in the video game industry, and we know they're all using generative AI. The rest of the industry, though? Well, a quick perusal through the responses to Automaton's report confirms what we already knew: it is absolutely not true that every game company is using AI and generative AI technology.</p>



<p>To highlight a few of the many, many responses, Strange Scaffold founder (the studio behind I Am Your Beast, Clikcholding, El Paso, Elswhere, etc.) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3m5fpcezxzc2w">Xalavier Nelson Jr. replied,</a> "<em>We don’t use generative AI at Strange Scaffold and I can confirm that a lot</em> <em>of other studios are not—whether indie or AAA</em>."</p>







<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aerialknight.com/post/3m5g4d4npvc2w">Indie developer Neil Jones</a> (maker of Ariel Knight's Never Yield) replied, "<em>We don't use Ai in our games. Ai isn't and hasn't ever been needed been needed to make a good game and CEOs like this don't know what the f*** they are talking about.</em>" <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcdoogleh.bsky.social/post/3m5gw6lddxc2c">Rogue Eclipse developer Huskrafts replied</a>, "<em>I'm happy to confirm Rogue Eclipse is AI FREE and in fact NOT USED as a part of our process AT ALL! We discourage the use and have ANTI AI USAGE clauses in our agreements!</em>"</p>



<p>Goodbye Volcano High developer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ko-op.com/post/3m5fjjxacpc25">KO_OP responded with a simple "<em>No</em>."</a> Necrosoft Games, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-series-inspired-tactical-rpg-demonschool-launches-next-month-on-pc-and-consoles/">behind the upcoming Demonschool</a>, said "<em>Hello, not only do we not use AI we would rather cut off our own arms than do so. Demonschool is 100% human made.</em>" </p>







<p>So, no, it's clear that not every game company is using AI and generative AI technology. From a player's perspective, it's arguably more important to assume the opposite of Lee's statement, that the majority of game developers are not using generative AI, because they see their own artistic ability and commitment to their craft as their real advantage over their competition.</p>



<p>We can assume that the major companies that have talked about using generative AI, like Nexon and EA, are using it. For everyone else, however, the responses to Lee's comment suggest the rest of the industry aligns with what <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/">Starfinder: Afterlight developer Epictellers Entertainment told Wccftech this past October</a>: "<em>There is no point in using AI for any creative endeavor</em>."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> developers Rockstar Games have had legal claims filed against them by the UK's IWGB union, with the latter alleging that Rockstar have so far declined to meet with them for negotiations following the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-have-been-accused-of-union-busting-after-the-firing-of-more-than-30-staff-members">firing of over 30 workers</a>. The initial reason given by Rockstar for those firings was "gross misconduct", with the company subsequently claiming that the staff had shared confidential info in a public forum. The IWGB, meanwhile, have accused Rockstar of union busting.</p>
<p>Protests spearheaded by the union took place outside Rockstar North and Take-Two's UK offices last week, and you can read our reports from both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">here</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">here</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to today, and this filing of claims by the IWGB, as outlined in a <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-issues-legal-claims-against-rockstar-over-unfair-dismissal-of-staff/">blog post</a>. The claims accuse Rockstar of "unfairly dismissing staff for union activity and blacklisting its members".</p>
<p>"We are representing employees who were dismissed by Rockstar Games in circumstances that we believe amount to victimisation and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity," reads a statement from the IWGB 's legal team. "Despite our representation and attempts to meet with Rockstar to resolve the matter through negotiation, Rockstar have declined and persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful. Accordingly, we have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants."</p><p>"We are confident that what we’ve seen here is plain and simple union busting, and we will mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers," added IWGB president Alex Marshall. "Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company’s contractual clauses do not supersede UK law."</p>
<p>I've reached out to Rockstar for comment.</p>
<p>These firings and the events which have followed have come as GTA 6's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">second delay</a> has seen its release pushed back to November 19th, 2026.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade developers have revealed that they are considering expanding to other platforms, which could mean that ports for Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox are on the cards. </p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-devs-are-considering-a-switch-2-port-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from earlier this year</a> claimed that Stellar Blade developers were already working on a Switch 2 port, with an official development kit already in their possession. Now, the devs have outright stated that additional platforms are being considered, which means there is a chance that Xbox and Switch 2 ports are indeed coming. </p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-devs-are-considering-additional-platform-expansions-to-enhance-brand-recognition-and-boost-sales">Stellar Blade Devs Are Considering Additional Platform Expansions to Enhance Brand Recognition and Boost Sales</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/this-big-ps5-exclusive-could-be-coming-to-xbox-soon-the-developer-is-considering-additional-platform-expansions-after-strong-steam-sales-on-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, the discussion about additional platform expansions for Stellar Blade arose during a Q&amp;A session in Shift Up’s latest <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings results</a>. The developers first revealed that the game was recognized “as one of the most successful platform expansions in global AAA IP history” and has had a “stable sales performance in Q3.” The PC version experienced strong sales momentum in the fourth month after its launch, and the PS5 version has also successfully attracted new players. The combined sales across both platforms have “met internal expectations”. </p>



<p>However, “to further enhance brand recognition and boost sales” for Stellar Blade, the developers will carry out various promotional activities and are “considering additional platform expansions” to help make the title more accessible to players. Moreover, they are looking forward to “engaging an even broader global audience” through upcoming seasonal and holiday promotions for both PC and PS5 versions. </p>



<p>Expanding to other platforms seems like a good choice for Stellar Blade, considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the boost Helldivers 2 was able to gain</a> with their Xbox port. However, the developers are yet to confirm outright that Xbox and Switch 2 ports for the title are on the way. </p>

During our chat, we asked if solo battle royale fans will ever be able to drop into Fort Lyndon without grouping up with others. Design director Justin Wiebe stopped short of confirming whether additional queue options are on the way, but he does want fans to know the BF Studios team is listening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would say keep your ear to the ground on the future of solos,” Wiebe told us.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield REDSEC was met with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-steam-reviews-as-battlefield-6-players-push-for-battle-pass-changes-and-bigger-maps"><u>a review-bombing campaign</u></a> upon its launch late last month as disgruntled Battlefield 6 players gathered to ask for various changes, including a solo battle royale queue. It’s true the Battlefield battle royale offshoot launched without an option for single-player-minded fans, but Wiebe says adding solos into a squad-based shooter isn’t as easy as it seems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In my mind, that's not something you just turn on and just say, ‘OK, solos,’” he said. “There needs to be enough thought put into it because we built a squad-based experience. At its foundation, the game was designed for squads to play together, with each of them having tactical abilities and options, and training paths that unlock new perks. A lot of those perks are very oriented towards helping the squad, not helping the individual.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I would say keep your ear to the ground on the future of solos.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wiebe continued: “If we were just to throw that out and say, ‘Well, now you can just play solos, and you're unlocking these abilities that don't even matter to you,’ that feels like a fail.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 and REDSEC are designed around four primary classes: Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon. Aside from a few tweaks between some modes, each can bring everything from quick revives to vehicle repairs to a gunfight. Even vehicles themselves are typically in better care with more than one player behind the wheel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the kinds of mechanics BF Studios is considering when holding off on solos for battle royale in REDSEC. Still, it sounds like the option is far from off the table. Should players be allowed to queue up without teammates in battle royale, Wiebe tells fans they would need to launch “with the right abilities and training paths.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If we were going to launch something like solos,” he added, “we want to do it in a way that makes sense for players, that actually takes the mechanics and makes them work for making solos play better.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S.

In our review, we said, “Battlefield REDSEC offers an uninspired battle royale mode that dilutes what makes Battlefield 6’s regular multiplayer so much fun, but its Gauntlet option instead concentrates that formula into one of the coolest game modes I’ve seen from a military shooter.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

One example he calls attention to involves challenges and challenge requirements in Battlefield 6, with many of the more problematic issues in this area <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-major-overhaul-of-challenges-and-assignments-with-significant-reductions-to-challenge-requirements-available-now"><u>already addressed in an update last week</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For me, I always say, live service, you have a big clock,” he explains, “and every time there's a player issue, you start the clock and you measure and value your time to the player, so that you can make sure that the player and the community knows that we're listening, and we're going to be able to do what we can to react.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If it's a problem for the community, then let's talk about it. Let's see how we can prioritize that.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“But we're also weighing that against our future ambitions of all the different content and experiences we want to create from live services, because this is just the beginning of the experience, and we want to make sure that we're addressing player feedback, and we're also adding new and exciting experiences for players to play.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">REDSEC will continue to coexist alongside Battlefield 6, meaning players can expect seasonal updates to introduce new content to both experiences. The REDSEC Season 1 roadmap has already provided a taste of what’s to come, teasing a new vehicle-based Gauntlet mission called Rodeo for November 18 and an Ice Lock Gauntlet limited-time event for December 9.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We asked if seasonal updates could impact REDSEC’s map, Fort Lyndon, as Battlefield 6, battle royale, Gauntlet, and Portal updates roll out. BF Studios isn’t ready to talk map updates just yet, but when changes like that eventually arrive, don’t expect the developers to deliver surface-level changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For me, when we do map updates, if we're going to spend a bunch of time working on the map, I want to make sure that it's additive to the player experience,” Wiebe said. “That it's not just a quick cosmetic hit, right? That there's new fun things to explore there. It adds to gameplay in new and meaningful ways. I think, for me, that's the important component moving forward.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He adds that Gauntlet, the new game mode the Battlefield 6 community has welcomed with open arms, will continue to be a “tool in our toolbelt” when it comes to thematic seasonal content, calling the mode “the perfect, ultimate live-service game mode.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's not always looking at, ‘What do we do with the battle royale or Fort Lyndon map?’ but also, ‘How do we leverage Gauntlet and utilize it in fresh and unique ways to also hit some of those live service, thematic beats?’” Wiebe said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 and REDSEC launched into Season 1 October 28. The three-part introductory season will introduce new modes, maps, and weapons throughout its run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While BF Studios does its best to retake lost ground, you can check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-review"><u>7/10 REDSEC review</u></a> and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer"><u>8/10 multiplayer review</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of video games’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-vs-battlefield-the-last-great-gaming-rivalry">greatest rivalries</a> is heating up again with the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. It follows hot on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, which has firmly marked its territory as not just one of 2025’s best shooters, but as the best Battlefield game in many, many years. But Call of Duty proves itself as one of the biggest FPS games in the world, year in, year out – has Battlefield got what it takes to dethrone Activision’s behemoth this year?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s everything to play for when it comes to player numbers and financial success, the real question is: What kind of first-person shooter are you looking for? Do you want your multiplayer tight and competitive, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-brought-absolute-cinema-back-to-multiplayer">deeply cinematic</a>? Do you want something grounded in reality, or are you seeking undead hordes to shoot in the face? Call of Duty and Battlefield have long been pitted against each other, but this year’s offerings are good evidence that these games actually offer significantly different experiences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re considering picking Black Ops 7 or Battlefield 6 up to fuel your end-of-year gaming sessions, but are unsure which one is for you, then we’re here to help. Let's take a look at what each game offers across its suite of modes and work out which aligns with your preferences.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Multiplayer</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/battlefield-6-multiplayer-1762789258577.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The key difference between Call of Duty and Battlefield is their approach to multiplayer. Typically, Call of Duty focuses on tightly designed, smaller-scale maps that cater to fast-paced fights, and Black Ops 7 is no different – at launch it will offer 16 different maps for 6v6 matches. Battlefield, on the other hand, is designed around large-scale warfare using a combination of infantry and vehicles to capture objectives. Battlefield 6 features fewer maps - just nine at launch - but in general they are much, much larger than Call of Duty’s maps. They also feel less like killing arenas and more like authentic places, in part due to the fact you can destroy many of the buildings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you <em>can </em>say that the key difference between CoD and BF is small vs big, that’s not strictly true. Black Ops 7 will also launch with two 20v20 “Skirmish” maps for larger-scale battles, and Battlefield 6 features modes like the 8v8 Squad Deathmatch that take place on smaller sections of its big maps. Similarly, it wouldn’t be fair to say that Battlefield is objective-based and Call of Duty isn’t; while TDM is a Call of Duty staple, its multiplayer suite contains a whole host of classic-style objective modes, including Hardpoint and Domination. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that said, Call of Duty has always excelled at the smaller, more “traditional” FPS experience, and Battlefield is better for those large-scale, “war movie” style multiplayer matches. If you’re looking for a fast-moving, more focused and intense game, Black Ops 7 is your ticket. If you like something more tactically driven, with clearly-defined class roles, longer matches, and the added spectacle of tanks and helicopters, then Battlefield 6 is where you need to be.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Campaign</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/blops-7-characters-1762789329207.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty and Battlefield have frequently delivered story campaigns that feel very similar, but this year they both have very different focuses. Not only are they set in distinctly different universes – BLOPS is going all trippy sci-fi this year, while BF6 keeps it grounded with a modern warfare approach – but Call of Duty’s campaign has a multiplayer approach this year, while Battlefield is strictly single-player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 7 has full four-player co-op support for its campaign, turning the typically solo endeavor into a social experience. That approach is emphasised by the fact that it has an infinitely replayable “Endgame” mode, unlocked after completing the story. A PvE co-op mode, it will see you and your team complete objectives in the face of escalating odds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it wasn’t already clear that the BLOPS 7 campaign is more closely related to the multiplayer side of Call of Duty than ever, a new unified progression system means that you can earn XP during the campaign and endgame in the same way you would multiplayer. While this is a big shift, it seems like the “classic” single-player Call of Duty campaign will still be there for those who want it. The missions can still be completed solo, and they have once again been designed by Raven Software, the developers behind last year’s fantastic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">Black Ops 6 campaign</a>.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If a more traditional approach to campaign is your preference, then you may want to take a look at Battlefield 6. Its resolutely single-player story very much feels like an old-school COD campaign, with linear missions that mostly focus on firefights and destroying objectives. It follows a modern day conflict between NATO and the private military company Pax Armata, and will have you unspooling a large conspiracy as you battle through locations like Croatia and New York. You can expect the classic staples of sniping missions, beach landings, vehicle chases, and explosive set-piece design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that if you love Battlefield’s massive maps, use of vehicles and destruction, and its clearly defined class roles, you won’t find much of that here. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-review">campaign review</a> was disappointed in how it failed to adapt the multiplayer’s winning formula for a single-player experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for a traditional campaign experience, you can find it in both Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6. If you’d like to play that kind of story in co-op, BLOPS 7 is your best (and only) choice, but it’s important to note that the setting is a near-future sci-fi, which hasn’t always appealed to COD fans. For those interested in more “realistic,” contemporary warfare, then Battlefield 6 will serve you better. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Additional Modes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/blops-7-zombies-1762789379781.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As is tradition for Treyarch’s Call of Duty games, this year’s Black Ops once again includes a Zombies mode. Once a simple bonus PvE game, Call of Duty Zombies has massively grown in scale and scope over the years, and Black Ops 7 features perhaps the series’ most robust offering. Round-Based Zombies is the main one, tasking you and a group of friends to survive zombie hordes round after round, with the danger increasing each time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zombies is known for its cryptic design, and often you need to solve obtuse puzzles to progress. A “Directed” version, returning from Black Ops 6, helps guide you through those objectives, while a “Cursed” version remixes the game with ideas from previous Zombie iterations for a more difficult challenge. “Survival” tasks you with staying alive as long as possible on a smaller version of the new Zombies map, while “Dead Ops Arcade 4” sees the return of a top down, twin-stick shooter mode that was last seen in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Black Ops Cold War</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You won’t find any undead monsters in Battlefield 6, but you will find Portal – a powerful tool that allows you to create almost any kind of Battlefield experience you can imagine. Best thought of as Battlefield’s answer to Fortnite’s creator islands, the Portal tool allows you to create brand new maps and game modes, a feature that has allowed fans to re-create favourite maps from prior games, as well as entirely new types of multiplayer matches. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it may seem at first glance that, when it comes to additional modes, that BLOPS 7 is best for those looking to play and Battlefield 6 is better for creators, it’s worth remembering that non-creatives can still play Portal creations made by the community, and that they are easily accessible from Battlefield 6’s main menu. As such, BLOPS 7 is the best pick for those looking for an arcade-style PvE horror game, while Battlefield 6 is more suited to people who enjoy creating or playing user-made experiences. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battle Royale</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/battlefield-redsec-1762789433569.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Technically speaking, neither Black Ops 7 nor Battlefield 6 have battle royale modes. That’s because Call of Duty and Battlefield both have free-to-play battle royale games, which can be downloaded and played without the need to buy BLOPS 7 or BF6. However, these modes are closely linked to their “parent” games, and so are worth considering, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> is one of the biggest battle royale games in the world, and is frequently updated with content that’s linked to whatever the current “main” Call of Duty game is. Currently that’s Black Ops 6, but we expect a plethora of BLOPS 7-themed content to arrive in the coming months, such as skins and limited time modes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of experience, Warzone’s flagship mode is a classic, large-scale, fight-to-the-last person/squad standing game. More approachable than PUBG and less hero-driven than Apex Legends, it’s nonetheless an exciting and tense take on a now-staple idea. Alternate modes, such as Resurgence (which allows respawns) and Plunder (where squads fight to gain as much cash as possible) makes Warzone a fairly varied suite of free-to-play game types. Importantly, Warzone is part of Call of Duty’s unified progression, so any XP earned contributes to your overall pool collected from every BLOPS 7 mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-redsec">Battlefield REDSEC</a> is the new kid on the block, and plays a similar game to Warzone. It’s also a large-scale battle royale with a shrinking circle, but this time there’s those classic Battlefield elements of vehicle warfare and destructible terrain. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-review">review</a> found that those ideas perhaps didn’t carve out a whole new niche for REDSEC’s take on battle royale, but was much more enthusiastic about Gauntlet, a brand new knockout-style mode that sees squads race against the clock to complete objectives. REDSEC is also supported by the Portal system, and so is another place where community-driven creations can potentially thrive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As these are both free-to-play games, there’s nothing to lose by downloading and playing both of them. If you’re already locked into the Call of Duty ecosystem, then Warzone’s unified progression system will no doubt be helpful in boosting your XP bar. And if the destruction and class-based design of Battlefield is more your speed, then REDSEC may appeal more. There’s also the modes to consider – we’d consider Warzone better for classic battle royale, and REDSEC better for its alternative Gauntlet mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also worth considering both Warzone and REDSEC as “tasters” for their parent games. While these battle royales offer very different experiences to Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6, they are built on the same foundations. If you prefer the movement and shooting systems of one over the other, then you’ll likely find that’s a good test for which of the paid-for games your best click with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-vs-battlefield-6-which-one-is-best-for-you]]></content:encoded>

That's proven to be a controversial topic among Switch 2 players, some of whom are angry enough that they claim they'll skip Pokopia entirely.</p><p>Nintendo of Japan's <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/pocoapokemon/ja/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a> confirmed Pokopia's Game-Key release, followed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ldQYMwzWrY&amp;t=15s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an official YouTube video</a> that used it as a Game-Key Card example, and the reaction has been swift. Unlike digital releases, fans are able to resell Game-Key cards. But for players who prefer to own the complete game on a cartridge, it's viewed as Nintendo breaking its pledge not to publish its own games that way. The game was developed by Koei Tecmo's Omega Force, so technically Nintendo hasn't broken that promise. However, not everyone sees it that way.</p><p>Nintendo introduced Game-Key Cards alongside the Switch 2 in part as a way to mitigate the size restrictions of Switch 2 cartridges. The only thing on the card is a digital license that allows the player to download the game directly to their Switch 2. This differs from a digital purchase in that the Game-Key Card needs to be in the console for the game to play, but it's also transferable to a new owner if the player who purchased it no longer wants it. </p><p>Pokemon Pokopia will be released on March 5, 2026 for Switch 2. On Thursday, November 13, Nintendo will debut a new trailer for Pokopia that will feature over 10 minutes of gameplay.

                <p>Activision has released more details on what its teams are doing to try to stop cheaters in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 for its upcoming launch this week.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ricochet-anticheat-day-one#Evolved" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Activision reminded people that they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-enable-tpm-2-0-so-that-your-pc-is-ready-for-windows-11/1100-6496686/" data-ref-id="1100-6496686">need TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot</a> to play Black Ops 7 on PC as the foundation for anti-cheat measures. Activision says this can be thought of as a handshake that tells its Ricochet anti-cheat system about your PC, "I'm legit. Let's play."</p>

      </div>
<p>The developer said it has "evolved" its machine-learning-based anti-cheat measures with the aim of helping the system become "smarter, faster, and fairer."</p><p>"Our aimbot-detection models are trained to decide whether a player’s targeting was performed by a human or an aimbot. In Black Ops 7, these updated models will discriminate between natural aim and cheating with even greater precision by taking what they have learned from real gameplay to catch more cheaters than before," the developer explained.</p><p>Beyond aiming, Activison's Ricochet anti-cheat efforts include behavioral models that examine <em>how </em>people play to deduce if they are possibly cheating. "These upgraded models now analyze not just where a player aims, but how they move, how they engage, and how their play changes," Activision said.</p><p>As an example, if a player is consistently getting kills on a map at places that aren't usually "hotspots," this can be flagged "for deeper analysis."</p><p>"Our pattern recognition is trained on real matches, learning what genuine skill looks like--and recognizing when it's not," Activision said.</p><p>Also in the blog post, Activision said some of the new anti-cheat systems for Black Ops 7 that were tested in the multiplayer beta will be "even more effective" when the game launches.</p><p>"Our mission is simple: Make every round you play fair. Each Ricochet anti-cheat upgrade means cleaner matches and wins that reflect real skill. You deserve nothing less, and that's our promise to you," Activision said.</p><p>Black Ops 7 is available to preload now. For more, check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-times-and-preloading-info-revealed/1100-6535917/" data-ref-id="1100-6535917">Black Ops 7 release times</a>, including details on how to trick your console into thinking it's in New Zealand so you can play early.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"First of all, I think it's important to assume that every game company is now using AI," Lee said. "But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: How do you survive? I believe it's important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness."</p><p>To answer his own question of surviving in a competitive development market, Lee expressed that "human creativity" is what'll push an OK game to a fabulous game. This sentiment mirrors what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-no-shortcut-to-making-great-games-embark-studios-cco-responds-to-and-defends-ai-use-in-arc-raiders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Embark Studios CCO Stefan Strandberg told Eurogamer in October 2025</a>, that there are "no shortcuts to making great games" despite using AI to "assist in some content creation."</p><p>Not everyone agrees with either Lee or Strandberg, though. Strange Scaffold founder Xavier Nelson Jr. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3m5fpcezxzc2w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded with condemnation on Bluesky</a>, personally confirming that "a lot of other studios"--whether indie or AAA--are not using generative AI in their games. Tommy Thompson, founder of AI video game analysis company AI in Games, also disputed Lee's argument, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tommy.aiandgames.com/post/3m5geygzyzs2r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posting on Bluesky</a> that "very few [studios] have gone all in" on AI. Developer Neil Jones, creator of the 3D runner Aerial_Knight's Never Yield, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aerialknight.com/post/3m5gwkm6iw22h" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on Bluesky</a> that this is an admission that "they're going to fire you." And former Chucklefish animator Adam Riches shared his contempt for Lee's comments, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supernorn.bsky.social/post/3m5gohsq7qk2m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">taking to Bluesky</a> to say that Nexon is "too cheap to care about their craft."</p><p>While people are upset with Lee's notion that "every game company is now using AI," one CEO came to his defense: Epic Games' Tim Sweeney. Posting in <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1988053268535406695" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the replies to Eurogamer's review on X</a>, Sweeney said that "political opinions" should stay in the opinion section, not reviews. He continued in <a href="https://x.com/Doubttom/status/1988054048579481663" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response to X user doubttom</a>, who asked if disliking AI should be considered political:</p><p>"Yes. This technology increases human productivity in some areas by integer multiples, and views on whether this is a net good and should be rewarded, or bad and should be fought against, are speculative and generally distributed along political lines," Sweeney said. "Since the author states the pessimistic case, I’ll put the optimistic one here. Game developers compete to build the best games in order to attract gamers. When tech increases productivity, competition leads to building better games rather than employing fewer people."</p><p>It's worth noting that there are some AAA studios banking on AI. EA said its workers should view the controversial technology as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">thought partners</a>" while demanding its employees train AI on their work. Krafton Inc. has announced plans to invest $70 million to become an "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">AI-first company</a>." Square Enix wants <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-wants-genai-to-automate-70-of-game-qa-by-2027/1100-6535996/" data-ref-id="1100-6535996">generative AI to automate at least 70% of game QA and debugging work</a>. And even Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-lays-out-plans-for-ai-use-in-gaming-going-forward/1100-6534741/" data-ref-id="1100-6534741">laid out plans for incorporating AI in its games</a> going forward. This is not to mention the myriad developers who've recently said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">AI should be embraced by the industry</a>, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devs-who-dont-embrace-ai-are-selling-themselves-short-ex-god-of-war-dev-says/1100-6535614/" data-ref-id="1100-6535614">those who refuse to work with it will sell themselves short</a>.</p><p>Although a hot-button topic, this isn't the first time Embark Studios has used AI in its games. The developer's last game, the 2023 free-to-play multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-finals/" data-ref-id="5000-570887">The Finals</a>, also featured text-to-speech (TTS) that was generated using AI because <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-finals-uses-ai-text-to-speech-because-it-can-produce-lines-in-just-a-matter-of-hours-rather-than-months-baffles-actual-voice-actors/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the team could produce voice lines in hours rather than months</a>. Embark Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-finals-dev-defends-ai-voices-says-its-not-trying-to-replace-humans/1100-6518802/" data-ref-id="1100-6518802">defended its choice back then</a>, stating that "making games without actors isn't an end goal" and a combination of recorded voice audio and audio generated via TTS tools merely expedited the process.</p><p>Regardless of the discourse surrounding the game, Arc Raiders has been a smash hit since its October 30 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-on-an-upward-arc-surpassing-helldivers-2-all-time-peak-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6536086/" data-ref-id="1100-6536086">smoked the multiplayer shooter Helldivers 2</a>, becoming one of the most-played games on Steam.</p>

            <p>The UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has issued a legal claim against Rockstar following what it believes is the unfair dismissal of staff.</p>
<p>As we reported earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">Grand Theft Auto maker has been accused of union busting</a> after it fired 30-40 Rockstar staff who were purportedly involved in union activities. Rockstar claims they were fired for gross misconduct.</p>
<p>Now the IWGB is fighting back with a legal claim, with members alleging these dismissals "amount to victimisation and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity". Rockstar has declined to meet with IWGB, leading to this legal claim.</p>
<p>"We are representing employees who were dismissed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> in circumstances that we believe amount to victimisation and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity," said the IWGB's legal team in a statement shared with Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"Despite our representation and attempts to meet with Rockstar to resolve the matter through negotiation, Rockstar have declined and persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful. Accordingly, we have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants."</p><p>Added Alex Marshall, IWGB President: "We are confident that what we've seen here is plain and simple union busting, and we will mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers. Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company's contractual clauses do not supersede UK law.</p>
<p>"This case stands as a warning to any employer in the games industry and beyond who thinks they are able to act with impunity against organised workers - we will not be intimidated."</p>
<p>Following initial reports of the dismissals, Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis told Bloomberg the developers were fired for "gross misconduct, and for no other reason", adding "[Take-Two] fully support[s] Rockstar's ambitions and approach".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9nOwjeznjI&amp;t=240s">People Make Games</a> recently met with the former employees during a demonstration outside Rockstar offices in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The employees had been in the process of forming a union, The Rockstar Games Workers Union, to push for better working conditions ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. Just over ten percent of the Rockstar workforce in the UK had been recruited, a crucial criteria for a union in the UK to apply for statutory recognition by the government.</p>
<p>Earlier this month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">Rockstar delayed GTA 6 once again</a>. It's now set for release next November.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Even during &nbsp;one of the busiest times of the year for gaming launches, there’s always room for another title to catch your eye. When it was first revealed, Where Winds Meet immediately stood out as a free-to-play title with AAA aspirations, using Unreal Engine 5 to deliver a compelling Chinese Wuxia setting, an immense open world, and martial arts-inspired combat that’s eye-wateringly fast. On first impressions, it has the potential to be one of the winter’s biggest time sinks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Where Winds Meet - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LrP70xmIPRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first batch of options you’ll have gives you the expected control over the game’s difficulty and the amount of guidance you’ll have while out in the open world. It’s worth considering the immersive option, as it really cleans up the HUD, at the cost of limiting how much information you’ve immediately got to hand. You can also choose to go with a multiplayer focus or a solo-oriented adventure, with the option of joining up with other players for tougher encounters.</p>


<p>It’s an action-packed opening, taking control of Jiang Yun, who’s seemingly stirred up an immense hornet’s nest by killing his father. He’s also carrying a baby in a sling, though this doesn’t seem to slow down his impressive abilities in the slightest. After meeting up with a companion, you’re embroiled in a QTE-infused horse chase, with enemies coming at you from all sides, and slow-motion arrow-time bow shots to see them off.</p>
<p>It’s delivered with bags of style, and when you arrive at a set of ruins in the middle of nowhere, you’re greeted by The Void King, a hulking, scythe-wielding foe who immediately makes you feel outmatched.</p>


<p>Combat is swift and precise, with a great sense of flow. Timing is key, mixing up blocks, parries – called deflections here – and dodges to outwit and evade your opponents, before leaping in with regular sword thrusts or Mystic Arts. The timing window for deflections is pretty intuitive, but you can turn on Assist Deflection if you want a bit of slow-motion assistance, albeit at a cost to your Insight Points.</p>
<p>Straight away, it’s clear that it’s not intended to be as punishing as a Souls-like, though the multi-stage attacks and huge sweeping blows that The Void King punishes you with certainly give you a very real sense of danger. You’re equipped with 10 health flasks, though, and as long as you don’t think you’re invincible, you’ll probably make it through this early test unscathed.</p>
<p>Time passes, and it’s now that you can create your character, taking on the role of the baby from Jiang’s sling. You can draw from a pool of ready-made presets, broken up into Elegant or Realistic categories, and then alter them to fit your tastes. There’s a full suite of customisation options, from face shape to a huge array of make-up options, to bring your character to life, or you can delve into customising your character via a separate app or web portal, importing the data to save you some time.</p>

<p>Visually, there’s been a lot of care and attention put into Where Winds Meet, from the detailed character models through to the often-beautiful locations. There are some signs of the game’s free-to-play nature that hang around though, and the English voice dub isn’t the strongest I’ve ever heard. To be honest, I’d leave it on the native language with English subtitles to get the full effect of the game’s setting and tone, as it’s a much more authentic experience.</p>
<p>Once you’ve created your character, you’re assaulted by tasks, character names and locations that you’ve got no clue about. It certainly looks incredible though, and this is a world begging to be explored. There’s an initial, very frustrating, archery test to take part in, that doesn’t work how you expect it to, but you can paper over that since it’s a very small component of what’s going on in Where Winds Meet.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of interesting ideas at play, from learning martial arts moves from the natural wildlife – your first Mystic Art comes from mimicking a bear – to listening in on the conversations of different encampments before you put them to sword. Overall, it feels closer to an Assassin’s Creed-style open world than a Souls-like, and the regular combat is certainly more akin to that as well.</p>
<p>You wander the open world, drawn here and there by pockets of enemies, who are often guarding some helpful loot, while the main mission thread takes you wherever you really need to be. It’s a decidedly traditional take on the open-world, but if roaming huge maps and tootling about is for you, Where Winds Meet is staking a compelling claim for your time.</p>

<p>A lot of the Free to Play aspects seem to revolve around customisation, with the most visually exciting clothing all locked behind a cavalcade of tasks, sets and the like. It’s reminiscent of Infinity Nikki, and just as there, it’s the main action that will draw you in, with the hope that you’ll want to stump up a bit of real-world money for a cape that really speaks to you. As business models go, I can get on board with it, just as long as the game itself delivers on the promise that our early hands-on has given.</p>
<p>There are some rough edges, but this is still Early Access, and the clear thing about Where Winds Meet is that it doesn’t feel too dissimilar from a full-priced title. I’m interested in the world, and the combat feels really good once you’ve got a handle on the timing. I’ll certainly be delving in further when it launches here in the West on the 14th of November for PS5 and PC.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.wombogames.com/">Wombo Games</a> is a new studio founded by IO Interactive co-founder Janos Flösser, who founded the new studio in Copenhagen alongside several other former IO Interactive developers. Earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-co-founder-opens-new-studio-wombo-games-new-rogue-lite-raiders-of-blackveil-to-be-debut-project/">the team announced the new studio, and along with it, the team's debut project</a>, a co-op roguelite, Raiders of Blackveil.</p>



<p>Today, the studio confirmed that its debut title will launch in early access on PC before the end of the year, on December 15, 2025.</p>



<p>"<em>Early access is a huge milestone for us as it's where we'll really start shaping Raiders of Blackveil with our community of players</em>," said Benjamin Flösser, executive producer at Wombo Games, in a press release. "<em>It's been a wild ride since we started working on this game, and we're extremely grateful for all the support, wishlists, and feedback since the first demo came out - the game wouldn't be the same without it</em>."</p>

<p>Wombo Games describes its debut project as a MOBA-inspired, PvE extraction co-op roguelite with RPG-style loot set in the dystopian fantasy world of Blackveil. When players jump into the early access version that'll launch in December, they'll be able to check out one of the game's first biomes, The Harvest Operation, with 11 new enemies and two new powerful bosses that were not previously seen in the game's first demo.</p>



<p>The game's perk system is also getting a major update, and new items, gameplay mechanics, and more will be included in the game's early access release. Following its early access release this coming December, the studio has Raiders of Blackveil's 1.0 release slated for sometime in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning, everyone. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-rosalina-bowser-jr-direct-2000643447">Have you seen that new <em>Mario</em> movie trailer?</a> I hope it’s good, unlike the last one. Anyway, welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, your daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. In this fine installment, we have info on the new <em>Avatar</em> sequel, rumors of legendary loot flooding<em> Borderlands 4</em>, a big patch for <em>Outer Worlds 2</em>, and some rare good news from the games industry.</p>

 <h2><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> gets a massive patch with over 300+ changes</h2> <p>Xbox and Obsidian’s well-reviewed <em>Fallout</em>-like RPG <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> just got a big ol’ update, and the patch notes for it are massive. Like huge! The patch notes list over 300+ bug fixes, tweaks, and changes to nearly every part of the game. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/huge-outer-worlds-2-patch-includes-over-350-fixes-and-changes-including-a-niche-addition-that-may-be-a-direct-response-to-a-disappointed-player-on-reddit-really-cool-they-did-that/">One particular highlight, as spotted by <em>Gamesradar</em></a>, includes a change that seems to be inspired by a single Reddit user who found a creative way to complete a quest, but was denied.</p>

   <p>According to newly <a href="https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/avatar-fire-and-ash-53700">updated theater websites,</a> James Cameron’s next <em>Avatar</em> movie is going to be over three hours long. That’s not surprising. Specifically, the upcoming<em> Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> will be three hours and 15 minutes long. As an <em>Avatar</em> sicko, I’m ready and will be there day one. I’ll just make sure to empty my bladder first.</p>

 <h2>Vending machines in <em>Borderlands 4</em> seem to be giving out more legendary items</h2> <p><em>Borderlands 4</em> is filled with vending machines. Usually, these aren’t very exciting and are just used to sell loot you don’t want. But recently, players have started spotting more and more legendary items popping up in vending machines. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-4-vending-machine-filled-with-more-legendary-weapons/">As reported by <em>The Gamer</em></a>, players on Reddit seem to think<em> Borderlands 4</em> is being more generous on purpose by shoving more legendary items into vending machines. Maybe! But I also think it’s possible that people are just documenting this phenomenon more, and it seems like an increase as a result. Still, if you have been hunting for legendary weapons, check out some vending machines in<em> Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Sega will raise employee pay again in 2026</h2> <p>Usually, when reporting on the game industry, it can be depressing. So it’s nice to see that Sega is doing something not terrible and is raising wages. <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-raises-starting-salaries-for-new-hires-and-base-pay-of-existing-full-time-employees-in-japan-again/">As spotted by <em>Automaton</em></a>, starting in April 2026, Sega will raise the base salary for all full-time employees by around 10%. It’s also upping the pay for new hires, too.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101">Here’s your first look at next month’s <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> DLC</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-story-melinoe-chronos-hecate-is-it-good-2000642943"><em>Hades II</em> isn’t a story — it’s maintenance&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/proceeds-from-battlefield-6s-veterans-day-pack-dont-directly-benefit-vets-2000643014"><em>BF6</em> charity bundle isn’t actually a charity bundle</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-loot-boxes-gambling-roblox-2000642980"><em>Fortnite</em> will let users add loot boxes to custom games</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Almost two weeks after <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">31 developers were fired</a> from Rockstar Games, the union representing the former employees says the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> maker has refused to meet with it to discuss what it alleges was an act of union busting aimed at disrupting ongoing organizing efforts at the UK-based studios. The IWGB now plans to move forward with legal claims against the company asserting that the firings “constitute trade union victimization and blacklisting.”</p>

 <p>A spokesperson for the union said legal claims were submitted to the country’s Employment Tribunal last Thursday and the date for an initial hearing will depend on the court’s backlog. Take-Two and Rockstar have denied allegations of mishandling the firings, claiming the employees were released for “<a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">gross misconduct</a>” related to allegedly sharing company secrets online. The union claims discussions only took&nbsp; place in private Discord channels.</p>

 <p>In the meantime, an ongoing pressure campaign, <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-fired-union-workers-legal-2000643030">including picketing outside Rockstar and Take-Two’s offices</a> in the UK, has apparently failed to bring the company back to the table to discuss getting the fired developers their jobs back so they can continue working on the recently delayed blockbuster.</p>

 <p>“Despite our representation and attempts to meet with Rockstar to resolve the matter through negotiation, Rockstar have declined and persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful,” lawyers for the union wrote in a statement. “Accordingly, we have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants.”</p> <p>The core of the legal fight could come down to whether individual employment contracts with the fired employees trump broader labor protections for union organizing. “We are confident that what we’ve seen here is plain and simple union busting, and we will mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers,” IWGB president Alex Marshall said in a statement. “Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company’s contractual clauses do not supersede UK law.”</p>

              <p>Despite it’s name. there’s no need to have your desktop take up all the space on the top of your desk. You can reduce the footprint your PC takes up by downsizing to a small but powerful mini PC. The Blackview MP100 Mini PC is a wonderful solution for any of your school, business, or personal needs, plus right now Amazon happens to have it on sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5479/">That’s right.

You end up saving a whole $101.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5479/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Do It All Without Giving Up Desk Space</h2>
<p>The mini PC is damn-near pocket-sized, measuring at just five by five inches and coming in under two inches high. The Blackview MP100 is working with an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U&nbsp; processor with an integrated graphics card. It’s got six cores and twelve threads, capable of boosting up to 4.3GHz.

Particularly as a home media center. While there are now plenty of options for getting video streaming applications on your TV or projector via Fire TV Sticks, Rokus, or perhaps your displays native smart features, it can still be beneficial to opt for a Windows device as it provides more flexibility with different video formats. A mini PC can also make for a great retro gaming emulator.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-winds-meet-review%E2%80%94a-glorious-free-to-play-rpg-packed-with-content.1351231/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>China is on the rise in the gaming sphere with a host of top-notch releases catching the eye, and Where Winds Meet is a further feather in the cap for the rising giants in the industry.</p>



<p>The Everstone Studios title, backed by the might of NetEase Games, achieved significant success in its homeland, where it launched in December 2024, and the global release shows every sign of following in those steps after smashing through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-hits-10m-pre-registrations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million mark for pre-registrations</a>.</p>



<p>Having dived into the game during a limited-time review period, I’m delighted to report that Where Winds Meet is a shining example of what free-to-play titles can be.</p>







<h2 id="h-a-world-of-possibilities">A World of Possibilities</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A beautiful world. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first thing that will catch your eye in Where Winds Meet is the size of the game, both in terms of the download space required and the sprawling map that is there to explore. </p>



<p>I was initially sceptical of the developer’s claim that there is over 100 hours of single-player content to explore but though my limited time in the game did not allow me to get into triple-figures for playtime, it was more than enough to confirm that those declarations are entirely accurate.</p>



<p>You can barely walk a few meters in Where Winds Meet without uncovering something new to do, whether it’s a new side quest, a random event that appears, a puzzle to solve, or enemies to fight. And, while the combat wasn’t groundbreaking, I found it refreshing to be able to pick up and play, and there was plenty of options to customize the settings further to make it easier, or harder, if I wanted.</p>



<p>For a world so large, it’s impressive that I did not encounter a single area that felt barren and lacking, as there was more than enough to do, and I didn’t even touch the multiplayer aspects of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-just-one-more-fight">Just One More Fight…</h2>



<p>The biggest obstacle I faced in the game was deciding where I wanted to focus my energy. I’m a completionist and want to uncover all the secrets a game has to offer, but I may have met my match in Where Winds Meet, as 100% completion seems impossible.</p>



<p>I constantly found myself distracted by something, whether it was a puzzle to solve or a bear to fight, and couldn’t say no to the optional quests that appeared. Whenever I told myself it was time to log off, I encountered something else I wanted to do, and the process repeated again and again.</p>



<p>While I played the game as a solo player, there was still some interaction with other players, often in humorous ways. In Where Winds Meet, you can place signposts that appear for other players, which some used to provide hints for puzzles, while others encouraged you to do nefarious acts—like using the new ability you just learnt to throw an innocent old man into a river.</p>



<p>Those small moments provided further evidence of just how big Where Winds Meet can be, which will be expanded significantly when </p>







<h2 id="h-a-fine-example-of-f2p-s-strengths">A Fine Example of F2P’s Strengths</h2>



<p>Throughout my time with Where Winds Meet, there was one thought I couldn’t get out of my head: the utter disbelief that the game is available as a free-to-play title.</p>



<p>There are plenty of microtransactions available for those who want to splash out, but, from what I could see, the options were merely cosmetic, providing no in-game benefit, or time-savers that provide a chunk of currency to spend on items, enhancements, and similar.</p>



<p>With hundreds of hours of content, a sprawling open-world to explore, and plenty to do in single-player and multiplayer, both co-operatively and in PvP, Where Winds Meet could have released as a fully-priced game and would have been more than decent value for money.</p>



<p>The fact that you can enjoy it all without having to spend a dime is staggering, and can serve as an eye-opener in the industry when prices for AAA titles continue to rise.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-4-5-great">Verdict: 4/5 – Great</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo released the very first trailer for upcoming cinematic sequel&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, as well as introducing a couple of new characters who will be voiced by some pretty big names.</p>

<p>As part of a (rather short) Nintendo Direct presentation, Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto, along with Illumination's Chris Meledandri, provided a first look at the movie, which will be released on April 3rd around the world.</p>

<p>Naturally, the movie's chief inspiration is 2007's classic&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, and so one of that game's biggest characters will be joining the cast; it's none other than cosmic Princess Rosalina, who will be voiced by "Nintendo superfan" Brie Larson.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-mario-luigi.jpg?itok=k16Tc0aC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-mario-luigi.jpg?itok=ww1jr9su 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie&nbsp;</em>will seemingly pick up right where its predecessor left off.</figcaption></figure><p>Rosalina's introduction comes as she reads a story to her adorable Lumas, who begins telling them about "a brave and noble Princess named Peach" before the Lumas request "the one about the plumbers".</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like she'll be a helpless damsel, though; we also get to see her do battle with a giant mech, and she's got some serious combat prowess, although this being Rosalina, her fighting style is very graceful.</p>

<p>Also joining the cast of&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie&nbsp;</em>is Bowser Jr., who appears to be out for revenge against the Mario brothers for what they did to his father in the first movie. He's voiced by cinema auteur Benny Safdie.</p>

<p>During the course of the trailer, we get to see Bowser Jr. suit up in his&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Sunshine&nbsp;</em>mask, and he's wielding his paintbrush from that game as well, so it looks like the movie will roll in more influences than just the&nbsp;<em>Galaxy&nbsp;</em>games.</p>




<p>If the first movie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-movie-stats" rel="nofollow">box office performance</a> is anything to go by,&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie&nbsp;</em>will almost certainly be a cinematic hit. Nintendo has promised more info about the movie in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for that.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-power-pack-dlc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gran-turismo-7-power-pack-dlc-brings-24-hour-races-and-more-in-december.1351210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have announced the&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Power Pack DLC, which brings 24-hour endurance races, a huge credit injection, and more next month.</p>

<p>It turns out that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc" rel="nofollow">isn't the only game</a> getting a big DLC pack on December 4th, as that's also when&nbsp;Power Pack <a href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/news/00_1147434.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launches</a>. If you're playing&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>on PS4, though, you won't get access to this DLC, unfortunately.</p>

<p>PS5 players can look forward to "50 new races across 20 categories", according to Polyphony Digital, including "24-hour endurance racing" and more. The ability to play through a full race session, including practice, qualifying, and the race itself, will also be added.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-dlc-power-pack-nurburgring.jpg?itok=Chm56toR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-dlc-power-pack-nurburgring.jpg?itok=2KR1UFbC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is getting a round of paid DLC in December, bringing new races and more.</figcaption></figure><p>The Power Pack will also bring the latest version of&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s proprietary Sophy AI system, which can now offer "nail-biting close quarters tail-to-nose racing" (but only if you pick up the DLC; otherwise, you'll be stuck with the previous version of the AI).</p>

<p>As well as all of the above, you can look forward to a huge bonus of five million in-game credits if you pick up the Power Pack. That should help you pick up a fair few of the cars that have been introduced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-162" rel="nofollow">previous</a> free <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-161" rel="nofollow">updates</a> for the game.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, it is, as the name suggests, the seventh mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>series of simcade racers (which essentially means it's somewhere between a real gearhead's racing sim and a more arcade-y offering).</p>

<p>The game, which was released back in 2022, allows players to race across a variety of real-world tracks using cars from huge name brands like Aston Martin, Ferrari, and Maserati, among many others.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s Power Pack DLC when it launches exclusively for PlayStation 5 on December 4th. The game, unlike its DLC, is available for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">both PS5 and PS4</a> right now.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-coming-in-december.1351207/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have announced&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, the first major DLC expansion for multiplayer Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, and it's heading your way in December.</p>

<p>As outlined in a <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-reveals-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launching-december-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, which launches on December 4th, will add two brand new Nightfarers for you to play as, plus new bosses, a new shifting earth condition, and more.</p>

<p>Specifically, you can look forward to two new third-day Nightlord bosses, as well as more iconic bosses from across both&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>making their appearance in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>when&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows&nbsp;</em>launches.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-lion.jpg?itok=IxQmIQyd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-lion.jpg?itok=vzYzLqAd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Divine Beast Dancing Lion is just one of the new bosses you'll face in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows&nbsp;</em>DLC.</figcaption></figure><p>Returning bosses include&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s Divine Beast Dancing Lion,&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' Knight Artorias, and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s Astel, Naturalborn of the Void, and it looks like there may be some new mid-bosses for you to tackle as well.</p>

<p>We don't yet know what the two new Nightfarers will be, but it looks like one will use a spellbook to attack enemies, while the other will buff itself with what looks like some kind of dark magic during combat. We'll likely find out more about these new classes in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>spinoff that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">definitely isn't</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring 2</em>; rather, it's a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-inspired roguelite in which your goal is to explore a shrinking map, looting supplies and battling bosses.</p>

<p>Each run takes place over three nights, and at the conclusion of each night, you'll fight a miniboss, with the third night culminating in an encounter with that run's chosen Nightlord boss.</p>




<p>The game was released back in May to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">strong sales reception</a>, and since launch, it's received a number of updates, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-release-date" rel="nofollow">a two-player mode</a>&nbsp;and a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-difficulty" rel="nofollow">difficulty level</a> for truly dedicated players.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows&nbsp;</em>DLC will arrive on December 4th. The base game is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can read my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night" rel="nofollow">review of it here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Doings are afoot in the retrofuture scrapmetal world of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>. Developers Embark have announced that a major new update called North Line will roll out tomorrow, 13th November at 1.30am PT, 4.30am ET, 9.30am GMT and 10.30am CET. It'll add Stella Montis, a region beyond the Rust Belt that is described as "cold, pristine, and filled with the remnants of humanity's lost ambitions." I am picturing a landscape awash with Betamax cassettes, Bored Apes and Soviet space shuttles, where Raiders pick through old branches of Toys R Us.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You won't just be able to waltz across the lintel into Stella Montis tomorrow, mind. You'll need to earn access by means of a new community event, Breaking New Ground, which is about restoring tunnels to the new region by earning a special events currency, Merits. "The release timing of Stella Montis will be set by community progress, revealing the next frontier and triggering the "Staking Our Claim" Phase II, a new progression track with rewards to earn and challenges to complete," explains the press release. "This new track will be available for a limited time, running until December." 
</p>
<p>
The devs are also adding a couple of new ARC foes - the Matriarch, which is apparently even more formidable than the Queen - and the Shredder, which only appears in Stella Montis, and is built for close quarters combat. It sounds rather knifey. Players will go up against them armed with an "Energy Burst" battle rifle, some new mines - that's "Impulse", "Timed" and "Gas Jump", the latter of which sounds like a platforming tool - and some fresh playstyles, "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lone-wolf">Lone Wolf</a> and "Trailblazer". I'm not clear what these playstyles are but I don't think you'll get to be an actual wolf. The ARCs have melted down all the wolves for biofuel, I suspect. Still, there's always <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/good-news-dorks-it-is-not-too-late-to-be-a-janky-ass-wolf">WolfQuest</a>.
</p>
<p>
In a bid to maximise the good vibes around North Line's launch, Embark are also taking an axe to the game's microtransaction pricing. "We've reviewed our prices and made adjustments to lower prices where applicable," explains <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/">a new FAQ on the official site</a>. The prices will be update alongside the update's launch.</p>
<p>"For any Raider who has already made a purchase on the old pricing, we'll compensate you for the difference," the developers add. "These Raider Tokens will be refunded back into your account automatically in the coming week." 
</p>
<p>
These concessions accompany a note that Embark will shortly introduce paid premium Raider decks that focus on "cosmetics and convenience", with no "pay-to-win" elements. So this is mollifying the people unhappy about microtransaction pricing while introducing a few more microtransactables with their other hand.
</p><p>
Last and leastly, Embark say they have "silently tested and enabled Duo prioritized matchmaking, beginning earlier this week." To be clear, duo here means two-player. "Duo matchmaking will work like this: first, we prioritize Solos and Squads to play separately," the devs explain. "After that, we prioritize Duos to play with other Duos, and for Trios to play with Trios."
</p>
<p>
Arc Raiders continues to be the subject of scorn regarding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">its usage of AI-generated voices</a>. There was another social media blowout yesterday and I have been working on a short op ed, because (hint hint) only op eds are allowed to be political. There is a non-zero chance I will eventually decide that it's rubbish and bin it off.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Samuel Horti addressed the game's generative AI usage in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-review">Arc Raiders review</a>, commenting that Embark's research projects around generating gun models "could well change how I feel about a game where the presence of AI voices already makes me feel slightly icky about recommending it."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Since the game launched on October 30, one map on <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ rotation has remained locked. That’s about to change. The mysterious “Stella Montis” map will soon be available following a community event to unlock it. And when players arrive, there’ll be new Arc to contend with. They don’t sound friendly. The new community event kicks off tomorrow, November 13, 2025. Here’s everything you need to know.</p>

 <p>Developer Embark Studios has revealed what’s in store for <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first major post-launch content update and community event (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-first-major-update-north-line-goes-live-tomorrow-heres-what-to-expect">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>). But before anyone can step foot on the new frontier of Stella Montis, players will have to work for it via “Breaking New Ground,” described as a “multi-phase community event leading to a Stella Montis unlock.”</p>

 <p>There aren’t too many details about what, exactly, players will be doing during the event. But the developer has promised “rare resources, new gameplay items, and potential weapon blueprints.” The event will feature its own currency, “Merits,” and will only be available until December.</p> <p>Once accessible, Stella Montis will be home to an exclusive Arc, the Shredder. Embark describes the threat as something that will force “Raiders to stay sharp in close-quarters encounters.” Good news for those tired of shooting drones and rolly things that go pop.

              <p>While <i>Arc Raiders</i> certainly isn’t alone in featuring paid cosmetics and, soon, battle passes, the game has come under fire from fans since launch for its pricey skins and concerns that some items in the upcoming premium battle passes will be “pay-to-win.” In a blog post outlining some pricing changes, however, developer Embark Studios is responding to player feedback and concern, lowering prices on existing cosmetics and clarifying what fans can expect when premium battle passes arrive.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gifts-premium-currency-after-server-struggles-2000640888">Backlash against expensive skin pricing</a> in <i>Arc Raiders</i> swiftly followed the game’s release on October 30. With the game selling for $40 rather than being free-to-play, fans weren’t too happy about skins in the premium store costing half that. Meanwhile, the limited customization options associated with cheaper items like face paints have seemed to discourage folks from getting too excited over them.</p>

 <p>But <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/">according to an official blog post</a> today, Embark Studios is lowering prices on skins and refunding folks (in premium currency) who purchased them at the older, more expensive price. Furthermore, the studio has clarified that any usable gameplay items found in upcoming battle passes will be in the free versions available to all players. “The focus for premium [battle passes] are based on cosmetics and convenience,” the developer wrote.</p>

 <p>As some fans have pointed out, since you can lose gear in an extraction shooter just as easily as you can find it, gameplay items in a premium battle pass wouldn’t be locked to a player and thus wouldn’t be as unfair in theory, but it’s still nice to see the game avoid any accusations of being pay-to-win.</p>

 <h2>Duo matchmaking was secretly enabled</h2> <p>Since launch, players have asked for duo-only matchmaking, allowing pairs of folks to venture out into games populated by other pairs. Embark Studios confirmed that it has “silently tested and enabled Duo prioritized matchmaking” earlier this week. While it cautioned that “you may [still] run into differing constellations of players other than your own,” the developer described the matchmaking system like this:</p> <blockquote><p>First, we prioritize Solos and Squads to play separately. After that, we prioritize Duos to play with other Duos, and for Trios to play with Trios.</p></blockquote> <p>As a solo player, I haven’t been too bothered by mismatched player counts in squads out there, but hopefully this will help balance out PvP skirmishes in the near future.</p>
