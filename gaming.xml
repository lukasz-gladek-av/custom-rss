            <p>Developer Asobo has advised <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> players to "move your community packages" if they experience persistent stability issues or long loading times.</p>
<p>In a notice appended to the 1.1.9.0 Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-update-1-1-9-0-available-now">release notes</a>, Asobo noted that outdated packages in the Community Folder could adversely impact performance, adding that relocating the packages to another folder and relaunching the game should help.</p>

<p>"If you are playing on PC, outdated packages in your Community Folder may have an unexpected impact on the title’s performance and behaviour," the statement said. "If you suffer from stability issues or long loading times, move your Community package(s) to another folder before relaunching the title."</p><p>The patch itself also addresses a crash when you select "As Arrival" in the EFB, a crash that could occur when "closing and invoking the Camera menu after changing the Drone focus mode option to a value other than undefined", as well as "various" other crashes across the title".</p> <div>

<p>A few other "general" bug fixes have also been resolved, including the missing cursor on Xbox Live sign-in popup, a problem where you could lose focus when creating a new input profile, and a bug wherein the aircraft selection is accessible via the control menu, but can only be changed from the home page.</p>
<p>It also fixes an issue where you could get stuck when accessing the menu bar from any help page.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-studio-apologises-for-issues-as-it-increases-server-capacity">the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 team apologised to its community</a> for the game's less than perfect debut, admitting, "this is not the launch experience we want for our players", admitting it vastly underestimated how many of us would be looking to take to the skies in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 at launch.</p>
<p>In related news, we recently learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-borrowed-all-its-animals-from-planet-zoo">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 borrowed all its animals from Planet Zoo</a>.</p>
<p>"I called my friend, the CEO. His name is Jonny [Watts], and I said, 'Hey, Jonny, I'm working on Flight Sim, can I have your animals from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-zoo">Planet Zoo</a>?' And he's like, 'Yeah, why not?'," said Flight Simulator boss Jorg Neumann. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Intel is preparing to reveal its next generation of graphics cards, and it looks like some early specs have been leaked thanks to a, now removed, store listing.</p>



<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gxp8e0/amazon_has_leaked_a_few_intel_arc_b580_gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">accidently listed</a>, then removed, what appeared to be two Intel Battlemage GPUs from ASRock. According to the store listing, the Intel Arc B580 features 12GB of GDDR6 memory with a speed of 19Gbps. The card also features a 192-bit memory bus which would result in a 456 GB/s or so bandwidth.</p>







<p>A couple interesting bits from the listing were the cards being PCIe x8 only as opposed to x16. Regarding boost frequency, the listing suggested a 2.8 GHz boost frequency compared to a 2.0 GHz from the Arc A580.</p>



<p>When reached for comment in the past, Intel has declined to comment on any rumor or speculation. That said, a store listing adds credence to rumors that an announcement of their new graphics cards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was set to come in December</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Intel Arc B580</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GPU</td><td>Battlemage BGM-G21</td></tr><tr><td>GPU Clock Speed</td><td>2.8 GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>12GB GDDR6</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Bus</td><td>192-bit</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Speed</td><td>19 Gbps</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Bandwidth</td><td>456 GB/s</td></tr><tr><td>PCIe</td><td>5.0 x8</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <p>A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> fan believes they've discovered a hidden message that adds further credence to a long-held fan theory about the seminal horror game.</p>
<p>The player believes that on two television sets found in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> – the TV in the hospital cafeteria, and another in the nurses' lounge – a secret message is being played via Morse code.</p>

<p>"A message is playing on the TV in Brookhaven Hospital, transmitted in morse code," YouTuber Shiba explained.</p>
<p>"The sound is mostly drowned out by the static from the TV, making it difficult to hear clearly. However, the Morse code is distinct, with a clicking sound that resembles a telegraph. The loud clicks mark the beginning of a signal, while the softer click signal its end. If we listen closely, we can decipher the following message."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another fun Silent Hill 2 Remake discovery, a TV in Brookhaven Hospital in morse code repeatedly says, "Again and Again and Again and Again" endlessly: <a href="https://t.co/v1OcX7r8tb">https://t.co/v1OcX7r8tb</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1859864583252607265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>The message itself is pretty short, consisting of just two words and played on a loop: "Again and."</p>
<p>Coupled with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-cracks-mysterious-silent-hill-2-remake-photo-puzzle-revealing-secret-message-hidden-by-bloober-team">hidden message discovered hiding behind the mysterious photos found in Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, the morse code message adds further validity to the popular fan theory that James Sunderland is trapped in the town of Silent Hill, reliving his search of Mary on a loop "again and again and again and".</p>

<p>The patch comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-fans-want-to-know-when-the-game-will-run-properly-on-ps5-pro">Silent Hill 2 Remake players called on Konami to address the technical issues still plaguing the game on PS5 Pro</a> almost two weeks on from the Pro's release. However, some players report all the patch has done is remove PSSR and fails to address any of the underlying issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The “game-aware” overlay lives in the Microsoft Game Bar and is designed to automatically find and show you links to tips and guides for the game you’re playing, using the Edge browser.</p><p>Game Assist uses the profile you’re logged into in Edge, so it’ll give you access to your data, like cookies, autofill, and favorites, so “you don’t need to log into sites again.” Like other Game Bar widgets, you can pin it above your game as you play. Game Assist is currently available in English, and you’ll need to opt into the preview and set Microsoft Edge Beta 132 as your default browser to use it.</p><p>Here’s a video of the feature in action: </p><p>You’ll have to find content yourself for most games for now, but the game-aware part of Game Assist will surface information automatically for a few games, including <em>Baldur’s Gate 3, Diablo IV, </em>and <em>Hellblade II: Senua’s Saga</em>.

<p>After thanking an eagle-eyed viewer for pointing out the strangeness of a hand in banner art on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> itself, Riot Games called the image "a mistake [that] has since been removed" and asserted its "strict stance" against AI.</p>

            <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is calling for an investigation into Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/22/apple-and-google-could-face-uk-competition-probe-over-app-store-rules.html">CNBC</a>, the CMA may use its powers under the new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC) to examine possible anti-competitive behaviour from the two companies given their dominance of the UK's mobile markets.</p>
<p>However, it proposes that no further action be taken on cloud gaming given "primary concerns have been addressed".</p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-publishes-provisional-findings-in-mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming-market-investigation">preliminary investigation</a>, an independent inquiry group has recommended a review into the UK mobile ecosystem and assess if the two megacorps have Strategic Market Status (SMS) which potentially gives them a self-preferential position in the market.</p>

<p>The independent inquiry group alleged Apple's App Store rules "restrict other competitors from being able to deliver new, innovative features that could benefit consumers" and makes it difficult for smaller developers to operate without having to use the App Store.</p><p>The investigation also looked at mobile cloud gaming but said that as Apple made changes to allow cloud gaming apps to be sold via the App Store during the course of the investigation, "the group has provisionally concluded there is no need for intervention by the CMA in mobile cloud gaming".</p>
<p>The group also alleged Google and Apple have a revenue-sharing agreement to make Google the default search engine on iPhone which "significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete in mobile browsers on iOS".</p>
<p>"Markets work best when rival businesses are able to develop and bring innovative options to consumers," said Margot Daly, chair of the CMA's independent inquiry group. "Competition between different mobile browsers is not working well and this is holding back innovation in the UK."</p>
<p>Apple dispute the claims and said inteventions made under the DMCC "would undermine user privacy and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart".</p>
<p>"Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish," Apple said in a statement to CNBC. "We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users."</p>
<p>The CMA expects to make a final decision in March 2025. Google, Apple, and other interested parties have until 13th December to respond to the inquiry group's provisional report. The DMCC will come into effect in January 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cma-closes-its-investigation-into-apples-app-payments-on-grounds-of-administrative-priority">The CMA closed its investigation into Apple's in-app payment system</a> back in August "on the grounds of administrative priority".</p>
<p>At the time, the CMA said it no longer considered the investigation a priority but stressed that the case's closure "does not constitute a decision by the CMA".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-reportedly-working-on-new-game-focused-ios-app-integrating-store-social-features-achievements-and-more">Apple is reportedly set to continue its slow and steady expansion into gaming</a> with the launch of a new game-focused iOS app that'll gather the likes of a store, recommendations, achievements, and social features into one place.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>World of Warcraft is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, November 23, 2024. Below, we talk with key developers about the journey to make the game what it is today, and the future ahead.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Two decades ago, World of Warcraft burst onto the scene and changed gaming forever. The once-niche MMORPG genre became mainstream overnight. Blizzard took ideas that came before in games like Everquest and refined, polished, and further elaborated on them until what was left would appeal to the gaming masses. The result was "WoW" becoming a household name and a cultural phenomenon in a way most video game creators can only dream of, with millions and millions of players willing to pay a $15-a-month subscription to this day for the privilege of continuing their digital adventures in the fantasy world of Azeroth.</p><p dir="ltr">It's hardly a surprise the WoW that first launched 20 years ago on November 23, 2004, while technically still the same game, is vastly different to the current version of the MMO players play today. Its most recent expansion alone, The War Within, added account-wide progression and a new endgame activity for solo players, two ideas that would have been unheard of even a decade ago but which have been received with near-universal praise from the game's community.</p><p dir="ltr">Modern WoW is so different, in fact, that Blizzard in 2019 began offering up "Classic" versions of WoW so players could re-live the game as it was at launch and first few expansions--something fans had been doing unofficially for years. There are currently five different versions of WoW to choose from, a fact that further emphasizes just how big, and how much of a cultural impact, Blizzard's MMORPG has had. Many live-service games in 2024 can barely survive a few months, let alone years, yet here is Blizzard operating five versions of the same game at once (WoW Classic, Season of Discovery, Cataclysm Classic, WoW Classic Hardcore, The War Within)--and finding great success doing so.</p><figure data-embed-type="comparison" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4404229-screenshot2024-11-22at2.07.42%E2%80%AFpm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4404230-wow_the_war_within_undermined_location_screenshots_%286%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4404229,1300-4404230" data-size="large" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4404229-screenshot2024-11-22at2.07.42%E2%80%AFpm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4404230-wow_the_war_within_undermined_location_screenshots_%286%29.png"><p>Gallery</p>       <figcaption>Left: Early WoW footage from YouTube user SpecialAgentSqueaky / Right: World of Warcraft: The War Within</figcaption> <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4404229-screenshot2024-11-22at2.07.42%E2%80%AFpm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4404230-wow_the_war_within_undermined_location_screenshots_%286%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">For WoW's 20th anniversary, GameSpot talked with leading members of the WoW development team to get their thoughts on what makes the virtual world of Azeroth special, why WoW has endured for so long, and how the team is currently making plans for the next 20 years.</p><p dir="ltr">For executive producer Holly Longdale, she said the familiarity--the ability for players who may have played years ago to return and still recognize the game--contributes to its long-term success. The team strives for WoW to remain consistent over the years for that reason, whether it's the game's look, themes, or even something as small as its often not-too-serious quest text.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's something really powerful about coming home," Longdale said. "This fundamental idea we have is that if you haven't played in six, seven, or 15 years, we want it to be the place you remember and the place you fell in love with."</p><p dir="ltr">It's for that reason WoW won't be dramatically updating its graphics or art style anytime soon, something Longdale said Blizzard gets asked about a lot. As it stands, it would be "a risk that's not worth taking," she said.</p><p dir="ltr">She also wasn't shy when it came to admitting that WoW has an advantage new MMORPGs just getting started today don't--it was, in many ways, first.</p><p dir="ltr">"Let's be honest, when you're the first game of this sort, that came out of a genre that hadn't hit mainstream and you were the one that became mainstream, you have an advantage," Longdale said. "We don't take that for granted at all. We know that."</p><p dir="ltr">Using a mantra of "leave no player behind," Blizzard is looking at how to deliver on what the vast and varied communities that make up WoW want moving forward. Part of that means more frequent content updates, as has been the case since the launch of 2022's Dragonflight expansion (Longdale said every time in the past 20 years there has been an update drought, it has not gone well). It also means investing in a more data-driven approach to understand how players interact with the game in addition to listening to what they have to say.</p><p dir="ltr">She used the game's roleplaying community as an example of an area where Blizzard "could absolutely do better." She said the recent Netflix documentary, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-remarkable-life-of-ibelin-review-the-real-warcraft-movie/1900-6418311/">The Remarkable Life of Ibelin</a>, "sparked a fire" in the team to do more. The documentary tells the story of Mats Steen, a WoW player who suffered from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy but found comfort within Azeroth as part of a roleplaying community. Much of the film is animated using WoW's in-game assets, but also shows characters doing things in-game, like fully animated hugs or high-fives, that aren't currently possible in WoW. She said the team is now doing testing to see if those kinds of interactions could be added in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Longtime game director Ion Hazzikostas had his own thoughts on why WoW has continued to endure so many years later. He used factions as a measure of just how far the game has come and how it continues to evolve. For much of the game's life, the decision of whether to play as a Horde or an Alliance character dictated a player's experience--who they could play with, where they could quest, and the story they experienced. In 2024, that's, for the most part, no longer the case. Hazzikostas said the idea of Horde and Alliance players grouping up to play together, as they can for certain activities in the modern version of game, is an idea that would have at one time been "unfathomable."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm sure if you'd asked the development team a while back, they would have said, 'No, never. That can never change. It wouldn't be Warcraft if it did,'" Hazzikostas said. "Alliance and Horde are playing together today in many cases, and it's still Warcraft."</p><p dir="ltr">He said the strength of the community--the bonds, friendships, and families that have been forged in Azeroth--is a large reason why WoW continues to thrive. It's that same community that pushes the game forward, encouraging Blizzard to adapt to the changing demands of its playerbase.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="293582500" data-promo-id="0"

on their own, and have a different vibe, and a different pace, and appeal to a different audience, I think is a testament to how much the game has changed along with our players and grown up along with our players," Hazzikostas said. "The release of World of Warcraft on November 23, 2004 was a magical moment, and millions of people discovered this world and the ability to connect with others. But if we hadn't continued to evolve along with them, we wouldn't be here 20 years later."</p><p dir="ltr">Two decades in, Longdale said it's time for WoW to change by "way of the community," as Blizzard puts a renewed focus on understanding its playerbase and listening to what it wants. She said as part of her role she's already thinking about the next 10, 15, and 20 years of WoW, and what foundations need to be laid out in the years ahead to get the game there. WoW may have been going for 20 years already, but that doesn't mean it's slowing down or looking to relinquish its MMORPG crown anytime soon.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want to keep doing better…the goal is to grow," Longdale said. "We want everybody on the planet to be in Azeroth, at some point."</p>

		<p>Hands up if you had snow overnight? Well lucky you, because while I still have a chill in the air in my neck of the woods, it’s merely accompanied by wind and some rain.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-confirms-double-pump-return-for-og-chapter-1-season-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fortnite has officially confirmed the return of one of the most popular meta moves in the game, Double Pump. Players can Double Pump their way to a Victory Royale with the start of OG Chapter 1 Season 1 on December 6, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite revealed the return of the Double Pump for OG Chapter 1 Season 1 in a unique way this time. Before officially confirming on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1860006119420174525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the official Fortnite Twitch account took the chats of certain popular streamers to make the reveal. Streamers like <a href="https://x.com/DrLupo/status/1860003558051184758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr Lupo</a>, <a href="https://x.com/sparkles_qt/status/1860001598971478132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">100T Sparkles_qt</a> and more saw Fortnite enter their chat to state, “hey, chat…double pump returning December 6 with OG chapter 1 season 1, btw”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the announcement of Double Pump’s return to Fortnite, fans have started speculating what else could return along with OG Chapter 1 Season 1. Players wonder whether other elements, such as original weapon models, the UI, the OG Scar Sound, and more, could also make an appearance. As we all know, Fortnite’s OG Chapter 1 Season 1 has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-fortnite-map-returning-permanently-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to return permanently</a> this December, so the developers might have a lot more planned this time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Double Pump was one of the most popular moves during standoffs in OG Fortnite. Players would set two Pump Shotguns next to each other in their inventory and swap while shooting to fire multiple bullets in quick succession. Thanks to its aggressive approach, Double Pump became one of the most used tactics in the original chapter, and fans are delighted to see the return of this meta move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite is seemingly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-reportedly-gearing-up-for-a-cyberpunk-2077-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gearing up for a collaboration with Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Also, Epic has announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-increasing-its-battle-pass-price-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slight increase in Battle Pass prices from December</a>. What are your thoughts on Double Pump returning to Fortnite?&nbsp;</p>

We took these Warbands and decks for a spin so check out what makes these tick and how we liked them.</p>

<h3><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> Warband Changes</h3>

<p>With the new edition of <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> the way that Rivals decks are mostly the same, but there are larger changes to the ways that Warbands function that you'll need to know before reading further.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6ed521c-5f08-4830-865a-d3f962e557b4" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Underworld Embergard Review</em></a> a Warband is now just the units, Fighter cards, and Warband reference cards. These reference cards contain the unique mechanics for each Warband, it's no longer something specific to that Warbands Rival Deck. Those mechanics now stay with each Warband, and then the Rivals Deck you're using creates permutations as you go into games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grandfathers-gardeners-and-the-jaws-of-itzl-jaws-box.jpg?itok=qVWqX-bR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grandfathers-gardeners-and-the-jaws-of-itzl-jaws-box.jpg?itok=4OXXcuAI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No more Rivals Decks for Warbands</figcaption></figure><p>For example if you're using the <em>Grandfather's Gardeners</em> you'll always be able to use their Blooming Plague throughout the battle, but pairing them with <em>Reckless Fury</em> will result in a more aggressive style of game as opposed to the positioning-based <em>Wrack and Ruin</em>.</p>



<p>Inside each of these new Warband packages you'll receive the Warband's Fighter Cards, a sprue with the Fighter's pieces, instructions for assembly, and the Warband card that shows colored versions of each Fighter alongside their names, story, and primary mechanics.</p>

<p>Quite interestingly the standalone Warband packs don't just come with a single Warband card but they come with seven. Each card comes in a different language supporting English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Japanese, and Chinese. Their character cards also list the creature names in a variety of languages.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grandfathers-gardeners-and-the-jaws-of-itzl.jpg?itok=FecBKBdM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grandfathers-gardeners-and-the-jaws-of-itzl.jpg?itok=Ki6-_PER 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Multi-language support out of the box!</figcaption></figure><p><em>Grandfather's Gardeners</em> are a Warband fighting to "spread the maggots and seepages of Nurgle across the realms." This Warband of five has a really interesting mechanics of cycling through powerlevels, like a garden growing and wilting away.</p>

<p>At the start of the game a token is placed on the start of their Warscroll tracker and processes at the end of turns, when damaging is inflicted upon you, or if you have more treasure tokens than your opponent. As the tracker moves around the circular track the number next to the tracker will determine the power of their characteristic.</p>

<p>This will determine times when you'll want to seek out objectives, if you're at a low value position on the tracker, or when you want to make big plays. One point on this track even allows you to heal a fighter making it beneficial to be moving through the track quickly if you need to heal up.</p>

<p>By comparison, <em>The Jaws of Itzl</em> are a Skaven pack of four Fighters; Kro-Jaz, the Aegis, So-Kar, Ro-Tak, the Guardian, and Sotek's Venomites. This Warband will always be seeking to overpower their opponents and get into advantageous positions.</p>



<p>With Instinctual Control after declaring an attack Sotek's Venomites can move, keeping Sotek's Venomites nearby other Fighters can help gain a quick advantage early on. With low stats it's likely the most help that the Venomites will be.</p>

<p>Other offensive plays including Savage Mauling which lets you roll attack dice up to the damage that the saurus has taken. A quick way to turn the battle and even more useful knowing it recharges on the death of an enemy fighter. Knowing just when to unleash this attack could get your opponent on the back foot very quickly.</p>

<p>It's clear that this Warband is ready to not only take some hits but also dish out, for a player who enjoys pushing fast and aggressively at the start of the game you'll likely have a lot of fun with this Warband.</p>

<h2><em>Warhammer Underworlds Rivals Decks - Reckless Fury </em>and <em>Wrack and Ruin</em></h2>

<p>Each Rivals Deck comes in a large package, once inside you end up with a neat deckbox with the logo of the Warband. Easy to cary around and pack up which is important for storage once you've got a lot of Warbands to pick from.</p>



<p>The Rivals Decks themselves come with a double-sided title card. This displays the deck name, a narrative structure for the deck, and a list of all of the included Objective and Power Cards. There are 12 Objective Cards and 20 Power Cards that will make up your deck.</p>

<p>For <em>Reckless Fury</em> your goals align with the Bounty characteristics of enemy fighters, or getting Charge tokens on your Fighters. This really aligns with the idea of "Fury" as you'll be wanting to Charge as much as possible, or use power cards to force characters to Charge, and then taking out your opponents to score big.</p>

<p>The majority of the cards in this deck are tied to Charging, abilities when you have Charge tokens, and buffing characters when they have the Charge token. It's honestly not a complicated Rivals Deck to get behind, and at the beginning of a new edition of <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> this will likely be a great way to introduce players who just want to deal some damage to the format.</p>



<p><em>Wrack and Ruin</em> play a more complicated game. Earning objectives are predominantly tied to the positioning of your Fighters. You might get an objective on something as simple as a friendly fighter being in both territories or if there are no fighters in Edge Hexes, but it could also be something far more complex like having two friendly fighters in the enemy territory with Move tokens.</p>

<p>The placement isn't just about your own fighters either, as it's also important to see where your opponents Warbands are and attempt to move them into specific positions.</p>

<p>These specific requirements can be achieved with smart use of ploys and upgrades. You'll be getting to swap fighters, giving your opponents options of whether they want to move or be vulnerable, or simply push them around.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>Reckless Fury</em> that's all about attacking you'll likely more be dancing around your opponents with the <em>Wrack and Ruin</em> Rivals Deck having to plan two or three turns ahead to make sure you have responses to keep yourself safe and on-objective while baiting your enemy towards you. For a more calculating player there's a lot of fun to be had here.</p>

<p>Variety is the spice of life and once again Games Workshop has created a diverse collection of Warbands and Rivals Decks that when mixed and matched can create wholly different experiences.</p>

<p>Whether you're playing as <em>Grandfather's Gardeners</em> with fluctuating power you can go on the attack with <em>Reckless Fury</em> or coax your opponents into helping you achieve your objectives through non-combat with <em>Wrack and Ruin</em>. The pieces are the same, but in a different arrangement, it's a whole different level of fun.</p>

<p>The only potential drawback of this offering is that it's either a very simplistic approach, or a very complicated one. If you want an easy stepping stone to a more complicated startegy it's likely not going to be found here.</p>

New units that pull from the show include Divalo (Vanguard), Saiko (Exclusive), Okorun (Exclusive), Pweeny (Exclusive), and Mimi (Exclusive). A skin system will allow players to customize existing Units with new outfits and can be acquired from the Occult Banner. Meanwhile, Kitawari says Familiars help out your Unit by providing them with “substantial buffs.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime Vanguards released in September and has continued to attract Roblox players for months. Although momentum has largely been maintained since launch, its development has not been without the occasional speedbump.
