If you're a fan of Naughty Dog's Last of Us series, either the games or the TV show, you can now preorder a replica of Ellie's guitar that Joel customized with the custom moth inlay fretboard. This guitar was first featured in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us Part II</a> and made an appearance in the second season of the HBO series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The guitar is a collaboration with Taylor Guitars and is a special edition of the Taylor 314ce. You can preorder it for $2,999.99 at the PlayStation Store and it will officially release on November 18, 2025. It's listed in the PlayStation store's hardware section among various consoles, controllers, and other accessories.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Taylor 314ce The Last of Us Part II Replica Guitar</h2><div catalogid="09a8041f-5e7d-4130-8508-ecf1bff3e86c" id="227110"><div id="227110" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Taylor 314ce The Last of Us Part II Replica Guitar</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The PlayStaton Store bundle includes a strap and replica case.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The guitar has distinctive rich tobacco sunburst top in Sitka spruce pulled straight from the game and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-spoiler-free">latest season of the TV show</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you think that $3,000 is a ridiculous amount of money to pay for a guitar, it's actually not <em>that</em> terribly priced, especially for a nice acoustic guitar. The standard Taylor 314ce costs around $2,499 on its own without the Last of Us details included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that Taylor is selling a <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjp1Ee?object_uuid=94cc8cdf-4912-495a-b122-00a9bf6fb1f1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">slightly cheaper version of this replica</a> directly from its website.

But what about new games and episodes of the show? Game-wise, The Last of Us Part 3 has yet to be officially confirmed and it seems unlikely that it ever will be.

						<h5>Echoes of the End</h5><p><span>August 12, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Echoes of the End is the debut title from developer Myrkur Games and is published by Deep Silver. At first glance, at least based on the title, it looks like it has something new to offer, or at least familiar but in a comforting way. But before the tutorial was even over, I was deeply concerned with how negative the familiarity felt, in a way that made it difficult not to compare it to its betters.</p>



<p>By the end, however, Echoes of the End pulled together a story and even a few gameplay moments that were meaningful to experience, but not so meaningful that it's worth crawling through a boring first half to get to an improved back-half, especially when there are elements that never really improve.</p>



<p>Echoes of the End puts you in the shoes of Ryn, who is also a vestige, a person who has the potential for incredibly destructive power, and who is so dangerous to others around them that they can't even touch another person. Right from the top, when Ryn is surveilling an area with her brother Cor, she denies grabbing his hand to help her up a cliff, and Cor refers back to a previous incident where Ryn gave Cor scars because of her powers. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Echoes of the End features plenty of stunning vistas.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The more we learn about what it means to be a vestige from Ryn, the more we discover that Ryn has basically been told she's something to be feared all her life. It's pretty much all that defines Ryn as a character. She's scared of her power and is seemingly angry at herself all the time for even having it. She only seems to be able to make peace with herself by using her strength to fight against the threats that her countrymen, and more specifically her brother, cannot overcome alone. </p>



<p>But just as we're getting to know more about her relationship with Cor, who is perhaps the only person that Ryn can be comfortable with, he's kidnapped by the game's antagonists, Aurick, the leader of an opposing nation's invading force, and Zara, a vestige who is using her powers to try and destroy the magical protection wards that have kept Ryn and Cor's nation safe for years.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Ryn and Abram discover the invasion is progressing faster than they could have anticipated.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The fact that Zara is succeeding at destroying the wards is cause for concern, but not so concerning that Ryn thinks twice about throwing herself into a fight with Aurick, Zara, and their legions. It's at this early point in the game that we are introduced to Abram, a scholar who was traveling to Ryn's homeland to figure out what happened to Ryn's father, as he was, unbeknownst to Ryn, pen pals with her late dad, and became worried when the letters stopped coming. That's at least what Abram tells you at the beginning, but you don't have to be a scholar to figure out that there's more to his character than he's letting on.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Deep Silver</figcaption></figure>



<p>You soon learn that Abram lost his daughter several years ago, and with that knowledge the fractured parent-child relationship that Abram and Ryn each represent one side of that will be healed over the course of the game's events, reveals itself in the narrative. Abram is a parent looking to fill the gap left by his lost child, and Ryn is searching for a father to give her the kind of compassion she believes she never got.</p>



<p>That at least sets the groundwork for what becomes a bit more of an interesting character-driven story by the end of the game, no more of which I'll spoil here, though even with what I've already shared, you might be able to predict how it ends. And that's part of the problem I keep swinging back and forth on with Echoes of the End.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Some of my favorite moments in Echoes of the End were the conversations between Ryn and Abram while they looked out at the skyline.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Its narrative is very familiar, because its themes, and even the look of its setting, can't help but resemble another recent series of games that have a similar visual language and character explorations, which, if you haven't yet guessed, is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-mad-dad-redemption/">2018 God of War reboot</a>. Is Echoes of the End bad because it is predictable, and in a post-2018 God of War world, tries to execute its own spin on what Sony Santa Monica proved was a winning formula? Not necessarily, but it's also not good because of it. It might be a comforting, C-grade story by the end that has a few B-grade moments and even one A-grade moment before the credits roll. But it misses the mark more than it hits it, and it only starts getting close to the target once you've reached the fifth chapter and are officially in the back half of a 10-chapter game.</p>



<p>You'll notice that I haven't mentioned the gameplay yet. That's because I'm trying to talk more about the good, or at least the half-good elements to find in Echoes of the End, before getting into the bad and the janky. </p>



<figure><figcaption>This forgotten king is perhaps the best boss fight in Echoes of the End.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, sticking with the good, and with the story for a bit more, I'd be remiss if I didn't compliment the voice acting, which was perhaps the main reason I came around to Ryn and Abram even before the story got more interesting in the latter parts of the game. </p>



<p>The gameplay elements that fall into that 'good' descriptor are its puzzle and platforming mechanics, but again, these only get interesting towards the back half of the game. Even worse for a puzzle game fan like myself, some of the more interesting puzzle mechanics are introduced in one chapter, never to be seen again. Some puzzle elements are layered on top of each other in the final chapters to make for the game's most fun-to-solve challenges, but they're so few that it feels more disappointing than anything, because I can't help wondering why they didn't explore more layering between the puzzles and platforming.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Echoes of the End has a few fun puzzles.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I can appreciate that those puzzles and platforming sections in the latter half of the game were included at all, but I walked away from my time with Echoes of the End wondering why the ramp-up to those challenges was so poor. I'm also left wondering, and bemoaning, how quickly the game was prepared to give me the answer. At least Echoes of the End had the courtesy to let me press a button to ask for a hint, and I only recall a few times in the early part of the game where my companion, whether it was Cor or Abram, spilled the beans on what to do before I even had time to begin figuring out the puzzle in front of me. As a side note, achievement hunters would do well to avoid the hint button, since there are several puzzles where you'll get an achievement for solving them without any help from the game.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This volcano level was a favorite of mine, especially visually.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The final point in the 'good' category, I can't deny that Echoes of the End is easy on the eyes across all 10 chapters. Some, like the chapter that takes place entirely in a volcano, and the one on a frozen lake with a Northern Lights-esque skybox all around you, are more engaging to stop and marvel at than others, but overall this is game is a visual treat, especially if you have a PC that can really push the graphical limits of a modern release.</p>



<p>With 'the good' unfortunately exhausted, it's time for the bad, and the bad is the combat. I found it entirely unengaging, lacking in enemy variety, and thanks to the jank that was constantly present in all aspects of the game, it was difficult, if not impossible, to get into any flow with Ryn and her movements across each encounter, boss fights included. A key element of this is the game's poor lock-on function, which could very well just be broken, so you might find this review a year after this game's launch and have no idea what I'm talking about because Myrkur Games patched it up. But as it currently stands, the lock-on doesn't seem to really work, and I was fighting the camera as much as I was fighting the barrage of lackluster humanoid enemies in front of me.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Deep Silver</figcaption></figure>



<p>Any flow to the combat that could be found came from stunning enemies with your powers to slam them into each other, or inflict damage with several other mana-based attacks while you picked them off, because the enemy AI possessed no thought other than 'charge at player character' when in a fight. It got boring quickly, even if parrying made me feel overpowered from the start without levelling up, and some of the final-blow animations that played when I defeated the last enemy in an encounter were occasionally cool to look at. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Echoes of the End's more interesting encounters are, unfortunately, too few.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, the skill tree you'll progress through did very little to add spice to the combat, and honestly, while it might've been an early judgment, I sort of figured that would be the case when I saw the first upgrade you unlock is your bog-standard Heavy Attack. Maybe this is reductive, but if you're gating any aspect of my character's combat progression with a mechanic that comes as part of the default package in any number of third-person action games, that signifies a shallow combat system in my eyes.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Echoes of the End's lock-on system is unfortunately broken.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Credit where it's due, some of the very final skills you earn in the tree make it a little more fun to toss enemies around, but there's nothing in Echoes of the End's combat that makes me excited to get to the next enemy encounter or boss fight. I was instead left thankful when one ended, because at least I might get an interesting narrative scene afterwards, or a fun puzzle to solve.</p>



<p>Finally, the janky, which, surprise surprise, runs through every element in Echoes of the End. It's perhaps even a meme at this point, but this is yet again an Unreal Engine 5 release that is a poor technical showcase at launch that's doing its best to distract you from the hitches, texture pop-ins, stutters, frame rate drops, and everything else under the sun short of the game crashing. I played pretty much all of my 15-hour playthrough on my laptop, which sports a Ryzen 9 6900HS and a mobile NVIDIA RTX 3070Ti, at 1440p at Medium settings, and even dropping the graphical preset to Low didn't solve my issues.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Echoes of the End does have better character moments towards the end.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Frankly, by the end of my playthrough, Echoes of the End felt like I was playing something that launched in the mid-to-late-2000s as a seventh-generation console release. That can have its own brand of charm, if, like me, you were going through some of your more formative gaming years at the time, but that doesn't mean it's worth spending your money on. Also, that charm wore off whenever an invisible projectile hit me in the middle of an attack animation. It almost didn't matter that I could parry them later on in the game, since I couldn't see them coming in the first place.</p>



<p>And invisible flaming rocks are just the tip of the iceberg for the constant glitches I was fighting beyond the enemies in front of me. At least when I stopped to look at the scenery, which was so often that most of my screenshots are stills of Ryn staring into the horizon, it was nice to look at.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ultimately, Echoes of the End delivers a C-grade experience that's trying to be flashy enough for an A. It may be visually appealing, and the back half of the game's narrative might have some solid character moments, but the technical issues and the seventh-generation-esque jank run the whole experience down.  </p>



<p>The combat, unfortunately, never lifts it back up, with rote gameplay that doesn't try to be innovative, and doesn't get the tried-and-true elements right either. The few fun and intriguing platforming and puzzle sections, along with a story that is able to stick its landing, aren't enough to save it, in part because it's questionable if it is worth sticking around to see those parts, when you could spend your time, and money, playing something that doesn't take half of its runtime to get interesting. I can appreciate that this is a small team's debut game that they put a lot of heart into, but that doesn't excuse how lacking the overall package is.</p>

					<h2>Echoes of the End</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Echoes of the End has more bad than good to it, and the jank of its technical issues running throughout all aspects of the game bring down even its best elements, like its strong visual presentation, character-driven storytelling, and some fun platforming and puzzle challenges. The combat both overall fails to innovate and pass the standard bar for interesting, and as a whole package it's likely not worth your time when you need to get five-chapters deep in a 10-chapter story to get to its best bits.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Character-driven storytelling that sticks the landing by the end
</li><li>Strong visual presentation that's great to look at throughout
</li><li>A few fun puzzle and platforming challenges, particularly towards the back half</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>It puts its worst foot forward and takes five chapters into a 10-chapter game to get better
</li><li>Fraught with technical issues that bring down even its better elements
</li><li>Combat that both doesn't try to innovate and isn't able to stand up with modern action-adventure standards
</li><li>Lack of enemy variety that, once again doesn't improve until later chapters
</li><li>Uninteresting boss fights that are more often than not repeat fights against the same key characters</li>						</ul>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enotria-the-last-song">Enotria: The Last Song</a> developers Jyamma Games are making a new action-RPG inspired by and named after Dante Alighieri’s 14th century epic poem La Divina Commedia, aka the Divine Comedy.</p>
<p>Like the poem, it sees you descending through the circles of Hell, each the geological manifestation of a particular Sin. Unlike the poem, it features a set of combat classes, a choice of protagonist genders, a narrative alignment system, procedurally generated extraction dungeons, and customisable weapons and armour. As the poet himself might say: in the middle of the journey of our life I came to myself within a dark wood where I had to grind for crafting materials. </p><!--more-->
<p>The games industry has not been mega gentle with poor old Dante, whose monumental work helped establish the Tuscan language and influenced a brace of English writers, from Blake to Beckett. The best-known video game adaptation is probably still Visceral’s cheeseball 2010 action-adventure Dante’s Inferno, which is often more interested in aping God Of War. A cynical man or snob (hello!) might look at the below, hacky-slashy trailer for Jyamma’s adaptation and consider it to be another act of wanton literary desecration. Terza rima isn’t supposed to be a three-hit combo, you blistering philistines!</p>

<p>Still, this isn't quite another exercise in crafting boobwalls for the circle of Lust or punching organs out of bodies. Enotria was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enotria-the-last-song-review%E2%80%9D">pretty metaphysical for a Soulslike</a>, building a universe and combat system around the practice of stagecraft, and Jyamma’s take on the La Divina Commedia is similarly dreamy - it turns Dante’s poem into a kind of overarching mythology.</p><p>“In this new adventure, the studio presents an epic journey set in a world where The Divine Comedy has supplanted the old faith, bringing about a golden age of righteousness among humanity,” explains <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/JYAMMA-GAMES-ANNOUNCES-LA-DIVINA-COMMEDIA-AN-EPIC-DARK-FANTASY-ACTION-">a press release</a>. “When dark forces subvert the promises of the poem, order collapses and the world is thrust into chaos. The player will take on the role of a warrior-poet trapped in the infernal depths, called to descend through the circles of Hell, face increasingly powerful demons, and redeem a sinful past.”</p>
<p>Sounds quite involved. Still, I’m not sure where the procgen extraction dungeons fit in, exactly. The idea of mining hell for loot and progression materials is the kind of videogame conceit I’d love to lay before an actual 14th century theologian. I'm sure the humour of the situation would be well worth the inconvenience of being burned at the stake. Anyway, there’s no release date yet for La Divina Commedia. The poem took about 12 years to write – hopefully, Jyamma will turn their version around a little sooner.</p>

              <p>Raphaël “Jeanpormanove” Graven reportedly died in his sleep earlier this week following broadcasts <a href="https://kotaku.com/nickmercs-kick-twitch-faze-clan-gambling-1850973704">on Kick</a> where he was routinely assaulted by others in controversial “humiliation” livestreams. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mpjplk4pxo">According to the BBC</a>, a judicial investigation in France is underway, with French government minister for digital technologies Clara Chappaz calling what Graven experienced “absolute horror.”</p> <p>The death of the 46-year-old, whose <a href="https://www.charentelibre.fr/france/qui-etait-jean-pormanove-l-influenceur-decede-en-live-25595669.php">streaming career began with TikTok videos about <em>GTA 5 </em>and <em>FIFA</em></a> and who had amassed over a million followers across all his channels, appears to have been captured live during his latest, and last, marathon Kick broadcast. Graven’s more recent content, which he created as part of the collective Le LokalTV, included being seemingly brutalized by two fellow streamers who go by the aliases <span dir="auto">“Naruto”</span><span dir="auto">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span dir="auto">“Safine,” with some clips appearing to show violent, prolonged strangulations. </span>An <a href="https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/080125/maltraitances-sur-kick-deux-influenceurs-nicois-places-en-garde-vue">investigation last year by<em> Mediapart</em></a> alleged that Graven had been subject to “months of online abuse.”</p> <p>It’s unclear what exactly the relationship was between all of the men, though reporting by <em>Mediapart</em> suggests the “humiliation” streams were lucrative and helped propel the popularity of Graven and the group’s channel on Kick. Naruto and Safine were reportedly taken into custody earlier this year but were later released amid an ongoing investigation. Kick also temporarily suspended the channel but it later resumed streaming again. Clips of the alleged abuse can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/ImpactMediaFR/status/1957522649879302450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1957522649879302450%7Ctwgr%5E96e20f49e42b8d663ca62bac84c30551c2664a5b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fkick%2Ffrench-streamer-jean-pormanove-dies-in-his-sleep-age-46-3239700%2F">circulating online</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/180825/victime-de-maltraitance-en-ligne-depuis-des-mois-le-streamer-jean-pormanove-meurt-en-direct"><em>Mediapart</em> now reports</a> that viewers of the stream earlier this week on Discord became worried about Graven’s condition after he appeared to being laying motionless in his sleep for an extended period of time. According to <em>the AFP</em>, an autopsy to determine the cause of death has been ordered.</p> <p>Kick is a competitor to Twitch and YouTube known for its loose guidelines and minimal moderation. Streamers there can promote gambling and other topics that are prohibited on other streaming platforms. A representative for Kick told the BBC it was “urgently reviewing” the circumstances around Graven’s apparent death on camera. “We are deeply saddened by the loss of Jeanpormanove and extend our condolences to his family, friends and community,” they said.</p>

              <p><em>Denshattack!</em> was probably the coolest game revealed during <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">today’s very long Gamescom Opening Night Live event</a>. But funnily enough, the wild-looking, trick-based anime train game wasn’t actually revealed during the trailer-packed event. Instead, it debuted during ONL’s shockingly good pre-show. And I can’t wait to play it when it launches next year.</p> <p><em>Denshattack!’s </em>vibrant colors and eye-popping art immediately caught the attention of everyone at <em>Kotaku</em> and reminded me of <em>Jet Set Radio</em> or even Insomniac’s <em>Sunset Overdrive</em>. And then, we all saw a train do some flips and grinds, and suddenly it became clear that <em>Denshattack!</em>&nbsp;is like a<em> Tony Hawk</em> game, but instead of controlling a person on a skateboard, you control a customizable subway car that can flip, jump, grind, hop, spin, and more across some truly gorgeous scenery. Just watch this trailer and try not to smile.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Denshattack! - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_Xmv9eAIZA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Here’s how the game’s developers, Undercoders, describe <em>Denshattack!:&nbsp;</em></p>

 <blockquote><p>Flip, trick, and grind your train in a fast-paced, off-the-rails ride through a colorful Japanese dystopia. Outmatch rival gangs, wreck a shady megacorp, and take back the tracks with nothing but skill, speed, and style. Hop aboard your custom gravity-defying train and embark on a hectic quest to defeat the sinister Miraido corporation, alongside a vibrant pack of outcasts.</p></blockquote> <p>According to the game’s trailer on YouTube, <em>Denshattack!</em> contains over 50 levels to complete, a full combo system, and “slick beats” from composer Tee Lopes, who helped create the music for games like <em>Sonic Mania </em>and <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge.&nbsp;</em>It also features “bizarre boss fights” and multiple regions of Japan to discover and explore while doing sick flips as a big train. This is definitely one of those video game concepts, <a href="https://kotaku.com/shark-dentist-horror-game-deadly-great-white-steam-pc-1851786072">like doing dental work on a shark</a>, that I never thought about, but now that I’ve seen it, I must play it as soon as possible.</p> <p><em>Denshattack!&nbsp;</em>doesn’t have a specific release date yet, but is set to launch in Spring 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2524850/Denshattack/">You can wishlist the game now on Steam.</a></p>

This is the studio's debut game, and a hands-on demo is available for those at Gamescom this week. I watched the demo ahead of its release at a preview event, and the game is an alluring combination of part-ghost story, part-musical, and part-renovation game. The heart of the game is the ghost story, though, and the developer works to make this spooky seaside tale approachable for everyone.</p><p dir="ltr">In There Are No Ghosts at the Grand, you play as Chris David, a character who has inherited The Grand, a dilapidated hotel located along the English coast. Chris is initially only tasked with restoration of the hotel, but he is ultimately drawn into rooting out a deeper mystery that surrounds the town and the people who live there.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552108-thegrandhotel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552108" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552108-thegrandhotel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552108"></a><figcaption>The Grand hotel</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552108-thegrandhotel.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The first part of the demo showcased the game's unique hotel renovation mechanics, which uses a quirky set of talking power tools built into one handheld device. Robert C. MacBrushy is a Scottish AI assistant integrated into this tool, and he gives a bit of humorous commentary to keep you company as you renovate the hotel. This sounds like it will come in handy to balance the tense elements of the game, as There Are No Ghosts at the Grand turns spooky at nighttime.</p><p dir="ltr">In the daytime, the game focuses on renovation work, with the handheld device hosting a selection of tools, including a sandblaster, power sprayer, turbo vacuum, and a furnisher. Anil Glendinning, Friday Sundae's creative director and co-founder who presented the demo, also confirmed each power-tool type has three different modes that are unlocked as you progress. We saw debris get sucked up in the device's turbo vacuum, and the demo also showed how intuitive the sprayer mechanic could be when painting walls. Glendinning said the game was designed to allow players to have fun renovating without requiring precision. With simple swipes of the sprayer, the game knew to paint only the wall surface and ignore the surrounding furniture and paintings that were still decorating the area.</p><p dir="ltr">At nighttime, the town gets a bit weird and spooky. A good example of this is when Chris's efforts to help the mayor leaves him stranded on an island. This seems to be the first moment of the game where he learns about the spooky dangers of the town, as he steps outside during a nighttime portion of the demo to find a bunch of red chairs scattered all around him. The chairs quickly evolved into some sort of spider-chair-monsters. This scare culminated in a chase scene and first-person-shooter moment, where the renovation multi-tool turned into a weapon that let Chris fire back at the creepy chair-monsters.</p><p dir="ltr">"We describe the game as being spooky. But there's no gore in the game or horror-distressing elements," Glendinning said. "It doesn't need it in order to tell the story we want to tell. And that story is about people and family, and it's about how some of that stuff can manifest itself in life."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552115-spidermonsters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552115" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552115-spidermonsters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552115"></a><figcaption>The spider-chair-monsters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552115-spidermonsters.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552109-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_14-38-31.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552110-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_17-30-51%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552111-hotelinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552112-moped.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552113-mrbones.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552114-wwiibunker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552109,1300-4552110,1300-4552111,1300-4552112,1300-4552113,1300-4552114" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552109-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_14-38-31.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552110-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_17-30-51%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552111-hotelinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552112-moped.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552113-mrbones.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552114-wwiibunker.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552109-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_14-38-31.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552110-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_17-30-51%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552111-hotelinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552112-moped.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552113-mrbones.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552114-wwiibunker.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There Are No Ghosts at the Grand is also a musical of sorts. Our preview introduced us to the town's mayor, who shared her feelings toward Chris and his hotel renovation plans through a musical number. During these scenes, you're given the option to choose how you want to respond to the characters, and Chris will sing his reply. These musical moments will happen with other characters you meet in the story as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The game wasn't always planned to be a musical, Glendinning said, but the element was added fairly early on.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the very start, we wanted to create a ghost story," he said, explaining how the story was inspired by some of the dilapidated seaside towns and boarded-up shops found in the United Kingdom. "We were hearing this internal soundtrack in our heads as we were creating this ghost story, and as we were writing dialogue and setting it to music, the [musical] dialogue evolved from that."</p><p dir="ltr">These musical interactions are just some of the opportunities for branching narratives in the game. There are also multiple endings you can experience based on your non-musical interactions with the town folk, as well as how much information you learn about the town and your neighbors by exploring and uncovering clues.</p><p dir="ltr">There Are No Ghosts at the Grand extends beyond the hotel itself, as you get access to explore various parts of the seaside village. We saw part of a mission that began with a moped ride through town, and eventually, Chris was tasked with repairing a boat for a trip to a haunted island with a World War II bunker.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552116-683d9bc8c9bcb729503d79e0_secretdoor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552116" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552116-683d9bc8c9bcb729503d79e0_secretdoor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552116"></a><figcaption>Mr. Bones and Robert C.

Mr. Bones appears to be just a normal cat during the daylight hours, but at night he gains the ability to talk to Chris and speaks with an Australian accent. It's possible his story will be part of the mystery you'll need to uncover. Regardless, don't worry: The preview confirmed you can pet the cat.</p><p dir="ltr">Glendinning also confirmed various parts of the game can be skipped.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're believers in allowing players to move through the story," he said. "If a puzzle is too difficult, you can definitely skip it."</p><p dir="ltr">That also factors into the game's replayability, as you can skip scenes and puzzles you've already experienced to more quickly advance through additional playthroughs.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, the early preview piqued my interest, as someone who loves musicals and a good mystery. The town looks cozy yet mysterious, and characters like Mr. Bones and Robert C. MacBrushy lend a great deal of personality to the game, leaving me eager to play and uncover the secrets of There Are No Ghosts at the Grand.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can renovate and work through the mystery next year, as There Are No Ghosts at the Grand is headed to Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026, and will be available on day one with Xbox Game Pass.</p>

This is not to be confused with EA’s 2010 action game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante%27s_Inferno_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dante’s Inferno</em></a>, an idea so unlikely that I remain shocked it ever came to fruition.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> developers Game Science have revealed Black Myth: Zhong Kui, another single-player action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> steeped in Chinese mythology. It casts you as a ghost-hunting god who wanders between hell and Earth. Here's a CG short from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom's Open Night Live 2025</a>, which shows the fearsomely bearded Zhong Kui himself riding an extravagantly sized tiger. </p><!--more-->

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui">a Q&amp;A on the official site</a>, the developers call the game a "tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design". They want Wukong players to feel "right at home" while "catching them off guard in the best way". That said, for now the new game remains "little more than an empty folder", with no release date and little sense in the CG trailer of how Zhong Kui fights, compared to Wukong. I'm guessing that tiger is a useful ally, though.</p>
<p>We quite liked the original Black Myth, with bygone reviews editor Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-is-a-pleasantly-surprising-soulslike-even-if-its-given-me-an-enemy-for-life">calling it</a> "a refreshing adventure after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s knotty DLC". We were less keen on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukongs-record-setting-launch-popularity-soured-by-co-publisher-request-to-avoid-feminist-propaganda-in-streams">the mildly draconian PR messages</a> to certain streamers, cautioning them to avoid "feminist propaganda", "politics" and discussion of the Chinese games industry.</p><p>These gamergatory memos followed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">a lengthy report from IGN</a> about alleged workplace sexism at Game Science. The devs refused to say anything to Ed about this when he asked at a preview event. If we're invited to preview Zhong Kui, we'll give it another shot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom and Square Enix took the stage at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74oh7zD_jxI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>gamescom Opening Night Live 2025</u></a> to show off a new collaboration that will see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> collide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and Final Fantasy 14 Online Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida (a.k.a. Yoshi-P) showed up to talk about how two of gaming’s biggest publishers are working to bring some of their biggest franchises together. Two new trailers (below) revealed only a taste of what to expect, including Monster Hunter-themed content for Final Fantasy 14 and Final Fantasy-themed content for Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Final Fantasy 14 content coming to Monster Hunter Wilds kicked off the announcement with a look at how Hunters will be able to use Chocobo to travel during hunts. It's a trailer that also teases appearances from familiar elements like Cactuar as the Capcom team tells players to prepare for "an Omega level threat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/monsterhunterwilds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> the Monster Hunter Wilds content coming to Final Fantasy 14, on the other hand, will see players "face an unknown threat in this thrilling new hunt." Its trailer shows off some of the new content you'll be able to enjoy, but there is a catch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In order to participate in the Monster Hunter Wilds-themed update, you'll need to reach level 100 in Final Fantasy 14 and complete its Dawntrail main scenario quest. It's far from a simple feat to achieve and could take new players potentially hundreds of hours to pull off (according to <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/12654" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howlongtobeat</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If a Monster Hunter fan were to jump into Final Fantasy 14 for the first time today, they could spend around 400 hours working their way through all of the required content. Alternatively, Square Enix's long-running live-service game offers paid options for those who want to skip their way past any entry barriers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using a Tales of Adventure item to skip to level 90 for any one character costs $25 alone, and a second Tales of Adventure item to then skip to Dawntrail also costs $25. That's $50 to go from level 1 to almost meeting the requirements to unlock the Monster Hunter Wilds content, with players then asked to complete the final 10 levels and see Dawntrailer to its conclusion. <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/132429" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howlongtobeat</a> estimates that it should take players about 48 hours to beat this one Final Fantasy 14 chapter on its own.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds players can expect the new content to arrive in late September as part of Free Title Update 3. Final Fantasy 14 players, meanwhile, can expect to receive their content in early October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for more updates, be sure to read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at gamescom Opening Night Live 2025</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">At Gamescom Opening Night Live, we just got a look at the opening cinematic for the next World of Warcraft expansion: Midnight. And with it, we got a taste of what to expect at the focal point of the expansion's start: Quel'Thalas, and the Blood Elf city of Silvermoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a WoW veteran, you probably know Quel'Thalas. It was introduced to World of Warcraft in the first expansion, The Burning Crusade, alongside the introduction of the Blood Elves. Currently in the game, in consists of Silvermoon City and the surrounding Eversong Woods, as well as the northern Isle of Quel'Danas and The Ghostlands to the south. Though it's largely populated by Blood Elves, it's also home to Zul'Aman, the home of the Amani Trolls. As it stands now, Silvermoon and everything to the south serves as a starting zone for low-level Blood Elves (though it's also largely been made obsolete due to the addition of the ubiquitous new player experience, Exile's Reach), while Quel'Danas was an endgame zone in patch 2.4 that's largely useless now if you don't have a very specific reason to be there.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All that is about to change. As we saw in the cinematic, Midnight opens with void menace and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-no-everyone-in-world-of-warcraft-is-falling-for-the-hot-evil-lady-who-will-definitely-try-and-kill-us-later">total baddie Xal'atath</a> attacking the Sunwell, a magical power fountain in Quel'Danas that's sacred to the Blood Elves. We're headed there at the start of Midnight to defend it (alongside the thankfully-not-dead Blood Elf leader, Lor'themar Theron), which means that whole area is getting an overhaul. Midnight starts with four zones: a reworked Eversong Woods (which also seems like it will include at least some of Ghostlands), a reworked Zul'Aman (now upgraded from a raid to a full zone), and two new areas: the rootlands of Harandar, and Voidstorm, which seems to be located in a different world entirely. Players will start in Eversong Woods and end in Voidstorm, with Zul'Aman and Harandar able to be done interchangeably.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apologies to the Draenei, though. Burning Crusade's equivalent Alliance class starting zones, Azuremyst and Bloodmyst Isle, and the Draenei hub The Exodar, don't appear to be getting any special treatment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike recent expansions, Midnight will open with not one, but three raids: The Voidspire (six bosses), The Dreamrift (one boss), and March on Quel'Danas (two bosses). World of Warcraft hasn't had multiple raids running at once for several expansions now, so having three at once at launch is a big deal. The expansion also launches with eight new dungeons (including a reworked Magister's Terrace), seven new delves, and a new PvP battleground. There's also a brand new feature called "Prey" where players hunt powerful targets across different world zones, with the potential to be ambushed while on the hunt.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft: Midnight Cinematic Images and First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for characters, we're not getting any brand new classes. A new allied race, Haranir, will be available, alongside a new mid-range Demon Hunter specialization and Void Elves now also able to become Demon Hunters. There are also some overhauls to the new player experience including new story mode raids for Dragonflight and some other catch-up features. And they're simplifying skyriding, including (thank goodness) getting rid of the vigor bar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the biggest and most exciting feature of Midnight is one we already know about: player housing. We've already heard and seen a lot about what to expect from housing, but Blizzard has re-confirmed that we're getting fully customizable player homes, with 3D placement tools, dyes to recolor furniture, all sorts of decor items available to be earned through all different kinds of content, and private and public neighborhoods. No <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-takes-a-jab-at-final-fantasy-14-with-its-housing-plans">fighting over plots</a> like in Final Fantasy 14, either!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're expecting to hear more details about what we'll see in Midnight throughout Gamescom, so stay tuned to IGN for more on World of Warcraft's latest. Midnight launches in 2026. You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Directed by Smash Bros. head Masahiro Sakurai, Kirby Air Riders is a racing game featuring characters from the world of Kirby. It offers battle arenas for vehicular combat, as well as standard tracks for racing. Kirby Air Riders is available for preorder now (<a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdbq66?object_uuid=a97a1d3a-863e-48e1-84a1-276af742c2eb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Best Buy</a>).</p><p id="preorder-the-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Preorder the game">Kirby Airy Riders</h2></p><div catalogid="011f803d-35ed-467e-be69-95e40a6bb8fd" id="227102"><div id="227102" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kirby Airy Riders</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdbq66?object_uuid=a97a1d3a-863e-48e1-84a1-276af742c2eb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Best Buy</a> - $69.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47lO4?object_uuid=a97a1d3a-863e-48e1-84a1-276af742c2eb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at GameStop</a> - $69.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5wD55?object_uuid=a97a1d3a-863e-48e1-84a1-276af742c2eb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Nintendo eShop (Digital)</a> - $69.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">There aren't any special or collector's editions for Kirby Air Riders, so the standard edition is your only choice. I, for one, find that sort of refreshing in a world where many games charge an extra $20 to play a few days early, which just seems distasteful to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll add more retailers as the listings go up, but for more immediate info as it live at other retailers, be sure to follow IGN Deals on <a href="https://x.com/IGNDeals" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/igndeals.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a>.</p></div><p id="is-the-game-on-the-cart"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Is the game on the cart?">Is the Game on the Cart?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you buy a physical copy of Kirby Air Riders, you can rest assured that the full game will be contained on the cartridge itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t always the case with physical Switch 2 releases.

Finally, there are full game carts that come with the game on them. Kirby Air Riders is the latter, as are all first-party Nintendo games released so far.</p><p id="what-is-kirby-air-riders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What Is Kirby Air Riders?">What Is Kirby Air Riders?</h2></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders is a sequel to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-air-ride">GameCube game called Kirby Air</a> Ride (note the lack of "ers" at the end) that came out in 2003. While the original game’s roster was mostly different versions of Kirby, this sequel lets you play as a number of other characters as well, including King Dedede, Meta Knight, Chef Kawasaki, and Bandana Waddle Dee. All of these characters will have Kirby’s patented copy ability, which lets them copy and use the powers of their enemies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And where the original game featured a single button to press during gameplay, this Switch 2 sequel has added a second button.

Five years ago you led your team into the abyss and have been haunted by your failures ever since.

        <p><strong>Welcome to the End of History</strong></p><p>Find yourself thrown into a three-way struggle for cultural and ideological power, played out across an unforgettable new city. In ZERO PARADES, the world itself is a character with its own secrets, traumas, and miracles for you to discover.</p><p><strong>Trust is a Volatile Plaything</strong></p><p>To get anywhere in this world, you’ll need friends. Unfortunately, you don’t have any. Instead, you’ll go up against international bankers, foreign techno-fascists, psychic doppelgängers, a paranoid TV presenter, a man with a box for a heart, and dozens more. Everyone you meet has their own agendas, beliefs, and secrets for you to uncover and turn to your own ends.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_985862"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Make It Up as You Go Along</strong></p><p>In this line of work you’re going to fail *way* more often than you succeed. That much is expected of you. What matters is how you pick yourself back up. As an operant, your dice are in the hand of fate.

This is espionage stripped of glamour—no parades, no happy endings – at least probably not for you.</li><li><strong>Failing Forward</strong> – In the life of an operant, failure is inevitable. Here, it’s another way forward – every misstep opens doors that success would run swiftly by.</li><li><strong>A Story-Rich Espionage RPG</strong> – From the studio which brought you <em>Disco Elysium</em>. Blending the psychological depth of a spy novel with surrealist undertones and richly drawn characters.</li><li><strong>A <a title="Companies > Question [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/question">Question</a> of Identity</strong> – Who are you when no one is watching? Or, at least, when you *think* no one is? In ZERO PARADES, the answer will define much more than just the assignment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live time, and that means <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s back and ready to dish out loads of gaming news and information. As part of the presentation, Keighley and the crew behind Opening Night Live took to the stage with brand-new trailers, announcements, reveals, and more, kicking off this year's Gamescom event in Germany. You'll find a complete list of everything announced during the showcase below.</p>
<p><strong>A new trailer for </strong><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7"><strong>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</strong></a></p>
<p>First up, there was a cinematic trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.de/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> Black Ops 7. The trailer, set in the year of 2035, showed a world under the grip of terrorism, where militarised police and soldiers take to the battlefield in both the real world and what appears to simulated, topsy-turvy versions of Los Angeles, Angola, Tokyo, Alaska, and somewhere called Avalon (a 'living, breathing space that evolves with the player', per the devs).</p>
<p>The trailer also seemed to tease some sort of Zombies mode called 'Arcade Zombies' which is a top-down, action-RPG style experience that'll be added to this year's CoD. You'll be playing as series veteran David Mason, who's deployed alongside the 'Guild', a tech-startup inspired group that apparently calls itself 'humanity's last stand'. Hm.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting thing about today's news is that Activision confirmed you'll be able to play the whole story either single-player or with up to three other people. There's an emphasis on freedom in this campaign, and that's when it comes to narrative, gameplay, movement, or whatever else. It certainly seems like a drastic move for the series, and I'm pretty intrigued.</p>
<p>More information will be revealed at Call of Duty Next, which takes place on 30th September. The game is set to launch for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-suggests-theres-still-no-nintendo-switch-2-version-at-launch">on 14th November 2025.</a></p>

<p><strong>Lords of the Fallen 2 gets a reveal trailer</strong></p>
<p>Next up, we got a cinematic trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</a>, a sequel to 2023's title by Hexworks and CI Games. It's dark fantasy through and through, with your armoured knight character going toe-to-toe with an angelic foe against the backdrop of a crumbling Medieval world. The game is set 100 years after the last one, as the barrier between the living and the dead begins to tear.</p>
<p>It'll also be "bloodier, faster, and more brutal than ever", promise the devs. We'll get more gameplay later this year.</p>

<p><strong>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is getting an anime</strong></p>
<p>Next up, Geoff <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-is-getting-an-anime-adaptation">showed off a trailer for Sekiro: No Defeat</a>. The anime is heading exclusively to Crunchyroll and is directed by Kenichi Kutsuna, with character design by Takahiro Kishida.</p>
<p>"We are taking on the monumental task of animating the breathtakingly beautiful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>. In doing so, we are pouring every ounce of our artistic vision and passion for beauty into its production," said Kutsuna. "The final product is being crafted to be a truly memorable experience, one that will leave a lasting impression on both dedicated fans of the game and those who are discovering the world of Sekiro for the very first time. Please look forward to it."</p>

<p><strong>Lego Batman returns with Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</strong></p>
<p>Lego Batman - not voiced by Will Arnett any more, apparently - returned with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-batman-is-back-in-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-and-its-out-next-year">goofy new Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, packed to the cowl with little references to the series at large: the Penguin, Joker, Catwoman, the Batmobile, Bane and more were there (and it sounds like Matt Berry is voicing Bane?!)</p><p>Per the developer, Legacy of the Dark Knight covers Bats' whole career, from Origins to legend. There's decades of lore here, and it looks like the studio has taken the best moments from games, comics, TV shows, and more in order to make a proper love-letter to the IP as a whole. I wouldn't expect anything less from the Lego games, though. You can also drive about an open-world Gotham in "your choice of Batmobile". Cool.</p>
<p>Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is being developed by TT Games, and there's a demo on the show floor. A release date was not mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>Dawn of War 4 announced, gets a cinematic trailer</strong></p>
<p>Warhammer is on a roll right now. Whether it's Rogue Trader or Space Marine 2, the IP is having a real moment both in miniatures and video games. Today, that strength continues, with a big (and pretty good-looking) new trailer for Dawn of War 4. We've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-announced-and-its-coming-from-a-surprise-new-developer-next-year">way more information on our dedicated page</a>.</p>
<p>Following the story of the Blood Marines, the cinematic trailer showed the marines dispatching enemies (Orks and Nekron, mostly) against the backdrop of that grimdark sci-fi universe that should be recognisable even to those that don't engage with Warhammer.</p>
<p>Dawn of War 4 is coming to PC in 2026.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.de/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a><strong> gets a Final Fantasy 14 crossover (and vice versa) </strong></p>
<p>It's no Seikret that everyone thought the ridable mount in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> felt a bit like a chocobo from the Final Fantasy franchise; a mountable bird that is intelligent and dangerous in its own right? It's basically IP theft! Well, go figure - both franchises are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-and-final-fantasy-14-are-collaborating">collaborating to bring a touch of Final Fantasy 14's Eorza to the world of Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p><p>After first collaborating with Monster Hunter World, this promises to be a large crossover. We're getting the chocobo skins for our Seikrets, sure, but we're also getting a new monster to fight in the form of Omega Planetes, a mechanised beast that shares the name of a series-long villain in the Final Fantasy series. We didn't see much about the fight during the show, but if the Behemoth in Monster Hunter World is anything to go by, it'll be pretty brutal.</p>
<p>This collaboration works both ways: FF14 will let you replace your mount with a Seikret, and it looks like the MMO will be introducing Arkveld (the 'end-game' baddy from MH Wilds) as an encounter. It'll most likely be a raid. I think you may also be able to turn your Palico into a Cactuar, too? That's the real highlight.</p>

<p><strong>More gameplay for </strong><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/onimusha-the-way-of-the-sowrd"><strong>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</strong></a></p>
<p>Next up, we had a trailer for Onimusha: Way of the Sword that showed off combat against your standard 'mob' enemies (including some lush swordplay and some bow-based combat) as well as a few boss encounters: if you're a fan of parries, you're going to love this. I have a full preview (hands-on!) coming for you tomorrow, so expect to hear more then.</p>

<p><strong>Daemon X Machina Titanic Scion gets a free Switch 2 demo</strong></p>
<p>Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion now has a free demo available for users on all platforms, but the one I'm most intrigued about is Switch 2. The demo is available to download now, allowing you to play through the first nine chapters of the story and roam the open world. That's pretty generous for a demo. Even better, all save data can be transferred to the full game when it launches on 5th September 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Fallout season two sets the world on fire, gets a proper release date </strong></p>
<p>So, we're going to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>. After dealing with a lot of 'family struggles' in their own right, the showrunners noted they wanted to send Lucy and the Ghoul to 'one of the most family friendly places on earth'. Will Lucy transform the Ghoul, or will the Ghoul transform Lucy? That's the core tension this season. The assembled actors and producers on stage also pushed a bit into Maximus' lore, and teased a journey for him as he steps gently into his role of a knight in the Brotherhood of Steel.</p><p>Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">Season 2</a> is diving more into New Vegas - a place explored well in the video game - we're also going to see some more crossovers with the game. So, say hello to Mr. House, as he appears in his human form. We even get a VATS-style slow-mo shot of Lucy shooting a gun, and our first glimpse of a Deathclaw as it appears in the show.</p>
<p>Fallout season two comes to Amazon Prime Video on 17th December, 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is coming to Switch 2</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will release on Nintendo's Switch 2 console next year, following the previously Xbox exclusive game's arrival on PS5 back in April.</p>
<p>We also got an update on the DLC - The Order of Giants - which is coming to Xbox Series X/S, Steam, and PS5 in September.</p>

<p>After this, we had the standard mid-show rush where a lot of stuff was announced all in one go:</p>
<p><strong>Deadpool VR</strong> is coming to Meta Quest 3 (launching in December), <strong>World of Tanks</strong> gets its biggest update ever with World of Tanks 2.0 (coming in September), we got a new trailer for <strong>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</strong> ahead of its release date in 'early 2026' (which had some of the best music in the whole show), and then Ron Gilbert - creator of Monkey Island and Manic Mansion - took to the stage.</p>
<p><strong>Death by Scrolling brings back an industry legend</strong></p>
<p>It's a vertically-scrolling RPG-cum-roguelike that sees you struggling through purgatory to stay one step ahead of the Grim Reaper herself. There are five playable characters with their own unique perks, and the gameplay looks like a mix of Vampire Survivors, Enter the Gungeon, and classic Zelda. Yeah, I'm sold.</p>

<p><strong>Studio ZA/UM shows off its first game since Disco Elysium</strong></p>
<p>A cinematic trailer is never really going to be able to capture what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> is, or can be, but let's put that aside for now as we look at ZA/UM's new game, Zero Parades. A trailer shows off concept art, a very small bit of gameplay, and some voiceover that promises to be as moody and cerebral as the original game. Described as an 'espionage RPG', you play as Hershel Wilk - or CASCADE - who has been sent on a mysterious assignment. You'll need to make the acquaintance of various people at the end of history, each with their own agendas.</p><p>Of course, most of the original developers have left the studio at this point, so any tie to Disco Elysium is more down to developer name than shared DNA. It's too early to tell what this game will be like, but, from the trailer, it seems ZA/UM is at least keeping the <em>vibe</em> alive. It's all about "failing forward", apparently. But I won't make a comment about that.</p>
<p>You can wishlist the game now on Steam.</p>

<p>Next was another block of little trailers. There was <strong>Unbeatable</strong>, a stunning looking game where "music is illegal, and you do crimes". It's an anime-inspired rhythm game that is developed by D-CELL Games and published by PlayStack. It's coming to Steam and consoles in November. We also saw trailers for a new anime gacha game, <strong>Neverness to Everness</strong>, and a boss battle for <strong>Honor of Kings World</strong>. These were followed by a new trailer for Delta Force, which launches today on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p><strong>Ninja Gaiden 4 gets a story trailer</strong></p>
<p>Platinum Games showed off a new trailer for Ninja Gaiden 4 that featured some bloody and intense gameplay, but also dipped a bit deeper into the story and lore of the new game. The most notable thing was probably the cybernetically enhanced skills that most of the ninja and enemies seemed to be rocking. But the real star of the show is the combat; fluid, bloody, and brutal. It looks good.</p>
<hr>
<p>Time for another sizzle reel. This time we got Cinder City and Time Takers. Both from NCsoft, this was our first-ever look at the gameplay for Time Takers, and it revealed a team-based third-person shooter which brings together a group of rogues from across time to fix their past. Standard. Think Overwatch x Apex Legends. Cinder City is your standard MMO fare, and lands on 21st October.</p>

<p><strong>Silent Hill f gets a brand-new trailer</strong></p>
<p>And just like that, we're in old Japan: alone, tiptoeing around some creepy wooden buildings. And then she's gone into some other dimension. Per the trailer, Suzie Yeung provides the English voice of the main character. And she wields a naginata to fend off the undead hordes that have come to drag her kicking and screaming into the underworld. It's all very Silent Hill, and we can learn more when we get our hands on the game on 25th September.</p>

<p>There'll be three biomes to explore on its initial debut, each including "unique enemies", so keep your wits about you. When players return from these biomes, there will be plenty of relics to then sell in Will's shop.</p>
<p>"Set prices, serve customers, customise your space, and experience most of the story - all built around an updated combat system featuring four main weapons, nearly 100 shop and dungeon perks, and a smoother, improved feel," the blurb reads.</p>

<p>Next up, we got confirmation that <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2'</strong>s Legacy of the Forge DLC will launch on 9th September. It's the second story DLC, and is included in the Expansion Pass, but will also be sold separately for base game owners. Also, Massive Monster and Devolver Digital's multi-million-selling cult simulator <strong>Cult of the Lamb</strong> got a massive update announcement in the form of Woolhaven: an ice-cold new paid expansion coming early 2026.</p>

<p><strong>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 finally shows signs of life</strong></p>
<p>The sequel to Troika Games' gothic cult classic RPG has been delayed and moved from studio to studio so often that you'd be forgiven for thinking it was long dead. But here, at Opening Night Live, it finally shows signs of life. Bertie knows far more about this than I do, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">so I will defer to him and his wonderful preview</a> to let you learn more.</p>

<p><strong>World of Warcraft: Midnight gets a classic Blizzard cinematic</strong></p>
<p>World of Warcraft got a new cinematic for its Midnight expansion, and it showed infamous shoe-disliker Xal'atath pulling up to the sunwell where the Blood Elves have been hanging around for over a decade. Lor'themar, married and happy, somehow didn't get his brains blown out live on the Gamescom stage.</p><p>Funnily enough Blizzard also announced <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-demon-hunter-specialization-revealed-embrace-the-void-with-devourer-378233">a new Demon Hunter specialisation</a>, and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-allied-race-for-midnight-announced-haranir-can-be-druids-378237">an allied race</a>, but these weren't shown off during the show itself for some reason. Midnight is coming out at some point in 2026, so get excited to do awful DPS and not get invited to your friends' raids soon!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei"><strong>Ghost of Yotei</strong></a><strong> promises free DLC for players in 2026</strong></p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei developer Sucker Punch has confirmed its highly anticipated sequel will be getting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-is-getting-its-own-co-op-legends-mode-as-free-post-launch-dlc">its own co-op-focused Legends mode</a> as free post-launch DLC sometime next year, including a "fantastical supernatural story and survival missions". It sounds like it'll be similar to Ghost of Tsushima's Legends mode, then, that was received pretty well and extended the gameplay - and sales-tail of the game - to a pretty impressive degree.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a><strong> delves into Grace Ashcroft's past</strong></p>
<p>Resident Evil: Requiem protagonist Grace Ashcroft got a bit of fleshing out in the latest trailer for Capcom's storied franchise, but there's still no sign of fan-favourite and series stalwart, Leon S. Kennedy. After receiving a phone call from a mysterious stranger, Grace Ashcroft and her mum panic and attempt to escape from the building they're staying in, only to witness a brutal murder as people chase the duo down.</p><p>It's all a bit of a teaser for the promise Capcom has made to return to the series' "overarching narrative", as we go a little closer to home and the origins of Raccoon City and the Umbrella Corp. There is more to come in my hands-on preview of the game, which drops tomorrow at noon.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on 27th February, 2026.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-game-announced-by-game-science-following-wukong-success"><strong>Black Myth: WuKong gets a sequel</strong></a><strong> in the form of Black Myth: Zhong Kui </strong></p>
<p>Black Myth: Zhong Kui will be an all-new follow-up, focused on the titular ghost-catching god who wanders between hell and earth. The developer clearly doesn't want to stray too far away from what has been successful in the past, as this newly-announced title will be another single-player action-RPG, rooted in Chinese folklore. If it ain't broke, as they say.</p>
<p>A brief teaser trailer was aired during Gamescom Opening Night Live, showing a couple of men hiding from a parade of mythical characters, including Zhong Kui himself, who was riding a giant tiger.</p>
<p>"Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design," say the developers in a Q&amp;A.</p><p>"Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets. And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong: the westward journey won't end here."</p>
<p>Black Myth: Zhong Kui has no release date yet, but promises to launch on PC and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Amazon have announced that Season 2 of Fallout will drop an episode a week, rather than all at once, which is how Season One arrived. The second season, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/20/fallout-season-2-confirmed-sony-paramount/">which was commissioned just a week after the first </a>had aired, finds Lucy (Ella Purnell), Ghoul (Walton Goggins), and Maximus (Aaron Moten) as they travel to New Vegas in an attempt to catch up with Lucy’s father, Hank (Kyle MacLachlan).</p>
<p>Moisés Arias returns as Lucy’s brother Norm and it will be interesting to see where his story goes, as at the end of Season 1, he discovered the real purpose of the Vaults.&nbsp; Barb, the Ghouls wife from his previous life, will also join the cast, and most excitingly, according to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32158505/?ref_=tt_eps_nx">IMDB, Dogmeat</a> will be in the show.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout – Season Two Teaser Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TsP09cZA7o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer reveals that fan favourite Mr. House will join the show, played by Justin Theroux, and he has a connection to Ghoul, or more specifically, Cooper Howard, the pre-war era actor who eventually became Ghoul. There is also a tease of a Deathclaw right at the end and lots of head popping gory action, just like the first series.</p>
<p>If you missed the first series, then we highly recommend it. You<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/11/fallout-season-1/">&nbsp;can check out my review here.</a> Season 3 has already been commissioned, so the story will continue.</p>

<p>The Fallout television series is canon within the franchise so Fallout 5, whenever that gets round to being made, may incorporate characters and locations from the show.</p>
<p>“Fallout is one of the greatest game series of all time,” said&nbsp; Jonathon Nolan during <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/02/fallout-tv-series-teased-by-amazon-studios-and-kilter-films/">the show’s 2020 announcement</a>. “Each chapter of this insanely imaginative story has cost us countless hours we could have spent with family and friends. So we’re incredibly excited to partner with Todd Howard and the rest of the brilliant lunatics at Bethesda to bring this massive, subversive, and darkly funny universe to life with Amazon Studios.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-science-announces-black-myth-zhong-kui-the-next-game-in-the-black-myth-series.1274994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-launch-scheduled-for-exactly-one-year-after-pc-ps5/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> developer Game Science has announced Black Myth: Zhong Kui, the next game in its Black Myth series, coming to PC and "<em>mainstream console platforms"</em> sometime in the future, as a specific release date was not announced.</p>



<p>On the game's <a href="https://gamesci.cn/zhongkui">official website</a>, Game Science makes a few things clear to Black Myth: Wukong fans who potentially have a flurry of questions in their minds about Zhong Kui.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Myth: Zhong Kui World Premiere Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zwYZ7xC2v80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Firstly, Zhong Kui is the next game in Game Science's Black Myth series, but it is not a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong. As to why Game Science isn't just rushing to show off Black Myth: Wukong 2, in an FAQ for Zhong Kui, it wrote, "<em>Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets.</em>"</p>



<p>The studio does also confirm that the choice to reveal Zhong Kui first doesn't mean it's the end for Wukong, as it closes by saying, "<em>And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong, the westward journey won't end here</em>."</p>



<p>But even though Game Science is debuting Zhong Kui before it shows off Wukong 2, it is also very clear in communicating that this game is very, very early in development. Regarding Zhong Kui's story, Game Science admits that it's "<em>not even done with the outline yet</em>," and also calls the project "<em>little more than an empty folder at this stage</em>." Which it explains is also why the debut trailer isn't gameplay, but instead just a CG short "<em>to let everyone know that a new project has kicked off</em>."</p>



<p>Even though by the sounds of that, we'll be waiting a long time to see any actual gameplay of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, it's exciting to get a look at what the studio is working on, and to know that there's more to come regarding Black Myth: Wukong. Hopefully, we'll have more concrete information soon on when Game Science is ready to release its next project.</p>

            <p>Fire up the geiger counter, the second series of Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV series</a> just showed off a trailer during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. It premieres on 17th December.</p>
<p>If it wasn't clear already, this chain of episodes is set to take us to NEW VEGAS. I said NEW VEGAS. That's NEW VEGAS, the setting of obscure 2010 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: NEW VEGAS</a>. Understand? I don't think you do, so let's all look over here while I point to this sign. It says Lucky 38, which is a casino in NEW VEGAS.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I doth protest this much because I'm a NEW VEGAS fan who's looking forward to taking in this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-tv-creators-saved-iconic-elements-for-season-2-so-it-doesnt-feel-like-they-just-skimmed-wikipedia">second series of Fallout</a> when it premieres in December. Ahead of that, this outing of it showed us The Ghoul and Lucy heading to New Vegas in pursuit of a certain someone (I won't say who, to avoid series one spoilers). Between the trailer and little chat actors Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten and the showrunners had with the Geoffman, we look to be getting a lot more of that Purnell/Goggins duo rubbing off on each other in series two, which sounds great to me.</p><p>They'll have to do a lot to pry my attention away from everyone's favourite preservation tube-dwelling Fallout billionaire, though. After popping in briefly in series one, NEW VEGAS' own Robert Edwin House looks to be playing a big role in series two. He and Walton Goggins' Cooper Howard are having plenty of pre-war chats, which see the suave, moustachioed House stare deeply into the Goggler's eyes while talking down to him just like he does to a certain videogame mailperson. Phwoar, Bob Residence. If you weren't a shrivelled prune by the time my character reached you, they'd have stabbed you through some bedsheets after a round or two, rather than that Benny.</p>
<p>Despite all the NEW VEGAS, I'm keen to see whether, with all of of its major characters all now set up and past the early stages of a playthrough when you're still convinced you're not gonna resort to speccing into speech, the series does anything major to take Fallout places it's not been. The likes of new factions or visits to locations the games haven't touched, just to spice up the big screening of things we know and love. Though, I'm aware that's something that I may well be in the minority on, given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fallout-tv-show-gave-the-fallout-games-a-huge-player-bump-as-everyone-remembers-they-like-fallout">massive popularity</a> of the first series.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Either way, odds are Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, and co will once again be the faces of a good post-apocalyptic adventure, and one that looks like it's leaning heavily into pre-war flashbacks of NEW VEGAS in all its glory.</p>
<p>That's NEW VEGAS, lest you forget amid your Silver Rush to get on Tops of all the other Gamescom Opening Night live news.</p>

<p>Game Science has dropped a tease at an expansion to the story of Black Myth: Wukong, confirming the Journey to the West is not over.</p>



<p>The title, which was released last year and is finally joining Xbox on August 20, was a breakout success for the studio, with many expecting DLC would be announced at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Instead, the finale of Gamescom Opening Night Live was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-zhongkui-revealed-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer for Black Myth: Zhong Kui</a>, a brand-new title from Game Science that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-myth-zhong-kui-a-sequel-to-black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong</a>—but more could be on the horizon.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-myth-wukong-journey-will-continue">Black Myth: Wukong Journey Will Continue</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to wait. Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a> for Black Myth: Zhong Kui, a series of questions and answers were shared about the development of the new title, with one stand-out entry concerning the decision to develop a brand-new game and not create a sequel for Black Myth: Wukong.</p>



<p>Explaining the decision, Game Science stated the aspiration to “take a tentative first step” to “build more game experiences,” “challenge ourselves with bolder features,” and “bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design.”</p>



<p>The key detail concerning Wukong, however, came right at the end with a message that said: “And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong, the westward journey won’t end here.”</p>



<p>It’s not clear whether the story from Wukong will continue in a new title as a direct sequel, or whether DLC is planned for the original title.</p>



<p>If the plan is for a direct sequel, that would likely come after the release of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, which itself is a long way off, considering development is in very early stages and “even Yocar himself has absolutely no idea” when a release will be.</p>



<p>Do you want to see DLC released for Black Myth: Wukong, or are you happy to wait for a direct sequel? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3347/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Later this month, NetEase is debuting a new game mode and a new map that brings Season 3's enemy, Knull, to the forefront.</p><p>The new map is located on Klyntar, the planet of the Symbiotes, and it's called Throne of Knull.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Survival horror fans have been treated to a new look at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> during <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/gamescom">Gamescom</a> 2025. The survival horror sequel, which made its debut during E3 earlier this year, will take fans of the franchise back to Raccoon City with a new lead protagonist at the helm.</p>
<p>A release for the upcoming title has been confirmed for February 27th, 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check out Capcom’s latest gameplay video.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Gamescom Gameplay Trailer | gamescom 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/19LGIQNmN4M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as Grace Ashcroft who – as RE law dictates – finds herself embroiled in an apocalyptic scenario that has players running a gauntlet of jump scares as they peel back layers of a grander conspiracy.</p>
<p>Much like Resident Evil 7, and Village, Requiem will feature first person gameplay and visuals powered by Capcom’s silky smooth RE Engine. Instead of being chased by the shambling undead, the Gamescom footage shows Grace and her mother escape the clutches of someone who appears to be a deranged serial killer. It’s definitely a change of direction for Resi though one that will no doubt loop back to the familiar tropes this series is known for, with fan favourite characters likely to make an appearance at some point.</p>

<p>While it hasn’t been confirmed, we’re also likely to see a demo. Both RE7 and Village gave fans a tantalising slither of gameplay to keep them sated, so let’s hope Requiem follows this trend.</p>

<p>During Gamescom's Opening Night Live showcase, it's been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> now has a free demo available for users on all relevant platforms, including the Switch 2.</p>
<p>It should be available for download by the time you're reading this, but if not, then just keep an eye out over the coming hours for an update to the Switch 2 eShop; it'll be there before you know it.</p>
<p>As for what you can expect, the demo will include the first nine chapters of the story, and will also allow you to freely explore the open world. Online co-op is also supported for up to three players via cross-play, and all save data can be transferred to the full game when it launches on <strong>5th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Titanic Evolution</strong> - <strong><em>Daemon X Machina</em></strong>’s high-octane armored action debuts on a new generation of platforms, bringing with it an epic sci-fi adventure, gameplay that’s accessible to newcomers, and an expanded scope sure to satisfy returning fans.</p>
<p><strong>Build a Better You</strong> - Now a nimble suit of armor, each Arsenal can be fully customized both in design and in loadout, with the ability to craft or salvage new elements.</p>
<p><strong>Together You Can Make a Difference</strong> - Cooperative and asynchronous multiplayer means players never truly fight alone. Team up with friends online to tackle the epic story and battles together.</p>
<p><strong>Beautiful and Deadly</strong> - Explore an alien planet in an Arsenal as players battle against mechanical and organic enemies. Trek through the vast open world on foot, fly through the skies, or when all else fails, gallop on horseback across plains, swamps, mountains, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We recently went hands-on with Titanic Scion and came away feeling pretty optimistic about the whole thing. Needless to say, while we'll reserve our full judgement until the game launches, we reckon you should keep an eye on this one.</p>

			<p>Ghost of Yotei is arriving on PS5 and PS5 Pro later this year on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">October 2, 2025</a>, and ahead of that launch at Gamescom ONL 2025, developer Sucker Punch Productions confirmed that the popular multiplayer Legends mode introduced in Ghost of Tsushima is also making its way over to Ghost of Yotei, with Ghost of Yotei Legends confirmed with a 2026 release window.</p>



<p>Just how Legends was free for Ghost of Tsushima players, it will also be free DLC for all owners of Ghost of Yotei when it eventually launches sometime next year.</p>

<p>"<em>Ghost of Yōtei Legends will offer two-player story missions and four-player survival matches. This time around, you’ll play as one of four character classes and try to defeat demonic, giant versions of members of the Yōtei Six, plus a variety of new enemies that fight alongside them,"</em> writes Andrew Goldfarb, senior communications manager at Sucker Punch in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/ghost-of-yotei-legends-dlc-is-coming-in-2026/">PlayStation Blog post.</a></p>



<p>The blog post also featured concept art of the enemies you'll face, which you can see here.</p>

<p>It's exciting to know that we'll be able to dig back into Legends following the main release for Yotei, which is coming in October. It's unfortunate that we have to wait until 2026 to check it out, and that even those in attendance at Gamescom ONL 2025 and the rest of the convention won't get a chance to play it this week.</p>



<p>Still, Legends was a surprise mode that fans of Ghost of Tsushima loved, and knowing that it'll be coming to Yotei further solidifies the next entry in Sucker Punch's 'Ghost' series as a true successor to Ghost of Tsushima.</p>

            <p>Remember the spy-themed game ZA/UM have settled into making after all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> drama? Well, unless they've got another espionagey cRPG in the works, Project C4 has gotten a new name in a cameo at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. It now seemingly goes by Zero Parades.</p>
<p>Yep, amid the waves of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-playable-disco-elysium-2-prototype-in-the-wilds-according-to-a-report-on-clashes-between-the-spiritual-successors">spiritual successors</a>, after all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-lawsuit-woes-continue-as-fired-devs-double-down-on-claims-of-fraud-at-studio-zaum">controversy around the exits of key team members</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">cancellations of Discoey things</a>, this is the thing those who remain at the studio have been working on. It looks and sounds very Disco Elysiumy.</p>

<p>The Keighleybot intrduced Zero Parades trailer as a "first look" at a spy RPG ZA/UM have been working on. Oh, you mean the spy game they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-it-all-disco-elysiums-original-studio-have-revealed-espionage-filled-new-game-c4">revealed earlier this year</a>, Project C4, I mouthed at the screen. Geoff didn't answer, or even mention the name Project C4. So, unless this is an example of spyish doubling up to confuse a foe, I assume the two must be one in the same.</p><p>Anyway, in Zero Parades, the name for which comes with a host of optional taglines including "Zero Parades for fake radicals", which given all that's happened with folks seen as radical ideasmiths leaving ZA/UM in the Disco aftermath feels maybe a bit cheeky. Anyway, in this game you play as an operant Hershel Wilk, alias CASCADE, who's described as being "brilliant, burnt-out, possibly cursed", as well as "an Anti-Icon". Hershel's also a woman, so modify the mental image of Harry Du Bois that description's inevitably given you a little bit. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863680/ZERO_PARADES/">Steam page</a> continues as follows:</p>
<blockquote>Five years ago you led your team into the abyss and have been haunted by your failures ever since. Now you've been recalled for a mysterious assignment that may give you a chance to prove yourself again. Find yourself thrown into a three-way struggle for cultural and ideological power, played out across an unforgettable new city. In Zero Parades, the world itself is a character with its own secrets, traumas, and miracles for you to discover.</blockquote>
<p>Much like in Project C4's reveal, a big thing's made of the fact you'll be failing a lot, and tha your failure will take you places via improvisation. Places that might not be as ideal, but that be how the dice are sometimes.</p>
<p>Zero Parades, or the artist that looks to be formerly known as Project C4, is currently without a release date. You can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863680/ZERO_PARADES/">here</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-protagonist-atsu-wolf-ps5-1851657667"><em>Ghost of Yōtei Legends</em></a> will bring multiplayer to Sony’s fall blockbuster, though not until next year. The cooperative online mode will arrive as free DLC sometime in 2026.</p> <p>For anyone unfamiliar with the mode from the original game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/im-going-to-play-the-shit-out-of-ghost-of-tsushima-s-ne-1845397850"><em>Legends</em> was a multiplayer spin-off for <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> that had players team up online to take down mythical challenges in a new series of story missions, fight off waves of enemies in a horde-like survival mode, or compete with other players to see who could rack up the highest score. There were character classes, difficulty ranks, and unlockable cosmetics. It was one of those multiplayer add-ons to a single-player adventure that was way better than it had any right to be.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ghost of Yōtei - &quot;Song of Vengeance&quot; Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FM08YoziYJs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/ghost-of-yotei-legends-dlc-is-coming-in-2026/">PlayStation Blog post</a> suggests things will work pretty much the same in <em>Ghost of Yotei Legends, </em>though this time the story missions will revolve around teaming up to take down members of the Yōtei Six, the main antagonists of the single-player campaign. They’ll be accompanied by new enemies, however, and presumably have other, more challenging tricks up their sleeves. The return of the survival mode is also confirmed, though it’s currently unclear if that will include the 2v2 contest option as well. It sounds like Sucker Punch will reveal more details once <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is out on October 2.</p> <p>The original <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> multiplayer mode was one of Sony’s more successful first-party forays into live-service content. Its popularity among fans made it seem like a slam dunk impressive enough to justify a full-blown standalone spin-off game. But despite the literal billions Sony has poured into trying to get a fleet of live-service games off the ground,<em> Legends</em> hasn’t been among the projects released or canceled, at least that we know of. If anything, the success of <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review-in-progress-difficulty-1851782700"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> proves there’s definitely players out there who want innovative co-op riffs on traditional single-player games. We’ll see if<em> Ghost of Yotei Legends</em> can satisfy some of that pent-up demand when it arrives next year.</p>
