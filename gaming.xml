			<p>The core survival-horror elements of Resident Evil Requiem have been showcased effectively in recent events (<a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-2025-awards-resident-evil-requiem-capcom/">such as Gamescom 2025</a>), but a crucial part of the experience, combat, has remained unseen until today. Unfortunately, the reveal wasn't accompanied by the confirmation all fans are waiting for: <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-first-trailer-hides-leon-campaign-clues-insider-claims/">the presence of Leon Kennedy in the game. </a></p>



<p>A few hours ago, new Resident Evil Requiem combat footage started making the rounds online. The short clip was shown in a series' special program which aired in Japan earlier today. This clip showcases a brand-new area and Grace fighting multiple zombies using a handgun in some third-person sequences that are highly reminiscent of Resident Evil 4. <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As known insider Dusk Golem</a> stressed, having aired on Japanese television, the footage was captured from a censored version of the game, so blood and gore should be as usual in the international version of the game.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One thing I'll clarify is since this aired on Japanese television, this is 100% the censored Japanese version. RE games get a "censored" version and a "Z-Rated" version released in Japan, things like headshots/dismemberment are always censored in the Japanese non-Z rated versions</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1996166803119349812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-leon-kennedy-speculation-continues">The Leon Kennedy Speculation Continues</h2>



<p>With the first Resident Evil Requiem combat footage not showing Leon Kennedy in action, the window for such a critical reveal is becoming tighter. </p>



<p>In the previous months, it was speculated that the protagonist of the second and fourth main entries in the series would be the focus of the game's combat elements, and revealing his presence alongside the combat mechanics would have made a lot of sense. Hopes haven't been dashed completely, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-leon-playable-demo/">game producer Masato Kumazawa recently addressed the rumors without denying them</a>, though, so there's still a chance the beloved character will be the second protagonist of Resident Evil Requiem alongside Grace Ashcroft.</p>



<p>No matter what, there's no denying that Resident Evil Requiem is looking great in the new footage. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">The new entry in the series felt really promising when I tried it out during this year's Gamescom</a>, and I look forward to delving deeper into the darkness when the game launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch on February 27.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-drops-next-month-brings-back-a-beloved-dark-souls-bumkicker">Forsaken Hollows expansion</a> arrives tomorrow, December 4th. Ahead of letting folks dive into Limveld's big hole and try out the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlcs-first-new-class-looks-great-for-book-nerds-and-grubby-old-men-lovers">new nightfarer classes</a>, FromSoft have lobbed out the customary big patch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This patch, 1.03, is out now and decently beefy. Looking through the notes, the studio have taken the opportunity to add a a fair amount of new features, with most being minor tweaks which make certain menus easier to parse, allow you to quickly check which relics you're rocking or how many flasks you've got left, and ensure personal objectives don't impede teaming-up. Some shop inventories have also been rearranged or added to.</p>
<p>Arguably the most noteworthy thing about the patch is that FromSoft have opted not to make nightfarer-specific tweaks as part of their latest round of balancing. Instead, stock changes to passive, special and relic effects have been drafted in, with melee attacks made more powerful, while dashing and rolling strikes have also been boosted. Meanwhile, effects that help negate damage when you're already at low health have been made less effective, which is bad news for less tanky builds.</p>
<p>Given the Forsaken Hollows is supposed to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-has-reignited-my-interest/1100-6536543/">slightly tougher cookie than the base game</a> anyway, you may want to go back to an old fashioned 'hit everyything with a big stick while cowering behind a tonne of armour plating' type of setup if you're keen to maximise your chances of not being forsakenly hollowed out.</p><p>Rounding out the patch are the usual bug fixes. FromSoft having "mitigated an issue where Sites of Grace or Churches would not activate and leveling up and adding charges to flask could not be performed under some conditions" is a welcome one. As is the rectifying of healing and enhancing effects not applying themselves to allies who happen to be busy dodging or unleashing their ultimate art.</p>
<p>You can check out the full notes rundown for the patch <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-103">here</a>. The Forsaken Hollows is set to release on PC at 11PM GMT today, December 3rd. That's 6PM EST and 3PM PST.</p>

            <guid>1371418</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>There’s a great 1st anniversary party happening for <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em>, and new players and longtime franchise fans are all invited. Two huge new events, three powerful new dolls—as anniversary celebrations go, this is a big one.</span></p>
<p><span>The fireworks begin on Nov. 27 with a massive overhaul of the Crew Deck, the launch of the <em>Deep Oblivion</em> and <em>Intertwined Assault</em> events, and the debut of new dolls Leva and Lenna. <em>Deep Oblivion</em> is a two-part event, with part 2 dropping on Dec. 18 along with Robella, the third new doll. There are also huge player rewards to be found, including more than 130 pulls and over 13,000 Collapse Pieces. Needless to say, this is an event <em>GFL2</em> fans will not want to miss, and a golden opportunity for new fans to step up and experience this global phenomenon.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2000646757" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646757"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646757">© Sunborn Games</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Inside the New Crew Deck</h2>
<p><span>The Elmo’s Crew Deck has been upgraded, and the brand-new gameplay is now live. In this updated space, Commanders will find not only fully realized 3D versions of the collectible cabinet and armory, but also a variety of new interactive story moments between Commanders and T-Dolls.</span></p>
<p><span>When the update goes live, Commanders will immediately find Makiatto’s exclusive story <em>Time Capsule: Pulse-Racing Night</em> in their inbox. If you already own Makiatto’s Embroidered Bamboo Blooming Shadows outfit, you can jump right into this free story. Klukai also gets in on the special features, with a Cerulean Breaker outfit (pictured above) that comes with a new Body Maintenance Technician item.</span></p>
<p><span>With more stories, outfits, and furniture for Commanders to invest in, the Crew Deck gets a little more homey and personalized with each addition. And with a brand-new holography function, players can actually embody select Dolls inside the Crew Dec, starting with Klukai, but with more to follow.</span></p>
<p><span>The Crew Deck is a completely new space, no longer just a menu, but an interactive showcase. Among the other anniversary-celebration innovations debuting on Nov. 27:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>3D Ornament Cabinet &amp; Armory</span></li>
<li><span>Memory Corridor for special scene collections</span></li>
<li><span>Crimson Arcade, a minigame zone</span></li>
<li><span>Interior decoration tools</span></li>
<li><span>Tea Break system to unlock extra interactions</span></li>
<li><span>Dreamscape, an atmospheric feature for additional world-building</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Loot, Loot, and More Loot</h2>
<p><span>Normally an anniversary party involves gifts being given to the celebrants. But for <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em>‘s big celebration, it’s the players who will be the ones on the receiving end of a staggering amount of free stuff.</span></p>
<p><span>Commanders who participate in the full season of events are in for a serious haul, including over 130 free pulls, over 13,000 Collapse Pieces, 2 free outfits, and a massive array of other upgrade materials, tokens, and Crew Deck bonuses. When the Crew Deck Date Reward arrives on Nov. 27, that’s stacked with </span><span>35 Outfit Access Permissions, </span><span>10 Access Permissions, an Elmo Model Ornament, 300 Collapse Pieces, and multiple other growth materials.</span></p>
<p><span>Other goodies include a free Dragon Chef outfit for Qiuhua available in the Glory Store, and an automatic unlocking of Springfield’s Enjoy the Fragrance. There are more Access Permissions available by completing daily missions, through mail rewards, furniture exchange, gift packs, and the seasonal Battle Pass.</span></p>
<h2>Don’t Miss the Live-Action Trailer</h2>
<p><span>Even with all of these updates, new Dolls, and massive rewards, another exciting part of the <em>GFL2</em> 1st anniversary celebration is a live-action trailer featuring the legendary 404 Squad. The video showcases the characters’ relaxed daily life on the Crew Deck, while also featuring intense combat action.You’ll see the 404 Squad engage in desert firefights and blackout industrial battles, with Humvees, Gatling guns, and a heavily armed helicopter aiding their cause.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2000646758" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646758"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646758">© Sunborn Games</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Even before this giant anniversary party, it’s easy to see how <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em> has become such a worldwide success. Whether you’re a <em>GFL2</em> veteran or you’re just hearing all the rave reviews now and want to see what it’s all about, it’s an awesome experience on PC, or mobile on both Android and iOS devices. Commanders, join in and celebrate the anniversary!</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Horses Is The New Viral Horror Game Banned On Steam & Epic Games Store]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/horses-is-the-new-viral-horror-game-banned-on-steam-epic-games-store/</link>
            <guid>1371412</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Horses was banned at the final hour by Steam and the Epic Games Store due to the game’s unsettling and controversial content, but you can still buy the viral horror title.</p>



<p>The initial premise of Horses seems quite simple: You’re on a two-week break working at a farm. You perform standard tasks, such as feeding the farmer’s dog and tending to the ‘horses.’ It becomes quickly apparent that they aren’t normal horses, and the game quickly descends into a host of horrifying and inhumane themes.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-deals-holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and Epic didn’t like this much.</p>







<h2 id="h-you-can-still-buy-horses-elsewhere">You Can Still Buy Horses Elsewhere</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Yes, a carrot. Credit to Santa Ragione Game Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>Mere hours before its launch, <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Horses</a> was banned from Steam and the Epic Games Store. If anything, this has furthered the game’s profile with people desperate to understand why.</p>







<p>Take a look at this content warning on the Horses website to get an idea of what to expect:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This game contains scenes of physical violence, psychological abuse, gory imagery (mutilation, blood), depictions of slavery, physical and psychological torture, domestic abuse, sexual assault, suicide, and misogyny.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Insider Gaming has seen lots of the game’s footage and the aforementioned content—it’s just as perturbing and disturbing as you can imagine. The Epic Games Store says Horses is still “Coming Soon,” but you don’t have to wait, as the horror game is available to buy on GOG. </p>



<p>The ban decisions could be overturned in the future, especially if Santa Ragione Game Studio fights back, and popularity in the title explodes. Insider Gaming will continue to monitor Horses’ status.</p>



<p>If you’ve played Horses, now’s your chance to share. Is the full game as psychologically damaging as it’s made out to be? Was Steam and the Epic Games Store right to ban it?

            <guid>1371409</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An artist whose art was stolen by Bungie’s Marathon has now claimed that the issue with Bungie and Sony has been resolved to her satisfaction.</p>



<p>The news came more than six months after the artist took to <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to say that Bungie had used the assets she created in 2017 without permission. Back then, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/artist-accuses-bungie-of-plagiarizing-work-for-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she claimed</a>, “The Marathon alpha released recently, and its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017.”</p>



<div><p>The claim was almost immediately picked up by Bungie, who said,</p><p>“We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game.</p></div>



<p>This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred. We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to @4nt1r34l to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist.</p>



<p>As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission.</p>



<p>To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions.</p>



<p>We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.”</p>



<div><p> But now, the issue has been fully resolved, with the artist saying,</p><p>“The Marathon art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.”</p></div>



<p>As to the extent the issue was resolved, that will likely never be shared, but Sony and Bungie have seemingly gone to great lengths to ensure the artist has been fully compensated and/or reached an agreement. </p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon is scheduled to release by the end of this fiscal year (by April 1st, 2026).</p>



<p>What do you think the artist got to resolve the issue? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Official Discord Server</a>.</p>

IGN Japan was in attendance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Monster Hunter Wilds was first released on February 28, some players left harsh feedback, but Tokuda said the team worked to improve the game by taking advantage of that feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Immediately after the release, we apologized for the inconvenience caused by the volume of content and the difficulty level. Despite this, we were delighted to receive various awards, including Users' Choice awards. We would like to thank all the players who have given their opinions and spoken warm words even in this situation. The development team was able to turn everyone's feedback into an asset and work on the update with all our strength, and I think the result was also the reason why players voted for us," said Tokuda.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/img-3587-1764763663206.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yuya Tokuda (left) and Ryozo Tsujimoto (right) at the PlayStation Partner Awards 2025 Japan Asia held in Tokyo on December 3. Image credit: IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Monster Hunter has the characteristics of a title that gets regular updates, but player opinions were very helpful during the update process, and in order to make Monster Hunter Wilds better, the fans’ voices gave us power. There are still updates left to come, so we will continue to do our best," added Tsujimoto.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Monster Hunter series celebrated its 20th anniversary last year. The franchise was a hit in Japan, and after the release of Monster Hunter: World in 2018, it grew into a literal monster title overseas. According to Tokuda, the Monster Hunter Wilds team were more aware than ever of being accepted by newcomers or those who had trouble beating the games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We analyzed what kind of places beginners were stuck in, including Monster Hunter: World. We have worked on these points in turn to make it easier for new users to clear hurdles such as being able to reach certain monsters or to craft certain types of armor. In addition, we have tried to adopt as many new elements as possible that are beneficial for both beginners and existing users, such as Focus Mode. This time, as a result of making the game easy to beat even for new players and players who could not clear it before, I think the difficulty curve was a little lacking for existing users,” said Tokuda. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda said the team has focused on creating more difficult content with each update. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you beat the game immediately after its release and stopped playing, I would appreciate it if you could pick it up again," said Tokuda.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds still has updates to come, but Tsujimoto also talked a little about the future of the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, we don’t intend to stop the series here. We plan to continue, and we want to let more people play. In addition, I would like to think about things beyond the games so that we can further expand the potential of the Monster Hunter IP," said Tsujimoto.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All Low Rank Armor in Monster Hunter Wilds</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From Tsujimoto's remarks, it seems we can continue to look forward to new games and more in the Monster Hunter series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tsujimoto was also asked where Monster Hunter stands within the overall catalog of Capcom IP, which he answered diplomatically. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Capcom is a company with various IPs, and every IP is very important. I'm in charge of Monster Hunter now, that’s all I can comment on, but as Capcom, we want to expand all our IPs,” he said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom is scheduled to release Resident Evil Requiem, Onimusha Way of the Sword, and Pragmata in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>"After 18 years of waiting, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond manages to replicate that magical sense of discovery from the GameCube original while pushing the series in some incredible new directions," we wrote in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 9/10 review</a>, describing Samus' latest adventure as "quite possibly the boldest, most well-realised Metroid game to date".

            <guid>1371382</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> update 1.4.0, making a big bunch of changes and bug fixes to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2’s</a> biggest game.</p>
<p>Amongst the changes are a new custom items rule setting, which lets you pick exactly which items appear in your game – this is really handy for anyone chasing the last few Kamek transformation character!</p>


<p>There’s also an improved way to join up and play multiplayer with friends, as up to four players gathered together in a “Room” can all take part in Race, Knockout Tour and Battle, and you can also join people playing Knockout Tour when in 2P and Online as well.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also changed the course layout for eight of the Intermission style point-to-point races involving Koopa Troopa Beach. All the races heading there will now have two laps of Koopa Troopa Beach once you get there. We hope this is a sign of more changes to come!</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Mario Kart World update 1.4.0:</p>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added “Custom Items” to the item rules.
<ul>
<li>This is a feature that lets you set which items appear.</li>
<li>This is supported in “VS Race”, “Balloon Battle”, “Coin Runners”, and “Room” in “Online Play” or “Wireless Play”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Made it so that music track name and source title of the track that is playing will be displayed on the Pause Menu.</li>
<li>Added “Music Volume” to “Settings/Controller”.</li>
<li>Made it so players who gathered in a “Room” of “Online Play” can participate in “Race”, “Knockout Tour”, and “Battle”.
<ul>
<li>Up to 4 players can participate in “Race”, “Knockout Tour”, and “Battle”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Made it so you can join in with friends who are playing “Knockout Tour” from “Friends” in “2p”, “Online Play” as well.</li>
<li>Added “Restart” and “Next Race” in the Pause Menu for “VS Race” in “Single Player”.</li>
<li>Made it so you can select “Photo Mode” from the Pause Menu in “Race against Ghost” in “Time Trials”.</li>
<li>Changed the course layout of below courses for “VS Race”, or “Race” in “Online Play” or “Wireless Play”.
<ul>

<li>You will now dash when riding on Manta Ramp’s back.</li>
<li>Made it so the player will not hit Dragoneel when transformed into Bullet Bill.</li>
<li>Made it so the player cannot use a second Boo while already using a Boo, when holding two Boos.</li>
<li>When Dash Food is taken by someone, shortened the time until that Dash Food reappears.</li>
<li>When a coin placed on water is taken by someone, shortened the time until that coin reappears.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the dash time was not correct after a Charge Jump.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player would slip through a wall when being stomped on from above by a vehicle driving on the road.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a player would be squashed when touching a Thwomp that had landed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a Bullet Bill would not be displayed after using it.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a character would be blurry even when making “Focus” “Character” when taking a photo in “Photo Mode” on the Pause Menu.</li>

            <p>Valve’s quiet bankrolling of open-source emulation tools could make it heaps easier to play your PC games library on a humble smartphone, though it sounds like Gabe-made SteamOS phones are unlikely to be joining the company’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">growing hardware catalogue</a>. In an interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/820656/valve-interview-arm-gaming-steamos-pierre-loup-griffais">The Verge</a>, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed that they’ve been funding the development of Fex – a free compatibility tool that gets Windows apps functioning on mobile ARM processors – since well before revealing the ARM-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> standalone VR headset.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Valve's bundling Fex into SteamOS so the Frame, due in 2026, can run Steam games straight off the headset’s internal chip. But it is already out in the wild right now – i.e. <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX">GitHub</a> –, and has a promising future in bringing those very same games to Android phones. Just not, Griffais says, phones with a Steam logo on them.</p>
<p>"I don’t know if that’s going to be a big focus for us to develop local content or try to develop SteamOS for devices like that" he explains. "I mean, I’m not discounting any possibility, but I think with just living room, handheld, and desktop, trying to have a good outcome for gaming applications and everything else you’d want to do in a desktop, we have a ton of work to do."</p>
<p>The living room and handheld formats clearly refer to, respectively, the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a> and the existing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>. But these are both based on x86 processors, much like a regular Windows PC or laptop. It’s ARM hardware, the diesel to x86’s unleaded, that Fex and the Frame are trying to crack – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-just-works-valve-talk-the-steam-frame-android-games-on-steamos-and-putting-a-pc-on-your-face">with at least some success</a>, judging by the slickness with which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> ran on the Frame when I tried it at Valve’s offices last month.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Steam phone or no, Fex may fulfil that promise of Steam games on mobile. It is, for instance, one of multiple x86 emulation layers employed by <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaoji.egggame&amp;hl=en_GB">Gamehub</a>, an Android game launcher app produced by Chinese peripheral makers GameSir. I’ve tried this on my Pixel 9 and admittedly haven’t had much luck, even with the games I know work well on the Steam Frame: Hades 2 crashes immediately and Silksong gets stuck on an endless launching screen. Also, there’s a non-zero possibility that I’ve handed over my Gmail and Steam account details to the Chinese Communist Party. C'est la vie. You <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gamehub">don’t have to look far</a>, mind, for folks who’ve used Gamehub to get Androidified Steam games up and running, including the author of that Verge piece.</p><p>Hopefully this cross-device compatibility push continues apace; Valve obviously have a business interest in getting Steam games (uhhhh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">sorry Horses</a>) playable on as many computery doohickeys as possible, but kicking down compatibility barriers and spreading software across devices of the user’s choosing is good for the common gamesplayer as well.</p>

            <guid>1371376</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="96" data-end="911">Making progress in any sport really comes down to knowing your numbers. If you want to improve, you need a solid idea of what you’re working toward and a convenient way to keep an eye on it. Whether you’re just getting into running and hitting your favorite trails, jumping in open water for triathlon training, or biking some hills, a reliable GPS watch can make all the difference. It helps you stay motivated, stay on track, and avoid losing steam. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6183/">Conveniently, Samsung’s newly released 2025 version of its smartwatch—the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic—is still on sale post Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a>. This watch normally goes for $500, but right now you can grab it for 20% off, bringing it down to $400. You end up saving yourself a whole $100.</p>
<p data-start="96" data-end="911">Now this is the Classic model of the Watch 8. What’s different about it? First up, it’s much bigger. The standard models come in either 40mm or 44mm. This watch face measures across at 46mm. But more noticeable that that, the watch has a metal casing. The new lug system allows for easy band detachment and replacement. So when you’re not working out, this watch maintains a professional work you could even pair nicely with a suit. Then when it’s time to hit the pavement in your running attire, swap out the band for a silicone one, easily.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6183/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="913" data-end="946">A Fitness Coach on Your Wrist</h2>
<p data-start="948" data-end="1552">The Galaxy Watch 8 runs on Samsung’s Galaxy AI platform, which helps it deliver smarter health and fitness tracking. Whenever you head out for a ride, run, hike, or any sort of outdoor workout, the watch can keep tabs on how you’re performing in real time and compare it to your past sessions. Throughout the day, it can nudge you with personalized wellness suggestions to help you steadily move toward your fitness and health goals. The improved heart-rate tracking is also a big upgrade. It filters out the noise from natural body motion, giving you a more accurate reading than previous Samsung watches.</p>
<p data-start="1554" data-end="1991">Your sleep gets just as much attention. The Watch 8 tracks your patterns closely enough to flag possible signs of sleep apnea and gives you a much clearer look at how well you’re actually resting each night. When you wake up, you get a quick snapshot of your energy level and readiness for the day. It combines details like your sleep score, steps, heart-rate behavior, and more to give you a realistic picture of where your body stands.</p>


<p data-start="1993" data-end="2450">Of course, it’s not just about fitness. The Galaxy Watch 8 works great as a full-blown smartwatch for everyday life. You can read and respond to messages straight from your wrist without fishing your phone out of your pocket. And if it’s paired with your phone, the watch becomes a remote camera controller—perfect for group shots or selfies at a distance. You can change settings, hit the timer, and take the picture all from the watch.</p>
<p data-start="2485" data-end="2997">The new Watch 8 can hit up to 3,000 nits, while the Watch 7 maxes out at 2,000 nits. That extra brightness makes a big difference when you’re checking stats under direct sunlight. Both models are still tough enough for all-weather training, whether you’re out in the cold, the rain, or the heat.</p>
<p data-start="3279" data-end="3522"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6183/">The Galaxy Watch 8 is also designed from the ground up to work with Gemini, the AI assistant built by Samsung and Google</a>. You can use it to check your schedule, reply to texts, set reminders, and handle a bunch of everyday tasks with ease.</p>

            <p>Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii has said he "can't talk about" future plans for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, suggesting something is indeed in the works.</p>
<p>Though best known for Dragon Quest, Horii was a supervisor on the celebrated Chrono Trigger, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">celebrating its 30th anniversary this year</a>.</p>
<p>During Horii's latest talk show livestream KosoKoso Hōsō Kyoku, he was asked about current buzz surrounding Chrono Trigger and whether this was "foreshadowing" a bigger announcement (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chrono-triggers-original-supervisor-yuji-horii-says-i-cant-talk-about-it-dont-ask-and-ill-get-in-trouble-when-asked-about-new-developments/">Automaton</a>).</p>

<p>Horii was also joined by former editor of Shonen Jump Kazuhiko Torishima, who noted a number of Chrono Trigger-related projects that were previously announced, including a concert series planned for next year. Torishima asked Horii if there would be any developments in the franchise.</p><p>"I can't talk about that," said Horii, becoming flustered. He added: "Wait, if I say that, you'll figure it out!", "Don't ask!", "Asking is off-limits!", and "I'll get in trouble!", to which the panel collectively laughed. Torishima cheekily replied: "There's something".</p>
<p>It would seem, then, there's at least something in the works, even if Horii remains tight-lipped on any details.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> acknowledged the 30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger earlier this year, stating it would launch "various projects that go beyond the world of the game over the next year to express our gratitude to everyone who has played Chrono Trigger so far."</p>
<p>Of course, fans speculated a remake or re-release could be in the works, though there's been nothing official on this. Horii's latest comments are certainly fueling the fire, however.</p>
<p>Still, there are plenty of other projects inspired by Chrono Trigger you can check out: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-clockwork-dlc-will-release-later-this-month">Sea of Stars received DLC</a> earlier this year, while future games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-a-french-made-rpg-that-takes-inspiration-from-japanese-rpgs-and-was-actually-made-by-a-team-of-30-edge-of-memories-should-scratch-that-itch">Edge of Memories</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-chrono-trigger-celebrates-30th-anniversary-spiritual-successor-threads-of-time-gets-fresh-gameplay-trailer">Threads of Time</a> are heavily inspired by Square Enix's classic.</p>

            <p>
Well-received horror game No Players Online has returned to Steam after nearly three weeks of unavailability, which its developer Beeswax Games has blamed on an "unfounded" DMCA takedown notice filed by a "former friend".
</p>
<p>
No Players Online is a narrative adventure in which players explore the files of a '90s desktop PC in order to uncover the secrets of a long-abandoned shooter. It started life as a short Game Jam title in 2019, garnering positive critical attention and something of a cult following - and an expanded reimagining was launched for Steam at the start of November. Not long after, keen-eyed horror fans began noticing it had disappeared, with Beeswax Games initially appearing unsure why, and promising to "figure out what's going on".

<p>
Three weeks on, Beeswax Games has announced No Players Online's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701800/No_Players_Online/">return to Steam</a>, shedding some light on the reason for its initial disappearance. "[The game] was removed from steam for nearly three weeks right after launch, following a DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) claim made by a former friend," the studio explained in a <a href="https://noplayersonline.net/statement">message shared on its website</a>. "They claimed to be a co-author of the game despite not having done anything for it. No Players Online was made completely from scratch by our team."
</p><p>
Beeswax, which counts the 2019 game's trio of creators - Adam Pype, Tibau Van den Broeck, and Viktor Kraussays - among its number, say the unnamed individual "recklessly filed the DMCA to Steam without any notice", resulting in the game's removal a little over a week after launch. "We immediately filed a counter-notice," it continued, "and today the game has been reinstated after the time for them to respond has passed."
</p>
<p>
"It's crazy to me that someone can just take down our game by filling out a simple form," it added. "It's been tough trying to reconcile with this betrayal from someone I considered a dear friend." Beeswax doesn't detail the specifics of the disagreement, only saying it attempted to offer clarity to the claimant prior to the filing that "their allegations were completely unfounded".
</p>
<p>
"This situation has had a significant impact on us," it continued, "especially given how crucial the first months after release are for small indies like us." The studio says it spent a "ton of money" over the two and a half years it took to complete No Players Online, and that its temporary removal from Steam means it "lost out on much needed momentum and revenue". As a result, Beeswax is "unsure if [it] will be able to recover financially" given its "already thin margins", and says the future of the studio is uncertain. However, it remains "committed to doing all that we have planned still for No Players Online".
</p>
<p>
DMCA copyright claims have proven highly controversial over the years, given the ease with which they can be abused. In 2023, for instance, Soviet city-builder game Workers &amp; Resources was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soviet-city-builder-game-taken-off-steam-due-to-nonsense-dmca-strike-from-rogue-fan">temporarily pulled from Steam</a> following a "nonsense" DMCA notice from an angry fan, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> studio Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-files-lawsuit-against-individuals-behind-false-destiny-copyright-takedowns">launched legal action against a disgruntled YouTuber in 2022</a>, accusing them of maliciously filing fraudulent takedown notices against other content creators in retaliation for a DMCA filing by Bungie's own team.

            <p>A senior developer who worked on Larian's much loved and critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has moved studios, and is now working with Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk studio CD Projekt Red.</p>
<p>Senior developer Felix Pedulla worked at Larian for six years on the cinematic side of the team, before announcing his departure this week. He called his time at the Baldur's Gate 3 studio an "incredible" and "frankly wild" ride.</p>

<p>"I'm so grateful for every chaotic, creative, and unforgettable moment we shared. We made some serious magic together, and I'll forever cherish the lessons and memories," Pedulla wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fedulla_newjob-careergrowth-gamingindustry-activity-7401304661347172352-uP_M/">LinkedIn</a>. "A huge thank you to all my incredible colleagues and friends I made."</p>
<p>The developer has now moved to CD Projekt Red, where he will "trade in [his] <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> dice for some Polish steel" as the company's new senior cinematic designer. It's time to "get to work crafting some epic cutscenes," Pedulla closed.</p><p>While the cinematic designer did not say which of CDPR's games he would be working on, it is fair to assume that he will be lending his talents to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. Just last month, it was confirmed some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-bolsters-the-witcher-4-team-with-key-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-talent">key Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 development talent had also made the jump to CD Projekt and Ciri's new adventure</a>.</p>

<p>As for The Witcher 4, its<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star"> first trailer was revealed at last year's The Game Awards</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-not-at-the-game-awards-this-year">don't expect it to show up again this year</a>.</p>
<p>We got another look at the next Witcher game in-action back in June. The team did caveat though, that though that particular demo may have looked like gameplay, it was actually a representation of what the tech could do, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">wasn't actually representative of the final game</a>. The performance seen during said tech demo is what the game is aiming for, however. At this time, the studio also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4s-northern-setting-revealed-in-new-unreal-livestream">showed off the northern setting for The Witcher 4</a>.</p>

<p>Well that's not suspicious at all!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8cd734bd57d33"><a title="Chrono Trigger" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8cd734bd57d33/chrono-trigger.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>11th March 2025 marked the 30th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>. Square Enix marked the occasion by announcing that "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/chrono-trigger-to-celebrate-30th-anniversary-with-various-projects">various projects</a>" would be coming our way over the next year, but so far, those projects have been limited to character popularity polls and planned orchestral concerts. Importantly, that's <em>not</em> the remake that we all want to see and have been chatting about for years. But we're still not ready to completely throw out all hope just yet.</p>
<p>You see, in the latest episode of the '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq1II1jaiuA&amp;t=6628s">KosoKoso Hōsō Kyoku</a>' talk show livestream (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chrono-triggers-original-supervisor-yuji-horii-says-i-cant-talk-about-it-dont-ask-and-ill-get-in-trouble-when-asked-about-new-developments/">Automaton</a>), <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> creator and Chrono Trigger supervisor Yuji Horii attempted to keep his lips sealed about where the series is heading — but in saying nothing, has he actually said <em>everything</em>?</p>
<p>"I can't talk about that," Horii-san told the interviewer when asked whether the smaller anniversary events might be "foreshadowing" bigger developments down the line. He jokingly added clarifying statements like, "Wait, if I say that, you'll figure it out!," "Don't ask!," and "I'll get in trouble!" before the panel decided to move on with the show.</p>
<p>Hmmm. It's far from anything concrete, and there's every chance that Horii-san was genuinely just trying to get himself out of a sticky situation, but we can't help feeling that the whole thing is a <em>little</em> suspicious. Hey, perhaps it's just wishful thinking on our end.</p>
<p>Back in May, it seemed like Horii-san might have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/oops-yuji-horii-may-not-have-leaked-massive-remake-news-after-all">let the news of an upcoming remake slip</a> during a panel at Napoli Comicon. However, it later turned out that it was just the translator bringing up the series, not Yuji Horii himself. <em>D'oh</em>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the best way to officially play Chrono Trigger remains the wonderful 2008 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/chrono_trigger">DS port</a>, which'll set you back a pretty penny if you try to pick it up on the resale market today. It has arrived on mobile and Windows in the years since, but come on, we all want to see it on Switch (2), right?</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:193538,177779,188142 @ 1764765945 -->

            <p>
A few weeks ago, developers Beeswax Games released a "spiritual successor" to 2019 freeware game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-players-online">No Players Online</a> on Steam. If you've not played the old freeware project - <a href="https://papercookies.itch.io/no-players-online-classic">still available on Itch</a> - it's one of those haunted software jobbies that accentuate the eerieness of elderly 3D simulation tech, and in this case, abandoned FPS multiplayer maps. I was looking forward to playing the successor. But then, spookily, the Steam page vanished. And now, spookily, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701800/No_Players_Online/">it's back</a>. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
According to Beeswax, the game was hit by a Digital Millennium Copyright Act claim filed by a "former friend" who "claimed to be co-author of the game despite not having done anything for it". Valve then took the game down on 13th November, a week after release. The developers filed a counter-notice, and Valve have now reinstated the Steam release after the complainant neglected to respond to that counter-notice in time.
</p>
<p>
You can read developer Adam Pype's full account of events <a href="https://noplayersonline.net/statement">here</a>. It doesn't name the "former friend", and I'm not going to speculate about their identity. Pype says the upheaval has cost the project dearly, writing that "we spent 2 and a half years of our lives and a ton of money making this game. we also have a lot of people who believed in us and wanted us to succeed. it's crazy to me that someone can just take down our game by filling out a simple form, and it's been tough trying to reconcile with this betrayal from someone i considered a dear friend."
</p>
<p>
Pype continues that "this situation has had a significant impact on us, especially given how crucial the first months after release are for small indies like us. we lost out on much needed momentum and revenue right after the release of our game and we're unsure if we will be able to recover financially from this given our already thin margins."
</p><p>
I haven't been keeping up with latest happenings in DMCA-land, but this particular legal institution has attracted much criticism for being easy to abuse. Back in 2017, Alice O (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/river-city-ransom-underground-pulled-from-sale-following-copyright-claims">reported</a> on the yoinking from sale of River City Ransom Underground, commenting that DMCA filings "don't require that the accuser offer proof that they hold the rights, putting the burden of time and effort (and sometimes money) on the accused". More recently in 2023, a community guide writer had ace city-builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/workers-resources-soviet-republic">Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/workers-resources-soviet-republic-is-back-on-steam-after-a-dmca-strike-from-disgruntled-player">removed from Steam for a month or so</a>, after developers 3Division added a mode that seemingly took a little inspiration from the writer's work.
</p>
<p>
Natalie Clayton <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-players-online-offers-free-spooks-on-the-empty-servers-of-a-dead-multiplayer-game">had a rare old time</a> with No Players Online back in 2019. "No Players Online sees me, booting up old games, looking for that sweet nostalgia kick, and suggests that maybe I let dead things stay buried," she wrote. These cautionary sentiments notwithstanding, I'm thankful that the spiritual successor has escaped the grave of DMCAing. It expands on the freeware game's premise with a faux-90s desktop interface and a bunch of different, presumably cursed games to download from various not-forums.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> won't be getting the final update devs Obsidian had planned for this year. Instead the studio have opted to save putting out the new game plus mode they'd planned for this autumn for a big update to make the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s first birthday in February. To make up the extra wait, the anniversary update'll be adding some mystery extra bits alongside the already announced features.</p>
<p>The autumn patch was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-latest-update-comes-with-community-requested-features-lots-of-tweaks-and-a-promise-of-a-roadmap">originally set</a> to be the third update delivered to the nature-rific blunderbuss adventure this year. The last one to arrive was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-summer-update-revamps-fighter-and-ranger-skills-so-those-pesky-wizards-arent-having-all-the-fun">the summer update</a>, which aimed to round out the fighting skills of non-magic users so that wizards weren't having all of the fun.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now, though, the roadmap has been remapped. No autumn update shall exist, with Obsidian having <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1995917924708876634">announced</a> that they're shifting efforts to "a larger update coming next February, timed with the anniversary of the game’s release". As such, stuff like new game plus, a photo mode, and a new type of weapon will now be arriving around February 18th, having been delayed from their original slot.</p>
<p>As someone who really should get around to replaying Avowed now some time's passed, I'm pretty happy to be able to leave thinking about doing so via new game plus next year, given how packed December always is. The photo mode'll also be a cool addition, given Avowed's vibrant natural scapes are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-verdict-avowed">one of the areas</a> in which it really sung. They'll have to pry my arquebus out of my cold, dead mushroom hands to get me to try the new kind of weapon, though.</p><p>Some character customisation additions have also been pushed from this year to the anniversary update. These include the ability to switch up your appearance within the world, as well as more presets for characters and their Godlike features. The Godlike features for the uninitiated, are the mushrooms and bits of wood you can slap across your envoy's face to show that they are the mystical nature-person of legend.</p>
<p>Alongside those announced bits, Obsidian added that you can expect some surprise "additional features" that'll fleash out the anniversary update to make it the game's biggest yet. My money's on a giant mushroom you can peel off your face, then mount to fly around Eora. Or throw at enemies like a pizza-shaped fungi boomerang. Either that or some sort of Outer Worlds 2 crossover which sees the citizens of fantasyland have to fight off an invasion of corporate types whose leader <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2s-faction-writing-falls-short-of-fallout-new-vegas-and-how-it-handles-the-powerful-is-key">the writers feel a bit sorry for</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Every bit of new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay is welcome. So, while it’s a bummer that exclusive Resident Evil Requiem gameplay was shown off in Japan, a video has been shared, showcasing the intriguing footage.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem adds to what is already a ridiculous 2026 for gaming. Capcom’s newest survival horror entry in the genre-defining franchise puts Grace Ashcroft in the hot seat. It’s already been revealed how <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-reveal-how-grace-differs-from-previous-protagonists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grace differs from previous protagonists</a>, but seeing her in action is a treat—as shown in a new gameplay clip.</p>







<h2 id="h-exclusive-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-revealed">Exclusive Resident Evil Requiem Gameplay Revealed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shocking. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>The ever-reliable <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dusk Golem</a> shared a video showing “new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay of a new area with Grace fighting a zombie in the Resident Evil special program that aired on Japanese television.”</p>







<p>A 34-second video shows the new ability to flick between first-person and third-person, and shows Grace battling off zombie threats with a pistol. The gameplay looks infinitely more horrible, claustrophobic, and terrifying in first-person, which would explain why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-has-a-third-person-camera-because-resident-evil-7-was-too-scary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 9 has a third-person camera</a>.</p>



<p>The indoor environment certainly looks new, and nothing we’ve seen already in any previous gameplay footage or teaser trailers.</p>



<p>Dusk Golem clarifies that because it’s a Japan-only advert, meaning it’s “100% the censored Japanese version.” It still features blood and gory effects, but presumably to a far lesser extent than we’ll see in the full release.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There was some new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay of a new area with Grace fighting a zombie in the Resident Evil special program that aired on Japanese television. <a href="https://t.co/FToPeqi4HW">pic.twitter.com/FToPeqi4HW</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1996158141793489389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>It definitely gives off more of a Resident Evil 2 Remake and Resident Evil 7 vibe—which will be music to the ears of those who lambasted Resident Evil 8’s somewhat familiar return to action and open areas.</p>



<p>What do you think of this short gameplay extra? Is Resident Evil Requiem looking better by the day? Will this be a return to the classic vibe of vintage Resident Evil games? You can let everyone know in the usual place: The free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Official Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-review</link>
            <guid>1371343</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Lengthy RPGs are one of the great joys in my life, but it can sometimes feel a bit daunting to pack one into just a few weeks for the review process. As of writing this, I have played just over 70 hours of Octopath Traveler 0 and am nearing the final few chapters in its main questline – and having played these kinds of RPGs most of my life, I already know those "final few chapters" will be anything but short. However, I'm eager to wrap them up in the coming days because it's been a worthwhile journey so far. Between the new wrinkles in its dynamic combat system and some fantastic music that uplift its big battles, Octopath Traveler 0 is hitting the right notes and delivering the things I seek from RPGs. The tales told within its various quest branches have been hit and miss, though, and I'm still waiting to see if the story will come together and hit its stride in this last stretch before I settle with a final, scored review.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Octopath Traveler 0, Square Enix has adapted the 2022 mobile game Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent into a more traditional package, serving as both a prequel to the original and a reconfiguration of what's already available on phones. Regardless of where I land in my final review, I'm glad it exists in this form at all since it ditches the gacha/microtransaction elements that were used to build your party and instead has you recruiting team members through sidequests. Thus, the better parts of the mobile game come to the forefront and highlight that the foundation of the series held up then and still holds up now.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Story is where most of my reservations are since it hits some pretty high highs and fairly low lows. While I'm not expecting it to be the most beautifully written script or deepest character study, I've found several plot beats to fall quite flat due to some shallow storytelling, rudimentary dialogue, or things that happen <em>just because</em>. Comically evil villains make for bosses I get fired up to absolutely destroy, but it's hard to take them seriously at times when their foolish cruelty and thirst for power is the main hook, so I'm not coming away with a sense of satisfaction I've felt elsewhere (namely, Octopath Traveler 2). Like the rest of the series, godly powers linger in the background and slowly reveal themselves as you uncover the real purpose behind the eight divine rings, one of which is assigned to "the chosen one" who is your created protagonist. Despite the inconsistent quality of its storytelling across this long runtime, Octopath Traveler 0 runs at a decent pace and propels you forward without sitting on any one story thread for too long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A big part of this is in how the main questline is structured; after a tragic prologue where your hometown is burned to the ground, you're given three story branches to pursue the trio of villains responsible. Themed around power, fame, and wealth, respectively, those three paths then converge into a conclusion for what is roughly the first half of the overall story (at about 40 hours). It then splits into three <em>new </em>questlines that pick up those themes once again, and although they retread similar territory, the stakes get higher as more of Octopath's world gets involved. That's a lot to chew on, but it's able to keep momentum rather than trying to build eight separate stories that have to run in parallel. Octopath Traveler 2 was very successful with regard to its cast of eight and made for some of the most memorable RPG stories in recent memory, but this is a smart direction considering that this (and the mobile game) centers around recruiting <em>a lot </em>of characters to swap in and out of your party. Unfortunately this means most party members feel rather disposable, so the disonance it creates is just the trade-off that gets made.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>So far the story has hit some pretty high highs and fairly low lows.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While I haven't experienced the same compelling, emotionally resonant character arcs I saw in the second game, specific moments remind me that there's still some heartfelt stuff tucked within. Whether it's a character wielding their pain from tragedy to summon a new power mid-battle or a quiet, reflective cutscene back at town to remind you what "home" really means, Octopath Traveler 0 has brief moments of greatness. The big picture is solid, too – the alliances and betrayals of various kingdoms don't get bogged down in exposition and deliver good old fashioned drama. The stories around Octopath's world religion get a bit unwieldy when it comes to the greater lore, but it's not incomprehensible and makes the mechanism of the church quite clear. Like the previous game, class warfare and going from nothing to something remains a prominent motif, and even though it sometimes fumbles the messaging here, it's willing to talk about those topics with enough clarity. Whether or not all these threads pay off, well, that's what's left for me to determine as I finish the main story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, that's the A-plot. There's a B-plot that revolves around rebuilding your hometown through an independent but related questline that's tied to the town-building system. In the process of bringing your hometown back to life narratively, you actually <em>rebuild </em>it in a similar vein to Fallout 4 or even Ni no Kuni 2. You collect crafting materials naturally throughout which then allow you to build housing, shops, and decor wherever you like within certain parameters. It’s an enjoyable side activity, with tangible benefits that come from constructing new buildings and recruiting new residents you invite from across the map. You get perks such as discounted shop prices, a self-sufficient flow of materials, and a training ground for inactive party members to continue leveling up, among other things. Town building may seem optional at first, but it becomes almost essential the deeper you get, especially when you consider the story's broader message about what home means to you and the people you care for. It's a bit cheesy at times, but its heart is in the right place as it gets sentimental about what it takes to rebuild after losing everything. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You get a ton of sidequests thrown at you as you progress in the main game, many of which are a short series' of objectives to unlock new party members – some of which are cast members from the original game. It's super cool to see, but don't expect them to have any particular depth as the main story is largely focused on specific, non-optional characters. One thing I do enjoy about Octopath games and RPGs like them is the sense of discovery and stumbling upon secrets or locations you wouldn't visit otherwise, and the sidequests, if anything, have been a good way to pull you in those directions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2023/2900-4972/#8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on record saying Octopath Traveler 2</a> has one of my favorite turn-based combat systems ever; it shines here as well and for slightly different reasons. The Boost and Break systems give the typical dynamic of hitting elemental affinities extra depth. Playing the guessing game of discovering what enemies are weak against gets a little tiresome, but once that part is solved, scheming for your plan of attack based on turn order to Break enemies and tee up the big hits is oh so satisfying. Building each party members' Boost points to add extra hits or increase spell potency gives you something to plan around for turns well in advance. And lining up all these variables while juggling the threat of hard-hitting bosses who impose some impactful status ailments have me feeling like a genius tactician. Octopath might be playing on our nostalgia with its HD-2D retro-style visuals, but I honestly believe it has continually set a higher bar for turn-based combat systems in modern gaming.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This series has continually set a higher bar for turn-based combat systems.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Party composition is quite different this time around since you have eight active party members at all times – four in the front row and four in the back who you can swap between mid-turn. With 30-something characters in my current roster, it's an overwhelming amount to process and manage. But while the fundamentals of Octopath's combat system are familiar, pairing characters as duos for the column they occupy is a unique strategic layer that allows for a lot of flexibility in combat. And because they build Boost points individually, you can dole out the big hits more frequently and keep up a brisk pace in battle. You sacrifice individual character depth, however, as each party member has just one Job to progress through (aside from your protagonist), but you can at least master specific Job skills to then equip on other characters to diversify their moveset. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm not quite ready to say whether I like this combat more or less than Octopath Traveler 2 since I found its character growth more meaningful, but it’s still been a welcome change of pace that hits the turn-based highs that've made the series special. The slow-motion cinematic camera cuts for Max Boost attacks and tide-turning limit breaks still get me hyped up, giving combat the visual flair that truly makes the HD-2D style stand out when the action picks up. The confluence of thoughtful gameplay, fantastic graphics, and a banging soundtrack that contends with some of the RPG greats, showcases why the genre is still in good hands.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Michael Higham's Top 10 Favorite RPGs of All Time</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Octopath Traveler 0 has so much firing off in parallel with its separate story branches, overarching themes, and complex-but-satisfying RPG combat system, and I'm excited to see how it all concludes as I inch closer to the end. Great RPGs live or die by how their final acts play out – with the expectation of wild boss battles, story revelations, and resolution to an 80-hour-plus journey, a lot is riding on it. And I'm just as eager to finalize my thoughts and feelings on Octopath Traveler 0 soon after.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has released a new update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and it's another big one.</p>
<p>Version 1.4.0, to give it its proper name, has made swathes of changes to Nintendo's latest Mario Kart installment, ranging from the way music tracks are displayed all the way to UFO entries.</p>
<p>There are tweaks to the smart steering, some course changes for those taking part in "VS Race", "Race" in "Online Play" or "Wireless Play", and adjustments to the speed at which Dash food reappears. You will also now dash when riding on Manta Ramp's back, and there also <em>so much</em> more on the list. Nintendo has really gone to town with this one.</p>
<p>Alas, there's still no mention of racing on individual tracks in multiplayer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-fine-tunes-race-selection-in-vs-race-pool-responding-to-player-criticism">but we all know that's something everyone wants</a>. Maybe next time...</p>

<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 1 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160887/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>In 2020, Square Enix released an interesting 'stopgap' in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> series called <strong>Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent</strong>. This free-to-play mobile game took the gacha approach to design, regularly launching new units and storylines to interact with as the years rolled by. The company wrapped up that initial version in January this year, but it decided to design a new standalone version for consoles: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>.</p>
<p>Not quite a straight port of the original nor a brand new game, this fresh release converts a previously more fractured game into a cohesive traditional JRPG that features no online elements or microtransactions and feels more in line with what you’d expect from a proper numbered entry. And while it’s not the true successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler_ii">Octopath Traveler II</a>, OT0 nonetheless stands tall as another great entry in the series.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 2 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160902/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The narrative here is arguably the most interesting aspect, as it somewhat bucks the series trend of offering various disconnected narratives following each of the primary protagonists. For one thing, there’s now technically only <em>one</em> protagonist (your self-insert MC) and everyone else is merely an incidental addition to the plot. And while there’s still a nonlinear, chapter-based system that allows you to pursue the main story at your leisure, each chapter is now focused on a specific <em>antagonist</em>.</p>
<p>Even though intraparty interaction is still kept to a minimum, the storyline is nonetheless significantly more streamlined and in line with what you’d expect out of a typical JRPG. You begin as a resident of the cosy, friendly town of Wishvale, which is very quickly pillaged and razed to the ground by a nasty group of villains. After reconnecting with another survivor, you set out on a campaign of vengeance several years later, hunting key leaders of the attack, setting up the first arc of the overarching narrative.</p>
<p>What I really liked about this storytelling approach is how much more personal and interesting it made the rogues' gallery of villains. Not only do the ensuing chapters explore some of the antagonists' moral greyness, but there are some genuinely surprising and <em>dark</em> plot twists that add to the satisfaction when you finally get a chance to punch these people in the mouth.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 3 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160897/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I was always a fan of the way the first two games handled their braided narratives, but choosing to centre the narrative this time on one protagonist and various villains that have made their life hell is an interesting and ultimately worthwhile change.</p>
<p>That all said, the length of the campaign is a <em>long</em> haul. Given that this is based on a live-service gacha that grew quite a bit, there are literally <em>years</em> of storylines to experience—the developers themselves flagged that it should take you <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1963949417548923364">roughly 100 hours to clear</a>, and that’s <em>not</em> including the mountain of optional side content. I wouldn’t say that this tremendous length is necessarily a mark against Octopath Traveler 0, but just be aware that the pacing and quality can vary over that time, as any narrative of that size can get unwieldy in some places.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 4 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160888/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay otherwise follows the standard formula of previous games, wherein you explore a sizeable open world, pick up quests, fight in turn-based battles, explore dungeons, and utilise Path Actions to interact with the various NPCs you come across. Initially, you only have two party members, but as you discover and explore new towns, you eventually grow the party to just over <em>30</em>.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, this is exactly how you’d expect a new Octopath entry to play, and while I would have liked to see more innovation on the gameplay side of things, it’s tough to argue that the team didn’t stick the landing with the execution of their gameplay loop.</p>
<p>Combat remains largely the same, with a key difference being that you now have <em>eight</em> active party members instead of four. Only four of them are active during a given round, but when a party member’s turn comes, they can tag out to let their backline partner take an action instead. The backline is more than just a reserve in case someone gets knocked down, too, as all characters in the rear at the end of every round also gain HP and SP.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 5 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160894/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Though the eight-character setup doesn’t massively change the overall flow of combat that we’re well familiar with by now, I really appreciated the additional strategic depth offered by the extra members. You effectively build BP (Boost Points) twice as fast now, which can lead to some crazy combos if you plan out your team right, and there’s a lot more to think through as you consider the various skills and abilities of each member and plan in advance how you’ll place them in the overall formation.</p>
<p>Do you put two healer characters together to maximise your healing output? Or do you pair one with a DPS character who will need to get cycled to the back to recover? The previous two games regularly asked you similar teambuilding questions, but here that more strategic approach is present to a much higher degree.</p>
<p>On the other hand, individual character progression has been kneecapped a bit, and I'm not as much a fan of how it’s been implemented. The ability to multiclass in previous games kept character-building interesting throughout the whole experience as you constantly unlocked new class types and found new ways to combine different class abilities to lead to some units that truly 'broke' the game. Here, there are no second classes; you can only progress a character along their default assigned class.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 6 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160892/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There is some variation introduced by equipping Battle Skills and Support Skills gained from NPCs, granting boons like the ability to utilise wind attacks or increased healing output. However, these feel more limited than giving a character access to all the abilities that come along with a new class, and it leads to characters feeling pigeon-holed into the clear roles they’re designed to fulfil.</p>
<p>There’s something to be said about having a roster of bespoke characters who become simply <em>more</em> of what they already are at the beginning, but I’ve always viewed the Octopath Traveler games as encouraging you to find ways to make party members overpowered by building them far beyond their initial loadouts and here that definitely feels reined in.</p>
<p>Given that there’s technically only the one protagonist in this game, the Path Action system has been adapted. Now your protagonist can do <em>all</em> the actions (such as stealing, inquiring, or haggling) and the success rate is determined by how much you’ve grown their wealth, power, or fame stats by completing various quests and side quests. Which stat gets checked depends on what the character you’re talking to values most, and this also affects what path actions are available to use on them. Overall, this doesn't feel like a significant change, but I appreciated how it gave you reason to regularly return to towns, as many NPCs are clearly way above the levels you’re at when you initially meet them.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 7 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160905/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps the headlining new feature is the addition of townbuilding elements while you slowly rebuild Wishvale to its former glory. Simply talking to your carpenter friend, Stia, or interacting with a workbench will turn the overgrown ruins of the once-quaint town into a grid where you can place new buildings, paths, and decorations according to your liking. Some of these buildings have a more functional passive value, too, such as how the pub allows you to bring food and prep dishes to give yourself an edge in battle for a certain number of turns.</p>
<p>As you find new towns, some NPCs will have the 'Invite' Path Action, which lets you invite them to Wishvale to contribute to the community. Every NPC has some sort of passive ability that can affect things like crop production speed or JP (Job Points) gain in battle, and housing them in your town lets you build these up over time. Plus, inviting more residents causes the overall town level to increase, unlocking new structures to build, and lets you place more homes where you’d like.</p>
<p>I appreciated how the townbuilding managed to feel both instrumental <em>and</em> optional to the game’s progression. Though there are plot reasons for why you <em>have</em> to build up the town to a certain point, it’s something that you can otherwise choose to ignore if you’d rather just stay on the road and keep pushing on to the next quest.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshot 8 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160876/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, there’s plenty to dig into here if you want to get in the weeds of building the most picturesque town possible as you regularly return to reap the rewards. And while there are concrete gameplay benefits from investing in and interacting with your town, they aren’t so enormous that you’re handicapping yourself if you choose to only return to Wishvale when necessary.</p>
<p>As far as visuals are concerned, this entry falls neatly between the fidelity of the previous two mainline games. It's clear that it was built with many reused assets from the first Octopath Traveler, but there are some details and flourishes present that will remind you more of the second game.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version runs quite well, too, and seeing the action unfold at 60fps makes everything appear that much nicer. It definitely feels like a slight step down if you’re playing this right after putting a lot of time into Octopath Traveler 2, but overall the HD-2D art style here still holds up exceptionally well and looks gorgeous in motion.</p>

<p>Much like how the visuals feel like a blend of the previous two games, the soundtrack offers a variety of tracks and remixes from its predecessors, with some new tracks thrown in there to accompany the new content. Though it’s a <em>bit</em> disappointing that we didn’t get a new full-fledged soundtrack for this release, the new music feels right in line with the previous tracks, which are just as excellent as they were when we heard them for the first time.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In many ways, Octopath Traveler 0 feels like a ‘victory lap’ for the beloved series, remixing various elements that you’re familiar with from the past games while introducing some interesting new ones to spice things up a bit. Importantly, this prequel does <em>not</em> feel like a proper Octopath Traveler 3, but that doesn’t mean that it isn't still an incredibly good time and a much better JRPG than most genre peers.</p>
<p>Even if it's a retread in some ways, though, an absolutely monstrous amount of content, interesting new gameplay elements, gorgeous visuals, and compelling storytelling all come together to make Octopath Traveler 0 a must-buy.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Role-playing video games have been around almost as long as D&amp;D itself, but for every step they take towards modernity, many of the fundamentals remain the same. Octopath Traveler 0 is a game that’s more aware of that than any other AAA release this year. It readily leans on RPG fundamentals like turn-based combat, grinding for experience and epic storytelling, while aping the 16-bit visuals of classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI. It’s also a reworking of the mobile title, Champions of the Continent, but, for all of that, Octopath Traveler 0 looks and feels every inch the modern RPG.</p>
<p><iframe title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PSRFT5OVqKs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Admittedly, we’ve been here before. The first two Octopath games took eight separate characters, and interlinked their eight narratives to great effect, but it was the HD-2D visuals that instantly won them an avalanche of pixel-art admirers. Octopath 0 immediately pulls the same trick by being undeniably stunning to behold, updating the look of the classics with a shimmering, living filter that brings every scene to life in remarkable fashion. I don’t think I could ever get bored of this art style, and three games in (and with a bunch of other HD-2D games alongside) that looks likely to pan out.</p>


<p>While the visual style remains the same, the overarching structure and narrative framing have changed, this time putting a created character at the centre of everything. Your silent protagonist gets their own name, look, and even a favourite food, but they don’t say much of anything at all, while other characters readily monologue through conversations to their heart’s content. You get used to it, but I did miss the individual characters of the last two games.</p>
<p>That said, the teams at Square Enix and DokiDoki Groove Works have crafted an interesting and companionable bunch of characters to surround yourself with, and there’s a huge number of them, and their backstories, to involve yourself in. Whether touched by tragedy, or seeking knowledge and influence, there’s hundreds of narrative threads to pull on, some of which go nowhere, while others contribute to your own, world-altering quest.</p>


<p>Outside of the thirty recruitable characters, virtually every person you come across can be spoken to, investigated, bartered with, or hired, whether through your persuasive talents or by beating them in combat. It’s an enjoyable, and often productive, diversion, and it makes every town and village feel as though it’s brimming with life and character, even when these backstories are often just a few lines.</p>
<p>The core narrative is split into three strands: Power, Fame and Wealth. At the outset, each of these is headed by a particularly hateful lead antagonist, from the murderous playwright Auguste – who’s definitely stolen the Guardians of the Galaxy’s Collector’s schtick – to the beautiful Herminia whose drug cartel stands to corrupt half the population of the continent. You can tackle these in any order, with the other strands remaining frozen while you work your way through the others.</p>
<p>Your hometown, Wishvale, finds itself decimated at the hands of these evil-doers, setting you and your friends off on a quest to collect the eight divine rings, and you find yourself chasing each of them down, enacting your revenge while also rebuilding your homestead.</p>

<p>Town building is a big part of Octopath 0’s gameplay, and it’s well done, even if you might find it a little limited and straightforward. You can build various homesteads, shops and facilities and gain certain boons by inviting people to live there, while the layout and expansion of Wishvale is up to you, albeit within the framework that you’re given to work with.</p>
<p>You’ll find yourself decorating and tinkering for hours, and getting to see your creation in the beautiful game engine is well worth it. There’s a small fly in the ointment for Switch 2 players, who don’t get to use quite as many objects as PS5 or Xbox Series X|S owners (400 compared to 500), but there’s still enough customisation to truly make this place feel like your own.</p>

<p>Octopath Traveler 0 evolves the series’ turn-based combat, though it does feel fundamentally the same as its predecessors. Boosting attacks and breaking enemies is the key to success, wearing down their defences by discovering what weapon types they’re weak to. This time, you can have a massive 8 different characters in your party, with half of those in the back line providing support, while you can also recruit helpers to throw in with you.</p>
<p>It’s a shame that the difficulty level often bounces between ridiculously easy and teeth-gnashingly tough, but it does even out the further you go. If you’re a fan of turn-based combat, Octopath 0’s rendition remains interesting throughout, with the multiple characters bringing some of the mobile-centric chaos and carnage that you’d expect with multiple effects and attacks going on, while failure means you often have to strategise and plan to progress.</p>

<p>If you head into the menus, there’s plenty of the traditional levelling and equipping you’d expect to find, and you can unlock skills in the order you want, which is a nice touch, although you have to bear in mind how much SP they cost to cast when you’re starting out. There’s a huge amount of customisation available, with characters able to learn others’ skills, while your central protagonist can also change jobs – choosing from eight, obviously – learning new skills and improving their stats as they do, and letting you experience some of that variation the previous games had with multiple characters.</p>
<p>One of the biggest worries with Octopath Traveler 0 was whether it was going to feel like a mobile port, and thankfully, it doesn’t. From the huge cast of voice actors, through the multiple quests and asides, to the town-building and exceptional production values, Octopath Traveler 0 feels every bit the full console game. It definitely has a different flavour to the previous titles, and I can see some fans struggling with the shift, but in many ways, it feels fresh and unique when placed alongside its predecessors.</p>

			<p>Although its popularity doesn't reach the heights of other established series like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">Final Fantasy</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-classic-rpgs-at-their-best/">Dragon Quest</a>, the Octopath Traveler franchise is proving to be rather seminal for the JRPG genre as a whole, mainly thanks to its HD-2D visual style which has been employed to great success in other titles, including the tactical role-playing game Triangle Strategy, the upcoming action role-playing game <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-new-trailers-drop-ahead-of-tgs/">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, and remakes of classic games such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/">first three entries in the Dragon Quest series</a> and in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-ocean-the-second-story-r-far-beyond-the-stars/">Star Ocean: The Second Story R</a>, remake of the second entry in the series created by tri-Ace.</p>



<p>The HD-2D style, which combines 2D sprites with 3D environments bridged together with pixel-art aesthetics, also made its debut a few years back on mobile platforms with Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, a free-to-play RPG set in the world of the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-eights-great/">first entry in the series</a>, which also serves as its prequel. This mobile game is also the basis upon which Octopath Traveler 0 has been built to deliver some of its features and story, as well as gameplay that's closer to the first two entries in the franchise.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251122133018_1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Octopath Traveler 0 features one of the best stories in the entire series</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike the first two entries in the series, Octopath Traveler 0 doesn't feature eight different protagonists with their own individual stories, which sort of blend together in the final act, but a single protagonist. This player-created protagonist, whose appearance, Job, and more can be customized before the start of the game, is a resident of Wishvale, a town in the continent of Orsterra which is burned down during the town's annual festival by three nefarious individuals - the witch Hermania, the hero Tytos and the playwright Auguste - in the bid to acquire Aelfric's Ring, an artifact of immense power related to the Flamebringer said to have concluded the war between the twelve other gods and Galdera, saving the world, over one thousand years before the events of the game which fatefully made its way into the hands of the new Ringbearer.</p>



<p>Sometime after the destruction of Wishvale, however, the Firebringer emerges from hiding and together with another survivor of the fire, the apprentice architect Stia, sets out to restore the village, rounding up any other survivor scattered all over Orsterra, setting out to find new people to populate the place and take revenge on the villains that have reduced Wishvale to ash.</p>



<p>Although the Octopath Traveler 0 story moves on two somewhat distinct directions - the Wishvale restoration and the revenge directions - it is a much more focused effort than previous entries in the series, which I felt suffered not only from excessive fragmentation, but also uneven quality between tales -  in the original game more than in <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories/">its sequel</a>. The main quests are still separated in different chapters with different minimum level requirements, so it's not possible to pursue a single questline from beginning to end with no interruption, but this setup is way less forced than in the other games, feeling more natural and organic.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251122140521_1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Octopath Traveler 0 villains are among the best seen in modern JRPGs</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The introduction of a single playable character is a huge departure from the rest of the series, but Octopath Traveler 0 handles the challenges of having a silent protagonist with its compelling cast of supporting characters, which include over 30 other travellers that interact with each other in special party chat events, and characters with central roles in the "Master of" quests. Despite a relatively limited screen time, these characters quickly become memorable, as their own motivations for going against the Masters of Wealth, Power, and Fame are clear from the get-go, and their backstories are masterfully woven into the individual villain stories to deliver some gripping tales.</p>



<p>The stars of the show in Octopath Traveler 0, however, are the Masters themselves. Designing the main questlines around them, rather than around the heroes, gave the development team all the time needed to paint a complete picture, and do a great job to highlight how much these people are, simply put, monsters in human form. Their actions at the beginning of the game are only the tip of the proverbial iceberg: they are much worse than they appear. Saying precisely why would be entering into heavy spoilers territory, which I won't do, as the beauty of the Octopath Traveler 0 story is learning the heinous acts these villains are capable of. Suffice to say that it is very difficult to remain unmoved when learning of the physical and mental atrocities these individuals are capable of.</p>



<p>As such, the story is often very dark, and with the villains remaining utterly unapologetic until the end, Octopath Traveler 0 is a breath of fresh air for the genre. True, there are times these villains are slightly made to look like victims of fate as much as other JRPG villains, but their actions say it all: they act the way they do due to the complete disregard of everything that isn't their heinous goals. To make a comparison, one of the villains, the Master of Fame Auguste, reminds me of Final Fantasy VI's Kefka Palazzo, a character that has entered the collective memory of JRPG fans mainly because of his completely unhinged destructive tendencies.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251127192212_1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Their heinous, cruel acts make it very easy to hate the Octopath Traveler 0 villains</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The twists and changes to the formula established by the first two entries in the series aren't limited to the story setup in Octopath Traveler 0. Though still very similar to what we have seen so far, the new entry in the series twists gameplay in a competent way that makes the whole package more compelling.</p>



<p>In Octopeth Traveler 0, the player travels all over Orsterra, exploring towns and dungeons as quests dictate, interacting with NPCs via Path Actions to learn more about them, acquire items, hire them for combat, or invite them to Wishvale, and fighting enemies in a classic turn-based combat system enriched by the Break and Boost systems. The first allows players to "break" enemies by hitting their weak points with the appropriate weapon or element a number of times determined by their shield value, leaving them stunned and defenseless for an entire turn. The second, on the other hand, allows characters to attack more than once with their equipped weapons or power-up skills dictated by the character's Job by spending the BPs that are naturally accumulated every single turn.</p>



<p>While traversal and exploration continue to be one of the weakest element in the series, as the excellent Path Actions interactions are offset by an uninspired field and dungeon design which basically consists of a series of corridors with nothing of relevance besides the occasional treasure chest, the combat system and character progression have seen some small yet significant improvements that have a significant, positive impact on the entire experience.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251128180948_1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The expanded eight-member party is the biggest gameplay change of Octopath Traveler 0</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With over 30 travelers available, expanding the combat system to include eight characters instead of four was a natural choice. Divided into front and back row, it is possible to switch between pairs at will at the start of a turn, giving access to a bigger selection of attacks and skills each turn, which makes Breaking enemies easier and faster than ever. The larger party also opens up some effective strategies that significantly improve the pace of combat.</p>



<p>For example, a front row character can spend their BPs to quickly break an enemy, which can then be attacked with everything the back row character has, boosting their abilities using the accumulated BPs and with the full SP granted by the back row automatic restoration mechanics. Some travelers also come with special abilities that can make them switch back to the back row automatically upon use, or that are more effective if used from the back row, opening up a lot of synergies that weren't available in the first two games.</p>



<p>Character progression has also been heavily overhauled to accommodate the much bigger character roster. The series' Job system, which allows players to assign a Job between eight choices - Warrior, Thief, Hunter, Merchant, Apothecary, Cleric, Danger, Scholar - is back in Octopath Traveler 0, but only the Ringbearer can switch between different Jobs after unlocking them. Every other traveler comes with a pre-assigned Job which cannot be changed. Although these Jobs are based on the eight base jobs, they are slightly different variations that either combine skills from two different Jobs, or are altogether unique Jobs with unique abilities.</p>



<p>While this, by itself, greatly helps make these characters unique, Octopath Traveler 0 goes the extra mile by offering skill customization options via the Masteries system. By obtaining Mastery items, it is possible to assign up to three Action skills and two Passive skills to any character, which can further differentiate between travelers, even if they belong to the same general Job archetype. This very simple addition, in my opinion, elevates the Octopath Traveler 0 experience significantly, providing a granular upgrade system that is a significant step forward from the basic Job system of the previous entries in the series, allowing players to come up with skill combinations to empower a traveler's set skills and Ultimate Attacks, only partially restrained by the main Job of each traveler.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-Masteries.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Mastery system provides deep customization options</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides introducing these changes to combat and character progression, Octopath Traveler 0 introduces some brand new mechanics for the series, with the town-building mechanics that allow players to directly influence the restoration of Wishvale. These town-building mechanics are rather straightforward, allowing players to place a certain number of facilities on the available locations and change their appearance, but they are central to the experience, as getting more facilities up and running, upgrading them and inviting more villagers unlocks essential features, including a monster arena that offers rewards for pitting captured monsters against others, and a Museum where it is possible to listen to collected music scores and display special treasure hidden all over Orsterra.</p>



<p>The town building mechanics are expanded organically throughout the Wishvale restoration-focused quests, and never feel like a distraction. On the contrary, they provide a nice variation from all the adventuring, which doesn't change a whole lot during the course of the adventure, due to the aforementioned average level design.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-visuals.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Shaping the future of Wishvale is a big part of the Octopath Traveler 0 experience</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While Octopath Traveler 0 represents a solid step forward for the series in terms of story and gameplay, the visuals have taken a step back from the second entry in the series. While the HD-2D aesthetics still look gorgeous, locations don't feel as lively as they did in the previous game, and even assets seem to be of lower quality, closer to the original Octopath Traveler. This isn't a major issue per se, but striving for at least the same level of quality as the franchise's current peak would have been a better choice. However, given that the game is based on a mobile platform, this isn't too surprising.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the same hasn't happened to the other core element of the Octopath Traveler series presentation: music. Series composer Yasunori Nishiki delivered another beautiful soundtrack encompassing pieces that evoke emotions from across the spectrum, moving from high-quality sad, evocative pieces to epic combat themes effortlessly. The voice acting is similarly good, with great performances across the board that make the story more involving, and characters more engaging.</p>



<blockquote>
<h2 id="h-review-in-progress-verdict">Review in Progress Verdict</h2>



<p><strong>Time Played:</strong> 30+ Hours</p>



<p>I have completed the main 'Master of' quests, but I have not yet reached the conclusion of the story. Based on the compelling narrative, the excellent eight-character combat overhaul, and the meaningful addition of the Masteries system, the game currently sits as my personal favorite entry in the series. The ultimate score will depend heavily on the payoff of the final narrative act and whether the combat holds up against the toughest challenges.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">$55 billion leveraged buyout</a> which will see Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake and Jared Kushner become the new owners of EA will reportedly lead to the Saudi Public Investment Fund owning a whopping 93.4 percent of the game publishers. That's assuming the deal goes through as planned.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is according to filings with Brazil’s antitrust regulator reported by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/saudi-fund-to-own-almost-all-of-electronic-arts-after-buyout-661e92be?mod=hp_lead_pos4">Wall Street Journal</a> (paywall). The other parties in the takeover, investment firms Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, are set to receive stakes amounting to 5.5 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.</p>
<p>The latter company was founded by Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law. Both Silver Lake and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html">Affinity</a> already get some of their own investment funding from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Overall, the Saudi PIF are putting up somewhere in the region of $29 billion to make the deal happen, with $36.4 billion of the $55 billion cost funded in equity, plus the $5.2 billion worth of EA already owned by the country's wealth fund. The remaining $20 billion will come from a loan set to be dished out by JPMorgan Chase Bank, with generative AI <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">reportedly being viewed</a> as a way of repaying the debt by slashing EA's running costs in the coming years. Sigh.</p><p>All of that's a serious chunk of change for a fund recently reported by the New York Times to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-saudi-arabia-fund-behind-the-wildly-leveraged-ea-buyout-is-dealing-with-financial-distress-claims-report">dealing with some "financial distress"</a>. Though, the fund did disagree with that assessment of their money future, casually declaring that they've got $60 billion in cash and "similar financial instruments" in their wallet.</p>
<p>The question, given how much control of Saudi Arabia stand to gain over EA's direction for owning 93.4 percent via the PIF, is whether there's any truth to claims that EA's day-to-day will go on largely as usual, following the deal. "Our values and our commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged," EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/exciting-news-about-our-future?isLocalized=true#:~:text=Our%20values%20and%20our%20commitment,lead%20the%20future%20of%20entertainment.">said in October</a>.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's ruling regime, led by Mohammed bin Salman, boast a terrible human rights record which <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">Amnesty International</a> cite as including "arbitrary" detention and execution of people simply expressing their opinions, abuse of migrant workers, and discrimination against women. They're also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">believed by the CIA</a> to have been responsible for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. All of that makes the wealth fund gaining majority control of the games publisher worrying, especially given the diversity and inclusiveness studios like BioWare and series like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> are noted for.</p>

              <p><span>I wouldn’t fault you for being skeptical if a friend told you about the most amazing role-playing game, and one of the first things said was, “It’s a port of a moderately successful mobile gacha game, but trust me! It’s really great!” But here I am, your friend, telling you that </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> isn’t merely okay, it’s genuinely great. It takes a story previously locked on mobile phones and expands it into a masterfully crafted experience of earnestly told adventure that isn’t simply “good for an RPG” but great by any standard of the word. This is the best the series has ever been.</span></p> <p><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> is the platonic ideal of a role-playing game. Starting with a doomed hometown and a quest for vengeance against colorful villains, it builds to the genre-expected epic battles and world-shattering plots. You’ll leap from story arc to story arc, exploring dungeons and facing off against bosses in turned-based battles; you’ll pause between these big story moments for some comfortable town-building and brisk side quests. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>This is not a game that reinvents the wheel and yet I can’t recommend it enough. Using only this simple framework, </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> consistently impresses. It stands side by side with all-time classics and somehow manages to do this in spite of a truly odd development process. </span><b><br> </b><span><br> </span><span>I’ve played much of this game already and knew this story before downloading it because it started as a mobile gacha game called </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent.</span></i><span> Released in 2020, </span><i><span>Champions of the Continent</span></i><span> was a very solid RPG prequel to </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler</span></i><span> that supplemented development costs, as many mobile games do, with microtransactions and a gacha “pull” mechanic where players could spend in-game currencies on a random smattering of heroes. This was particularly strange because it was a solo game with no real multiplayer component. But the bigger oddity wasn’t the tacked-on money mechanics but the fact that </span><i><span>Champions of the Continent</span></i><span> was honestly a good RPG.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Marvelous!"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>A Goddamn Role-Playing Game</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked</p>                 <p>Classic stories told with clear passion, crunchy combat and fun team building, some of the best music in all of gaming</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked</p>                 <p>Some party members don't really get a chance to shine, town-building is charming but somewhat limited, there's some stuff from the mobile game I really wish was here.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Square Enix</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>December 4, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>Final save file time was 88 hours and 50 minutes.

The pixel art was great even on mobile, and it had all the production value of a full-priced game. Which raised a question: why the hell was this a gacha game locked away on phones? It was simply way too good to be a mobile game.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Half a decade from the initial launch, Square Enix seems to have reached a similar conclusion, releasing </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> as an updated port for consoles and PC that greatly rebalances combat encounters and adds a fresh, new framing device to the experience.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In this version of the game, instead of commanding gacha-pull heroes, players create their own character. This adventurer lives in the small hamlet of Wishvale, which is prosperous and safe until a triumvirate of ring-bearing villains plots to burn down the village in search of yet another power-granting ring. A classic setup if ever there was.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>This version of the game, which removes all of the mobile version’s paid mechanics, turns out to be the sharpest and most compelling </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler</span></i><span> thus far. Packed with some of the finest boss encounters and sweeping storytelling in the franchise, </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> stands up in an oddly sharp rebuke to its progenitor title and answers the question “Did we really need those microtransactions?” with a resounding “no.”</span></p>

 <h2><b>My </b><b><i>Final Fantasy</i></b></h2> <p><span>I can’t say it emphatically enough: I love this game, I think it’s phenomenal. Yet if I’m forced to “ponder the orb” here, I find myself trapped in a fatal loop. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> can’t exist without the mobile gacha game coming before it, and yet the sheer craftsmanship on display, the frankly astounding talent packed into every pixel and each story moment, also screams out to tell me what I already know: So many of the games that we are playing today that try to sneak in ways to slowly bleed us of our cash, could simply be normal video games. We don’t need that gacha shit! You can tear it out and still have one of the best role-playing games of the decade.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Because dear God, what a video game this is. What a wonderful little thing!</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650022" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650022"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650022">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As you might expect, combat is the central focus, and </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> makes a few adjustments to the series’ battle system that help it stand out. The most obvious is the increase from an active party of four characters to a total of eight. This might seem like a beefy party size, but there are some benefits to be had.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Shifting away from a focus on character customization (party members only ever have one job instead of a combination of two) gives your fighters distinct roles in combat, while the large roster of characters means you’ll spend much of the game adjusting party compositions to cover potential weaknesses. In battle, four “active” characters stand at the front and can be swapped out with their partner in the back. Battles are a fast-paced affair where you constantly shift out characters to hit enemy weaknesses or else pull in your healers or buffers to bolster your powerhouses. There’s very little downtime in the middle of a battle, and clever teams can cover all your combat needs.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>This is draped on top of the usual systems that have come to define an </span><i><span>Octopath</span></i><span> game. Enemies have a variety of weaknesses, and hitting them with the correct weapons or elements chips away their shield until they are stunned for multiple rounds of high-damaging hits. Characters gain Boost Points every turn that can be spent to increase their damage, turbocharge their healing spells, or do things such as extend the duration of debuffs they toss on targets. The ideal boss battle finds a balance between spending just enough of these points to speed up damage to the enemy’s shield while keeping enough in reserve to dump into your attacks when the enemy is stunned. If you’re smart, most fights in the game can be cleared in two breaks of your opponent’s shield. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Managing character health, swapping out your travelers, and figuring out exactly what damage breaks an enemy’s guard gives the first half of a fight a playful tone. You’re poking and prodding and puzzling a path to victory until suddenly it all becomes clear and the stars align for a powerful round of dominating decisions. None of this is particularly complex. There are no timing buttons to parry attacks or pseudo-action systems augmenting the experience.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650021" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650021"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650021">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This RPG action is supplemented by more casual intermissions where the goal is to explore the world, meet townspeople, and plan out the newly revived Wishvale. Your hometown, lost in the opening hours like many RPG starting villages before it, lingers heavily in the hearts and imaginations of many characters throughout the game. While most of </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> is focused on dungeoneering and combat, a sizable chunk is also focused on rebuilding your home and wandering the world to find citizens that you can invite to populate the village.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>In the prior </span><i><span>Octopath </span></i><span>games, your party members would have various “path actions” that allowed them to interact with townsfolk in different ways. For instance, Therion the thief could steal items from people, while Olberic the wandering knight could challenge certain characters to duels. This was a good way of gaining access to special equipment without simply spending money in a shop. Certain characters could even be recruited to join you as summonable help in battle. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> retains this but ties path actions to one of three disciplines—Wealth, Fame, or Power—and allows your created hero to do all of them. Depending on how many points you have in the corresponding discipline, your chances of success will increase. Gain enough fame, and recruiting someone becomes easier. With enough wealth, you’ll haggle better</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><span>There’s nothing stopping players from attempting to perform these actions anyway, which is part of the appeal of exploring any </span><i><span>Octopath</span></i><span> game. Find someone with an incredibly good sword that you only have a three percent chance of stealing? You can still try it. Hell, if you’re stubborn, you might even save-scum until you get it. As a result, although much of the narrative is focused and guided, you still have a lot of incentive to explore beyond the bounds of the current moment, pressing through high-level areas until you arrive at a town where you might find some retired hero with just the right loot. It’s yours if you defeat them in a duel. Does it matter if you’re fifteen levels lower? Maybe if you’re smart, you could set yourself up for a long time.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>This aimlessness is a key component of the </span><i><span>Octopath</span></i><span> experience that you can access whenever you need a break. Inquiring about the people in a town might reveal funny stories. You might find a gardener with a crush on a local noble or even someone who once had a party of seven companions like yourself. There’s an entire side of these games that’s about these strange bits of character fluff and the joy of breaking the game by stealing the right dagger far sooner than intended. It’s easy to get lost in the joy of wandering.</span><span><br> </span></p> <h2><b>I’m A Wanderer, I Roam Around</b></h2> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span>, here’s even more reason to wander off and explore towns. Snooping around will lead to recruitable townspeople that you can invite back to Wishvale, and most characters have special benefits that they bring to your town. Someone might be better at working the farm, while recruiting another to work your general store could lower prices on healing items. The town-building in </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> isn’t too complicated but there’s a lot of joy in arranging houses and shops before finding just the right people to handle each new facility is a lot of fun.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Wishvale is where the game’s heart resides. Your character, along with a core group of friends, takes tragedy and from those ashes builds something better. The process of returning from a story chapter to spend a fresh hour or two on Wishvale’s development gives </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>a surprisingly comfortable mood. It’s not </span><i><span>Stardew Valley,</span></i><span> but it’s still a welcome reprieve from the high story stakes. As villains loom on the horizon and the path of heroism seems steeped in blood and pain, there’s always a home to return to and wonderful people to meet.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>That’s the entire “deal” here. This is not a complicated game in terms of themes, but in the face of terrible dark forces and vicious tyrants, </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> ultimately concludes that even the worst times are temporary. Even the most evil of kings can be deposed. All it takes to bring about radical and spectacular change is enough like-minded people. Whether that’s the cast of characters you invite back to Wishvale or the vibrant adventurers that join your actual party.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650020" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650020"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650020">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The Power Of Friendship</b></h2> <p><span>When people talk about </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler</span></i><span>, the refrain seems to be “It seems cool, but why aren’t these characters talking to each other?” and it’s in those moments where I both agree with the criticism and recall the series’ inspiration. Structured like 1994’s RPG powerhouse </span><i><span>Live a Live</span></i><span>, the mainline </span><i><span>Octopath</span></i><span> games have tried to balance eight separate character stories that players can engage with in any order while still weaving a larger tale that satisfies modern audiences. It’s been a difficult act. </span><i><span>Live a Live</span></i><span> managed it by having a wide range of genres represented in its stories; one chapter was a western, while another could have been a riff on </span><i><span>2001: A Space Odyssey</span></i><span>. Every chapter was wildly different.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><i><span>Octopath </span></i><span>games, lacking this kind of variety, have tried many ways to satisfy players. The first game tried to weave a subtle connection between plotlines, but a lack of character interaction held it back and made most stories feel contained in their own small bubbles. The sequel adjusted by implementing chapters where the main characters would team up for miniature adventures together as they unravelled the larger plot. It mostly worked out, but still didn’t grab audiences seeking traditional RPG party banter—even if the dialogue writing was great.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> tries something a bit different, and I think it is the series’s most successful story structure yet. Each chapter focuses on dealing with a different villain, pairing the player with a charismatic ally and side pals as they unravel the mystery of one of the divine rings. Many of these stories seem self-contained genre romps—one is a mafia adventure akin to </span><i><span>Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure Golden Wind</span></i><span>, another massive midgame stretch turns the game into a </span><i><span>Fire Emblem</span></i><span> tale of warring nations. By the end of the game, a core party of eight “main” characters will have emerged to face the final threat.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Supplementing this are a dabbling of recruitable side-characters to fill out party slots. Only a few of these characters have recruitment quests, while many more simply leap to join your adventure with little prompting. These characters are not really present in the plot but rather rounded out through the optional “party chats” that add fresh ways to banter when you return to Wishvale. In the best moments, these scenes will pop up in dungeons or during overworld travel to give characters a chance to chime in on happenings. This is particularly well-used in the final dungeon, which is packed with party discussions about the journeys they had and the strange sights they faced.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>While playing </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span>, one word continuously rings out: charming. There is not a single cliche or trope that this game doesn’t use— and sometimes it uses them multiple times within the course of a single scene. This is a game written by and for people entranced by melodrama, done with a deep and earnest love for storytelling that allows these archetypal moments to land. A traveling companion reveals themself to be a royal in disguise, or someone leaps into the middle of a climactic battle to tell the villain that they underestimated the power of friendship, and I’m still hooked. It always leaves a smile on my face.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650023" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650023"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650023">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>When Words Leave Off, Music Begins</b></h2> <p><span>The glue holding all of this together is the music. Composer Yasunori Nishiki leaps from style to style with an almost insulting ease. A story arc diving into criminal syndicates and vengeful anarchists becomes defined not only by the blood being spilt but by the brassing saxophone wailing that accompanies it. Once the game’s final villain reveals himself, his powerful marching leitmotif starts to suffocate, his evil seeping subtly into dungeon spaces and story scenes before exploding into what might be the most astounding suite of final battle music I’ve ever experienced.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>All of this music, all of this remarkable beauty, was previously locked away on mobile devices. It is an amazing relief that this music has now been preserved in a more accessible game. No other modern RPGs, not even titans like </span><i><span>Metaphor: ReFantazio</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, are operating quite on this level musically. We should be talking about Nishiki in the same breath as other pioneers of the genre like Yoko Shimomura or Yasunori Mitsuda.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> (and really all turn-based RPGs) functions like a stage musical. Players move through a variety of plots—political dramas, operatic stories about demons, and much more—and wait with anticipation for the moment where two characters reach an impasse, or someone wants something with such deep passion that mere words are not enough. On the stage, this would be the moments where characters burst into song. Here, we are thrust into lavish battle sequences that are equally as musical.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I know that the developers understand this because a key moment in </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 2</span></i><span> turned a singing competition into a turn-based battle. The game transforms into a flat, proscenium view where heroes stand on one side and villains line up on the other, hurling words and special attacks at each other. At key moments, an ally might leap in to give you miraculous buffs. Underneath this, there is music. </span><span><br> </span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650018" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650018"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650018">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2>On The Cutting Room Floor</h2> <p><span>Because this is an adaptation of a long-running live service game, there’s a wealth of content that could have been carried over. Hundreds of recruitable characters, special event quests, side stories, challenge fights and more have been added to </span><i><span>Champions of the Continent </span></i><span>over the last half-decade. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> is in the strange position of having to prune all of that into a tighter package.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As a partial remake of&nbsp; </span><i><span>Champions of the Continent</span></i><span>, this game occasionally makes some odd decisions about what to preserve and what to rework. Some changes are quite good. Reworked difficulty and dungeons streamline the gameplay and make this much smoother to progress through. There’s brand new content here including some mysteries that more casual players might never unravel. But there’s also some important things left behind in the original game.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><span>While there’s still a sizable crew of travelers to choose from—I finished the game with about 35 characters that I could use at my leisure—some more prominent characters from the mobile game aren’t here. Chiefly, the initial group of vaguely “canonical” heroes, such as Viola the Thief or Fiore the Warrior, is missing. These were iconic characters such as they might exist in a mid-tier gacha game, and not having them feels strange.</span><span><br> </span></p> <p><span>Plus, a large amount of character content from </span><i><span>Champions of the Continent</span></i><span> simply isn’t here and only a few key travelers have dedicated story content. From character quests to high-pressure coliseum challenges, there are pieces from the original game that aren’t here, resulting in some half-baked party members. Even if they’re still great in a fight.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>My favorite party member was Alexia the Scholar. She’s tossed at players quite early without much of a recruitment process, allowing you quick access to powerful magical spells. Unlike some new characters, she doesn’t have much personal story content and yet her ability to hit bosses with devastating magicks has made her not only my MVP in fights but maybe my favorite scholar in all of the franchise. I wish I knew more </span><i><span>about</span></i><span> her. I like to think maybe I just missed a side-quest but I suspect that’s not really how this all works. Not everyone gets their moment.</span><span><br> </span></p> <p><span>There are also moments where the grandeur is simply too much for the game to handle. Playing on the Nintendo Switch 2, there were key moments where the console struggled to keep up with everything happening on screen. A massive war sequence featuring a redesigned dungeon is dragged down by all those fire particle effects. I loved expanding my town and building out facilities, but as Wishvale grew, I encountered the occasional hitch while running around.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Adapting a game that was made with considerable hardware limitations in mind also means that there are moments where the environmental design and the overall color palette can seem limited compared to, say, 2023’s </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 2</span></i><span>. Some pockets of the game world can feel a bit sparse at first, and the initial dungeon forays are little more than brisk cave adventures.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650019" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650019"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650019">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2>What Is Done In Love Is Well Done</h2> <p><span>The scope of </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>changes drastically as time passes, however. That story, whose stakes eventually rise to the very heavens, is told with such fervor that my grin was always wide even if I’ve seen these kinds of stories told countless times before in dozens of games and I can’t count the number of times I stopped mid-battle to simply appreciate the gorgeous sprite work and astounding music. There is something magical here and a surprising challenge during my playtime was peace with how much I had fallen in love with this game. Was that allowed? Was it okay for me to feel so enraptured?</span></p>

 <p><span>Terrence McKenna, American philosopher and lover of magic mushrooms, has a phrase (advice for people experiencing a powerful psychedelic experience) that I’ve been turning over in my head as I walk away from </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span>: “Don’t give into astonishment.” AAA game</span><span>s often try</span><span> to hide their flaws behind mountains of graphical enhancements and production value. Dazzled audiences eat them up regardless of what messages they hold or value they bring simply because they </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> dazzling. The job of a critic is to slow down a little. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Nevertheless, I stand here astonished. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>is such a powerful distillation of everything that I find appealing about role-playing games that I cannot put my sentiment aside. There’s the occasional shortcoming, a performance issue here or a feature lost in the adaptation, which I personally miss, but anyone thinking this is some half-assed port of mobile gacha trash would be terribly mistaken. The average player can enjoy anywhere from 80 to 100 hours of gameplay, much of which will be graced by some of the most astonishing storytelling in modern gaming.&nbsp; </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>There is a price for this ride although it’s nothing too terrible. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> simply asks you to leave your cynicism at the door. There is a tendency in modern audiences to try to outsmart games. We’ve seen it all and are often very proud of the fact that there’s nary a plot twist we can’t see coming or a detail we can’t ring the “sin” bell about. Gamers are irony-poisoned, and consumers often compete with art, aiming for a chance to say “I knew that was coming.” Does that make you feel clever? I’ll be over here enjoying the show.</span></p> <p><span>When a piece of media as earnest as </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0</span></i><span> comes along—packed with wandering swordsmen, villains ascending to the Heavens, and more—it’s hard not to end up smitten. There is a belief that so long as you tell a story with your head held high and love for your audience, everything else will work out. And the damndest thing about that is that belief is correct. Meet this game with your own child-like sense of earnestness, and you will have an experience that you’ll not forget anytime soon.</span></p>

            <p>Obsidian Entertainment, one of gaming's busiest developers, has announced a delay for this year's remaining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> update. This was to include a Photo mode and New Game Plus mode, among other things, and it will now be held back - as well as enlarged - for the game's anniversary on 18th February 2026.</p>
<p>"If you've been following our Update Roadmap, you'll know we planned to release an update this fall. To break the bad news first: Avowed will not be receiving a fall update," <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1995917924708876634">Obsidian announced on X</a>. "The good news is that we're shifting our efforts toward a larger update coming next February, timed with the anniversary of the game's release.</p>
<p>"This update will include everything originally planned for fall, plus additional features that will make it our biggest update yet. Stay tuned as we head into the new year for more details on what's planned for the Living Lands."</p>

The other two updates this year - one in the spring, one in the summer - brought new abilities, items, NPC behaviours, an arachnophobia-safe mode, and other improvements.</p><p>Avowed was a very pleasant surprise when it arrived at the beginning of the year. A carefree action-adventure which delighted in exaggerated fantasy, it used smaller open-world areas to provide a sandbox exploration experience, and matched them with a tactile and experimental combat system to strong, and very enjoyable, effect. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">I was very complimentary of Avowed in my review</a>.</p>
<p>Avowed wasn't Obsidian's only big RPG released this year, however. The studio also released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outer-worlds-2-review">sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds 2 in October, which Alex reviewed and liked</a>, and the studio released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a>, which was a collaboration with Eidos Montreal. That's an early access release so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-wobbles-while-walking-a-line-between-frustration-and-brilliance">Grounded 2 is still finding its little insect legs</a>, but it's a powerful new foundation for the game and franchise to build on for, potentially, years to come.</p>
