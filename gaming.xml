            <p>Enough time has passed, and enough disappointment endured, that all I can remember of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters">Timesplitters</a> series is a map's worth of landmine-throwing monkeys. It's possible this is an actual traumatic event from my youth, warped into a harmless videogame anecdote by years of cold water therapy and hypnosis. 
</p>
<p>We'll find out on November 23rd, when Cinder Interactive release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters-rewind">TimeSplitters Rewind</a> - a fan revival project that stirs together modes, maps, and story material from all three original TimeSplitters games. Oh look, they've published a trailer. Let's have a watch and see if it dredges up any additional explosive, hairy, hooting memories.

<p>Why, I recognise that electrozapper! I recognise those Tommy guns! Oh god, it was all real. They're coming for me! I hear them pawing and chattering at the windows. I hear them nibbling on sticks of dynamite in the pantry. I smell their hideous banana breath as I settle down to sleep. Save me! No wait, I was remembering a videogame after all. 
</p><p>A good videogame, even. Created by Free Radical and released back in 2000, TimeSplitters is basically GoldenEye but sillier and without the burdensome Brosnan component. It uses time travel and alternate dimensions as an excuse to slap a bunch of daft weapons, maps and characters together. The sequels changed little about this premise beyond adding extra daftness and, eventually, online multiplayer.
</p>
<p>The fan remake has been in development since 2012, having been given the greenlight by then-license owner Crytek, and now runs on Unreal Engine. The developers were in tough straits last year, putting out a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/timesplitters-fan-remake-its-last-hope-after-free-radicals-demise-struggles-amid-incredibly-challenging-industry">call for help</a> as they sought to pack in material from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters-2">TimeSplitters 2</a> and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect. I'm not sure what's happened since, but they've evidently fared better than the creators of the official games. 
</p>
<p>Reporting on TimeSplitters in the years since Future Perfect has been perfectly torturous. Free Radical announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters-4">TimeSplitters 4</a> in 2007, but then they went into administration in 2008, after a dismal response to piss-visor FPS Haze. Crytek subsequently bought Free Radical and rebranded them as Crytek UK. In 2011, it was reported that Crytek might revive TimeSplitters 4, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crysis">Crysis</a> developers poured cold water on the idea in 2012, and eventually closed Crytek UK in 2014.
</p>
<p>A number of Crytek UK staff were transferred to Homefront devs Dambuster Studios, who somehow snuck <a href="https://twitter.com/bigevilboss/status/1378688148855795719">a full 4K remake of TimeSplitters 2</a> into their passable open world shooter Homefront: The Revolution. Then Embracer came along in 2018 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-timesplitters-game-from-deep-silver">bought the rights to TimeSplitters</a> via their Deep Silver label. In 2021, Embracer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/timesplitters-studio-free-radical-reformed-to-make-a-new-game">refounded Free Radical</a>, hiring back TimeSplitters co-creators David Doak and Steve Ellis. Then they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/timesplitters-studio-free-radical-could-close-days-before-christmas-embracer-exec-reportedly-confirms">closed it again in 2023</a> after their entire business went sideways for want of Saudi petrodollars.
</p>
<p>TimeSplitters Rewind will offer 28 maps, 50 arcade leagues, 32 challenges, 41 weapons (inc landmines), 20 arcade game modes, and 91 characters (inc monkeys). That's a lot of game. Congratulations to all at Cinder for seeing it through.</p>

<p>Xbox Live is currently down for many Xbox users on all fronts, like Xbox Game Pass and <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">even the support page</a>. The outage comes at an inconvenient time, as Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds 2 is in the middle of its launch today. As for what the cause is, it looks to be an Azure service outage, as Obsidian Support has <a href="https://x.com/OESupport/status/1983586140478435817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mentioned in a tweet</a>.</p>



<p>Outages for Xbox Live are rare, but when they happen, it causes a lot of problems for many players. Without access to the internet, you can’t play multiplayer, purchase items, or download anything. So, when it goes down, it’s a big deal. Unfortunately, it just so happened to shut down today with The Outer Worlds 2 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield: REDSEC</a> starting up. </p>

That's a big part of the reason why four of the cards are multicolored legendary creatures with abilities that are meant to be built around – though the somewhat novel twist of this particular scene is that most of them feature couples from the end of the show, making it a peaceful epiloque of sorts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to those six cards, we've also got a first look at two "Source Material" cards, which can be found in main set booster packs but are only legal in formats where they were already available. These cards use actual shots from the show as their art, tying classic Magic cards into relevant moments from the series, with their episode number listed at the bottom of the card itself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time we've shown off the Avatar Magic set, as we revealed a hands-on first look at the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-magic-the-gathering-beginner-box-card-reveal-spoilers">Avatar: The Last Airbender Beginner Box</a> back in August. While something like the Scene Box we are revealing today is a solid way to jump into Magic if you are just an Avatar fan more interested in the collection aspect of the game, the Beginner Box is the ideal starting point if you and a friend want to learn how to play from scratch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Card reveals for the set are in full swing through next week, with prerelease events kicking off at local stores on November 14.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review.1338448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With last year’s Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, Square Enix managed to successfully tow the line between recreating that authentic, old-school RPG experience while still offering plenty of modern adjustments so it didn’t feel outdated. Now it’s rounding out the original Dragon Quest trilogy with Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, and it’s every bit as impressive as its predecessor. Individually, both games in this package still stand on their own, and Square Enix has added exciting new content in a way that feels natural. Their combat systems and stories are a product of their time, with simple mechanics and very black and white motivations – but that’s part of the charm, as this approach oozes confidence in keeping things classic. And while I could have done without some returning difficulty spikes, Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is the perfect send off to one of the best RPG trilogies of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the Dragon Quest III Remake, I &amp; II Remake uses Square Enix’s signature HD-2D graphical style that combines expressive 2D characters with gorgeous 3D environments, seen in other games like Live a Live, Octopath Traveler, and Triangle Strategy. It’s the perfect fit that keeps a feeling of authenticity to its retro visuals yet looks stunning in a modern setting. The various castles and dungeons have plenty of detail and lighting that makes exploration captivating, and the surrounding trees and bodies of water in the overworld invoke a sense of grand adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Attack animations have also been greatly improved. My eyes opened wide the first time I saw my characters slice through enemies with a spell that conjured up a storm of beautifully crystalline icicles, or when I slammed another with Dragon Slash and the blood red aura of a drake shot upwards. It’s a visual spectacle that still feels nostalgic and never gets old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Quest I sends you on a quest through the land of Alefgard to defeat the Dragonlord. Given it helped pioneer the genre 40 years ago, this is a straightforward story about good versus evil, so don’t go expecting plot twists left and right. I love a complex RPG story, but it was actually a nice change of pace to play one that didn’t ask me to sympathize with villains or deal with their emotional backstories. All I had to do was turn off my brain and defeat monsters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>New content is cleverly integrated to help pad out the short run time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Dragon Quest I was quite short, clocking in at under 10 hours to complete, but there’s some new content here to help pad out the run time. It’s cleverly integrated, too, as it relates to the events that our heroes in Dragon Quest II will encounter. Additionally, it helps expand on important characters that didn’t have a time to shine in the original such as Rubiss, the creator goddess, which adds even more worldbuilding to Dragon Quest I’s lore. This only adds up to a few more hours of actual gameplay, but it’s refreshing to play an RPG that doesn’t take months to complete.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your protagonist is a descendant of Edrick, the hero from Dragon Quest III – and while he is silent, there’s now a semblance of a personality to him thanks to the HD-2D art style. He’s gullible, falling for a simple “look over there!” trick in the very first dungeon. He’s also selfless, as he helps out the Faeries during a time of need – these ageless creatures serve as important storytellers as the years go by, passing down tales of this game to Dragon Quest II’s main cast, establishing another enticing connection between them. So although he doesn’t say any words, his actions speak loudly, and his character sprite helps convey his traits convincingly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nature of Dragon Quest I’s battle system also means you’ll be spending a lot of time with this lone hero. Combat is a simple affair where you and your enemies take turns making moves. It’s like old-school Pokemon without the Mega Evolutions, Z-Moves, or Gigantimaxing. You won’t see modern mechanics like Persona’s One-More turn system or Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s real-time parrying. It’s raw and unadulterated turn-based combat in its purest form, but that doesn’t make it any less engaging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And unlike in Dragon Quest III where you have a whole party to command, you’re a one-man army in Dragon Quest I. This fundamentally changes how you approach each fight. Suddenly, non-damaging skills like Dodgy Dance, which increases evasion, or Wild Side, which lets you temporarily do the same move twice in a row, become some of the most important in your toolkit. More often than not, every single turn was quite literally the difference between life and death. If I avoided an attack, that gave me another chance to heal my HP instead of losing outright. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Playing solo forced me to consider all my options and be much more methodical.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With an entire party, you can get away with trying to steamroll through battles. One character can dish out all the damage while another could be put on strict healing duty. Here, however, I had to meticulously balance between offense and defense, adapting to every situation as the battle unfolds. Do I go for the extra hit by attacking, or play it safe and heal up? Playing solo forced me to consider all my options and be much more methodical. This made victory against Dragon Quest I’s difficult bosses even sweeter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That difficulty also applies to Dragon Quest I’s normal fights. Since it has random encounters, sometimes you’re at the mercy of RNG. There were instances where I’d trigger a battle against some easier enemies, but some others I’d face off against multiple powerful dragons that could act twice per turn, potentially killing me before I even had the chance to move. Those fluctuating difficulty spikes can be frustrating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is mitigated a bit by its generous autosave system, which activates after every successful battle and lets you reload a file that’s not far off so you can retain most of your progress. There’s also the easy mode called Draky Quest returning from Dragon Quest III Remake, which offers an invincibility option. Despite its name, enemies can still hit quite hard in this mode, especially bosses. The invincibility can be toggled on and off this time as well, which is a nice adjustment since you can now lower the difficulty a bit without being forced to use the invincibility crutch that trivialized Dragon Quest III’s Draky Quest mode.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Setting sail once again</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After revisiting the early but promising origin of the series, Dragon Quest II comes along as a much more story-driven and “traditional” RPG. It has a party-based approach to combat, similar to Dragon Quest III. The difference, however, is that the latter has blank slate party members while the former has characters with vibrant personalities. This alone makes Dragon Quest II my favorite entry in this remake trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story follows four cousins who are all descendants of Dragon Quest I’s protagonist as they rise to save the world from darkness once again. The increased focus on storytelling results in a beefier adventure, taking about 25 hours to finish the main story. As a direct sequel to Dragon Quest I, it also reuses the same overworld map and locations, but the order you visit places is entirely different, preventing it from feeling like a retread. The ship you use to travel that world can even go underwater now, which adds a whole new layer of to exploration, new dungeons and post-game activities, and new story and side content that greatly extends the runtime.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>DQ2's silent protagonist is balanced by your colorful party members.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the main protagonist, the Prince of Midenhall, is silent once again, that’s balanced by how colorful your other three party members are. The Prince of Cannock is your typical naive and bright young boy who sometimes can’t keep his mouth shut, leading to some humorous moments. His sister, the Princess of Cannock, is loyal and level-headed, yet sometimes a bit mischievous given that her brother initially didn't want her to join the party due to her age and lack of experience. Finally, the Princess of Moonbrooke is impulsive, but it’s warranted given Dragon Quest II’s story starts off with her kingdom being decimated by the main antagonist, Hargon. Initially guided by selfish vengeance, it’s compelling to watch her grow to learn that she should be fighting for a better world for everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Princess of Cannock’s role has been greatly expanded in this remake, becoming a full-fledged party member when she had much more limited involvement in the original. Her inclusion feels smooth and effortless, making her a natural fit for the party. I especially loved the sibling camaraderie between her and her brother as they always have each other’s backs. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">George's Favorite Japanese RPG Remakes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As opposed to Dragon Quest III, where you could customize your party to fill whatever combat roles you wanted, Dragon Quest II’s characters have much more defined paths. The protagonist is a pure physical attacker, while the Princess of Moonbrooke specializes in magic. The Cannock siblings are both jack-of-all-trade characters, but there’s enough differentiation within their spells and abilities to make them feel distinct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sigils your party has to travel around the world to collect can impact your combat strategy as well. Previously just useless items that sat in your bag in the original, they now provide passive benefits for the entire party. For example, the Moon Sigil adds a chance for offensive spells to do more damage and healing ones to recover more HP, while the Soul Sigil transforms certain attacks into more powerful versions if a character’s HP is below half. Should I heal a low character and forgo my chance at executing that more powerful attack, or should I risk death and go for broke to get that hit in, hoping to land the killing blow? The Sigils also appear in the Dragon Quest I remake, and these trade-offs are even more pronounced there since it’s a one-man show. They are an excellent way to introduce small but impactful changes to the classic turn-based combat without losing the spirit of the originals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the other entries in this remake trilogy, Dragon Quest II is tough, but having four characters feels perfectly balanced to take on the challenging boss battles and enemy encounters awaiting you. One of the best quality-of-life features that both games have, along with Draky Mode, is the ability to speed-up battles, making animations play out faster. It drastically improves the pace, especially with four characters to individually command.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Helping the world, one step at a time</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, you can also toggle objective markers on or off. In the originals, it was quite easy to get lost since many times you wouldn’t know where to go next. Turning on objective markers makes for a more streamlined adventure where you don’t feel like you’re wasting your time as often. You can also toggle on markers for secret areas on the map, which can contain useful items like gold and weapons if you enter them, which makes them worth exploring. I really liked having these markers available, but it’s nice that you can turn them off, if you want to preserve that old NES-era approach to discovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In both games, you’re now also able to come across Mini Medals, which were introduced in later Dragon Quest entries. These can be found in barrels and rocks throughout the world, smartly incentivizing you to interact with the environment and explore every nook and cranny in dungeons. Turning in the medals to a specific NPC rewards you with incredibly powerful weapons and equipment to help you along your journey, and every single stat increase matters, as it can mean the difference between victory and defeat.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review]]></content:encoded>

Your order for this one will be fulfilled by Amazon but sold by a third-party reseller. The reason we're mentioning the older bundle is because it comes with 50 Mini Boosters, so you'll get 150 cards total. The 2023 Trick or Trade Collection also features 30 Pokemon, many of which are either not in the 2024 lineup or have different artwork.</p></div>                      </div><p>Pokemon Trading Card Game prices have been extremely volatile this year, even at major retailers like Amazon.

Many role-playing games (RPGs) offer a wealth of options to fully customize your character or fine-tune abilities to your playstyle. That lends to a function that allows you to reset or reallocate points in case you made a few mistakes. Well, you might be scratching your head while looking for such an option in this particular title.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Can_you_respec_in_the_Outer_Worlds_2_">Can you respec in the Outer Worlds 2?</a><ul><li><a href="#When_are_you_able_to_respec_">When are you able to respec?</a></li><li><a href="#How_does_this_affect_leveling_your_character_and_companions_">How does this affect leveling your character and companions?</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="Can_you_respec_in_the_Outer_Worlds_2_">Can you respec in the Outer Worlds 2?</h2><p>The short answer is yes, you can respec your character. There's just one very glaring problem: You're given only a single opportunity to do this at the start of the campaign proper.</p><h3 id="When_are_you_able_to_respec_">When are you able to respec?</h3><p>Here's what you need to know about The Outer Worlds 2 respec function:</p><ul><li>When you start the campaign, you're able to select various <strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/outer-worlds-2-best-skills-guide/2900-7183/" data-ref-id="2900-7183">skills</a></strong> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/outer-worlds-2-best-traits-guide/2900-7184/" data-ref-id="2900-7184"><strong>traits</strong></a> while creating your character.</li><li>From there, you'd go through the prologue, which takes place in Horizon Point Station.</li><li>After the prologue, there's a short cutscene where your character is reawakened by a drone companion named Valerie.</li><li>At this point, you can respond with: "[Respec] That's probably for the best. I do feel a little different."</li></ul><p>Choosing this option allows you to reselect your character's skills and traits. This is the only time you're allowed to respec in the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4593096-outer-worlds-2-respec-character-reset-skill-points-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593096" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4593096-outer-worlds-2-respec-character-reset-skill-points-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593096"></a><figcaption>You can decide to respec your character upon completing the prologue.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4593096-outer-worlds-2-respec-character-reset-skill-points-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="How_does_this_affect_leveling_your_character_and_companions_">How does this affect leveling your character and companions?</h3><p>The developers talked about this decision in an <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/17785-outer-worlds-2-director-interview-respec-rpg-choice-consequences" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a> with our friends at RPG Site. According to Brian Adler, game director of The Outer Worlds 2, this was to ensure that players "understand [that their choices are permanent--they matter--and then they think more about their choices."</p><p>This does affect the rest of your progression. Since you can't reallocate points, you really need to be careful when choosing the right quirks for your character. Likewise, you have to consider each companion's build:</p><ul><li>One of two potential companion perks can be chosen every five levels. These passives greatly boost their capabilities, but each choice is permanent.</li><li>You receive companion mod kits when you complete their respective quests. These quirks grant additional boons, but thankfully, you can switch between the available options.</li></ul><p>That does it for our guide on how to respec in The Outer Worlds 2. The system, as it stands, is very restrictive. It looks like we need to wait until the developers change their minds. Alternatively, perhaps a third-party mod that doesn't hamper your playthrough or files would be available soon.</p><p>In the meantime, just so you're well-prepared when making these crucial decisions related to your character's build, we encourage you to take a look at our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/outer-worlds-2-best-skills-guide/2900-7183/" data-ref-id="2900-7183"><strong>best skills guide</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/outer-worlds-2-best-traits-guide/2900-7184/" data-ref-id="2900-7184"><strong>best traits guide</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/full-flaws-list-for-the-outer-worlds-2-best-flaws-to-pick/2900-7182/" data-ref-id="2900-7182"><strong>best flaws guide</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Ranked Battles Season 2 kicks off on <strong>6th November</strong> at 6am UTC and will reward all those that reach Rank K or higher with a Delphoxite Mega Stone — which, as you might expect, can be used to evolve Delphox into Mega Delphox. You can't get the stone anywhere else in the game, so it's well worth taking part if you have this fully evolved Gen 6 starter in your squad.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59gwyxpk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the precise time that the event will get underway in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 10pm (Wed) PST / 11pm (Wed) MST / 12am CST / 1am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 6am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 7am CET / 8am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 3pm JST / 2pm AWST / 5pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>All Pokémon numbered 001-229 in the Lumiose Pokédex (sorry Zygarde) will be able to take part in this one, though all levels will be set to Lv. 50 to keep things as fair as can be.</p>
<p>This means that there's just one week left to nab as many rewards as you can in Ranked Battles Season 1, including the Greninjite. You'll find everything you need to know about the current season, including how to play and the full list of rewards, in our complete guide below.</p>

<p>The news was announced as part of Don't Nod's <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial results</a> for the first half of the 2025-26 fiscal year, which show that revenue has increased by a factor of 3.8 when compared to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">the same period last year</a>.</p>

<p>The studio puts its revenue growth down to the "solid progress of its operational transformation" and the signing of the aforementioned Netflix deal, although I'm not sure the employees who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">lost their jobs</a> as part of that "operational transformation" would be particularly happy with their part in things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-dont-nod-netflix.jpg?itok=OQ2UJ4If 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-dont-nod-netflix.jpg?itok=ekFOSdWg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>studio Don't Nod is making a game with Netflix.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the Netflix deal, Don't Nod simply says it has signed an agreement with Netflix "for the creation of a new narrative video game based on a major IP", and that the studio intends to build on its "recognized expertise in the genre" for the project.</p>

<p>It's not clear what the IP in question is, but my money's on 80s throwback horror property&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things</em>. Back in 2018, it was announced that <i>The Walking Dead</i>'s Telltale <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/telltale-is-making-stranger-things-adventure-game-with-netflix" rel="nofollow">would work on a&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>adventure game</a>, but the project was closed when the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/updatedtelltale-games-begins-closing-entering-assignment-proceedings" rel="nofollow">closed its doors that same year</a>.</p>

<p>Don't Nod's experience with games like&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>,&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Tell Me Why&nbsp;</em>would arguably make them the ideal choice for reviving that project, although since nothing official has been announced yet, this is all just speculation.</p>

<p>The Netflix game will take its place alongside two other in-development projects at Don't Nod, namely narrative-led action-adventure title&nbsp;<em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>and a mysterious game known only as "P14" at present.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-nod-aphelion-financials-2025.jpg?itok=LyhmDavE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-nod-aphelion-financials-2025.jpg?itok=8Y8cGGBh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't Nod is gearing up to release action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>next year.</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, things are perhaps looking slightly more optimistic for Don't Nod, although we'll have to wait and see how&nbsp;<em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>and this tentative Netflix game shape up. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805174/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-xbox-ps5-release-date"><em>Halo </em>coming to PlayStation</a> is one of those events that, five years ago, would have been the tell that “something is not right here” in a show about time travel or alternate universes. Looking at the state of Xbox with its layoffs, game cancellations, price hikes, studio closures, and a soft release schedule light on attention-grabbing titles, it certainly seems like all is not well. But the company’s focus on tearing down the walls of its garden by multi-platforming its biggest exclusives combined with a push to make Xbox games playable on just about anything, denotes a strategy that may be what keeps the green guys in the game for a while longer.</p><div><p>Xbox has been offering exclusives to its competitor’s platforms since last year. The company tested the waters with smaller titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24078043/grounded-pentiment-nintendo-switch-release-microsoft-xbox-exclusive-games"><em>Grounded</em> and <em>Pentiment</em> on the Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079090/hi-fi-rush-ps5-xbox-release-date"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> and <em>Sea of Thieves</em></a> on the PS5 before graduating to bigger, buzzier hits like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610817/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date"><em>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/671575/senuas-saga-comes-to-ps5"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661169/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-release-date"><em>Gears of War</em></a>. <em>Halo</em>, the crown jewel of Xbox exclusives, is merely the apotheosis of this multi-platform strategy.</p></div><p>In May, Sony reported that <em>Indiana Jone</em>s, <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Oblivion Remastered</em>, and <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft">were among the top downloaded games on the PS5</a>. And while they’re not exclusives, other Xbox published games including <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Minecraft</em> were also on the list. “The biggest games in the world are available everywhere,” said Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://mashable.com/article/xbox-president-sarah-bond-calls-console-exclusives-antiquated-mashable">in an interview with <em>Mashable</em></a>. “The idea of locking [games] to one store or one device is antiquated for most people.” Xbox games have enjoyed more success simply by being available to more people. That openness is supported by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">“This is an Xbox” marketing campaign,</a> which aims to bring Xbox content beyond the console itself.</p><p>Xbox console sales have always lagged behind PlayStation and Nintendo and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23425029/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-profitable-revenues">Xbox Game Pass subscriptions are slowing down</a>. The Trump administration’s tariff policy has forced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">all</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">three</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">console makers</a> to raise their prices in contravention of the tradition of consoles getting cheaper as they age. Consumers are increasingly faced with the choice of necessity over luxury.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware">Xbox’s Play Anywhere and Cloud streaming</a> attempt to get around that choice by taking advantage of devices consumers already have. “We are all seeking to meet people where they are,” said Matt Booty, president of Xbox game content and studios, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html">in an interview with the <em>New York Time</em>s</a>. And for the diehard fans who are still interested in having dedicated hardware, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-releasing-a-1000-handheld-microsoft-has-said-its-next-gen-xbox-console-is-going-to-be-a-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience">Xbox plans to have something for them too</a>. “The next-gen console is going to be a very premium, very high-end curated experience,” said Bond in her <em>Mashable</em> interview. Xbox has already debuted its pricey new ROG Ally and Ally X handhelds, and Bond’s comments suggest that the next console will be pricey and powerful.</p><div><p>But Xbox’s new strategy isn’t enough to save it completely if it can’t navigate the problems currently dragging it down. It shuttered a number of studios in the last two years including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">Arkane Austin and <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>developer Tango Gameworks</a>. The company has cancelled its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs"><em>Perfect Dark </em>and <em>Everwild</em></a> projects. <em>Fable,</em> originally scheduled for a 2025 release, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619046/microsoft-xbox-fable-game-delay-2026">has been delayed to 2026</a> while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/713162/microsoft-satya-nadella-layoffs-memo">multiple rounds of layoffs at Microsoft</a> continue to gut its studios.</p></div><div><p>“We are all seeking to meet people where they are.”</p></div><div><p>It’s been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447808/elder-scrolls-6-announcement-reveal-bethesda-e3-2018">six years since Bethesda announced <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em></a> with no word on when more information would be coming. The <em>Fallout </em>franchise is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/fallout-games-continue-seeing-big-player-jumps-after-the-tv-series-success/">experiencing a soft renaissance</a> thanks to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video">the Amazon show</a> but is missing something new for playersy other than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805612/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-release-date-trailer">updates to existing games</a> and<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-reassures-fallout-fans-as-fallout-day-2025-ends-without-a-brand-new-game-reveal-just-know-we-are-working-on-even-more"> a nod from Todd Howard that <em>Fallout 5</em> it’s still coming eventually</a>. And while folks are excited that the original <em>Halo</em> is getting an enhanced version for PS5, the latest entry, <em>Halo Infinite</em>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/halo-infinites-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-year/">was a critical failure</a>. Being where the people are no matter if that’s on a PlayStation or a mobile device seems to be a winning strategy, but none of that matters if they have nothing good to play.</p></div><div><p>It doesn’t help that Xbox also has an image problem right now. A report in <em>Bloomberg</em> revealed that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805280/microsoft-xbox-gaming-profit-targets-layoffs">an unusually high target profit margin of 30 percent</a> has led to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">unpopular price increases in Xbox Game Pass</a> and studio closures. Its new ASUS ROG Ally / ROG Ally X handhelds are priced at an eye-watering $600 / $1000 respectively for what seems to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">a work-in-progress device</a>. In a town hall meeting last year, Matt Booty said Xbox needs, “smaller games that give us prestige and awards,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">the very day after it closed the studio responsible</a> for the short, popular, award-winning <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>. Parent company Microsoft has been a target of the BDS movement, and has fired <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774229/microsoft-fires-another-employee-over-palestine-protests">a number of employees</a> for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643670/microsoft-employee-protest-50th-annivesary-ai">speaking out against the company’s business contracts with the Israeli government</a> and accusing it of “using AI for genocide.” And earlier this week, when the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/807514/trump-white-house-dhs-ice-halo-image-meme-gamestop-console-wars">Department of Homeland Security used<em> Halo </em>in a racist ICE recruitment ad</a> on social media, Microsoft declined to comment.</p></div><p><em>Halo</em> coming to PlayStation isn’t the death of Xbox, but instead the clearest indication yet of the company’s shift in priorities. The console wars have long been over and console makers have to contend with a new reality where their biggest competitors aren’t only each other but also other attention and time-consuming platforms like TikTok, Instagram, <em>Fortnite</em>, and Roblox. Xbox can’t do that if its best offerings are siloed on the smallest install base of the three big consoles. And while it feels weird to see Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 someplace other than a Microsoft device, these moves are necessary to ensure the future of Xbox, whatever that ends up looking like.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/809053/halo-playstation-xbox-multiplatform-strategy]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ring ring. Ring Ring. Ring ring. The stern and bespectacled manager of Blake Manor's hotel appears for the eighth time. You're looking a bit narked there mate, I, the investigatorman, observe. Yes, he says yet again, I'm a bit stressed and busy on account of our telegram machine having gone kaput. Makes sense, I reply, can't think of any other reasons why you might be pissed off. He shuffles back into his office for exactly five seconds. Ring ring.</p>
<p>You're being haunted in the demo for spooky detective puzzler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395520/The_Sance_of_Blake_Manor/">The Séance of Blake Manor</a>, which released in full earlier this week, having had a demo up on Steam for a good while. However, I can confirm having taken in the first night of that demo that you're also give the power to do the haunting yourself.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck me as the intro sequence played were the Dracula vibes. You're not off to Transylvania, but the year is 1897 and private investigator Declan Ward is on his way to a remote manor in Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. He sits in a carriage examining the letter sent to him by an anonymous client, his brow furrowing in the way that only the brows of gothic horror protagonists can furrow.</p><p>He arrives at the manor and is greeted by pale stone walls amid a thunderstorm, because spooky tales like this are contractually obligated to lean into moody weather whenever possible. I jest, as for all its conventionality, the bit of Séance of Blake Manor I've played is a beautifully rendered and assembled love letter to classic spookage. Your first task is to work out whether the girl you're seeking, Evelyn Deane, has actually left the building.</p>
<p>To get there, you'll need to examine objects, quiz people, and gradually string together enough evidence to put together a hypothesis. Think something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-of-the-obra-dinn">Return of the Obra Dinn</a>, but a bit less unorthodox in terms of styling. Signs up hint that a séance is being hosted at the hotel and I'm sure neither that nor the ghostly figures I keep seeing hint at anything remotely concerning going on round these parts.</p>
<p>Thus far, I've distracted myself by relentlessly pressing the hotel desk bell to summon the manager. I need to get a move on, because each little bit of investigating takes time off the clock, and you only get an hour of in-game time to solve this first mystery. Fine, I guess I'll do something useful and ask him about the creepy statue outside this time. Ring Ring.</p>

            <p>
It is more than commonplace these days for games to get some kind of delay, in fact it's surprising when the big boy names don't get one, like, say, GTA 6, which was meant to be out this year, but got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">pushed to 2026</a>. But it's rare that most games take more than 13 years to develop, an amount of time which retrofuture moonbase <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/routine">Routine</a> did in fact take. Except now its release is right around the corner!
</p>
<p>
Yes, yes, I know, you'll believe it when you see it, but as it currently stands developer Lunar Software says that the game is slated for release this coming December 4th. That's just over a month away, as long as the way calendars work hasn't changed since I started writing this, a closeness that would make it surprising if the game received further delays. So, perhaps you'll be able to actually experience the game for yourself by the end of the year!

<p>
If you've not heard of Routine before, it's one of those survival horror games, one where you explore an abandoned moonbase. There's mysterious, quite creepy robots that want to kill you (of course!), puzzles to solve (of course), and an aesthetic based around the idea of what the future might have looked like from an '80s perspective (of course?).
</p><p>
It took so long to make in part because the devs simply couldn't work on it for a while, both for financial reasons and a general unhappiness with where it was going. Routine did get a re-reveal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/retrofuturistic-moonbase-horror-game-routine-is-actually-still-coming">back in 2022</a>, now with added support from publisher Raw Fury, with a couple of engine changes mixed in somewhere amongst the decade and a bit development period.
</p>
<p>
Doom 2016 composer Mick Gordon also worked on the soundtrack, but he did leave the project in 2024 due to scheduling issues - a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/606160/view/582778112589168937?l=english">recent Q&amp;A</a> explained that since that point the audio and audio implementation is being handled by "other people."
</p>
<p>
I do quite vibe with the aesthetic Routine offers up, I have quite a distaste for that clean, shiny look you see so much of in sci-fi these days, and retrofuturism always has that bit of texture I crave. But, well, it did take 13 years to make, so I have some reservations! Good thing I only learned about it from the re-reveal, so I don't have those 13 years of expectations like some of you might. On that note, good luck, Lunar Software!

<p>For reel</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Ever since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> was first announced for Switch earlier this summer, we've been eager to find out how the award-winning photo puzzle game would hold up on the Nintendo hybrid. Well, today we learned that we don't have long to wait.</p>
<p>Thunderful and Sad Owl Games have announced that Viewfinder will arrive on the Switch eShop on <strong>3rd December</strong>, slotting itself into the same week as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and every other game under the sun, it seems.</p>
<p>What's worse, we're very excited to play this one too. Viewfinder sees you adventuring through a trippy land, using photos from your magical camera to alter perspectives and bend the laws of physics.</p>
<p>You want to cross a bridge? Take a photo of a bridge and line it up with your surroundings. You want to bypass a fence? Take a picture of an open space and step through it. It's the kind of gameplay that's difficult to visualise until you see it in action, but the above trailer provides a pretty comprehensive introduction.</p>
<p>Here's a brief game summary and a handful of screens from Thunderful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Viewfinder, you take photos, find paintings and sketches, then place them in the world to have them become a fabric of its reality, reshaping the environment around you. This unique mechanic delights in the way it plays with perception, evolving in surprising directions that keep players challenged with every new puzzle they encounter.</p>
<p>Along with the game’s engaging puzzles, Viewfinder welcomes you into a vibrant landscape with mysterious origins. Uncover the game’s secrets to find yourself unravelling a story that connects to our ever changing world, human experience and relationships, meaningful and misguided passion for change, and overcoming loss.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Viewfinder picked up award nominations and wins at the BAFTAs, The Game Awards, The Golden Joysticks and more after its release back in 2023, so we're very excited to hear that we won't have long to wait before we finally get our hands on it.</p>
<p>Bring on a busy December!</p>

If you miss the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> as much as you do the mottled grass textures of Hyrule Field, you will perhaps enjoy Mouseward, which is available now in pre-alpha form. It's a "soulslike collectathon" from the people behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-sols">Void Sols</a>, which Katharine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/void-sols-is-an-atmospheric-and-highly-customisable-soulslike-for-people-who-are-rubbish-at-soulslikes">found to be</a> "an atmospheric and highly customisable Soulslike for people who are rubbish at Soulslikes". Mouseward seems similarly forgiving, for all its grim talk of death being "a lesson, not an end".

Yes, enemies respawn when you perish, but you get to keep all your accumulated progression points and spend them right away at the most recent campfire, care of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>-style astral level-up menu. Yes, the world looks a bit like Anor Londo, nested at the bottom of a well of Erdtrees, but it also looks like one of those N64 games you played, decades before you were exposed to the hellish clockwork of "deliberate, stamina-based combat". The visuals are at once chubby and cadaverous, like a mix of Ocarina of Time and Medieval. Here's a trailer.

The premise is that a "calamitous starfall" has brought a kingdom to ruin. You are a rodent Chosen Undead, rising from your grave to mend the world by tracking down every last scattered piece of star. Along the way, there will be blocking, backstabbing, archers, ambushes, secret entrances, plunging attacks, and melancholy, murderous badgers. In precisely that order, in fact.</p><p>I've just finished the opening bonfire loop in the pre-alpha, and I soulslike this a lot. Simple, tight controls, good atmosphere, and the enticing sense of a developer taking a genre back to formula - and possibly taking it somewhere new, once the tutorial segments are past. I'm interested to discover how the Fromsoft template might have to shapeshift to accommodate the collectathon focus and nods to fifth generation console action-platformers. Anyway, <a href="https://finite-reflection.itch.io/mouseward">you can find that Mouseward pre-alpha on Itch.io</a>. The game also has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188410/Mouseward/">Steam page</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The infrastructure of the modern social media landscape means that every so often someone clips out a section of a modern blockbuster that <a href="https://kotaku.com/yellow-paint-debate-ff7-rebirth-demo-resident-evil-4-1851249608">uses bright yellow paint</a> to guide the player where to go and says something like, “This is why games suck now.”</p> <p>So it was with <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>, whose prodigious use of yellow hues to tag climbing ledges and other footholds for progressing the adventure sparked minor controversy back during launch. Was it a lazy shortcut or clever game design? The game’s director has now weighed in on the subject.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">THE YELLOW PAINT VIRUS HAS INFECTED FF7 <a href="https://t.co/calN0dqHf4">pic.twitter.com/calN0dqHf4</a></p> <p>— Dave NewBlood (@DaveOshry) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveOshry/status/1755469586999505137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I get there is a debate about that, whether that fits with that world or not, whether some people want it, some people don’t,” Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/oh-no-the-yellow-paint-debate-is-back-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-says-there-is-definitely-a-need-for-that-kind-of-thing-and-the-only-real-question-is-about-how-its-done/">told <em>Gamesradar</em></a> in a recent interview. “I think as a game, there is definitely a need for that kind of thing in a lot of ways. I think obviously different developers experiment, try different things about what works best, what fits best, the right way of doing that in their game.”</p>

 <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>The need to guide players around from a gameplay perspective and show them what can be done, what they need to do, there are definitely times where that is needed. So I think obviously there is more of a debate about how it’s done, what level and what works. And there’ll still be people who say, “no, that doesn’t fit at all. We don’t like that.” That’s fine, but I think there is definitely a need there, and it’s something that is definitely worth looking at.</p></blockquote>   <p>“There’s definitely a need there” suggests Hamaguchi has seen enough people running around lost during playtesting to know that yellow paint, while far from the most elegant solution, is preferable to people getting stuck and frustrated. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is full of what one friend described as “bird poop” to mark its climbing ledges, and <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is even more gratuitously slathered in liquid caution tape than <em>Rebirth</em>. None of us&nbsp;<em>want</em> yellow paint until <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1764392813255410002">we absolutely&nbsp;<em>need</em></a> yellow paint.</p> <p>Such is the push and pull over immersion in hyper-realistic open-world RPGs (or in the case of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, visually messy linear corridors) that sometimes the best way to keep you ensconced in the fantasy is to momentarily shatter it with non-diegetic signposting. Hamaguchi’s position on the subject won’t put an end to the debate; we’ll see if the next <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> game implements a different solution or our old friend the yellow paint monster returns.</p>

              <p>The week is seven days long. <a href="https://youtu.be/kle2xHhRHg4">Don’t let The Beatles confuse you otherwise</a>. And if we were all just chilling in caves, eating bugs, and painting on the walls, the seven days wouldn’t matter. But that ain’t the world we live in. Instead, we have jobs and obligations. And that means the days that make up the week and its fun cousin, the weekend, are not all equal. Some days just suck, while others are so great we write songs about them.</p> <p>Anyway, we here at <em>Kotaku</em> decided it was time for someone to sit down and rank all seven days of the week. Finally, when pressured to provide an opinion on the concept of Thursday, you’ll have an answer you can use. Or when you ask ChatGPT about Thursday, it can scrape this post and provide our words to you. Whichever works, I guess. Let’s get to the ranking!</p>

 <h2>1. Saturday</h2> <p>Yeah, not a surprise, but Saturday is the best day of the week. For those of you who work a five-day week, Saturday is the crown jewel of the seven days. When you wake up Saturday, you are still feeling good from Friday, you don’t have to worry about your job, and you know that tomorrow is Sunday, another work-free day. Pure bliss. Nothing beats a perfect Saturday.</p>

 <h2>2. Friday</h2> <p>“Wait”! I hear you say. “Isn’t this a work day?” Yes, it is. But Fridays are both the end of the work week and the glorious start of the weekend. You have two days of doing nothing to look forward to, and one of those days is Saturday aka the best day. It’s hard not to feel excited and happy as Friday afternoon rolls around. It ain’t part of the weekend, but it’s still great.</p>

 <h2>3. Sunday</h2> <p>Sundays are strange. Sure, it follows Saturday, and that’s nice. And you don’t have to work, which is also nice. But Sundays are filled with dread. Your job is looming closer than ever. Monday is nearly here, and soon you’ll be back at your job. It seriously kills Sunday’s vibes. Still, the weekend is the weekend, so Sunday makes it into the top three.</p>

 <h2>4. Thursday</h2> <p>Oh, Thursday, you poor bastard. Doomed to forever be Friday-eve, you offer little more than the promise that soon things will get better. And that’s nice, but you are still another day of work sandwiched between more work. And that makes you a bit of a buzzkill. Sorry.</p>

 <h2>5. Wednesday</h2> <p>Wednesdays can often feel like the longest day of the week. You’re stuck in the middle of it all, two days removed from the fun of last weekend and 48 hours away from Saturday. This is the mountaintop of the week. From here, you can see all that came before and will come after, and while that provides a nice milestone, it’s also kind of a downer.</p>

 <h2>6. Monday</h2> <p>Many malign Mondays, often mocking the miserable start of the week. And make no mistake: Mondays suck. However, at least Monday follows the weekend directly. You’re still feeling good. Sure, the week is ahead of you, but the weekend is still a recent memory in your heart. It could be worse. It could be…</p> <h2>7. Tuesday</h2> <p>Fuck you, Tuesday. Sure, you are technically one step closer to the upcoming weekend than Monday, but that’s all this crappy day has to offer. There’s still so much week left and you’re already tired from Monday, a very bad day. Now you have to work more and you have three more days of this shit, too? Bleh. Gross. Horrible. Go to hell, Tuesday. That’s where you belong.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>, the upcoming PvPvE extraction shooter from developer Embark Studios (<i>The Finals</i>) is out tomorrow. I recently had a chance to sit down with the game’s design director, Virgil Watkins, to chat about the brutal nature of extraction shooters, how <i>Arc Raiders</i> seeks to appeal to folks skeptical of the genre’s hardcore nature, and, of course, whether my playstyle is toxic.</p> <p>Below is the transcript of our discussion about <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ approach to making the extraction shooter more friendly without compromising its intensity.</p> <p><i>This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity</i>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639881" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639881"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639881">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: So in <i>Arc Raiders</i> I can sprint, I can walk, I can dodge out of the way of incoming fire, I can swap the camera on my shoulder. But why can’t I lay down?</p>

 <p><b>Virgil Watkins, Design Director on </b><b><i>Arc Raiders</i></b>: Well, I mean, one, it is a massive animation hurdle to get that to behave correctly in all the states, and then two, just kind of the way the game is balanced and the pacing of it. Having people default to proning and hiding kind of disrupts that.</p>

But overall, it just didn’t feel like it fit with the game loop we’ve got.</p>

 <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: Gotcha. Okay. So extraction shooters tend to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">appeal to a very specific crowd</a>. Are you guys content with a game that mostly appeals to a hardcore niche?</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Is So Good I’m Worried It Will Completely Take Over My Life</a></p>

 <p><b>Watkins</b>: Once we pivoted to an extraction game, approachability became a key design tenet. Everything we have done up to this point tries to keep that in mind wherever possible, as long as it does not undermine that core extraction experience. We’ve put in a lot of systems that can act as a safety net or can soften the blow of failure. We have things like our quests, which many of them do not require you to extract.</p>

 <p>We have the safe pocket, which lets you put quest items that you might need in there and make incremental progress toward that goal. We have things in the meta game like our feats or trials which will come out with the launch of the game that, again, by progressing on some of these things, you can do it without extracting from the round, which is really nice to, even in that moment of failure, still understand that you’ve made some progress and earned something as a result.</p>

   <p>And then on the other side of it, we have what we kind of call “economic safety nets.” So we have the free loadout, which has no strings attached, you can just always choose it and have kind of a minimum quality of play while you’re using those kits. And then we have Scrappy the rooster, and he’ll give you a drip feed of materials so that you’re able to craft a few things as you go. And we’ve actually tuned him so that if you’re having a bad run of luck, he provides you with a touch more crafting materials compared to someone who’s being highly successful.</p>  <p>What we found in earlier tests is that highly successful players didn’t need [Scrappy as much]. But then the people who actually needed [the extra resources] were the ones who were getting left behind. So with all of that in mind, we wanted to shave off the those pointy edges [of the genre] so players who are maybe more nervous around this type of game or are apprehensive about how punishing it can be can fall back on these things and still feel like they’re capable of having fun and playing the game in the intended fashion as opposed to being down to just your knife and running it and going “I hope this works, I guess.”</p> <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: Cool. Am I a bad person for camping the elevator to kill players as they try to extract?</p>

 <p><b>Watkins</b>: [laughs] I mean. No. It is a tactic. It’s been an interesting topic around that because we try to provide enough alternate ways out, and of course, the amount of extraction points reduces as the round goes on. You have the hatch keys that you can use to go out the quieter way. Of course, extraction camping is a concern in any of these games, but when we go and look at our telemetry for how players actually behave around extractions, the incidence rate, as far as we can tell, of extraction camping is incredibly low.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639882" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639882"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639882">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>What you’ll tend to see is people making a decision, “oh, I hear [the elevator coming up]. Maybe I’ll go for it.” But in terms of like, literally just waiting there, it is a way to play and if you’re successful at it, I imagine you can get a decent bump in [loot] if you’re a good enough player to hold out there, but it tends to be that you’ll draw more attention [by camping]. Flares go off from people you’re fighting, drones get curious and they come investigating. So, hopefully things are tuned and positioned around those extractions enough where it’s not like, say, a perfect strategy, but it’s certainly an opportunistic one.</p>

 <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: Where do you think the line is between aggressive playstyles and toxicity?</p> <p><b>Watkins</b>: Yeah, that’s a tough one, right? I think, because we have some social systems, we have emotes, we’ve got proximity voice, I certainly think players could, if they so chose, turn those into a toxic element. We’ve seen a couple of instances where people bring like 10 defibs [items used to revive another player quickly] and then revive people and then kill them again, so we put in a few things like being able to accept revives rather than being at the whim of someone else. You should always have some agency over yourself where you can choose to surrender instead of being subjected [to abuse].</p> <p>But yeah, of course it’s a risk once you give players this level of autonomy. There’s gonna be people who take advantage of it.</p>

 <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: What’s your ideal run in a round of <i>Arc Raiders</i>?</p> <p><b>Watkins</b>: I tend to play in a non-hostile manner such that I won’t necessarily seek out fights, but I will take them if they start it with me. So I like trying to take a more contemplative approach. I’ll try to use where the drones are or aren’t, what the drones are doing and noticing, and I’ll use that information.</p> <p>I tend to be a very evasive player. Even if someone starts a fight with me, if I’m not very, very confident that I can win that fight in that moment, I will do enough to make them panic, and I will disengage and move somewhere else entirely, and maybe take the fight again from a different angle, or just disappear and let them run around and try to find me.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639896">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s kind of like Batman or something. I just disappear and then I’m doing something else, which I find really fun, trying to work around groups of players to still get what I need while taking fights when possible.</p> <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: There are a lot of bushes and hiding spots in the game. At what point is a hiding spot unfair?</p>

 <p><b>Watkins</b>: What we’ve tried to do with our combat balance is that we have a longer TTK (time-to-kill) and alongside approachability, one of the primary tenets of designing this game is that you should always have time to understand and react to what is happening to you.</p> <p>And that does not guarantee that you will succeed in your reaction, but you should at least be capable of ascertaining what led to [a bad] situation and what could have changed the outcome next time you go into that situation.</p>

 <p>So on even footing, the way the TTK is balanced, if you’re full health and full shields, and so am I, if you attack me first, there’s a solid chance that I will probably be able to back away, disengage, do something to kind of mitigate that situation, because we really like when our fights are a lot of back and forth rather than just instantaneous.</p> <p>And of course, if you’re on super low health, then sure, you might get into a bad situation, but I think that comes along with trying to soften the blow of defeat. You should be capable of running again and learning in a more rapid manner.</p>

 <p>But I guarantee there’s gonna be places people find where they’re like, yeah, this is actually a really prime hiding spot, and I can do a lot from here and I can’t be touched. But that is where, again, things like noise traps, how much attention drones pay to noise and your movements and things, so wherever possible, we give a lot of clues to people moving into spaces or through spaces. If they’re paying attention, they can probably pick up on the fact that someone’s nearby, and even your characters once in close proximity to them, you’re hearing the foley of their outfit and their footsteps.</p> <p>So unless someone’s literally holding exactly still, we try to give as many opportunities as possible for you to be aware of others around you.</p> <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b><i>: </i>How much time do you anticipate a player spending on <i>Arc Raiders</i> in a week?</p> <p><b>Watkins</b>: I would guess, just for the type of game this is and the type of player I expect to go on, it’s probably something on the order of like four to 10 hours would be my personal guess. There’s enough different things to do that you, you’re not literally just doing like one run over and over. You’re progressing a quest or crafting that new thing or going after this challenge.</p>

 <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: Has anything surprised you during the technical tests?</p> <p><b>Watkins</b>: Certainly the clips coming of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oalxph/straight_out_of_a_horror_movie/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">the Leaper going after people</a> have been very, very entertaining.</p>   <p>Like, of course, we already kind of knew what it could do, but I think so many of us [at Embark] are already familiar with how it maneuvers and the way it tries to engage that I think we almost inherently play around that just from the outset. Whereas players now are coming into contact with it for the first time and it’s causing them to lead it into and engage it in very bizarre locations that still work out to be very compelling.</p>   <p>And that was just kind of a happy coincidence. Like we did some changes to it so that it was more capable of navigating places like that and it just worked out now, and I’m pretty excited to see once players get it in the other maps with some other very unique geometry and setups, how it’s gonna surprise them.</p> <hr> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 30, 2025.</p>

<p>One of Nintendo’s anti-Palworld monster-capture patent applications has been rejected by the Japanese Patent Office as it “lacked an inventive step”.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have been battling PocketPair, the publisher of Palworld, in a patent infringement lawsuit for some time now. Most recently, we had heard a patent expert say that Nintendo is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-is-so-wrong-it-hurts-about-mods-not-counting-as-prior-art-says-patent-expert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“so wrong it hurts”</a> regarding mods not being counted as prior art. Now, prior art is the main reason why Nintendo’s patent application was rejected in Japan. </p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-anti-palworld-patent-rejected-due-to-prior-art-references-including-ark-monster-hunter-4-and-more">Nintendo’s Anti-Palworld Patent Rejected Due to Prior Art References Including ARK, Monster Hunter 4, and More</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesFray</a>, Nintendo’s rejected patent application, 2024-031879, was a subclaim of one of the anti-Palworld monster-capture patents and a parent of another. It was dismissed for lack of an inventive step, meaning it did not involve an innovative idea that was not an obvious combination of two or more pre-existing concepts. Several games were cited as prior art references. </p>



<p>The patent office determined, through a third-party submission of prior art, that this step existed before Nintendo’s December 2021 priority date, with games such as Studio Wildcard’s ARK, Capcom’s Monster Hunter 4, Pocketpair’s Craftopia, Kantai Collection, and Pokémon GO using it. However, the refusal was non-final, meaning Nintendo can either abandon this patent or file a new patent application with amended claims. </p>
