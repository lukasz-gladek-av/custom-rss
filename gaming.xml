			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-talos-principle-reawakened-launches-on-april-10-for-playstation-5-xbox-series-pc/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> came with a new expansion for players to dig their puzzle teeth into called In the Beginning, on top of everything else in the remaster.</p>
<p>The 18 puzzles in the new expansion are some of the toughest in the entire Talos Principle series, which is a credit to developer Croteam and the Talos Principle community since 16 of those 18 puzzles were designed <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fhow-to%2Fthe-talos-principle-reawakened-in-the-beginning-eclipse-puzzle-guide%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2806640%2Fview%2F519709875052217858&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=856e40b29b36265e272b3ed9bb5c7e57&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">in collaboration with members of the game's community</a>.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through completing the Flying Cubes puzzle in the Egypt section of the In the Beginning expansion in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Flying Cubes Puzzle Guide</h2>
<p>Flying Cubes is a fun puzzle until it's suddenly not, and you're stuck trying to fit the last piece of it together so you can walk out of the puzzle area with your tetromino in tow. 3/4 of the puzzle is relatively easy for any Talos Principle veteran to solve. It's that last bit that takes a little extra finagling you might not immediately think of.</p>
<p>If you just want a hint, I'll say that crossing the beams is your friend here. If you want the solution, read on.</p>
<h3>Phase One</h3>
<p>As in many Talos Principle puzzles, you first need to acquire all the tools you need to solve the rest of the puzzle.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>After entering the puzzle area, look immediately to your left and climb the ladder, where you'll find a jammer and a pressure switch. Grab the jammer, step on the switch, and watch a cube fly through the air onto another pressure switch. Now you understand where the puzzle gets its name and the final objective. You need to get four boxes to fly through the air, land on the four pressure switches, and open the tetromino gate.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jammer in hand, walk off the ledge, fall back to the ground, and then head further into the rest of the puzzle area, where you'll see two blue barrier shields, one to your left and one in front of you. Use the jammer on the one to your left. Walk past the barrier you just jammed, and you'll see the other two items you need to solve the puzzle. One connector is just out in the open, and another is trapped behind a blue barrier shield.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use the connector out in the open to free the trapped one by connecting the blue beam with the blue node that turns off the barrier trapping the other connector. Once the shield is down, grab the connector. For simplicity, from here on, I'll be saying C1 for connector 1 and C2 for connector two.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place C1 on the pressure switch that sits immediately in front of the red laser and connect it to the red beam. Grab C2 and connect it to C1 and the other two red nodes in your immediate vicinity. One of those nodes will make your jammer redundant, as they keep the same shield barrier off. Now you can pick up the jammer and bring it to the other side of the barrier so that you have the jammer, C1, and C2 on the same side of the barrier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two</h3>
<p>All right, at this point, you have all the tools you need for the puzzle in one place. As you read through the rest of this guide, you'll see that you can do these next parts in whatever order you want, but the way I'm going to lay it out is that you'll do the most confusing part first, so you can breeze through everything else.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>You'll notice that the red nodes you have lasers connected to are both keeping shield barriers off. Take the jammer and walk it across the opposite side of the far shield barrier, the one that leads to a corner of the puzzle area, where you'll find two fans blocking your path to a box and a blue laser behind a window connecting to a blue node that keeps one of the fans operational. Use the jammer to redundantly keep the same shield barrier down that the red laser is already disabling. Make sure you're using it on the inside of the puzzle area with the fans and the box, so you can walk both C1 and C2 to where the jammer is, as you'll need them both for these next steps.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up C1, connect it to the far red node, and place it on the opposite side of the wall where it would directly clash with the blue beam keeping one of the fans on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up C2 and connect it to where the blue beam is coming from and C1. When you put it down, you'll create a loop that cuts off the beam keeping one of the fans on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the jammer, and jam the other fan so you can grab the box with both fans turned off. Use the jammer and both connectors to bring the box to the main puzzle area by going through the same steps you used to get to the box in the first place. Then use the jammer to turn off the shield barrier at the top of the stairs.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Walk the box to the top of the stairs and place it directly in front of the fan before stepping on the pressure switch to the right of the fan to activate it. This will send the box flying, where it will land on one of the four pressure switches, which will open the gate to the tetromino.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Three</h3>
<p>Grabbing that box and getting it to its pressure switch final destination took me the longest to figure out and is the most confusing part of this puzzle. Everything from here on out is pretty simple and also pretty easy to spot now that you've been around the whole of the puzzle area.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the jammer to disable the shield barrier on the left side of the main puzzle area, where you went to grab C1 and C2. You can leave the jammer as is the for the rest of the puzzle.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>The last two boxes are sitting on top of elevated towers, and they're already ready to be launched by fans activated by blue and red laser nodes. Grab C1 and connect it to the blue laser and the blue node on the far right side of the puzzle to launch the first box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and place it in front of the red beam on the pressure switch and connect C1 to the red laser. Grab C2 and connect it to C1 and the red node on the left side of the main puzzle area to launch the final box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>With all four boxes on the elevated pressure switches, the gate to the tetromino will drop, and you can grab your prize.</p>

Casting pretense aside, he took his anti-vigilante stance to dictatorial levels by killing the police commissioner and trapping opposing political figures as well as the Punisher (Jon Bernthal) in an underground wine cellar, and placing the greatest city in the world under martial law. D’Onofrio took to X hours after the Season 1 finale was released to inform fans that shooting for the next season has already begun, and sharing a behind-the-scenes photo of Fisk in his cocaine-white power suit. In his <em>Variety</em> interview, he also revealed how Punisher escaping Fisk’s cage will affect the next season.</p><p>“I think that he does know that he’s gone. Eventually, he knows that he’s not there anymore. So far it’s a small part of the second season.

What we seemingly shouldn’t expect is for his captor to make an appearance, as D’Onofrio says it would be “news to me” if Kingpin appeared. <br></p><p>Then again, I’m sure Kevin Feige and the Marvel brain trust have taught their lead talent how to hide future plans behind lies. So don’t be surprised if Punisher and Kingpin finally square off when the<em> Punisher</em> special feature is released in 2026, around the time of the second season of <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Discord is experimenting with a new age-verification policy that would require users to prove their age to see material Discord considers harmful. The verification process is currently undergoing trial in the United Kingdom and Australia, though Discord didn't say how long the test period will last or when--or if--it will roll out in other countries.</p><p dir="ltr">The age verification process applies to all devices, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-comes-to-xbox-for-everyone-today/1100-6507437/" data-ref-id="1100-6507437">Discord on Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-on-ps5-how-to-link-accounts/1100-6511123/" data-ref-id="1100-6511123">PlayStation 5</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">When a user tries to interact with material that Discord flags with its sensitive media filter, such as potentially explicit images, or tries to change their sensitive media filter settings, a pop-up appears that tells them to verify their age before they can continue. Discord provides two ways to verify: a face scan using your device's camera or using a mobile device to scan an ID card, such as a driver's license. The process reportedly takes just a few minutes, and you receive a direct message from Discord once it's finished that tells you which age group you're in.</p><p dir="ltr">This system invites privacy concerns, though Discord said in an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Verify-Age-Group" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FAQ section</a> about the new requirement that the data users provide for verification is not stored by Discord or its face-scan vendor. The face scan option is "on-device," which means the vendor doesn't collect or store biometric data. Age verification for Discord is a one-time thing. After the system places a user in a specific age group, that's where they stay until they choose to re-verify. Discord said users can choose to re-verify their age at any time if they believe the system placed them in the incorrect category or, presumably, once they get older and the category no longer applies.</p><p dir="ltr">If the verification process decides your age category is below the minimum required to have a Discord account, it'll automatically ban you. Banned users will have to file an appeal using Discord's underage appeals process to try reversing the ban.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-builds-for-last-epoch-1-2-tombs-of-the-erased.1166115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/last-epoch-1-2-builds-best<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch 1.2 Tombs of the Erased brings a sentinel rework, Weavers endgame Faction, revamped Monolith of Fate experience, and much more. This is Last Epoch’s biggest update yet and IGN has teamed up with the ARPG experts at Maxroll to prepare detailed guides on all of the new content along with excellent builds for leveling and endgame alike. Before we get to the builds, here’s all the new stuff coming in 1.2:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New 1.2 Tombs of the Erased Content</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/01-new-content-woven-faction-1744819698558.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Woven Faction</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest changes in 1.2 is the new Woven Faction. They provide a deeper endgame experience by adding Woven Echoes to your Monolith of Fate. Begin interacting with them by finding a Cemetery of the Erased on your Echo Web, after completing the mini-boss at the end you can enter the Haven of Silk and speak to Masque to join the faction. Gain ranks with the Woven Faction by completing Woven Echoes to add points to your Weaver Tree then use these points to customize your endgame experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Champions &amp; Mini-bosses</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As you explore the Echo Web, you may also find some fun new surprises in the form of Champions, and new weaver mini-bosses. The Champions are larger, more powerful versions of rares, immediately visible due to their angry red glow. Defeating them is tricky but if you persevere you’re sure to be duly rewarded. There are also several new mini-bosses you can encounter in 1.2, so keep an eye out for a scary-looking boss as you explore the Monolith of Fate.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Set Item Crafting and LP Changes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch has an in-depth <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/resources/beginner-crafting-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crafting System</a> where you use Affix Shards, Glyphs, and Runes to heavily customize your items. This popular system is straighforward to understand and has a fair bit of depth to master. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1.2, crafting in Last Epoch gets even better. You can break Set items down to obtain crafting shards and then use those to craft set bonuses on your items. This gives you the best of both worlds where you have the power of a set bonus and the flexibility to craft your own gear with the affixes you need. EHG has also made a big change to how you use Unique items with Legendary Potential (LP) to craft Legendary items. In the past, when interacting with the Eternity Cache the modifiers added to your Legendary Items were chosen at random. So if you used a 1LP Unique, you get a Legendary with 1 random affix, if you use a 2LP Unique, you get a Legendary with 2 random affixes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, if you complete a Temporal Sanctum of level 2 or higher you can choose 1 affix to transfer to your Legendary! This means you get to pick what you want when using a 1 LP Unique, if you use an item with 2-4 LP, then you get to pick 1 affix and the remaining modifiers are chosen at random.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Uber Aberroth</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch’s ultimate boss is getting even tougher with 1.2. In addition to the normal version of this encounter, there is a special Uber Aberroth encounter. Very little is known about this foe beyond the fact that he is the most dangerous being in Eterra. Challenge him at your own risk!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1.2 Tombs of the Erased Leveling Builds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Use Maxroll’s leveling builds to cruise through the campaign with ease. Season 2 introduces the ability to switch your Mastery so you can level with the most efficient build for the campaign, then respec your mastery upon reaching the endgame. Here are the best ways to level each of the game’s 5 classes, straight from Last Epoch’s top speed runner Terek!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/primalist-build-1744820944042.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Primalist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The best way to level a Primalist is by playing Druid. This build has good damage, it’s very cozy as you can use transformations to spam your skills during the campaign, and gets quite tanky thanks to Werebear form.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/mage-build-1744820963651.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Mage</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Spellblade mastery seamlessly weaves blades and spells to decimate foes using Shatter Strike. You are reliant on spells in the early game but once you get Shatter Strike most of your time is spent rotating between Shatter Strike for damage and Mana Strike to recover your resources to continue dealing damage. Don’t be fooled by the Mage’s health, you can easily generate tons of Ward just by hitting enemies.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sentinel-build-1744820980104.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Sentinel</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot off the rework, Sentinel is stronger than ever. The most efficient way to level is by playing Paladin to get easy access to Resistances and Holy Aura for both offensive and defensive bonuses. Crusade your way through the campaign burning enemies in the holy fire of your Judgment!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/acolyte-build-1744820998394.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Acolyte</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As an Acolyte you are a master of the undead and the profane. Embrace your inner darkness and become a Warlock to create rifts in reality which unleash a volley of Chaos Bolt. The Chthonic Fissure skill provides great persistent damage for clearing while your Summoned Infernal Shades melt bosses with their hellish assault.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/rogue-build-1744821018335.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Rogue</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Rogue levels with her trusty Falcon Companion, flying through levels with ease and grace. This Falconer build is easy to scale with great sustain thanks to the Melee Leech affix on gear. With a bit of investment into Health, Regen and Physical Resistance, this Rogue becomes a well-rounded beast of a build.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1.2 Tombs of the Erased Endgame Builds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After you complete the campaign, you enter Last Epoch’s endgame. Maxroll’s Last Epoch team has been extensively testing a wide variety of endgame builds to dominate in the Monolith of Fate. While all of these builds are powerful, you can use Maxroll’s tier lists to see how they compare across different kinds of content.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Heartseeker Marksman</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/heartseeker-marksman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heartseeker Marksman</a> uses a new skill which seeks enemy targets and triggers a spectacular display of Fire and Cold Projectiles that cover the entire screen.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-has-serious-potential-for-old-school-fun.1166100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-has-serious-potential-for-old-school-fun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After more than a decade in the shadows, the Ninja Gaiden series returns with not one but three releases this year: the surprise remaster of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black that’s already out, this fall’s Ninja Gaiden 4, and in between, the 2D action platformer that returns the series to its roots, Ninja Gaiden Ragebound. While the mere existence of this trio is a pleasant surprise, Ragebound is perhaps the biggest shock, as the series hasn’t been two-dimensional since the early ‘90s. It’s also being delivered by a developer (The Game Kitchen) and publisher (Dotemu) who are new to Ninja Gaiden. They aren’t new to pixel art or retro throwbacks, though, and Ragebound appears to be in good hands that have real love for the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you know The Game Kitchen’s Blasphemous series, you’ll know they produce some of the best-looking pixel art today. Even though the Ragebound reveal trailer featured a lot of hand-drawn animation, everything I saw during my playtime was pixel art, from the title screen to cut scenes. I love the sense of depth they create in a forest area with layers of parallax scrolling, while fireflies drift about in the foreground, unconcerned with all the bloodshed happening right in front of them.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sequence-10-00-05-45-08-still002-1744762607029.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">An early boss fight.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of bloodshed, defeated enemies provide a satisfying splatter of pixelated red spray. Some bad guys even have multiple death animations. I also appreciate how, while some enemy corpses will fly offscreen or just burst into goo, others remain littered in your wake. Your own blood will occasionally spill on the background. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For its part, meanwhile, Dotemu published TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, Streets of Rage 4, Metal Slug Tactics, and the upcoming Marvel Cosmic Invasion. This is a team with a track record of reviving dormant game franchises and reinvigorating them with fresh ideas and often dazzling art. That seems to be the case again with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound. It looks like a supercharged 16-bit version of the NES trilogy and adds some gnarly new ninja tricks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One is the Guillotine Boost, which lets you bounce off enemies and projectiles with a spin attack. Not only will it deal damage, it extends your time in the air and therefore will help you cross wide areas with no ground beneath your feet. Game Kitchen has prepared many platforming challenges for you around this technique.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sequence-10-00-10-01-08-still003-1744762662791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kumori, your demoness buddy.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll notice certain enemies have a glowing aura around them. These you can slash to load your hypercharge attack, which decimates large foes and obstacles with one hit. Hypercharges can be chained together if there are multiple glowing enemies nearby. So in many instances there is a preferable order in which bad guys should be defeated, adding one more layer for you to think about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be clear, Ragebound is a level-based action game, not a Metroidvania. You make your way through each area slashing enemies, platforming, and fighting a boss at the end -- like the large demon bat thing I encountered in one of the first areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mercifully, checkpoints will prevent you from being sent back to the beginning should you be overcome. At the end of a stage you’re scored on your performance from D to S and will receive a summary of your completion time, number of kills, max combo, collectibles you found, and any challenges you completed. Challenges might be things like not taking damage or killing a certain amount of enemies with hypercharged attacks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I want to mention the prologue that sets the scene for Ragebound because it’s awesome, but if you want to avoid any and all story spoilers you may want to skip ahead. *pauses* Okay, cast your mind back to that first cutscene that opened the original Ninja Gaiden back in 1989. Two ninja face each other under a full moon. They dash forward, leap into the air, and clash swords. Back on the ground, after a moment, the red ninja falls, and we learn this was Ryu Hayabusa’s father. Most of us had never seen anything so cinematic in a video game before. This event kicked off Ryu’s quest for revenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the prologue of Ragebound, we play as Ryu’s father in the moments leading up to his duel. It’s so cool! Right from the jump, fans will recognize updated versions of classic tunes, like that which underscored the moment Hayabusa San collapses to the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When word gets back to Ryu of what happened to his father, he leaves for America and all the events we witnessed in Ninja Gaiden I-III. Back in his village, some kind of portal is opened that sends demons spilling into our world. With Ryu preoccupied, it’s up to one of his pupils, Kenji, to save the village and dispatch this demonic threat. So it would seem the events of Ragebound play out alongside the original game. A literal gaiden, or side story, then. Clever.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s cool to see Ryu's 3D costume rendered in pixel art.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ryu is in one of his 3D Ninja Gaiden outfits here. He’ll obviously be changing into his original blue outfit for his trip to America, but it’s cool to see a 3D costume rendered in pixel art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many gamers who came up in the ‘80s and early ‘90s still have PTSD from those damn birds that first appeared in level 3-1 of the original Ninja Gaiden. They were kind of an annoying combination of the medusa heads and fleamen from Castlevania. My friends, I regret to inform you: The buzzards are back. Thankfully, they still take just one hit and seem to be more manageable here, at least in the early stages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most interesting new additions to the classic Ninja Gaiden formula is Kumori, a demoness who will become your companion and has some useful tricks of her own. If you happen upon a Demon Altar, Kumori can commune with it and switch to the dark world, where hidden demonic entities are revealed and can be used to navigate environments and open whatever was blocking Kenji’s path. This isn’t a cooperative game, though, so Kenji will remain trapped in the altar while Kumori is galavanting about demon town. She also has special attacks that can help Kenji in combat.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sequence-10-00-15-56-22-still005-1744762535242.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Two heads will make you deader than one.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I already encountered some really cool enemies in my short playtime, like a cyclops that spits giant eyeballs from its gut. I like the way it dissolves into a skeleton, too. In a nice touch, clever moments break up the action, like when a demon leaps out at you but is eaten by a dragon snake thing that comes out of nowhere. These are eye candy moments that could just be amusing, or they might introduce a monster you’ll run into later on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think old school Ninja Gaiden fans are bound to enjoy this return to form. Ragebound has great pixel art, fast-paced platforming action, and new ideas that elevate the source material. I’m looking forward to learning more about Kumori and seeing how her relationship with Kenji develops. From what I’ve played so far, this seems like another winning combination of beloved but neglected IP with passionate indie devs. Ninja Gaiden Ragebound is out this summer.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The last couple of years have seen several well-received Godzilla movies released, and parent company Toho is looking to grow that success beyond the silver screen. The Japanese studio has announced that it will invest $830 million in new games, anime, and other projects based on its IP, including Godzilla console games.</p><p>Toho plans to spend $490 million on content development alone, which will focus on a broad range of media as it pivots toward growing its brand overseas (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-14/-godzilla-studio-toho-to-invest-830-million-in-global-push" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>). In addition to an undefined number of Godzilla console games, the studio will also focus on animation, theme park attractions, and mobile games as part of its brand expansion strategy.</p><p>While Godzilla appeared in numerous video games over the decades, the last couple of years have seen the kaiju king relegated to crossovers and cameos. Games like Fall Guys have offered Godzilla cosmetics to players, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> featured Godzilla as an environmental hazard and enemy as part of its Operation Monarch event.</p><p>Recently, Godzilla has starred in several mobile games--and a turn-based strategy game heavily inspired by Into the Breach in 2022 called Godzilla: Voxel Wars--but the last big game featuring the titan was 2014's Godzilla for the PS4, which was later released in Europe and the US in 2015. That game was met with negative reception upon release, and it has an average critic score of 38 on GameSpot sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/godzilla/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>.</p><p>"Godzilla commits so many game design sins that they become impossible to count, but the greatest horror of them all is that such giant monsters could be so boring," Kevin VanOrd wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/godzilla-review/1900-6416191/">Godzilla review</a>, scoring the game 3/10.</p><p>While it'll be a long time before Godzilla stomps his way back onto consoles, the cinematic future of the King of the Monsters looks bright. As mentioned above, a sequel to the Oscar-winning Godzilla Minus One is in development, and Legendary Pictures' Monsterverse will see the Godzilla and King Kong franchises team up for a third time in a movie that is scheduled to be released on March 26, 2027.</p>

                <p>Nvidia has been rolling out its RTX 50-Series graphics cards over the past few months, and today marks the arrival of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti. <strong>Available in 8GB ($379) and 16GB ($429) formats</strong>, early reviews are calling it a solid addition to the Nvidia catalog and worth considering if you’re seeking a versatile mid-range card. Unsurprisingly, the new RTX 5060 Ti is a hot commodity, with retailers already selling out, though new stock is likely to return soon. To help track availability, we’ve put together a short list of major retailers most likely to have the RTX 5060 Ti in stock.

The end result is faster performance than its predecessor and the ability to upscale lower resolutions to 1440p and 4K resolutions. According to Nvidia, the RTX 5060 Ti offers double the performance of the old RTX 4060 Ti when DLSS 4 is enabled (it's worth noting that the RTX 5060 Ti's performance uplift over the 4060 Ti <em>without</em> DLSS 4 is closer to about 15% faster). You’ll find the GPUs to be much slimmer than the RTX 4060 lineup, too, thanks to AI technology that allows the hardware to hit better benchmarks without requiring the same raw horsepower.</p><p>A variety of 5060 Ti models (including overclocked variants) are available from third parties.

		<p>Bloober Team has released the first gameplay trailer for its upcoming survival horror Cronos: The New Dawn, naming this trailer ‘Don’t Let The Merge.’ You can see why from the trailer as enemies can absorb other enemies to become bigger threats, with more powerful attacks and increased speed. The trailer also shows how you will navigate different locations, including some areas where gravity doesn’t have much of a pull.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Official Gameplay Trailer |  DON'T LET THEM MERGE" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZblwGH-C7eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/bloober-team-reveal-cronos-the-new-dawn/">Announced last October</a>, the behind the scenes video explores Cronos: The New Dawn’s setting, a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse. Some of the most notable inspirations include the Dead Space franchise and the movie Twelve Monkeys. The Traveller’s own suit takes its inspiration from older deep sea diving suits, alluding to the theme of diving through time to save people.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is set to launch in 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

But users won’t be able to play games within the app as initially promised. The feature was supposed to arrive in November, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307867/microsoft-google-xbox-game-store-android-purchase-games">but Bond blamed</a> a “temporary administrative stay” for holding it back.</p><p>Once Microsoft officially launches in-app game purchases, you’ll see a “Buy” button on game pages if you already have a form of payment saved. You’ll also be able to preorder games and set them to preinstall in your Xbox, as well as redeem Game Pass Ultimate perks. With this update, Xbox has done a complete reversal, as its app previously let users purchase games without remote play.</p><p>Though remote play will no longer be available in the app, Xbox notes that you can still access it from your mobile browser. Xbox is also bringing remote play to supported Samsung TVs, Amazon Fire TV devices, and Meta Quest headsets. </p><p>A few other updates are coming to Xbox as well, including the ability for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to stream select games they own from Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles, which means they won’t have to download games before they can play. Xbox recently added more titles to its “stream your own game” collection, including <em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em> and <em>Subnautica 2</em>.</p><p>There’s also a new game hub feature on Xbox that pulls up “relevant information” about a game, such as player stats, achievements, friends currently playing the game, events, and available add-ons.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is confirmed to be a day-one launch title on Xbox Game Pass which strongly suggests that it will be available for cloud gaming.</p></blockquote><p>When pushed for more evidence, as DM screenshots can be faked, the user shared a video showing the entire conversation and seemingly confirming that, yeah, the Xbox support account actually spilled the beans. Oops! </p><p>At first I wanted to chalk this up to a bot accidentally confirming info before it had been announced. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Ser_Raven18/status/1912510613634379868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Ser_Raven18/status/1912510613634379868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But as pointed out by Raven on Twitter</a></span>, at least <em>one </em>of the messages seems to have come from a “live service agent” aka a human being. So maybe this is actually human error? Or a bot pretending to be a human made a very human-like whoopsie? </p><h2 id="h1077"><a id=""></a>We tried asking the Xbox support account for info</h2><p>After seeing the DMs, I decided to give it a shot myself and see what happened. I reached out to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/XboxSupport&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/XboxSupport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox support account</a></span> and asked about <em>Oblivion </em>as well, and after a lengthy wait, a live service agent sent me this reply: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Hello Zack, thank you for contacting Microsoft. Unfortunately, there is nothing officially announced regarding this matter. We will keep you updated using our social media channel.</p></blockquote><p>I didn’t give up that easy. Instead, I replied with “MENU” as I had done earlier. This had previously provided me with a bot and options to ask different questions about my Xbox account and games. However, this time, I didn’t get a menu. Instead a few minutes later another message from a live service agent popped up in my inbox. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> At this time, there is no official information available regarding the release or availability of this title. We understand the excitement and interest, but as of now, nothing has been formally announced. We encourage you to keep an eye on Xbox’s official channels, including our website and social media platforms, for any future updates or announcements. As soon as there is confirmed information, it will be shared publicly through those outlets</p></blockquote><p>It seems the bot has been shut down and the live service agents running the account have been told to stop sharing details about a remaster that hasn’t even been announced yet. Anyway, it looks like we all might be playing <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remastered next week on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Game Pass.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloober-team-showcases-first-look-at-cronos-the-new-dawn-gameplay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After surprising everyone with its better-than-expected remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2</a>, Bloober Team's next project, a brand-new game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-deep-dive-from-bloober-team/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, looks like it's the next survival horror game players should keep their eyes on.</p>
<p>Bloober Team showcased our first honest look at gameplay from Cronos: The New Dawn in a new gameplay trailer, where fans of survival horror titles will see some similarities to popular games in the genre like Dead Space, but that's not to say Cronos: The New Dawn isn't doing anything new.</p>
<p>Like merging, for example. Enemies in Cronos: The New Dawn can 'merge,' meaning your job isn't done once you've shot an enemy dead. You need to burn the body. Otherwise, another enemy will take that dead bit of flesh on the ground and merge with it to make itself even stronger.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you're facing a bigger, badder enemy than you were before. If you keep letting enemies merge with the ones you thought you already took out, you can quickly find yourself in an even more terrifying situation. It's an additional layer of combat that means you'll always have to be on your toes between managing the enemies walking towards you and those you've already put down.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Official Gameplay Trailer |  DON'T LET THEM MERGE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZblwGH-C7eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a press release, co-director and producer on Cronos: The New Dawn, Jacek Zięba, writes, "<em>Imagine this: a distorted mix of sci-fi, time travel, retro-futuristic dread, and body horror—all set against the gritty backdrop of&nbsp; 80s Poland. What a ride, right? And whatever you do… don't let them merge.</em>"</p>
<p>Co-director and designer Wojciech Piejko adds, "<em>How do you fight them? Fire! Burn the </em><br>
<em>fallen before they merge with living creatures. The merge changes the game, adding a </em><br>
<em>whole new layer of strategy to combat. Push your survival instincts to the max.</em>"</p>
<p>When we get our hands on Cronos, it'll be interesting to see how merging impacts combat, and what else the game has in store for survival horror fans. After all, Bloober Team has declared that it won't be making "<em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bloober-team-claims-its-finished-making-shitty-games/">shitty</a></em>" games anymore.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't have an official release date yet, but we know it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2025. This means it'll be the studio's first new title to test that declaration.</p>

			<p>In today's new The Outer Worlds 2 video published as part of April's IGN First, Obsidian Entertainment revealed that the RPG sequel will feature 'way more expansive worlds' than the original (which is great news, as that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of my pet peeves with The Outer Worlds</a>). In classic Obsidian fashion, they will also be filled with fun stories and cool gear or collectibles to find.</p>
<p>Art Director Daniel Alpert explained:</p>
<p><em>We're definitely going more expansive than the first game. In the first game, we were very confined to smaller hubs and overland areas. Now that we're utilizing Unreal Engine 5, we can have way more expansive worlds. From point A to point B, there is a much larger territory that we can cover, and in between those areas, we have lots of little POIs (points of interest) that we can explore.</em></p>
<p>Game Director Brandon Adler added:</p>
<p><em>One of the very first things that we were targeting when we started The Outer Worlds 2 was to make these big, large, expansive areas. It's what players told us that they wanted the most. Working with Daniel and the other directors, we sat down and came up with a plan to how we were going to go do that. We made sure that we had big open sightlines and that we spent a lot of time and effort on making really cool-looking points of interest at a distance to really draw people and also maybe bring them off the beaten path a little bit. When they're heading over there, we made sure that as you're rounding corners or you're doing things like that, you see little points of interest. Another element that was also really important as we're kind of doing all of this stuff is making sure that it was very interesting when you get there, so we made sure that we blanketed all of our areas with just cool, fun stuff to go do, nice loot to go find, and cool stories to go unfold.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2: A Look at Its Expansive Worlds – IGN First" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKj1UUIH0a4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yesterday, IGN also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-outer-worlds-2-lets-you-go-wild-with-rpg-character-building-ign-first" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> an interview that dived into the changes and improvements made to the underlying RPG formula of The Outer Worlds 2. The developers are trying to avoid a situation where by the end of the game, the main character is essentially good at everything. They're also removing respec to make sure that choices truly matter.</p>
<p>Lead systems designer Kyle Koenig said:</p>
<p><em>We would often see characters good at everything, which by the end of the game, minimized your personal experience with your character. We wanted to focus on making each individual level-up and investment really important. There's less confusion on when I should invest in one Skill or the other. If I want to be a player that's all about guns and using medical devices, I know which Skills I really need to care about. By having them separated and not in groupings, it lets characters be more specialized.&nbsp;By removing respec, we really incentivize it to be your experience. It is a part of your experience that no one else had, and I think that's really special about RPGs and something that respec tends to lessen.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will also feature a full-fledged stealth system, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-first-gameplay-video-and-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> last week. More info should be coming throughout April, though the big showcase is scheduled to air <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after the Xbox Games Showcase on June 8</a>. The game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

                <p>Fortnite has been advertising heavily during WWE events this year despite the fact that there hasn't been any real WWE presence in the game in a while, leading pretty much everyone to assume a new collab was on the way. And it turns out that assumption was right, as reputable leakers are reporting that Cody Rhodes and The Undertaker will be the next wrestlers to be immortalized as Fortnite skins.</p><p>This isn't one of those not-so-credible "I'm hearing this is might happen sometime in the next few years" leaks like last week's Jack Black and Kingdom Come: Deliverance rumors. No, this leak comes with a release date (Friday) and prices (2800 V-Bucks for the full bundle), and was reported by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1912508694811595040" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">multiple</a> <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1912511287680004589" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">different</a> sources simultaneously--it's quite credible.</p><p>In addition to the Cody Rhodes and Undertaker outfits, the set will include the Undertaker's urn and the American Nightmare mantle back blings, along with the Cody's Cutlass and Taker's Shovel pickaxes, an American Nightmare wrap, and emotes for both Cody Rhodes and Undertaker. The whole set will be included in a bundle for 2800 V-Bucks, and every item can be purchased separately if you only want a specific item or two. We don't have images for any of this yet--these items <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1912521107078275534" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be decrypted on Thursday afternoon</a>.</p><p>This set represents the third wave of WWE collaborations with Fortnite. The first added John Cena all by his lonesome back in 2022, and then a year later we got Bianca Belair and Becky Lynch as well. The expansion of WWE's roster into Fortnite then paused until this week.</p><p>Fortnite has been overflowing with collaborations in 2025, starting in January with Hatsune Miku and Godzilla x Kong, and continuing with new skins from Kaiju No. 8, Jujutsu Kaisen, James Cameron's Avatar, Mortal Kombat, Cowboy Bebop, Invincible (including a free Dupli-Kate), Tomb Raider, Walking Dead, and Adventure Time--not to mention <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/" data-ref-id="2900-6417">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-baseball-players-in-the-world-might-be-hitting-the-fortnite-shop-soon/1100-6529993/" data-ref-id="1100-6529993">Shohei Ohtani</a>, and Clix joining the Icon Series. All this--plus these new WWE skins and a rumored Star Wars season on the horizon in May--make it seem as if these collabs are not slowing down even a little bit.</p>
