            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-games-boss-lord-of-rings-mmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann has provided an update on the ongoing development of the studio's&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO, and it sounds like the project is still very early on in its development.</p>
<p>In an interview with IGN, Hartmann says the&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO is "still early" and that the project is still "trying to find the hook". Hartmann says he and Amazon don't want to "go and do the same thing over", but instead to "find a fresh twist" on the MMO genre.</p>
<p>He says Amazon and the development team are still searching for "what could be the thing which is different to all the other games out there", so it sounds like it's going to be a very long time before we actually get to play the company's&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lord-of-the-rings-online-amazon-lotr-mmo.jpg?itok=EQ0guavk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lord-of-the-rings-online-amazon-lotr-mmo.jpg?itok=DKPjWcSD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amazon's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO will sit alongside Standing Stone's <em>The&nbsp;</em><em>Lord of the Rings Online</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We first learned about the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>MMO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-games-new-world-developer-working-on-lord-of-rings-open-world-mmo">back in May last year</a>, when it was revealed that the development team behind the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-review-bomb-relaunch">somewhat ill-fated</a>&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>would be working on it.</p>
<p>This is, it should be noted, distinct from the project that Amazon reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-game-studios-cancels-lord-of-rings-game">canceled over a contract dispute</a> with Tencent back in 2021, although since neither game was technically officially unveiled, the new title could certainly be using some of the DNA of that canceled project.</p>
<p>In any case, Hartmann also provides an update on the new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game in the IGN interview. He says Crystal Dynamics is "fairly sheltered" from what IGN calls the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">"recent turmoil"</a> with the developer's parent company Embracer Group.</p>
<p>Hartmann acknowledges that making a new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>is a "huge, huge task" with a "high" bar, but he says "things are progressing". That's arguably not much of an update, but hey, it's nice to know the game hasn't been canned.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-amazon-games-shadow.jpg?itok=wPVgCrlu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-amazon-games-shadow.jpg?itok=n2tjgoOf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game is progressing apace, apparently.</figcaption></figure><h2>Amazon Games' boss also says some...interesting things</h2>
<p>It's not just updates about games that Hartmann provides in the IGN interview, though. He's also got some...interesting (some might say "questionable") things to say about the gaming industry as a whole.</p>
<p>One rather intriguing comment Hartmann makes is that the gaming industry doesn't "really have acting", a sentiment with which I'm sure the industry's voice actors and motion capture professionals would vehemently disagree.</p>
<p>Hartmann is making these comments as part of a wider point about generative AI, which he says can "help us to have new gameplay ideas" and take away "the boring parts" of game development. Hmm.</p>

<p>He goes on to say, however, that having such a franchise is "the whole point" for Amazon, because it's a "larger than life company" and because smaller franchises would "not be interesting". He also says Amazon's not "in here to try it out and do some cute game development".</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-doesnt-need-60-fps-mode-says-obsidian/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-%E2%80%9Cdoesn%E2%80%99t-need-60-fps-mode%E2%80%9D-says-obsidian.961884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-doesnt-need-60-fps-mode-says-obsidian/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Obsidian confirmed in a new interview that Avowed’s core performance target will be 30 fps on Xbox Series X/S consoles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obsidian’s art director, Matt Hansen, recently discussed Avowed’s performance during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxBL4jTHs5w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Iron Lords Podcast</a>. When asked about the game’s console performance targets, Hansen stated that the team is ‘core targeting 30 fps bare minimum’.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🎙️ INTERVIEW  🎙️</p><p>Avowed developers confirm 30FPS was the target FPS from the start of development </p><p>“Since the game is a first person single player game you don't need a 60fps mode”</p><p>It could be 30FPS locked on Xbox </p><p>How do you all feel about this?💚🎮<br> <a href="https://t.co/FLBIZVnJa7">pic.twitter.com/FLBIZVnJa7</a></p></div>— GPT Gaming News (@GPTGamingNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/GPTGamingNews/status/1826920564700631363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Hansen added that Avowed is a “first-person, single-player game”, so players don’t “necessarily need” 60 fps. Additionally, targeting 30 fps allows Obsidian to bring better visuals to the table as they could get “a lot juicier with the effects, the lighting, etc.”. It’s a “tradeoff” that the studio had decided on pretty early into the development process, and the “game has been running pretty smooth for how visually dense it is”, stated Hansen.&nbsp;He concluded by stating that they are still figuring out the performance stuff as that is “one of the last things you do”. </p>



<p>Our Senior Editor attended a gameplay demo live at Gamescom 2024 and failed to see any issue with how Avowed ran. Even in intense combat sequences filled with blasts of magic and clashing swords, the game looked brilliant on screen. He noted that the traversal system needed a little work, but Avowed presents itself as a solid and well-built game overall.</p>



<p>In other news, a Pokémon Card Shop was allegedly busted with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-card-shop-allegedly-busted-with-over-1-million-worth-of-drugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over $1 million worth of crystal meth</a>. Also, Arena Breakout Infinite doesn’t have an offline mode as it is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-offline-mode-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too risky and expensive</a>. What are your thoughts on Avowed targeting 30 fps on Xbox Series X/S consoles? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-takes-the-franchise-back-to-its-roots.961878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft and developer Unfrozen Studio have announced&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</em>, and as the name suggests, it's a deliberate throwback to the strategy gaming roots of the franchise.</p>
<p>Per Ubisoft's <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/62HpoWQkAIVogVkoVk8JuJ/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-unveiled-at-gamescom" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, the game will be released "just in time for [the franchise's] 30th anniversary" and will take place in the land of Enroth as it was before the events of the original 1995&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em>.</p>
<p>If you're a&nbsp;<em>Might and Magic&nbsp;</em>buff, you might recognize the name of the as-yet unrevealed continent of Jadame, which is where the game takes place, allowing Unfrozen to include "new factions, biomes, and creatures".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-combat.jpg?itok=ii6hn_49 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era-combat.jpg?itok=2jWVzFsE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era&nbsp;</em>returns to the franchise's roots.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay will largely be split between two core pillars: exploration, in which you'll find resources and build your base, and combat, in which you'll pit your armies against your enemies.</p>
<p>Compared to previous games in the series, Ubisoft and Unfrozen say you'll have "more control over how [you] level up heroes and their factions". The classic hexagonal grid is back, though, so if you're a&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic&nbsp;</em>fan, that'll probably give you a nice nostalgic kick.</p>
<p>Specifically, Ubisoft says&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic&nbsp;</em>takes inspiration from&nbsp;the third game in the series, as well as the second and fifth entries, all of which are considered strategy classics by the series' fanbase.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p>If you feel like you've heard developer Unfrozen's name somewhere before, you may be thinking of its previous game,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/iratus-lord-of-dead"><em>Iratus: Lord of the Dead</em></a>, which took heavy inspiration from Red Hook's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/darkest-dungeon"><em>Darkest Dungeon</em></a>. It does, however, prove that Unfrozen has prior when it comes to turn-based combat.</p>
<p><em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era&nbsp;</em>launches for PC via Steam Early Access (an unusual move for Ubisoft, but one shared by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-roguelite-precision-platforming-at-its-finest"><i>The Rogue Prince of Persia</i></a>) next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1826952588295913791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, producer Lee Beom-jun announced that Season 1 of The First Descendant will now have two updates instead of three, moving its fall updates to October 10, 2024.</p>



<p>The producer acknowledged fan backlash following yesterday’s announcement that Season 1 Invasion would have a three-part structure. They apologized to fans, stating that “I have to admit that I’ve failed to fully meet your expectations.”</p>



<p>The previous Season 1 schedule would drop two different updates on September 26 and October 30, 2024. Lee Beom-jun explained this intended to “provide consistent updates every month, before each content release.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Now, The First Descendant’s October 10 update will merge all of the content from both of Season 1’s previous fall updates. That includes Ultimate Freyna, hard-mode infiltration, external components, and more.</p>



<p>In today’s post, Lee Beom-jun revealed that “we have also begun examining the update methods for the upcoming seasons in the future.” This implies that following seasons will also adhere to the updated schedule.</p>



<p>They also added that “the Dev team is working on continuous updates and hotfixes,” reorganizing their development process, and recruiting more personnel.</p>



<p>The First Descendant rolled out its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendants-new-major-content-update-is-releasing-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first major content update</a> late last month, as well as some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-summer-vacation-bundles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Vacation-themed skins</a>. Season 1 Invasion will still begin on August 29, 2024. </p>

            <p>Development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon is "going well".</p>
<p>Amazon announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">working alongside Crystal Dynamics on the next Tomb Raider game</a> back in 2022, when it said it would provide its "full support" to the team as it works on "the biggest, most expansive" series entry to date.</p>
<p>Since then, details have been pretty sparse for the upcoming release. In fact, all we really know right now is that it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-announces-next-tomb-raider-game-made-in-unreal-engine-5">being made in Unreal Engine 5</a> and will have "mind-bending puzzles to solve" and a "wide variety of enemies to face and overcome".</p>

<p>Despite quietness in terms of public information, behind the scenes, things on Tomb Raider are "going well". So says Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann, who told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview">IGN</a> that Crystal Dynamics is "fairly sheltered from everything going on with Embracer".</p>
<p>Hartmann discussed the ongoing disruption at Embracer, which initiated a "comprehensive restructuring programme" after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">collapse of a $2bn "major strategic partnership" in May last year</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">studio closures and layoffs</a>. The Amazon exec said he understood "people obviously look at what the parent company is doing", but in Tomb Raider's case, "it never impacted on resources, never led to any changes on management for them, so they're fine".</p>
<p>He added the "bar is so high" when creating a new Tomb Raider game. "The longer you go, the expectation goes higher, so it's a huge, huge task, but things are progressing," Hartman said. "I mean, there's some really great ideas here."</p>
<p>While he refrained from sharing what these ideas are, Hartmann reiterated that things are "moving forward" at Crystal. "The studio went through a couple of ownership changes anyway before, it's not brand-new for them," he continued.</p>
<p>"They kind of were doing games with moving around anyway. And like, okay, new sheriff... you know what I mean, new owner in town. Let's just keep on doing what we do and make games."</p>

<p>Along with its upcoming game, Amazon also has a Tomb Raider TV project in the works with Fleabag's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> attached.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> has its own animated series arriving later this year, known as Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. The show will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-netflix-show-will-help-lara-deal-with-her-grief-so-she-can-finally-start-working-on-other-sht">act as a bridge of sorts between the Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy and the games from the 90s</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And that allows us to get a lot juicier with VFX and lighting and all this other stuff.</p><p>“It’s a trade-off we opted to make relatively early, and we’re really happy with that. The game’s running pretty smooth for how visually dense it is, and that was always our goal.”</p><p>But, Obsidian is still figuring out the nitty gritty of performance: “It’s one of the last things you do,” Hansen said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Avowed - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Avowed is due out in February 2025 on PC and Xbox Series X and S, and joins a list of Xbox Series X and S games that launched at 30fps in recent years. That list includes Bethesda’s Starfield (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-gets-big-update-that-adds-detailed-surface-maps-ship-decoration-and-60fps-on-xbox-series-x">which now runs at 60fps following a post-launch update</a>), Arkane Austin’s Redfall (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/redfalls-latest-update-finally-adds-60fps-mode-now-available">which also now runs at 60fps following a post-launch update</a>), and Ninja Theory’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hellblade-2-confirmed-to-run-at-30-fps-on-xbox-no-performance-mode-available">Hellblade 2</a>, which has yet to receive a 60fps update.</p><p>Indeed, Obsidian’s reasoning for targeting 30fps echoes <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-starfield-performance-and-frame-rate-on-xbox-series-x-and-s">comments made by Bethesda development chief Todd Howard</a> in explaining why last year’s Starfield launched at 30fps on both Xbox Series X and S.</p><p>“I think it'll come as no surprise, given our previous games, what we go for,” Howard said at the time. “Always these huge, open worlds, fully dynamic, hyper detail where anything can happen. And we do want to do that. It's 4K in the X. It's 1440 on the S. We do lock it at 30, because we want that fidelity, we want all that stuff. We don't want to sacrifice any of it.</p><p>“Fortunately in this one, we've got it running great. It's often running way above that. Sometimes it's 60. But on the consoles, we do lock it because we prefer the consistency, where you're not even thinking about it.</p><p>“And we don't ever want to sacrifice that experience that makes our games feel really, really special. So it feels great. We're really happy with how it feels even in the heat of battle. And we need that headroom because in our games, really anything can happen.”</p><p>As was the case with recent Xbox games, Avowed may end up with a 60fps performance mode post-launch. There are also questions about Avowed eventually launching on PlayStation 5, following Obsidian's Pentiment and Grounded jumping to the rival console this year, and Microsoft's confirmed plans to release Id Software's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and MachineGames' <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> on PS5 next year.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-delayed-to-february-2025-to-give-players-backlogs-some-breathing-room">Avowed was delayed to February</a> “to give players' backlogs some breathing room,” Microsoft has said.

			<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christoph Hartmann</a>, Amazon Games' boss, spoke with IGN about the company's state and its future. He talked about the Lord of the Rings MMO in particular and the undertaking of an iconic franchise such as Tomb Raider.</p>
<p>Amazon Games is predominantly known for MMORPGs, such as Lost Ark, Throne &amp; Liberty, and Blue Protocol. However, with some of their recent acquisitions, they are hoping to step out of the MMO limelight and try their hand at making something new. Their most recent announcement happened just days ago at Gamescom 2024, with a stark change in genre from their previous games. This announcement was about the wacky co-op action game King of Meat, which is quite a shock compared to Amazon Games' previous published titles.</p>
<p>"As you know, we have Tomb Raider and others, so that's obviously happening regardless. But I think what's even more important is that we are taking bets on new ideas and new developers, which is very few... Well, we are not yet an established publisher, but we're still a big company." Amazon Games has kept relatively quiet about their plans throughout 2024, but they have over ten projects currently in development, with talks of getting their hands on a couple more, too. This, of course, includes Tomb Raider, as well as a new driving game made by the developers of Forza Horizon.</p>
<p>Although they are keen to expand their catalog, the hooks of MMOs seem deep into Amazon Games. While working on the King of Meat and the Tomb Raider franchise, they also have the Lord of the Rings MMO to attend to. Originally, in July of this year, they said that the Lord of the Rings MMO isn't "too far away. " However, the script has now been flipped to say that it's still early days for the game.</p>
<p>"We're still trying to find the hook, find that idea of what it is because we don't just want to go and do the same thing over," said Hartman. There have been multiple Lord of the Rings games in recent years, such as Gollum, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-gets-official-release-date/">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</a>, and, additionally, the upcoming game, Tales of the Shire. So far, these games haven't been particularly well-received by the audience, with Gollum being particularly controversial.</p>
<p>A Lord of the Rings MMO has plenty of potential, as it gives players room to add to the story and craft their world within the franchise, but it also has the potential to go wrong.</p>

            <p>I can guarantee you that a zombie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-save-birmingham">God Save Birmingham</a> wasn't on your "2024 Video Game Announcements" bingo card. It takes place in 14th century England, and tasks you with fending off the rampant zombie hordes of a populace who've succumbed to a mysterious case of reanimation. Perhaps the cause is that there's no Maccies or TK Maxx at the local Bull Ring yet.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As the sole Brummie left un-zombified, you've got to do survival game things: forage, craft tools, and weapons, hunt for food and build a nice little shelter to hunker down in. Birmingham itself will be home to markets, boarded up smithies and the Church of St.Martin in the iconic Bull Ring market, apparently.</p>

<p>While I wouldn't say the trailer above shows any of this, the game's aiming for "physics-based mechanics" that let you outwit the horde. The Steam page mentions stacking furniture to create barricades, using low fences to make zombies stumble, or just maiming them so they're more crawly and less runny.</p>
<p>The game's being developed by Ocean Drive Studios, who first started work on it with a team of two, before it grew to a team of six. Their plan is to deliver some beta tests, before it then launches into early access for a couple of years. When it launches into early access, we don't know, but they plan on it containing "one-quarter of the entire town" to explore. The first year of early access then, will be spent on completing "the town itself" and its "survival challenges", before the next is spent "creating light story-driven elements".</p>
<p>Honestly, survival games tire me out nowadays. I can't be arsed to build things out of wood planks anymore! But I have to admit that I'm intrigued by a game set in 14th century Birmingham, a place I don't have any familial ties to, but have visited a fair few times for a wedding, friend meet, and because the city plays host to one of the world's most prestigious <a href="https://www.allenglandbadminton.com/">badminton tournaments</a>. Perhaps this is how I trace the city's history? By sitting at my computer and erecting little fences to make zombies trip.</p>
<p>You can follow the game's progress over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3073940/God_Save_Birmingham/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I’m still a little giddy over how much I enjoyed lucarne-lobbing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a>. So much so that I mentioned in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tactical-breach-wizards-review">my review</a> how I’m well up for another run of its fifteen hour campaign. I’d already got a few missions into hard mode. There's no more starting mana points! It’s a real...<em>pane</em>.</p>
<p>Now, I might have to start again, even if going out of my way to grab the tapes added in its developer's commentary mode is going to be extra tricky. Ah, but will being able to chuck the recorders at my enemies for a point of knockback afterwards make up for it?</p>

<blockquote><p>There are 52 of these recordings to find, totaling over 3 hours of commentary, spread across the game's 15 hour campaign. They're a mix of designer/writer Tom Francis talking through his own thinking, and interviewing each other member of the team about their work.</p>
<p>We get into the reasoning behind design and story decisions, ideas we tried that didn't work out, the hardest challenges we have to solve, and get a little closer to understanding why this game took more than 6 years to make.</p>
<p>And when you're tired of listening to us, you can throw the tape recorder at an enemy to deal 1 knockback.</p></blockquote>
<p>The optional mode is part of the game’s special edition, which is currently about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065010/Tactical_Breach_Wizards_Special_Edition_Upgrade/">50% more expensive than the standard</a>. Alongside the weaponised-fact rectangles, it also contains the soundtrack, and an early build demo. I wouldn’t normally write a news piece just for a special edition, but I asked around the treehouse this morning, and we struggled to come up with a comparably creative implementation of a commentary feature.</p>
<p>I also have an ulterior motive here. Namely, this gives me a chance for some whimsical hijinks. I figured it'd be fun to ask to you to link me your custom TeeBeeDubs levels. If, say, at least three of you do, then I can write up my experience of struggling through them for the site. If you missed it, the game features a level editor that’s apparently more or less identical to that used in the making of the game. This is a surefire portal to unrestrained nonsense, and I am more than ready to suffer for your amusement. Riddle me up, chums.</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

            <p>Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford has admitted his long-term hopes for Epic were "misplaced or overly optimistic", having previously predicted Steam could become a "dying store".</p>
<p>For a bit of context, back in <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1117073428945653765">2019</a>, Pitchford wrote a lengthy post on social media discussing Gearbox's decision to make <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-pc-is-an-epic-games-store-exclusive-until-april-2020">Borderlands 3 on PC a timed Epic exclusive</a>. At this time, the exec <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1117077275680264193">said</a> he believed Epic's "investment in technology will outpace Valve's substantially", and went on to suggest Steam could fizzle out and other store fronts would reign supreme.</p>
<p>Fast forward now to earlier this week, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-coming-2025-taking-players-to-an-all-new-planet">Gearbox revealed Borderlands 4</a>. The next series instalment is currently slated for a 2025 release across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC via Epic and... Steam. Needless to say, this revelation has caused Pitchford's earlier comments to resurface once again.</p>

<p>In response to one fellow X user who had mocked up a 'How it started/How it's going' infographic highlighting Pitchford's 2019 post above Borderlands 4's Steam inclusion, the Gearbox head said he had "high hopes" for the Epic Games Store, but it had not "successfully pressed its advantage" in the time since.</p>
<p>Wrote Pitchford: "So, famously, Steam does very little to earn the massive cut they take and continues its effective monopoly in the West while would-be competitors with much more developer friendly models continue to shoot themselves in the foot."</p>
<p>He added while he uses Steam himself, he will "continue to root for and support competition". He also claimed that "customers show up for the games, not the store front", as proven by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-spin-off-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-heading-to-steam-this-week">initial release of both Borderlands 3 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands on Epic</a>.</p>
<p>"But the industry gives Steam their monopoly because publishers are afraid to take the risk to support more developer and publisher friendly stores," Pitchford continued. "It's all very interesting and there is a huge amount of opportunity in the PC gaming space for retail disruption, but no one seems to be able to make it happen. As a Steam Deck customer and user, my bias for personal interest and convenience is fighting against my wish for a more developer friendly alternative on Windows PC."</p>
<p>The developer went on to reiterate he had "high hopes for Epic", but his long-term hopes regarding the storefront were "misplaced or overly optimistic", calling this whole thing a "cool lesson" for him and others.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If Epic successfully pressed its advantage, that may have been the case. But Epic did not.

<p>"Moving forward, we'll continue to support Steam (as we have for literally every PC game we've launched since Steam came into existence)," he furthered. "Meanwhile, I sincerely hope Epic keeps up the fight and makes headway. Epic is going to have to prioritise the store and try some new initiatives while also doubling down on earning pivotal exclusives if it is going to have a chance.</p>
<p>"I also hope other viable competitors arrive. I am sure we will all be watching. As a developer I will continue to balance being where the customers are with being where I wished would earn the customers trust and loyalty."</p>
<p>Rounding out his thoughts, Pitchford said: "As a game player, I will be on all the platforms."</p>

<p>Epic first announced plans to take on Steam with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-maker-epic-takes-on-steam-with-its-own-pc-games-store">PC games store of its own back in 2018</a>, boasting a 88/12 per cent revenue split in favour of developers, setting it apart from Valve.</p>
<p>The storefront continues to offer free games to its community, with this week both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-and-gigantic-rampage-edition-free-on-epic-games-store">The Callisto Protocol and Gigantic: Rampage Edition currently on offer</a>.</p>

The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">adaptation then generated just $4m on its opening day</a>, a disappointing result that looks set to result in the film becoming a commercial flop.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.</p>
<p>The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everspace-2">Everspace 2</a>'s just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.</p>

<p>The expansion will add two new storylines, triggered midway through the main game's story - Dreadnought and Leviathan. Each lasts about three to four hours, and introduces new enemies, gear, craftables, characters and resources. In Dreadnought, you're off in search of a legendary colonial war battleship that has been hijacked by bandits - the basis for the "the biggest battle in the Everspace series so far!"</p>
<p>Sounds like a hoot, but space battles in Everspace are ten-a-pulsar. I'm more interested in the Leviathan storyline, which adds secretive star monsters that are effectively huge, roaming, spontaneously-forming dungeons with a taste for passing pilots. Here's the blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sightings of the legendary Leviathan have spread amongst the fortune seekers of Cluster 34 including your least favorite cultists, the Redeemers. Venture deep into the Khaït Nebula to discover the truth of these massive, presumed-to-be-extinct creatures! Not all that is swallowed is lost--treasures are said to lay deep inside the bowels of this beast and that's exactly where you're going to end up. Travel inside to discover valuable new resources can be found inside the guts of these massive creatures. No two ventures inside will be the same as the many stomachs and organs of these beasts rearrange themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sound cool, I think? Not since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supernatural-spaceship-shooter-underspace-shows-admirable-ambition-in-its-next-fest-demo">reading about Underspace</a> have I experienced such a frission of cosmic abandon. I can only imagine what teenage me would have made of being able to fly inside a space kaiju. I would have had no choice but to become Peter Molyneux. Anyway, the new Everspace 2 DLC doesn't have a release date yet but you can always go coo over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873460/EVERSPACE_2__Titans/">the Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whilst most players can expect the Gold Edition to unlock from Tuesday - and standard editions from Friday - some fans have seemingly received the game early. And rather than quietly getting on with it themselves, at least one has elected to livestream the game.</p>
<p>Having reportedly acquired a physical copy of the game early, the user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eyroec/star_wars_outlaws_kick_stream/">"thisisnotanaccount"</a> has popped up on livestream platform Kick.</p>
<p>Right now the stream is offline, and any videos or clips that may have been attached to the accounts have been removed. Perhaps unsurprisingly, though, copies and clips of their playthrough have been downloaded and reuploaded across social media, most notably on Tik Tok.</p>
<p>When challenged in chat about his reasoning for streaming the game early and "breaking NDA", they simply responded: "I have no NDA".</p>
<p>Ubisoft creative director Julian Gerighty recently acknowledged online criticism of Star Wars Outlaws - specifically, the aesthetic appearance of main character Kay Vess - by stating that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bad-faith-discourse-not-worth-engaging-with-ubisofts-star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-says">"bad-faith" debates are "not worth engaging with"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-offline-mode-interview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arena-breakout-infinite-offline-mode-doesn%E2%80%99t-exist-because-it%E2%80%99s-too-risky-and-expensive.961791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-offline-mode-interview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When Arena Breakout Infinite was revealed, one of the first things that the community started talking about was whether or not the game would have an offline mode. In these games, cheaters often ruin the fun in a multiplayer environment, which has led many players to desire a solo experience driven by AI-powered opponents and not real-world players.</p>



<p>I recently sat down with Enzo Zhang, the game’s producer, to talk about solo mode and the prospect of introducing PvE to Arena Breakout Infinite.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-are-facing-some-challenges">‘We Are Facing Some Challenges’</h2>



<p>To give the team credit, they’ve been <strong>trying </strong>to piece together an offline mode in Arena Breakout Infinite, but they admitted that they’ve been facing problems. Speaking to Enzo Zhang, I learned that they fully appreciate the desire for a single-player solution in ABI, especially as it’s ‘the best way to become familiar with a new map.’</p>



<p>With that in mind, the team at MoreFun Studios has faced extensive challenges in that area:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For ‘Solo Mode’ or ‘Offline Mode’, data computing needs to be done either on the server or the user end. If the data computing is done on the server to build the entire gaming environment for one user, the costs are very high. On the other hand, if the data computing is done on the user end, it exposes too much data to cheaters and hackers.</p>



<p>Right now, we don’t have an ideal solution <strong>yet</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The last comment from Zhang suggests that the team is still working on an offline mode in Arena Breakout Infinite. It’s not off the table entirely, but the company’s priority is building a stable, safe, and reliable multiplayer experience.</p>



<p>Recently, I learned that the team is piecing together <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-facul/">an industry-first AI model</a> that will allow players to interact with highly intelligent AI-powered companions. They’ll be able to use natural language to communicate with them, ordering them around the battlefield as though they were real people.</p>



<p>Have you been playing Arena Breakout Infinite? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>Amazon's latest crack at a Lord of the Rings MMO still needs to find its "hook".</p>
<p>That's coming from Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann, who in conversation with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview">IGN</a> said the team doesn't "just want to go and do the same thing over" with its Middle-earth game.</p>
<p>"While it's tempting sometimes with an existing IP, that's not the point of doing it. You've got to find a fresh twist, and we're still, I think, in that period where we really want to find out what could be the hook, what could be the thing which is different to all the other games out there," Hartmann said. "So it's a little bit early."</p>

<p>Amazon first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-announces-fresh-stab-at-turning-the-lord-of-the-rings-into-an-mmo">revealed its plans for this Lord of the Rings MMO last year</a>, as part of a deal with Embracer. The upcoming game was announced to be in development with its in-house studio behind New World, for PC and consoles. At this time, Hartmann said this MMO would offer players a "fresh take" on The Lord of the Rings, and was "in early stages of production".</p>
<p>This isn't Amazon's first bash at a Lord of the Rings MMO. The company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-cancels-its-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">cancelled an earlier attempt</a> after the project - initially announced in 2019 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-canned-because-it-just-got-very-complicated">became too "complicated"</a>. That particular Lord of the Rings project was set to be developed by a Hong Kong based company that was later acquired by publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon's upcoming Lord of the Rings MMO isn't, of course, the only Lord of the Rings MMO out there. We also have an existing and well-established MMO in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online">The Lord of the Rings Online</a> from Standing Stone Games. In January, Standing Stone revealed a rather <a href="https://www.lotro.com/news/lotro-letter-to-the-players-2024-en?locale=en_US">generous 2024 roadmap for the MMO</a>, which is now into its seventeenth year.</p>
<p>Hartmann previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-boss-expects-fans-to-just-move-over-from-previous-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">Amazon's upcoming MMO will be "worlds apart" from Lord of the Rings Online</a> in terms of the technology available now.</p>
<p>"It's a little exaggeration if I say it's going to be like black and white movies to colour, but that's the approach I want to take. It's just a completely different world," the exec stated last year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Enemies respawn after resting at a checkpoint, its challenging battles require you to manage a stamina meter, and perilous exploration can end in certain death if you’re not careful. So it’s reasonable for you to be wondering if <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> features another common soulslike staple: New Game Plus (NG+).<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,195410,196299" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This mode is known for allowing players to replay a game using all of the equipment and upgrades they earned in a previous playthrough, wielding it all against tougher enemies and bosses—and in some cases, entirely new threats that weren’t present in the initial experience.<br></p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> provides players with this always much-appreciated feature.

And if you’re a completionist, you may to want to see the game through multiple times anyway.</p><figure id="" data-id="4fa2b9a2e544d2d11323cbdbbb03f5ba" data-recommend-id="image://4fa2b9a2e544d2d11323cbdbbb03f5ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A monkey fights a bug with spikes all over it.

<p>According to a new report, a Pokemon Card Shop in Hong Kong was allegedly caught with over $1 million worth of crystal meth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3275171/hong-kong-police-raid-pokemon-card-shop-used-drug-front-seize-hk10-million-ice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">South China Morning Post</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-card-shop-had-over-1-million-in-meth-police-say/1100-6526063/?fta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamespot</a>), the Pokemon Card Shop was a 400-square-foot upstairs store in the Hung Hom district, and it was a popular spot for teenagers, children, and other enthusiasts. After an “extensive investigation”, the Hong Kong police searched a 28-year-old man outside the shop and found 5kg of crystal meth on him. Upon searching the premises, they found an additional 16kgs of meth in the “staff resting area”. The total 21kgs of drugs was worth over HK$10 million or US$1.3 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inspector Liong Chun-hin ensured through a statement that no children or teenagers were distributed drugs, and neither of them was involved in the trafficking at the Pokemon Card Shop. However, he added that “storing such a large quantity of the narcotics in a place where teenagers and children can visit is irresponsible and disgraceful behaviour that also heightens the possible risk of teenagers and children mistakenly encountering illegal drugs”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liong believes that the 28-year-old man working at the Pokemon Card Shop was “recruited by a drug-trafficking syndicate with promises of money and used his store to store the narcotics in an attempt to avoid detection”.&nbsp;The accused has been charged with drug trafficking and will appear at the Kowloon City Court on Wednesday.</p>

<p>According to a recent Hasbro job listing, the upcoming G.I. Joe Snake Eyes game will seemingly be open-world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://jobs.hasbro.com/job/Raleigh-Durham-Sr-WorldLevel-Designer-Nort/1202485900/?feedId=406100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job listing</a> is for a senior world/Level designer for a brand-new development studio called Atomic Arcade. The studio is in the process of finding staff to work on their first multi-platform AAA game. The upcoming title will be “a bold and contemporary new take on the G.I. Joe Universe,” and it will star the iconic character Snake Eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new listing revealed that the upcoming G.I. Joe Snake Eyes title will be a AAA third-person action adventure. The listing also asked for ‘experience working on open-world and/or Sandbox projects’ in the Extra Credit section, suggesting this could be an open-world G.I. Joe game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last update we received about the upcoming G.I. Joe Snake Eyes game was through a <a href="https://atomicarcade.com/news/development-update-1-gi-joe-snake-eyes-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> in 2023. Atomic Arcade revealed then that the game had officially transitioned from the concept stage to the pre-production phase.&nbsp;Atomic Arcade is part of Hasbro’s Wizards of the Coast division, known for creating top-rated games like Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons.&nbsp;</p>
