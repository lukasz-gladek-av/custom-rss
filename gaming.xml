			<p>Once Human is still a relatively new game, but as the game progresses, more events are being added to the title. This includes a variety of PvP events for players to take part in. However, Starry Studio, the developers of Once Human have become aware of players using terrain exploits to try and get a victory. As a result, Starry Studio has promised "strict action" against those who are aiming to "undermine the fairness and enjoyment of the game" in the Prismverse's Clash PvP mode. With the latest update to Once Human, this game has now rivaled games such as Rust, DayZ and 7 Days to Die on Steam's storefront, but the use of terrain exploits has become a consistent problem for those wanting to engage in PvP.</p>
<p>The Once Human update featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-humans-prismverses-clash-scenario-launches-september-26/">Prismverse's Clash</a> was added in patch 1.2, which was released last week. The update allows two teams of Metas to fight against one another, with players choosing which faction they want to support. Then, the players have to fight to claim Prism Deviations. While this game mode would typically be a lot of fun, the servers are currently plagued by players who want to exploit the terrain features, where players climbing mountains or hiding in bodies of water can become near invincible. As Starry Studio is now aware of the situation, they have said that they are intending to "take strict action against these violations." While a lot of the time, these sorts of statements are quite vague and don't explain what the action is, Starry Studio has specified what they have in store for those violating the rules.</p>
<p>"Once any of these violations are confirmed," it will wipe all points earned by the offending character, and the player's account will be banned for "a minimum of 30 days." The bans will be extended if that doesn't act as a deterrent. "For severe cases, bans can last up to ten years." On <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20240716/40780_1167540.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the official website</a>, the developers have also posted all characters who have been banned or reprimanded thus far for exploiting the game.</p>
<p>Starry Studio has asked those who catch offenders in the act to take a screenshot of the character and submit a report using the in-game customer support tools. In the meantime, Once Human developers are working on adding a new detection system for Prism Deviations; the units will no longer be able to be placed in water. "We hope all Metas will follow the game rules and maintain a fair and fun environment for everyone," says Starry Studio in the conclusion of their statement.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/emil-pagliarulo-says-starfield-is-the-best-game-weve-ever-made.999651/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/emil-pagliarulo-starfield-best-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Starfield&nbsp;</em>writer and designer Emil Pagliarulo has claimed that the game is, "in a lot of ways, the best game we've ever made", suggesting that it now "sits right next to&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls</em>" in Bethesda's pantheon.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/it-might-not-be-everyones-cup-of-tea-but-what-is-as-starfield-shattered-space-launches-bethesda-reflects-on-the-importance-of-players-speaking-their-mind/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to GamesRadar</a>, Pagliarulo said that&nbsp;<em>Starfield&nbsp;</em>is the result of Bethesda pushing itself to "make something totally different"; the studio set out to "jam into an Xbox the biggest, richest space simulation RPG anyone could imagine".</p>
<p>In Pagliarulo's eyes, the studio "pulled it off", and&nbsp;<em>Starfield&nbsp;</em>is, as a result, a "technical marvel". Pagliarulo acknowledges the game "might not be everyone's cup of tea", but he says it's been successful enough to take its place alongside the two aforementioned franchises.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starfield-bethesda-emil-pagliarulo-shattered-space.jpg?itok=nbjwFhjd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starfield-bethesda-emil-pagliarulo-shattered-space.jpg?itok=KuO2eJQo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Emil Pagliarulo is clearly proud of what Bethesda has achieved with&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Pagliarulo is effusive about Bethesda's achievements with&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>, it's an assessment with which a lot of players may find themselves disagreeing.</p>
<p>The game is still sitting at a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716740/Starfield/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mixed rating on Steam</a> across over 100,000 reviews, with players pointing to technical issues, a perceived shallowness in terms of content, and an overreliance on procedural generation as reasons to avoid&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>.</p>
<p>Pagliarulo's got an explanation for that, though; he says that&nbsp;<em>Starfield&nbsp;</em>does actually have lots of hand-crafted content, but that it's spread out over a wider distance, which is "something a lot of folks missed". Hmm.</p>
<p>When it comes to&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Shattered Space&nbsp;</em>DLC, Pagliarulo points to its "oodles" of what GamesRadar calls "bespoke content", as well as its "really unique", "hand-crafted landmass" to explore.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems players disagree with him;&nbsp;<em>Shattered Space</em>'s Steam reviews are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721670/Starfield__Shattered_Space/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sitting at Mostly Negative</a> right now, with players calling the DLC "boring", "lackluster", and "a disappointment".</p>
<p>It's also fair to say the DLC has failed to entice a lot of&nbsp;<em>Starfield&nbsp;</em>players back into space;&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>'s player count <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1716740/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">peaked at around 21,000</a> on Monday, which is a far cry from the game's glory days of more than 330,000 concurrent users close to launch.</p>
<p>Of course, not every&nbsp;<em>Starfield&nbsp;</em>player will be interested in DLC, but it's not a great look for a major expansion launch, especially when Pagliarulo says Bethesda looked to DLC from games like&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>(which is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/377160/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">about as popular</a> as&nbsp;<em>Starfield&nbsp;</em>on Steam right now despite being nine years old) for inspiration.</p>
<p>Pagliarulo says he's optimistic about&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>'s future; he tells GamesRadar he's "excited about the stuff we're working on now", suggesting that&nbsp;<em>Starfield&nbsp;</em>is "transcending its status as a game" and becoming a "platform for science fiction and space content".</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if he turns out to be right. In the meantime, you can check out our original review of&nbsp;<em>Starfield&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/starfield-review-interstellar-adventure">right here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-season-6-vessel-hatred-patch-notes-2-0-1851664198<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The next chapter in <em>Diablo IV</em>’s post-launch journey is almost here and it’s once again going to be turning a lot of the action-RPG on its head. A bevy of changes coming to all players as part of the Season 6 update will also be met by a ton of new content from the simultaneous<em> Vessel of Hatred</em> expansion. Blizzard finally outlined everything players can expect from <em>Diablo IV</em> 2.0. </p><p><em> Vessel of Hatred</em> and Season 6 are both set to go live at 7:00 p.m. ET on October 7. While the expansion’s campaign, new Spiritborn class, Nahantu region, Kurast Undercity time-attack dungeon, and more <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24140359/what-you-need-to-know-for-vessel-of-hatred-s-launch?blzcmp=blizzard-news&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24140359/what-you-need-to-know-for-vessel-of-hatred-s-launch?blzcmp=blizzard-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were all revealed previously</a></span>, the game-wide changes coming to all <em>Diablo IV</em> players with the arrival of Season 6 were detailed in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk2oJC-yX4Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk2oJC-yX4Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream this week</a></span>, followed by a full list of the Hatred Rising season patch notes. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24140803/conquer-colossal-foes-in-season-of-hatred-rising&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24140803/conquer-colossal-foes-in-season-of-hatred-rising" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Highlights include</a></span> Realmwalkers, enormous creatures with evil eye portals on their backs, which can now be found roaming the countryside. Once killed, they leave behind portals players can enter to discover new dangers and riches in Seething Realm dungeons. The creatures drop alongside a new Creeping Hatred quest that revolves around teaming up with the Zakarum Remnants, a brooding band of ennui-inflicted religious warriors who, when you encounter them, are in disarray.</p><p>More importantly, <em>Diablo IV’</em>s underlying leveling system and character progression are getting massive overhauls. Paragon and character levels are getting split, with Paragon levels—the post-game upgrade system—now being shared across all characters in either the eternal or seasonal realms. After level 60, players will start earning Paragon levels that unlock Paragon nodes. At the end of a season, all Paragon experience will be added to a player’s Eternal Realm progression. </p><p>World Tiers are also getting swapped out with standard difficulties to try and streamline the level of challenge players encounter in the game. World Tier I, II, III, and IV are now Normal, Hard, Expert, and Pentiment. Enemies no longer have levels and will just scale to the difficulty, granting more experience, gold, and better loot the harder the difficulty setting. A new Paragon board has been added for each character as well, and the Pit has received a big rework to make it less grindy and more rewarding. </p><p>There’s a ton more. Every character is getting one new skill and five additional passive abilities. The wardrobe can now be accessed from the character menu. A party finder now makes it way easier to link up with players who want to do similar activities and play with other people, which is clearly how so much of <em>Diablo IV</em> is intended to be played. The pros and cons of all of these changes will start to become apparent in the weeks ahead, but for now it should make the experience of playing a new seasonal character feel fresh all over again. </p><div data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Additional changes made since the PTR’s conclusion are highlighted in red.</p><h2 id="h139285"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Updates From PTR</strong></h2><h3 id="h139286"><a id=""></a>Game Updates</h3><h4 id="h139287"><a id=""></a>Masterworking</h4><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The Gold cost for Masterworking Ranks 5-12 has been reduced by approximately one third.</li><li>Masterworking materials now drop from more sources inside Nightmare Dungeons, including:Resplendent chestsNormal chestsMiscellaneous Interactive Objects, such as ambient corpsesBreakable ObjectsThe ButcherTreasure GoblinsLocal events</li><li>Non-Ancestral Legendary items can now be Masterworked up to 8 times and have two Tempering Affixes.</li><li>Material costs for Masterworking at lower Ranks have been adjusted.</li></ul><h4 id="h139288"><a id=""></a>The Pit</h4><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>50 additional Pit Tiers have been introduced, totaling 150.</li><li>Bonus tier unlocks for fast clears have increased from 3 to 5 tiers.</li></ul><h4 id="h139289"><a id=""></a>Loot Updates</h4><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Lower-level monsters will now drop more items, and less crafting materials.</li><li>Overall loot quality dropped by Hellborne has been increased.There is now a higher chance to receive at least One Legendary item, with an additional chance to receive 1-2 more.</li><li>Overall loot quality dropped by Treasure Goblins and The Butcher has been improved.The Butcher will always drop at least 1 legendary item.The Butcher will always drop the Butcher’s Cleaver Unique weapon.Treasure Goblins will always drop at least 1 Legendary item.</li><li>World Boss loot now scales with higher torment tiers.</li><li>Adjusted the drop rates of Mythic Unique items from Ladder Bosses to compensate for being guaranteed Ancestral quality.</li><li>Duriel and Andariel do not guarantee a Mythic item drop but their chance to drop a Mythic item is twice as high as other Tormented bosses.</li><li>The chance for Uniques to roll as Ancestral has been significantly increased.</li><li>Starting in Torment Difficulty I, only Legendary and Unique items can drop. Any Normal, Magic, or Rare items that would have randomly dropped will instead be automatically converted into corresponding crafting materials.</li></ul><h4 id="h139290"><a id=""></a>Runewords and Sockets</h4><p><strong>Developer’s Note: </strong><em>We love the enthusiasm around combining Runes, but we understand many would prefer the optimal combinations of Runewords to have bonuses other than scaling damage stats.</em><br><em>Our original approach was to create a journey where both the Runes of Ritual and Runes of Invocation would eventually lead to Legendary Runes becoming the most potent, but in practice, this led to a handful of combinations being favored. Now, the gap in power between rarity tiers for Runes of Invocation and Runes of Ritual will be much smaller, and Runes that provide utility will be more potent than Runes that only provide damage across all rarity tiers.</em><br><em>Additionally, to make sub power Runes competitive, the Rune type will deal more than other types found in Diablo IV depending on the amount of utility they provide.</em></p><p>Lith (Don’t walk or evade)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Previous: Stand still for 0.3 seconds.</li><li>Now: Stand still while fighting for 0.3 seconds.</li></ul><p>Feo (Become Crowd Controlled or Injured)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Reduce cooldown to 10 seconds.</li></ul><p>Vex (+3 to all Skills)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Offering increased from 400 to 1000.</li></ul><p>Kry (Spiritborn Vortex)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Reduced from 500 to 300 Offering.</li></ul><p>Ner (Rogue Concealment)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Reduced from 700 to 600 Offering.</li></ul><p>Jah (Sorcerer Teleport)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Offering reduced from 500 to 400.</li></ul><p>Qua (Movement Speed and Evade refresh)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Evade refresh removed.</li><li>Offering reduced from 400 to 50.</li></ul><p>Que (Enhanced Earthen Bulwark)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Changed to Base Earthen Bulwark.</li><li>Offering reduced from 800 to 300.</li></ul><p>Yom (Petrify)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Note: Petrify no longer gives Critical Strike Damage and instead grants 100 Resource.</li></ul><p>Ohm (Warcry)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Offering increased from 500 to 600.</li><li>Now uses base Warcry instead of Enhanced Warcry.</li></ul><p>Teb (Abhorrent Iron Maiden)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Rune version now deals 300% of base damage.</li></ul><p>Tun (Stun Grenades)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Rune version damage increased from 20% to 260%.</li></ul><p>Tal (Spiritborn Pestilent Swarm)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Rune version damage increased from 100% to 150%.</li></ul><p>Xan (Critical Overpower)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Offering increased from 700 to 900.</li></ul><p>Eom (Generic Cooldown Reduction)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Cooldown Reduction reduced from 0.25 to 0.1.</li></ul><p>Cah (Spiritwolves)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Enhanced the Spiritwolf AI allowing it to engage in combat faster.</li><li>Increased the Attack damage from 14% to 30%.</li><li>Increased the Leap damage from 14% to 50%.</li></ul><p>Zec (Ultimate Cooldown Reduction)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Cooldown Reduction reduced from 4 to 2 seconds.</li></ul><p>Lac (Barbarian Challenging Shout)</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Reduce rune version duration from 6 to 3 seconds.</li><li>Reduce offering from 800 to 400.</li></ul><p>Runes removed:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ur</li><li>Ono</li><li>Met</li><li>Kaa</li></ul><p>The following runes have had their icons updated to match their Diablo II predecessors.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ohm</li><li>Thul</li><li>Vex</li><li>Lum</li><li>Jah</li><li>Tal</li></ul><p>Updates for adding sockets to items:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The Jeweler is now accessible at Level 1 instead of at Level 15.</li><li>Chipped Gems can now be crafted at Level 1 instead of Level 15.</li><li>Gem Fragments now start dropping at Level 5.</li><li>Socketing costs only require Scattered Prisms for Ancestral items.

Players will now earn a one-time experience reward when killing a Stronghold Boss, preventing players from infinitely earning large amounts of experience from the same Stronghold through partying.</li></ul><p><strong>Developer’s Note: </strong><em>We’re glad the return of quest experience rewards, like Strongholds, in Patch 2.0 is being enjoyed. We’ve adjusted the experience reward so that Strongholds remain a strong early to midgame levelling activity, but not strong enough that it’s mandatory to hold them from completion until later

There’s a new icon on the Battle Pass reward track that displays your Earned Favor progress, so you’ll know exactly how far you are from unlocking your next Smoldering Ashes.</em></p><h2 id="h139394"><a id=""></a><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h2><h3 id="h139395"><a id=""></a>Gameplay</h3><h4 id="h139396"><a id=""></a>Barbarian</h4><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed an issue where excessive skill ranks of Martial Vigor and Guttural Yell could result in 100% Damage reduction.</li></ul><p><strong>Developer’s Note: </strong><em>This was only possible on the Eternal Realm since the tempering recipe for additional ranks of these skills was removed in the Season of Infernal Hordes.

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-is-getting-a-aaa-rpg-with-saber-interactive-and-paramount-game-studios-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Paramount Game Studios and Saber Interactive are developing a AAA action RPG for Avatar: The Last Airbender.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per the report, the game will be set in the Avatar Legends Universe and created in “close collaboration” with Avatar Studios, helmed by the original show creators, Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Very few details about the Avatar: The Last Airbender RPG were revealed, but Saber Interactive and Paramount Game Studios have called it “the biggest video game in franchise history”. The game will be released for PC and consoles, and players can experience an “all-new, never-before-seen Avatar” when it is out. No release window was provided.</p>



<p>Regarding what the game will be about, Avatar: The Last Airbender RPG is based in a world set thousands of years in the past. Players can master the four elements, combat alongside companions and experience what it is to be the Avatar. The story will feature elements that fans know and love, as well as some entirely new stuff.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Sony revealed the gorgeous DualSense Chroma Collection during September’s State of Play, and the lineup is now officially available for preorder at Amazon. Two of the three are slated to arrive later this year, while the third won’t drop until January 2025. Exclusive DualSense controllers like these are usually incredibly popular--so it never hurts to lock in a reservation if you’re hoping to add one to your collection. Here’s where you’ll find all three of the upcoming DualSense Chroma controllers.

                <p>With a new Dragon Ball game out this month, now might be the right time to upgrade your gaming chair so that you can wield the power of Goku in style. Secretlab has just the right cradle for your glutes, as the company has unveiled a new variant of its Titan Evo gaming chair. This one features a vibrant design inspired by Dragon Ball Z, and it'll be launching just in time for the 40th anniversary of the legendary manga and anime franchise. You can preorder the chair for $624 at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fsecretlab.co%2Fcollections%2Fgaming-chairs&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsecretlab-unveils-new-dragon-ball-themed-titan-evo-gaming-chair%2F1100-6526853%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Secretlab's online store</a>.</p><p>The Secretlab Titan Evo: Dragon Ball Z Goku Edition is a nostalgic twist on the regular version of this chair. Just like the Dragon Ball's protagonist's signature fashion, it's decked out in a series of orange and blue colors, and it has several other Easter eggs. You can find all seven Dragon Balls on the chair, symbols for the Kame and Kai-Oh schools that Goku trained under, and the four-star Dragon Ball prominently displayed. The other nice thing about this design is that it subtly references the battle damage that Goku accrues in his fights with some speckling between the colors. There's even an advanced 3D gradient knit to emulate the aura that surrounds Goku when he transforms into a Super Saiyan.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4377586-%5Bsetup_4_3%5Dsecretlabxdragonballz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377586" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1440" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4377586-%5Bsetup_4_3%5Dsecretlabxdragonballz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377586"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4377586-%5Bsetup_4_3%5Dsecretlabxdragonballz.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4377587-%5Bsubimage1%5Dsecretlabxdragonballz.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4377588-%5Bsubimage2%5Dsecretlabxdragonballz.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4377589-%5Bsubimage3%5Dsecretlabxdragonballz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377587,1300-4377588,1300-4377589" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4377587-%5Bsubimage1%5Dsecretlabxdragonballz.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4377588-%5Bsubimage2%5Dsecretlabxdragonballz.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4377589-%5Bsubimage3%5Dsecretlabxdragonballz.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4377587-%5Bsubimage1%5Dsecretlabxdragonballz.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4377588-%5Bsubimage2%5Dsecretlabxdragonballz.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4377589-%5Bsubimage3%5Dsecretlabxdragonballz.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-chair/1100-6486393/">The Titan Evo ranks as our favorite gaming chair currently on the market</a>, striking a balance between style, price, and comfort.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-jailbreaking/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest PlayStation 5 firmware introduced some changes that will heavily impact jailbreaking, making it difficult for users to continue accessing their digital libraries after taking their system offline.</p>
<p>As explained earlier today by well-known Souls series hacker Lance McDonald on <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, the latest firmware update changed the "Restore Licenses" screen so that it is now only possible to download licenses for games that are already installed on the system. Previously, licenses for every owned game would be restored, even for games not installed on the console. This means that once a PlayStation 5 console has taken offline, users won't be able to play the vast majority of the digital games they have purchased, being forced to use pirated backups. This will also prevent users from making backups of games to be shared with others. While this won't be a major issue for any legitimate use cases, this will make jailbreaking the console and modding games much harder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The screen used to look like this. You could download every single license to everything you’ve ever bought, even if it’s not currently installed. Then you could take your PS5 offline, jailbreak it, yet still have access to all your legitimately purchased digital games. <a href="https://t.co/fxvbCQO4dT">pic.twitter.com/fxvbCQO4dT</a></p>
<p>— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1841650827448221915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Won’t have any impact on legitimate use cases. Just a pain in the ass for people who want to take their PS5 offline hoping in the future to jailbreak it and mod/hack digital games they own.</p>
<p>— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1841651366076547412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The latest major PlayStation 5 firmware update is update <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-3d-audio/">24.06</a>, which introduced the new Welcome hub, a personalized space that users can customize with various widgets, a new Party Share feature, personalized 3D audio profiles, and a new Remote Play setting. This update was soon followed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-10-01-00/">another</a> that fixed issues for select games, such as Final Fantasy XVI, caused by some changes made by the 24.06 update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earth-defense-force-6-epic-account-dropped<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sandlot and publisher D3Publisher have announced that you'll no longer need to sign into an Epic Games account if you want to play&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>online via Steam.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2291060/announcements/detail/4674264042200462235" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement on Steam</a>, the two studios say that you can now play online missions in&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>without signing into your Epic account if you wish.</p>
<p>Sandlot and D3Publisher also provide a link to <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_EpicAccount/c-EpicAccountServices/how-do-i-disable-access-to-my-epic-account-for-a-specific-product-or-service-such-as-a-site-game-or-app-a000084959" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic's page about unlinking your Epic account from services like Steam</a>, so if you want to go full scorched earth and get rid of your Epic credentials from Steam altogether, that's how you go about doing so.</p>

<p>The third-person bug-splattering shooter was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earth-defense-force-6-review-bomb-epic">review bombed close to release</a> thanks to its Epic account requirement, and even a quick glance at the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2291060/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_6/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most recent Steam reviews</a> shows that many of them - including the positive ones - mention Epic.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that a lot of PC gamers have pretty strong feelings about the Epic Games Store, although that didn't stop them <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-store-year-in-review-2023">spending around $950 million</a> on games and apps from the store last year.</p>
<p>Still, if you're an&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force&nbsp;</em>fan and you've been holding off on picking up this sixth installment for fear you'd need to sign into an Epic account to play online, now's the time to dive in.</p>

<p><em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>is, as the title suggests, the sixth mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force&nbsp;</em>series (although it's far from the sixth game, thanks to the existence of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earth-defense-force-world-brothers-2-release-date-set-for-september">various spinoffs</a>).</p>
<p>It's a multiplayer-focused third-person shooter in which your goal is to attempt to reclaim a ravaged Earth from an invasion of malevolent alien insects and other beasties. You can think of it as a way more over-the-top&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, if you can imagine such a thing.</p>
<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2291060/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10002862" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>.

            <p>Out 17th October on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127660/Mask_Quest/">Steam</a>, Mask Quest is a platform game in which you hold and release a button to refill your character's lungs while dodging police batons, bullets, gas grenades and drones. Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-many-people-in-this-crowd-have-seen-molyjam">Peter Molydeux</a>, but in this case, it's all the fine work of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stephens-sausage-roll">Stephen's Sausage Roll</a> developer increpare and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quadrant-rhythm-game-demo">Quadrant</a> developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.</p> <!--more-->

<p>So, those complexities. From what I can glean, the levels evolve beyond the initial "do what you do in most platformers + remember to inhale/exhale" conceit, with setups that make the breathing mechanic more feature than constraint. For example: you can breathe out to shunt away quadrotor drones before they knock you off ladders, and blow on sails to inflate them. There's a bit where it looks like you're expelling air to lower your mass and fall through surfaces. There's also the prospect of hyperventilation, which seemingly requires you to preserve the rhythm of your respiration, however frenzied your surroundings: breathe too rapidly and you'll empty out your carbon dioxide gauge.</p>
<p>As for the political overtones: 1) your objective is, as you'd guess, to find a mask, which is "sold out everywhere". It feels like an allusion to "post"-pandemic politics and the expectation that clinically vulnerable people must now see to their own protection, without state support. And 2) your character is Black, your enemies all appear to be cops, and the breath mechanic may refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_can't_breathe">the murder of Eric Garner</a>. I am likely reaching horribly with all this, or at best, lumpishly unearthing the subtext.</p><p>For reasons best known only to themselves, the developers have localised Mask Quest in Latin, a "dead" language, and Toki Pona, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona">Wikipedia</a> calls "a philosophical artistic constructed language known for its small vocabulary, simplicity, and ease of acquisition", devised by Canadian linguist Sonja Lang around the turn of the millennium. It's all absolutely in keeping with the eccentricity of increpare's past creations, which you can read about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/increpare">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some fans obtained a copy early, however, and while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-remake-leak-reveals-revamped-intro-in-3-hours-of-ps5-gameplay">one player already shared the revamped opening of the game</a>, essentially the entire thing has now leaked online.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-comes-to-playstation-5-and-pc-in-october-2024">The Until Dawn remake has many changes previously announced</a>, such as revised cinematography that uses a combination of fixed and over-the-shoulder camera views, new accessibility and usability settings such as an alternative to the Don't Move mechanic, and, now revealed via these leaks, some even more significant changes too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Until Dawn on PS5 and PC — <em><strong>and final spoiler warning before we divulge these changes</strong></em> — features not just a remade opening but new ending scenes too.</p><p>Reddit user crawplays shared the post-credit scenes, below, which add new endings and a potential sequel tease. Until Dawn is a horror game where all eight main characters can live, die, or anything in between, and these two scenes come at the end of both Josh and Sam's "good" endings particularly.</p><p>Josh's is the smaller of the two and clears up some of the ambiguity surrounding his ending in the original Until Dawn. While his story perhaps had the most tragic end, with even his positive outcome seeing him taken by his sister turned spindly murdering monster, the remake puts a definitively more hopeful spin on things.</p><p>A cutscene shows Josh, played by Rami Malek, survive the wendigo encounter while a voiceover from Doctor Hill, the therapist who speaks with him and the player between each chapter, talks of Josh finally finding redemption.</p><p>The larger of the two scenes is what some players believe sets up a sequel, however. It's the first scene not set within the single night the rest of Until Dawn takes place in, instead showing Sam, played by Hayden Panettiere, years later.</p><p>Aptly waking up at dawn in her Los Angeles apartment, with medicine and a book about myths on her bedside table, Sam swipes to unlock her phone and blood smears across the screen. She opens her palm and sees blood trickling down from a nasty scar on her arm that doesn't quite appear to be real. Following a knock at the door and further wipes at her arm, a voice from behind her whispers "Sam" before the scene cuts to black.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PC Games</h3></div></output><p>Original developer Supermassive Games hasn't otherwise indicated a sequel is on the way and is plenty busy with its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-dark-pictures-anthology-the-devil-in-me-review">Dark Pictures Anthology games</a>. While it's released several of these in the years since Until Dawn arrived, alongside a full spiritual sequel in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-quarry-review">The Quarry</a>, perhaps none have been as well received as Until Dawn itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-announced-for-ps5-and-pc-alongside-a-release-window-state-of-play-2024">The PS5 and PC version was announced in January 2024</a> as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-are-all-the-ps5-games">the latest in a long line of ports and remasters from Sony</a>.

It's in collaboration with Avatar Studios, the division launched by original show creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-franchise-expanding-with-new-animated-movie-dedicated-studio">in 2021</a> with the goal of expanding the Avatar universe.</p><p>It's still in early development, so details are a little slim at the moment, but the companies call it "the biggest video game in franchise history." It will be made for both PC and consoles and tell a new story in the universe that's being developed in "close collaboration" with Avatar Studios, the announcement notes. </p><p>It'll put players in the role of an "all-new, never-before-seen Avatar" and take place thousands of years in the past. According to Paramount and Saber, players "can expect to be immersed in a vibrant world, master all four elements, engage in dynamic combat alongside companions, and experience the challenges and decisions that come with being the keeper of balance in the world." It adds that, story-wise, it'll feature elements both new and familiar to fans of the franchise.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/03/alta-1727916033734.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Avatar: The Last Airbender is getting its first AAA RPG. </figcaption></figure></output><p>“We know loyal fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender have been eager for more stories that bring them into the universe of the show, and through gaming, we’re able to expand the world-building and allow fans to experience the new content in a completely immersive way,” said Doug Rosen, SVP, Games and Emerging Media at Paramount. “Saber Interactive has a proven track record in bringing IP-based games to life, and we are excited to co-fund this AAA title alongside them and let fans experience this world first-hand.”</p><p>“At Saber, we are all truly fans of the IP we work with,” said Josh Austin, Head of IP Development &amp; Licensing, Saber Interactive. “Our team members are some of the most devoted, passionate creatives out there and it’s an honor to join forces with Avatar Studios and Paramount Games to further expand the Avatar Legends universe in video games.

It also wasn't exceptionally difficult. But it nailed a terrifying sensation for anyone who's ever been rock climbing: the terrible strain put on your muscles as you're hanging dozens—or hundreds—of feet up in the air.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cairn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is obviously safer for your real body than the real deal, and it's even safer than hitting your local gym. But the sensation is still there. Creative director Emeric Thoa explained to us after some time with the game that the studio was deeply invested in capturing the struggle and intense thrill real-life rock climbers experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To do that, it had to capture the pain and careful consideration that climbers practice when hauling themselves up a ledge.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cairn"><span>Cairn</span> is all about managing the limbs</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thoa joked in our conversation that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cairn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is almost like a "vertical </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Death Stranding</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," making a comparison to Kojima Productions' debut title, which tasked players with methodically walking across a post-apocalyptic United States on a journey where every bump or crevice in the dirt could throw off the huge loads they carried on their backs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Player character Aava has an easier time than </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Death Stranding</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s Sam Porter Bridges when she's navigating flat surfaces, but when it comes time to scale the walls of Mount Kami, she'll have to take on tasks his bulky arms couldn't possibly handle.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-got-to-be-hard-to-make-something-bad-how-glowmade-is-building-ugc-tools-in-king-of-meat" target="_self">'It's got to be hard to make something bad:' How Glowmade is building UGC tools in King of Meat</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is how the game's controls work: once players are on the rock wall, they control each of Aava's limbs as she grips crevices, inclines, and even smooth surfaces. The game automatically cycles through her arms and legs, meaning players need to quickly decide if their limb is already in a strong position, or if they need to move it to reach the next incline.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn't possible with premade animations. Thoa explained that because hands and feet can be placed anywhere, the character needed to be animated using a mix of inverse kinematic (IK) rigs and procedural animation. "There is no human-made animation," he stressed.</span></p><p>Image via The Game Bakers.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An algorithm calculating those animations works in tandem with another one that measures how much effort each movement requires and how stable Aava's position is. Players can boost her stamina with snacks and drinks quickly slurped down on the cliffside, or by dropping a pinion in the cliffside to hang for a rest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/rogue-flight-game-retro-anime-macross-gundam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A little while ago, Luke <a href="https://aftermath.site/anime-classics-mecha-robot-recommendations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a piece</a> about the anime of his youth and how They Don’t Make ‘Em Like They Used To – a curmudgeonly rallying cry that he used as a jumping-off point to examine the very literal ways in which that statement is true. One example he cited was <em>Macross</em>, an ‘80s mech series that has found numerous ways to be about way more than just mechs. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784620/ROGUE_FLIGHT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Rogue Flight</em></a>, a space combat game coming later this year, wears that influence on its sleeve.&nbsp;</p><p>The game’s trailer speaks ominously of the world burning at the hands of a “watchman system” that took control of the solar defense force and turned on humanity, then shows off some slick-looking animated scenes and even slicker-looking space combat. The ships do flips. I’m into it.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Rogue Flight - Coming Late 2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IX_GefjbJbE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This one’s also touting a seriously stacked voice cast. <em>Rogue Flight</em>’s Steam page says that it features “Japanese talent from<em> Sailor Moon</em>, <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, <em>Gundam</em>, <em>Naruto </em>&amp; <em>One Piece</em>, and English voice talent featured in <em>Overwatch </em>and <em>Fallout 76</em>, <em>League of Legends</em> and Marvel's <em>Avengers</em>.” It seems like, at least on that front, developer Truant Pixel understood the assignment. But can its story measure up to the likes of <em>Macross Plus</em> and <em>Macross: Do You Remember Love</em>, which Luke, Chris, and I derailed an Aftermath meeting to gush about last week? It’s a tall order, but here’s hoping.</p><p>All of this got me thinking: What are some other games that do justice to the retro anime vibe? As far as released stuff goes, there’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/jumplight-odyssey-rip-impressions-review-league-geeks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the sadly-discontinued <em>Jumplight Odyssey</em></a>, as well as better-faring fare like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/VA11_HallA_Cyberpunk_Bartender_Action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>VA-11 HALL-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/29619/River_City_Girls_1_2_and_Zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent <em>River City</em> games</a>. On the horizon, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD_smAWp8OQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Vivarium</em></a><em> </em>looks super promising if you’re into cozy stuff, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXfldahdjM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Nightshift Galaxy</em></a> appears to be approaching mechanized space combat from a slightly different angle than <em>Rogue Flight</em>. Are there any others on your radar?&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-last-airbender-aaa-rpg-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and Paramount have announced a new AAA action RPG based on Nickelodeon's iconic animation&nbsp;<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, and the two studios are working in collaboration with Avatar Studios on the project.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-is-getting-a-aaa-rpg-with-saber-interactive-and-paramount-game-studios-exclusive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an IGN report</a>, the project will be part of the Avatar Legends universe and will tell a completely original story, so it won't be adapting either&nbsp;<em>The Last Airbender&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Korra</em>.</p>
<p>Instead, the game will cast players as an all-new Avatar who's never been seen before in the lore of the show, and it'll take place "thousands of years in the past", according to IGN. That's right; it's a prequel!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-the-last-airbender-rpg-saber-quest-for-balance.jpg?itok=tH-LJUIR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-the-last-airbender-rpg-saber-quest-for-balance.jpg?itok=FXgkDI6Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other&nbsp;<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;</em>games exist, but they're...of varying quality.</figcaption></figure><p>A press release given to IGN by Paramount and Saber says players can expect a "vibrant world" from the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Avatar&nbsp;</em>game (no, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">not that <em>Avatar</em></a>), as well as the ability to "master all four elements", as you'd expect from an Avatar.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to "engage in dynamic combat alongside companions" and face "the challenges and decisions that come with being the keeper of balance in the world".&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two studios are promising story elements that are, to quote IGN, "both new and familiar to fans of the franchise". It's all pretty vague at the moment. Presumably, we'll hear more about the project in the coming months.</p>
<p>Paramount gaming SVP Doug Rosen says the&nbsp;<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;</em>RPG represents a chance to "expand the world-building" and allow&nbsp;<em>Avatar&nbsp;</em>fans to "experience the new content in a completely immersive way".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nickelodeon-kart-racers-3-slime-speedway-aang.jpg?itok=A__k6XE6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nickelodeon-kart-racers-3-slime-speedway-aang.jpg?itok=q3EJx7Hl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This won't be&nbsp;<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>'s first foray into the gaming world.</figcaption></figure><p>While this will, according to Saber and Paramount, be "the biggest video game in franchise history", it won't be&nbsp;<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>'s first journey into the gaming world.</p>
<p>A number of direct&nbsp;<em>The Last Airbender&nbsp;</em>adaptations have been made, and characters from the show have also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-last-airbender-characters-to-join-smite">joined the ranks of god-bothering MOBA&nbsp;<em>Smite</em></a>, of all things. Still, this project looks like it might be a bit more substantial than the ones that have come before.</p>

Paramount and Saber Interactive are teaming up to make the action RPG, which will put you in control of an “all-new, never-before-seen Avatar,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-is-getting-a-aaa-rpg-with-saber-interactive-and-paramount-game-studios-exclusive">as reported earlier by <em>IGN</em></a>.</p><p>Details about the upcoming game are still slim, but the companies say in a press release that it will let players master all four elements with “dynamic combat alongside companions” as well as “experience the challenges and decisions that come with being the keeper of balance in the world.”</p><p>Since the release of the animated <em>ATLA</em> series in 2005, we’ve seen several video game and live-action adaptations, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24071094/netflix-avatar-last-airbender-review">including one on Netflix</a>. Last year, Bamtang Games released <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender - Quest for Balance</em> — a co-op title that lets you play as&nbsp;Aang, Toph, Sokka, and Katara — but it didn’t <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-quest-for-balance-review">receive the most positive reviews</a>. </p><p>I’m looking forward to seeing how Paramount and Saber Interactive handle this upcoming game, especially since you’ll be playing as a new Avatar that’s not Aang or Korra. Saber Interactive is behind several successful titles as both a developer and publisher, including <em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 </em>and <em>Teardown</em>, along with adaptations like <em>Evil Dead: The Game</em> and <em>World War Z</em>.</p><p>“We know loyal fans of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> have been eager for more stories that bring them into the universe of the show, and through gaming, we’re able to expand the world-building and allow fans to experience the new content in a completely immersive way,” Doug Rosen, the senior vice president of games and emerging media at Paramount, said in the announcement.</p><p>This isn’t the only new <em>ATLA</em> game we’re getting, either. In February, a presentation from publisher Maximum Games revealed that it’s <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/02/avatar-the-last-airbender-competitive-multiplayer-fighting-game-announced">working on a competitive multiplayer fighting game</a> in the <em>ATLA</em> universe.</p><p><em><strong>Correction, October 3rd: </strong>An earlier version of the article stated Saber Interactive was behind </em>Vampyr <em>but it only developed the Switch version.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At the same time, Blizzard has become emblematic of many of the industry’s biggest failings, from the shareholder pressures to prioritize monetization over creativity to the deep sexism that still pervades so much of gaming today.&nbsp;</p><p>Jason’s book is out on October 8th, and it’s an incredible, detailed accounting of how Blizzard started, grew into one of the most beloved (and most controversial) companies in the world of video games, and eventually became a victim of its own mismanagement. Oh, and there are a series of chaotic, culture-clashing acquisitions along the way, culminating with Microsoft closing its deal to buy the combined company known as Activision Blizzard last year in the most expensive acquisition in gaming history. </p><p>As you’ll hear Jason tell it, the story of Blizzard really revolves around two central themes. One is the inherent tension that exists between art and commerce and how Blizzard’s journey from a small startup in California to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">subsidiary of Microsoft</a> with thousands of employees has been about as close to M&amp;A hell as you can imagine. </p><div><p>In particular, Jason goes into detail about how merging with Activision, the company behind <em>Call of Duty</em>, set Blizzard on a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-25/book-excerpt-play-nice-the-rise-fall-and-future-of-blizzard-entertainment">collision course that would rob it of much of the creative agency</a> that allowed it to flourish back in the ’90s.&nbsp;</p></div><p>The other big theme is how industries in intense insular fandoms, like gaming, often have deeply problematic workplace cultures that take root from the very beginning and refuse to let go. That makes these companies almost impossible to change without industry-shaking upheaval. </p><div><p>Listen to <em>Decoder</em>, a show hosted by <em>The Verge</em>’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems.&nbsp;Subscribe&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/welcome-to-decoder/id1011668648?i=1000496212371&amp;itsct=podcast_box&amp;itscg=30200&amp;ls=1&amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;ct=verge091322">here</a>!</p></div><p>The state of California filed a massive sexism and discrimination lawsuit against Activision Blizzard in 2021, a moment that would change the course of the company and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-blizzard-microsoft-deal-11642557922">precipitate its sale to Microsoft’s Xbox division</a> the following year. (Activision Blizzard and California <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/15/24003556/california-activision-blizzard-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement">settled the suit in 2023</a>, shortly after the Microsoft deal closed.)</p><p>There’s a lot going on here. And as you’ll hear Jason say, the story of Blizzard is a quintessential tale about the perils of capitalism — about what growth and scale will do to a business, especially those in the business of making art, and the compromises that have to be made along the way to keep all that money flowing. </p><p>It’s also a cautionary tale, about a fundamentally creative industry that has, at many times in its history, utterly failed to make room for more diverse voices, creating a ticking time bomb at the heart of even the most beloved institutions. </p><p>If you want to read more about the history of Blizzard, including excerpts from Jason’s book and deeper reporting on the Microsoft-Activision saga, check out these links below: </p><div><ul><li><em>Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment </em>| <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725443/?lens=grand-central-publishing"><em>Hachette</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></li><li>How Blizzard’s canceled MMO Titan fell apart | <a href="https://www.polygon.com/excerpt/458330/why-blizzard-mmo-titan-was-cancelled"><em>Polygon</em></a></li><li>Blizzard was built on crunch, co-founder says, but it’s ‘not sustainable’ | <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/27/18761120/video-games-crunch-developers-unionize-mike-morhaime-comments-blizzard-world-of-warcraft"><em>Polygon</em></a></li><li>Inside Activision and Blizzard’s corporate warcraft | <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-25/book-excerpt-play-nice-the-rise-fall-and-future-of-blizzard-entertainment"><em>Bloomberg</em></a></li><li>Blizzard cofounder’s new company Dreamhaven aims to recreate old magic | <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-18/blizzard-co-founder-s-new-company-dreamhaven-aims-to-recreate-the-old-magic"><em>Bloomberg</em></a></li><li>Activision Blizzard’s rot goes all the way to the CEO, alleges report | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"><em>The Verge</em></a></li><li>Activision Blizzard’s workplace problems spurred $75 billion Microsoft deal | <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-blizzard-microsoft-deal-11642557922"><em>WSJ</em></a></li><li>California settles Activision Blizzard gender discrimination lawsuit | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/15/24003556/california-activision-blizzard-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement"><em>The Verge</em></a></li><li>Microsoft completes Activision Blizzard acquisition | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized"><em>The Verge</em></a></li><li>Microsoft lays off 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs"><em>The Verge</em></a></li></ul></div><div><div><h2>Decoder with Nilay Patel<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>A podcast from The Verge about big ideas and other problems.</p></div><p><a href="https://pod.link/decoder">SUBSCRIBE NOW!</a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Konami producers have revealed that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater was easier to remake than Metal Gear Solid 1 and 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/19148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1841640650359656919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki</a>), game producer Noriaki Okamura and creative producer Yuji Korekado explained why it would be harder to remake MGS1/2 than Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Okamura stated that to remake those two games, the developers must make some parts from scratch, including level design. With the remake of MGS 3, the developers only needed to create a few new parts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okamura added that they first want players to play the Metal Gear Solid: Delta remake, get feedback, and move forward accordingly. Also, very few staff members left were involved with Metal Gear Solid 1/2. Hence, they plan to “create a path to preserve the Metal Gear series for 10 or 50 years into the future” before all those involved with the original titles leave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Korekado further stated that releasing the Metal Gear Solid Remake on PC will increase the game’s chances of being enjoyed for the next “10 to 20 years,” and their goal is to achieve that.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Remakes and remasters of classic games are nothing new, but definitely becoming more and more common, with games like Final Fantasy 7, Resident Evil 2 and 4, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 hitting consoles all in the past four years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hametsu-core-rulebook-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Set in late 16th Century Japan, after an event known as the cataclysm opened a portal and released demons into the world, <em>Hametsu</em> sees groups of survivors battling for survival, seeking answers, or simply seeking glory in this apocalyptic fantasy wargame.</p>
<p>This is our first article covering <em>Hametsu</em>, and we'll focus on the Core Rulebook here and how to play, but in future articles, we'll be looking at the <em>Hametsu</em> miniatures available from <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/hametsu">Black Site Studios</a>, and other supplements as they release.</p>
<h2>What Is Hametsu?</h2>
<p><em>Hametsu</em> is a tabletop wargame for 1 to 4 players, which means it can be played solo or cooperatively against AI-controlled enemies. While Black Site Studios produces miniatures for the heroes and enemies for <em>Hametsu</em> (along with some awesome scenery), it's a miniature agnostic system, so you can use any miniatures you wish to play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-2.jpg?itok=T3qcSxxw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-2.jpg?itok=IlWE5ljJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>How Do You Play Hametsu?</h2>
<p><em>Hametsu</em> has an extremely simple set of core rules, they take up about 11 pages in total in the Core Rulebook and include details of how enemies work, and all the actions available to the players. Characters and enemies have 4 core stats (Mind, Melee, Ranged, and Resilience), along with a Move, Body, Divine Favor, and Base Size stat. When making a test, players roll dice equal to the stat and need to score the number of successes required for the test. In some cases, like combat, this is a roll-off between the attacker's melee or ranged, and the defender's resilience stat.</p>
<p>Games of <em>Hametsu</em> take place over 3 unique phases. In the Stealth phase, players try to sneak around, avoiding the AI-controlled enemies who use the orders detailed in the scenario. In the Clash phase, enemies are aware of the players and attack them using their individual instinct rules. During both phases, players try to investigate clues, where they roll a D6 and add 1 for each previously investigated clue. Once a 9 is rolled on a clue investigation, the game moves into the Boss phase, and the lesser enemies flee to make way for a larger and more dangerous enemy.</p>
<p>Once a game is won, or lost, the players get a chance to upgrade their characters and move on to the next mission, with enemies scaling based on the combined levels of the players.</p>

<p><em>Hametsu</em> contains 4 schools, each containing 3 types of Hunters that players can choose from. The hunting party can contain any combination of hunters that players wish.</p>
<p>School of Magic</p>
<ul><li>Onmyoji - Magic users of elemental energies</li>
<li>Bunraku - Students of death magic</li>
<li>Monk - Spiritual magic users</li>
</ul><p>School of Stealth</p>
<ul><li>Shinobi - Ninjas, the masters of stealth</li>
<li>Geisha - Performers who use their abilities for distraction</li>
<li>Matagi - Ranged warriors</li>
</ul><p>School of Strength</p>
<ul><li>Ronin - Masterless samurai</li>
<li>Gaijin - Foreign warriors</li>
<li>Sumo - Large fighters who specialize in hand-to-hand</li>
</ul><p>School of Corruption</p>
<p>The <em>Hametsu</em> Core Rulebook includes the School of Corruption as a bonus school. These powerful classes can be played from the start, but using the core 3 schools for your first few games is advised, especially to play through the included campaign in the book.</p>
<ul><li>Ketto - Fast dual-wielding warriors</li>
<li>Kaeru - Stealthy acrobatic hunters</li>
<li>Doku - Poison users</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-4.jpg?itok=kAooaVgk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-4.jpg?itok=eljeFtQf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Does The Hametsu Core Rulebook Contain?</h2>
<p>As well as the fantastic art, that captures the feel of an apocalyptic feudal Japan and lore in the form of notes and stories to get you into the setting, the <em>Hametsu</em> Core Rulebook contains the core rules, along with detailed rules for combat and how to create a hunter (using the 4 schools and 12 hunter types detailed above). It also contains details about how to randomly generate a game (along with some fixed scenarios), using the 6 enemy profiles and 6 boss profiles. The book also details the post-game sequence for leveling up your hunters, and advanced rules for mounts and companions, along with tables for random weather and events to add variety to your games.</p>
<p>When Hunters get to level 8, they can also take part in Raids, which are high-level boss battles against raid targets. These games don't have any stealth or clash phase, just the hunters and a boss. The <em>Hametsu</em> Core Rulebook contains details of the Raid game type, and the first raid boss, the giant Omukade. The book closes with a narrative campaign, The Wolf and the Devil, which is perfect for 4 level 1 Hunters to start their <em>Hametsu</em> journey.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, <em>Hametsu</em> is a miniatures agnostic system, so you can use any miniatures you wish, but Black Site Studios produce a range of miniatures for all the hunters, enemies, and bosses in the Core Rulebook. You can also pick up the Black Site Studios scenery, or create your own awesome landscapes to battle on.</p>
<p>The first expansion for <em>Hametsu</em> is also currently up for preorder, <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/products/hametsu-season-1-digital-bundle?variant=45362731155697">The Ryu and the Rain</a>, and also the&nbsp;<em>Hametsu</em> Legends: Mushashi solo expansion booklet. We'll look at these in detail in a future article.</p>
<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Hametsu Core Rulebook?</h2>
<p><em>Hametsu</em> perfectly blends a simplistic ruleset, thematic setting, and challenging enemies. The leveling up of hunters is fast and uncomplicated, but the skills you chose, along with the combination of hunters still has a lot to explore. The simple core rules and the AI controls of the enemies mean that your games won't be bogged down in checking rules pages, but you might have to flick between enemy stats (the enemy and boss references are available on the <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/pages/hametsu-resources">BSS website</a>). With <em>Hametsu</em> already expanding with a new campaign, new raid bosses, and new Hunters, there's a great future to see <em>Hametsu</em> expand even further.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy The Hametsu Core Rulebook?</h2>
<p>If the setting and simple ruleset for solo/cooperative play appeals to you, then there's a lot to love with <em>Hametsu</em>. Your Hunters don't have a huge amount of variety if you're looking for roleplaying game-level complexity in your characters, but there's enough variation that 4 players all playing the same Hunter type could have very different hunters by level 4 or 5. For solo games, the simplicity of the Hunters makes controlling 4 Hunter much easier, and the focus will be on the combinations your Hunters can work with rather than the individual focus on a single character.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/best-served-cold-bartending-murder-mystery<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Rogueside has announced&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold</em>, a narrative-driven murder mystery adventure game in which you play a bartender in a city inspired by 1920s Bucharest.</p>
<p>The game is set in a fictional city called Bukovie, and you'll play as the owner of a speakeasy joint called the Nightcap, where you'll learn your customers' deepest, darkest secrets while pouring them the drinks they most desire.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>is reminding you of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/va-11-hall">VA-11 Hall-A</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-adventure-red-strings-club-heads-to-steam-jan-22"><em>The Red Strings Club</em></a>, rest assured you're not alone, but the historical setting and more down-to-earth vibe of this one could well set it apart.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/best-served-cold-bartending-murder-mystery-dialogue.jpg?itok=kgE6yXaw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/best-served-cold-bartending-murder-mystery-dialogue.jpg?itok=sSYmEFP7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>tells a story of murder and revenge in a city inspired by 1920s Bucharest.</figcaption></figure><p>You're getting away with running your speakeasy because a local detective has recruited you to help solve cases in return for the police looking the other way, so if you were wondering how you're getting away with it, now you've got your answer.</p>
<p>Rogueside is promising a "fascinating cast of intriguing characters" with their own backstories and agendas in&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold</em>, as well as a "richly crafted world inspired by the cultural and artistic revival of 1920s Bucharest".</p>
<p>As you tend your bar, you'll gather clues about the crimes you're investigating.&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>will offer five cases, akin to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/great-ace-attorney-chronicles">typical&nbsp;<em>Ace Attorney&nbsp;</em>game</a>, so it should give you plenty of bang for your investigative buck.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold</em>, which shows off the game's art style (but doesn't give too much away about its gameplay mechanics or plot), right here.</p>

<p><em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>will feature writing from&nbsp;<em>Cloudpunk</em>'s Thomas Welsh, alongside Joshua Aldred, and its cases will "serve as a lens" to learn about the city's political and economic background, according to Rogueside.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>yet, but it's landing on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch when it does arrive. Stay tuned for more, and in the meantime, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218530/Best_Served_Cold/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam here</a>.</p>

As I type these words, specialist wifeguy assessor Brendy is rambling through the fog of Bloober's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>. Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do <em>after</em> remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going "boo!"
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Back in the day when we were working on the first Layers Of Fear, we were much more counting on jump scares and things that appear in a very sudden way," lead producer Maciej Głomb told me. "And I think that with every game afterward and especially right now, with Silent Hill 2, we went much more in the direction of just creating this tense atmosphere - again, [this sense of] the unknown, you're not sure what's going to happen next. If you can actually deliver on this feeling, you don't actually need to 'make' something happen because this is already working on players, they're having that experience." </p>
<p>These observations are "more on the creative side". In more practical terms, Bloober haven't spent years getting a manual third-person camera up and running only to pop it on the shelf come 7th October.</p>
<p>"[The Silent Hill 2 remake] is also the first game where we've created a third person camera and going forward, I think this is also the direction that we want to keep exploring," Głomb continued. "Because we feel that it actually helps you experience the story, and understand the emotions, the motivation of the characters, and keeps the overall experience much more personal. Because seeing the character, you identify with them, in my opinion, much more than, for example, when you play in first-person."
</p>
<p>
The remake's creative director Mateusz Lenart also told me that Bloober try to treat every project very deliberately as a foundation for the next.</p>
<p>"If you track our evolution over time, you can see that every single project was actually preparation to do that again, that kind of game," he said. "We're adding elements very slowly to grow as a company, to gain confidence, to gain experience, etcetera.</p><p>"And it was while we were doing The Medium, that we did this proposition - we felt we had the technology, the experience and knowledge to try and deal with Silent Hill, an iconic title. For us it was the cherry on the top, but we still want to progress, we've learned so much about technology, about combat systems, so many things that we can bring to new titles."
</p>
<p>A chaser: Bloober Team's CEO Piotr Babieno recently hinted to <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Bloober-Team-spodziewa-sie-kolejnych-rozliczen-z-Konami-za-kamienie-milowe-8818376.html">Bankier.pl</a> that we "can expect that [Silent Hill 2] is not the end of the adventure with Konami." Will they be allowed to develop the next numbered sequel? Or will Konami hand them another elder Hill to revamp, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-didnt-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-bloober-start-by-remaking-silent-hill-1-the-devs-explain">perhaps even the original game</a>?</p>
<p>
As I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-hours-of-bloobers-silent-hill-2-its-unclear-who-is-remaking-who">explored rather showily</a> in my preview, there's a sense in which Bloober have been making Silent Hill games since their founding. While distinct productions that form a discreet connected universe, their projects have always been heavily indebted to Konami's ashen psychodrama. This is especially true of The Medium, which puts a splitscreen spin on Silent Hill's alternate-dimension premise.</p>
<p>While I can respect the logic of building directly on the design of the Silent Hill 2 remake, I'd personally love Bloober to swing for the fences a little, with their next horror game concept. It's not like there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/every-new-silent-hill-project-announced-including-the-silent-hill-2-remake">any shortage of Silent Hill games</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-need-a-horror-game-to-tide-you-over-till-the-silent-hill-2-remake-you-can-do-a-lot-worse-than-becrowneds-demo">Silent Hill-inspired games</a> in the offing.

Enter the pause menu to see the challenges on the left side, separated into Easy, Hard, and Weekly. On the right side is a rank system involving points, which I’ll go over soon.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Easy Challenges rotate every hour, but a new one can be immediately generated after beating it. Clearing them will reward you with three points and either a Konsumable, Crafting Komponent, or a Relic.</li><li>Hard Challenges rotate every day, but you can also generate another one after you beat it. These will reward you with seven points and a similar item type as Easy Challenges.</li><li>Weekly Challenges rotate every week. <strong>The key differences here are that they can only be cleared once a week and their reward is 50 points and Dragon Krystals.</strong></li></ul><p>While you might want to just aim for the premium currency Dragon Krystals, it can be worth grinding these out for the points too. Similar to Kombat League, you’ll be ranked by how many points you earn. Your rank will naturally fall as more players rack up points. That means if you want the highest rewards that require a Top 10 percent or Top 5 percent ranking, you need to keep on grinding before the two-week timer runs out.</p><p>A future update will also add points to the different Towers themselves, instead of just with challenges. This should make ranking up a little less monotonous, but for now, it’s best to focus on the challenges.</p><p>If you’re not a fan of the grind in these games, this mode might not be up your alley. That being said, I do feel that <em>Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reign</em>’s Towers of Time is less grindy than the previous iteration. Having to check in on the rank rewards once every two weeks is more convenient than finding out through social media you only have a few hours to unlock a rare skin.</p><p>Remember that playing through Invasions mode will help a lot in buffing your characters’ stats for the tougher fights. Keep on tackling these towers and you’ll earn plenty of awesome cosmetics that will look great while brutalizing your opponents.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Players will take on the role of an "all-new, never-before-seen Avatar", reports <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-is-getting-a-aaa-rpg-with-saber-interactive-and-paramount-game-studios-exclusive">IGN</a>, and will take place thousands of years in the past.

<p>Although there's no release date yet, it's set for release across PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Avatar Studios was set up in 2021 by original show creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko to expand the Avatar universe.</p>
<p>"At Saber, we are all truly fans of the IP we work with," said Josh Austin, head of IP development and licensing, Saber Interactive. "Our team members are some of the most devoted, passionate creatives out there and it's an honor to join forces with Avatar Studios and Paramount Games to further expand the Avatar Legends universe in video games. This unique co-fund structure is a result of our ever-expanding collaboration with Paramount, which started over a decade ago with WWZ, and we’re excited for all that’s on the horizon."</p>
<p>The Avatar: The Last Airbender series began on Nickelodeon in 2005 and was inspired by Chinese martial arts in its story of "Avatars" capable of "bending" the elements.</p>
<p>A number of video games based on the series have been released over the years, from the 2006 game of the same name right up to last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-mobile-avatar-the-last-airbender-game-is-on-the-way">mobile game Avatar: Generations</a>.</p>
<p>However, this new action-RPG will be the biggest adaptation yet.</p>
<p>Saber is fresh off its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 success</a>, with other games also based on famous IP on the way.
