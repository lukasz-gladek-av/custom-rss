		<p>It was an odd and almost unheard of situation when Warner Bros. Games closed off free-to-play platform fighter MultiVersus last year. What was a seemingly live and active online fighting game with two seasons of content released was taken away from players less than a year after its initial release. Sure, it was technically branded as an “open beta” thoughout, but it was baffling to see it go offline with a promised relaunch for 2024. Why shut the game down for that long?&nbsp;It didn’t seem to be in crisis, since there was an active playerbase and even plans for community tournaments. Fans of the mashup brawler weren’t sure what big revamps or additions necessitated the year of complete lack of access to the game. After spending some time with the new version of MultiVersus that’s set to launch on 28th May, I’m still not sure I understand the logic behind this.</p>
<p><iframe title="MultiVersus - Official Launch Trailer &quot;Stars Collide. Pies Fly.&quot;" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qX5AUVIAg_o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you’re a returning player from the initial version of the game, everything that was there is back – all 23 playable characters, every stage, and even any cosmetics or items you unlocked and purchased. Of course there’s also new additions, with a Mark Hamill voiced Joker, Agent Smith from The Matrix, a hockey masked Jason, and more naturally on the way.</p>


<p>Back when MultiVersus was first online, it featured a loaded cash shop, and multiple premium battle passes stuffed with cosmetics and currency, and none of this has changed in the new version of MultiVersus – well, <a href="http://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes">they’ve rejigged the currency names and what they do a bit</a>. If you’re a fan of collecting daily rewards, multiple currencies, and hundreds of tiered Battle Pass unlocks, the system at play here won’t bother you one bit. If you’re someone who’s a little exhausted by every game being turned into a job, though, it feels weird to boot up this big new relaunch of MultiVersus after a year and be greeted by the same slightly overwhelming seasonal objectives and mission lists that were there last time.</p>


<p>Some aspects of the experience are harder for me to directly compare to the open beta version of MultiVersus – a year out from the shut down of that version, and I don’t really remember the nuances of how combat felt or how the netcode performed, nor do I have any way to quickly revisit that version of the game for reference. Here’s what I came away from this new version of MultiVersus with, though: this game is now slow.</p>
<p>Combat, according to developer blog posts, has been reworked significantly to take the focus away from a constant flow of attack inputs and make everything much more deliberate, readable and possible to react to. The result is a platform fighter with next to no momentum. Every attack animation has a slow, winding start that completely cancels out the visual momentum of the move that came before it. Instead of stringing together a combo of basic and special attacks as Wonder Woman, I’m waiting and watching her perform a neutral attack, then waiting and watching her perform a neutral side attack, and then waiting some more as she busts out the Up Special I feel like I input hours ago.</p>

<p>This shift in speed and stilted animation momentum don’t necessarily make the game easier, but rather a lot less exciting. On harder difficulties and in full 2v2 matches against AI, I still found myself sweating to dodge projectiles and maintain control over the platform edges, but I wasn’t having fun anymore. I remember MultiVersus originally being entertaining to pick up and play with friends for the simple yet consistently breezy chaos of each match. That feeling hasn’t returned with this reworked version of the game.</p>
<p>One big change that adds a bit of depth to the game is a new PvE Rift mode. Instead of queuing up for standard battles, you’re given thematic Chapters with webs of individual encounters to dive into, each with their own unique modifiers, hazards, and more. It’s a lot like the Spirit mode of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, giving you dozens of uniquely modified parameters under which to fight the various characters. Some battles have minor yet entertaining changes, like equipping you with infinite-jump Angel Wings or rendering the entire screen in Matrix-style green and black wireframe. Other stages throw entirely unique minigames at you, like getting in a jumprope competition or fending off a giant boss mech.</p>

<p>It’s paired with a new Gem system – beat Nodes in this mode to unlock and upgrade Gems of different categories that grant you a variety of minor combat buffs or ability changes. Some are basic boosts like a chance at receiving a 10% attack damage buff before battle, while others let you customize your character kit a bit by activating the powers of other characters. Early on I found a gem that triggered Black Adam’s lightning whenever I dodged with a full meter, adding some interesting new utility to that move. As far as I could tell, there wasn’t a mode available to take your Gem-equipped character into battle against other players – but even with this locked away in a singleplayer mode, it’s a pretty solid way to spend time with the game and get some experience with the systems and characters before you try to head online.</p>
<p>While the new singleplayer mode is a pretty significant addition for the game, MultiVersus ultimately doesn’t feel much better off from where it was just over a year ago. In some ways it actually feels worse – with combat feeling far more sluggish and lethargic than I ever remembered it being in the open beta version of the game. Hopefully these combat reworks aren’t set in stone, and the team can take on board feedback and readjust when this new and not-entirely-improved version of MultiVersus goes live on 28th May.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-group-has-over-70-projects-in-the-works.879300/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-70-projects<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Embracer Group has released its financial statement for both the last fiscal year and the final quarter of said year, and it includes a tease for the impressive amount of projects the group currently has in its pipeline.</p>

<p>According to an Embracer <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2024-adjusted-ebit-increased-by-56-to-sek-1426-million/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>, the group has more than 70 projects in the works across its many subsidiaries right now, and that number includes "at least three important unannounced titles".</p>

<p>Those projects are slated to be released across the next financial year, which ends in March 2025. The lineup includes games like&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-leak">was announced recently</a>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-embracer-group-financials.jpg?itok=2VCPE5D_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-embracer-group-financials.jpg?itok=MDFZBbV8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is just one of the 70-plus games Embracer Group is planning to release this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer says that across the year, it saw a 12% increase in sales, driven largely by its tabletop and entertainment sectors (although its gaming sectors also returned modest sales increases).</p>

<p>In gaming terms, those increases were driven by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered"><em>Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered</em></a>, which Embracer says "performed above management expectations", as well as&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</em>, which sold well despite the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-aspyr-response">controversy surrounding its release</a>.</p>

<p>Another big earner for Embracer was&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em>, with the&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-esque&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>spinoff outperforming management's expectations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not all sunshine and roses, though. Some of the games released during this period underperformed, according to Embracer, including survival horror reboot&nbsp;<em>Alone in the Dark&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Outcast: A New Beginning</em>, a sequel to the 1999 cult classic open-world adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outcast-a-new-beginning-embracer-group-financials.jpg?itok=H2dhbAQA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outcast-a-new-beginning-embracer-group-financials.jpg?itok=sxwaoeN6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Outcast: A New Beginning&nbsp;</em>wasn't the success Embracer Group and THQ Nordic hoped for.</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this year, Embracer announced its intention to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies">split into three separate entities</a>: Coffee Stain and Friends, Middle-earth Enterprises and Friends, and Asmodee (the latter of which will <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group">inherit a pretty hefty euro debt</a> as a result).</p>

<p>Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors says he's "confident" that this decision will unleash "significant untapped potential" within Embracer, and according to the latest report, the group's shareholders largely agree.</p>

<p>That untapped potential includes projects outside of the gaming space, including an upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>live-action series that forms part of the brand's continuing expansion into streaming and film.</p>

<p>In gaming, Embracer's upcoming slate includes the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-to-develop-and-globally-publish-tomb-raider-game"><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game</a> currently being developed in conjunction with Amazon, as well as a new&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>title, the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-collectors-edition"><em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>remake</a>, and <em>Metro Awakening</em>.</p>

<p>Affected studios include Gearbox, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-publisher-take-two-to-acquire-gearbox-from-embracer-new-borderlands-in">sold to Take-Two in March</a>, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-saber-interactive"><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Saber Interactive</a>&nbsp;and more. Studios closed down by Embracer include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition"><em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer Volition</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>TimeSplitters&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/probable-images-of-free-radicals-timesplitters-game-revealed-after-studio-closure-by">Free Radical</a>.</p>

<p>Embracer acknowledges these closures and layoffs in its financial report, calling them "necessary but difficult decisions" and emphasizing the "compassion, respect and integrity" with which the layoffs and closures were apparently carried out.</p>

			<p>Today, NVIDIA announced the new games added this week to its GeForce NOW cloud platform. The library now has over 1,900 games, including Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, which launched just a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>GeForce NOW users subscribed to the Priority tier can enable NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution or NVIDIA DLAA as well as NVIDIA Reflex. GeForce NOW users subscribed to the Ultimate tier can also enable DLSS Frame Generation to get the best performance in the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In my review of the game</a>, I wrote:</p>
<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II keeps virtually the same scope and structure of the independent triple-A game made in 2017 by Ninja Theory. The story is just as poignant, the visuals are stunning, and the experience is one that every Game Pass user should check out for themselves. However, those hoping for a more traditional game in the vein of the God of War reboot will inevitably be disappointed, and this is unlikely to have nearly that level of success, which is what Microsoft still desperately needs.</em></p>
<p>Here's the full list of GeForce NOW games added this week:</p>
<p>● Synergy (New release on Steam, May 21)<br>
● Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, May 21)<br>
● Crown Wars: The Black Prince (New release on Steam, May 23)<br>
● Serum (New release on Steam, May 23)<br>
● Ships at Sea (New release on Steam, May 23)<br>
● Exo One (Steam)<br>
● Phantom Brigade (Steam)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/paper-app-dungeon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you ever sat on a long journey, and thought, I wish I was roleplaying right now? Or gone camping or hiking and not wanted to take a huge board game or tons of RPG books? Lucy Duck Games and Tom Brinton have your back, with <em>Paper App Dungeon</em>, the travel roleplaying, dungeon exploring notebook.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-2.jpg?itok=u5wCEk_u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-2.jpg?itok=2nNUthll 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each <em>Paper App Dungeon</em> box comes with a notebook and a special P6 pencil.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Do You Get With Paper App Dungeon?</h2>

<p><em>Paper App Dungeon</em> comes with a unique dungeon notebook, which are procedurally generated so that no two notebooks are the same, and a special P6 pencil. The P6 acts as your writing implement, and your dice, with 1 through 6 printed on the sides of it, which you roll to move during the game. The only issue is that the pencil can roll forever, especially if you're traveling. The idea of it is awesome, and it keeps the whole experience simple and portable, but I found myself using my own six-sided dice (D6) so that I didn't have to chase the pencil around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-3.jpg?itok=cVZkAUuF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-3.jpg?itok=RTrlgzC5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each&nbsp;<em>Paper App Dungeon </em>notebook comes with 45 maps to play through.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Paper App Dungeon?</h2>

<p><em>Paper App Dungeon </em>comes with the rules printed on the first three pages of the notebook, but a much more robust and easier-to-understand rulebook is available <a href="https://kind-jackson-99b826.netlify.app/files/Paper-Apps-DUNGEON-Guide.pdf">here</a>. For each map, you find the starting space and roll the P6. If you get 1, 3, or 5, you can move diagonally, 2, 4, or 6 and you move&nbsp;orthogonally. You have to move your complete distance rolled in a straight line, marking on the map as you go, and if you hit a wall, you can change directions.</p>

<p>On your travels, you will come across enemies, who take away your hit points, and treasure in the form of coins and chests. As you take damage or gain coins, you total them at the bottom of the page, and once you reach the exit, you total both up. If you have a negative health number, you start the next page with 10 health and 0 coins, but if you have a positive health number, you carry it over, along with your coins.</p>

<p>Occasionally, you can also come across stores, where you can increase your starting health, and also buy potions to use during maps. The final page in the book has a tally for your deaths and your final HP and Coin total, so you can compare them against your next <em>Paper App Dungeon</em> journey.</p>

<p>The challenge in <em>Paper App Dungeon</em> is predicting the dice rolls, and trying to avoid putting yourself in a position where you will move through enemies regardless of the roll. Sometimes calculated risks pay off, or if you know that between you and the exit are limited enemies (in our Floor 1 image below, you can see we headed straight through the enemy at the top of the map because it was a straight line to the exit after). T</p>

<p>There doesn't feel like a big payoff for taking risks for coins, because if you end up on negative health points at the end, you lose all of your coins, and even putting yourself on low health going into the next map makes that map even harder. You can play however you want, but I found that taking the simple routes, with calculated risks and minimal coins to keep my death tally down was the way I played through the maps.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-4.jpg?itok=n_sGSVcO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-4.jpg?itok=GsYxwWZY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Our first&nbsp;<em>Paper App Dungeon </em>adventure was very straightforward. Fought an enemy, got some loot, and made for the exit.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Long Is Paper App Dungeon?</h2>

<p><em>Paper App Dungeon </em>includes 45 maps total to play through. Each one can take as little as a few minutes (if you roll well), or much longer if the dice are against you and you end up bouncing around tight rooms on the map. Because each map is procedurally generated, some can be very easy, and some have particularly testing moments, but that's the nature of adventuring, and nothing is fair in the gloom of the dungeon.</p>

<p><em>Paper App Dungeon </em>is a fun little game and incredible for travel adventures, or for introducing younger players to tabletop games. The P6 while a great concept, isn't great for travel, and can roll forever, so we ended up using a standard 6-sided dice. The rulebook, while well condensed into 3 pages at the front of the notebook, is much easier to understand in the full format we linked to above. Once understood, you won't require it again, but that initial read of the condensed 3 pages can be confusing. It's a fun little package though overall, and I will be picking up another next time I travel.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Paper App Dungeon?</h2>

<p>If you want a quick pick-up-and-play game for travel, or to introduce younger players, then <em>Paper App Dungeon</em> is perfect in terms of size, portability, fun, and ease of use (take your own dice with you on travel though). If you're looking for a roleplaying game or dungeon exploring board game with depth or character development, then&nbsp;<em>Paper App Dungeon </em>isn't that.</p>

  <p id="0LQCJU">Warner Bros.’ fighting game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2022/9/13/23345074/multiversus-opinion-dodge-cooldown-meter-ui-player-first-games"><em>MultiVersus</em></a> returns on Tuesday, May 28 with its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23933735/multiversus-announcement-relaunch-release-date-warner-bros">long-awaited relaunch</a>. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22789132/multiversus-warner-bros-dc-game-of-thrones-bugs-bunny">Super Smash Bros.-inspired platform fighter</a> is getting a big overhaul next week, with an expanded roster, new visuals, and improved netcode, which developer Player First Games designed to make online multiplayer matches feel just like local, four-folks-on-the-same-couch matches.</p>
<p id="saFRQT">There’s a long list of changes coming with the official launch of <em>MultiVersus</em> — the previous version was labeled an open beta, you see — and we’ll break down what’s new below.</p>
<h2 id="a0hbSW"><strong>New fighters</strong></h2>
<p id="48SUpV">Four new characters are confirmed for <em>MultiVersus</em> in season 1, which kicks off May 28. They are <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155348/multiversus-joker-gameplay-mark-hamill-powerpuff-girls">DC’s Joker</a> (once again voiced by Mark Hamill), <em>Adventure Time</em>’s Banana Guard, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24160800/multiversus-trailer-matrix-agent-smith-jason-voorhees"><em>Friday the 13th</em>’s Jason Voorhees, and <em>The Matrix</em>’s Agent Smith</a>.</p>
<p id="jvfzn2">Tony Huynh, Player First Games co-founder and game director on <em>MultiVersus</em>, told Polygon in a video interview that Joker is “full of gadgets” and steeped in references to the long history of the character. “We’re realizing that character in a way that I think fans of the Joker will be extremely happy with,” Huynh said. Joker is a mage-type fighter, a class that is currently “not really well-represented in <em>MultiVersus</em>,” Huynh said, “and so [he] also pushes our diversity of the player experience pretty far.”</p>
<div id="N2fV7H"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sT1zXiYqcfA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="sEueKJ">Banana Guard may be the most unexpected new addition to <em>MultiVersus</em>, given that <em>Adventure Time</em> is already represented in the game by Finn the Human and Jake the Dog. Huynh said that Banana Guard’s addition to the roster came from “an individual on our team that was very passionate about [the character],” and shows that “anything’s possible” in <em>MultiVersus</em>. “We aren’t just going to do the expected,” Huynh said. </p>
<p id="GWieaN">Banana Guard will be free at launch for players who complete the game’s new tutorial. A Lady Banana Guard variant will also be free to unlock.</p>
<p id="Mvqe3F">Jason Voorhees brings a new tank-class character to the <em>MultiVersus</em> roster. Jason will be big, and more importantly <em>heavy</em>, dwarfed only by the Iron Giant. “The big challenge there is, if you understand [the fighting game] genre, is that large characters are typically not viable, but [we] looked at it from that experience, like, ‘How <em>do</em> we make a viable large character in the game?’” Huynh said. “And I think we’ve done a really good job of that.”</p>
<p id="N7H2iw">Jason will be available through the game’s season 1 premium battle pass.</p>
<p id="s0Zwhv">Details on Agent Smith are still forthcoming. The recurring villain of The Matrix franchise is due to arrive sometime during season 1 of <em>MultiVersus</em>.</p>
<h2 id="gMMDfu"><strong>New visuals and new netcode</strong></h2>
<div id="byQ4zu"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1Yx-Cz0l9U?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="bR2DMf">Player First Games says it has rebuilt <em>MultiVersus</em> from the ground up. That includes a tech upgrade, moving from Epic Games’ Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. Expect better-looking, larger characters and improved lighting.</p>
<p id="PJXqxg">More important, from a competitive standpoint, is <em>MultiVersus</em>’ new multiplayer netcode. That means the fighting game community’s tech solution of choice: rollback netcode. Here’s how Player First Games explains it:</p>
<blockquote><p id="RPMgIZ">Simply put, rollback netcode still sends player inputs back and forth, but each button press is accompanied by a precise timestamp, marking the exact moment of activation. This allows the client to reconstruct what would have happened had it received the input at the intended time. By leaping backward, then instantaneously simulating back to where you were, the game delivers an experience that feels smooth and enjoyable. With rollback netcode you’re seeing exactly the same thing as your opponent, meaning that their position and frames of animation are always updated to the most accurate position which continues to be predicted from there.</p></blockquote>
<p id="wrUshn">Huynh told Polygon that the game’s open beta period “really was about us learning as much as possible,” and that the dev team did learn a lot. “Now we have absolute world-class netcode,” he said, “so that players can play with their friends all across the country, and have just an amazing experience that almost feels offline.” Based on my hands-on with a pre-release version of <em>MultiVersus</em>’ new netcode, Player First has delivered. Even intercontinental matches felt surprisingly smooth and lag-free.</p>
<h2 id="RC0wXt"><strong>Rifts, a new PvE mode</strong></h2>
<div id="WA8Yn3"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3h4Zex58TLo?rel=0&amp;start=93" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="YsdzhE">For players just getting their feet wet in <em>MultiVersus</em> (and those who may want some less-heated competition) there’s something new: rifts, aka battles against computer-controlled opponents. Rifts will provide seasonal challenges and bits of narrative for the game’s ongoing story. Here’s how Player First explains the new PvE mode:</p>
<blockquote><p id="gp8jDO">Each Rift will have a sequence of battles or challenges around a particular theme, whether it’s The Joker infiltrating the Batcave or Batman and Velma teaming up to decide who’s the best detective. These themes will be organized around seasonal “Attunements,” such as Chaos<em>,</em> for the Clown Prince of Crime that is joining our cast in season 1. The same way every <em>MultiVersus</em> battle is bubbling with character interactions, we wanted to make each Rift “uniquely <em>MultiVersus,</em>” every season.    </p></blockquote>
<p id="E29chx">Rifts will have built-in cinematics and story elements, with “characters interacting with each other, tons of minigames, [for] a really diverse kind of experience,” Huynh said. “I think it does a really good job of teaching players how to play the game as well, but also has a lot of novel kind of experiences.”</p>
<p id="Q9VX2y">Player First promises to keep developing and expanding Rifts: “Anything that we can imagine, we can build, and deliver that [...] to players,” Huynh said. He added that, thanks to the game’s new netcode, <em>MultiVersus</em> Rifts can be played in their entirety cooperatively with friends.</p>
<h2 id="I5DGpu"><strong>New currencies</strong></h2>

<p id="s3SmRc">Players who spent real money on <em>MultiVersus</em>’ premium currency, Gleamium, during the game’s open beta will keep that currency, which can be spent on character unlocks and future premium battle passes. Players will also retain character tokens and battle pass tokens earned during the open beta, but Player First and Warner Bros. will no longer offer those currencies.</p>
<p id="g5k0yT">With <em>MultiVersus</em>’ relaunch, in addition to Gleamium, there will be three new currencies:</p>
<ul>
<li id="WPANyb">
<strong>Fighter currency</strong>, which can be earned in-game and used to obtain fighters</li>
<li id="01Acix">
<strong>Perk currency</strong>, which can be earned in-game and be spent on perks, power-ups that players can attach to characters to give them buffs during combat</li>
<li id="tDEkuI">
<strong>Prestige currency</strong>, which rewards players for all of the items and cosmetics they collect for their favorite fighters. “Each cosmetic item you acquire awards its own Prestige currency value based on type and rarity,” <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes">Player First wrote in a blog post</a>. “Eventually, you’ll use your Prestige currency to unlock Prestige cosmetics, which represent the rarest cosmetics in the game. These items can only be unlocked using Prestige currency.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mCgLTR"><strong>Will MultiVersus still be free to play when it relaunches?</strong></h2>
<p id="B4iAb1">Yes. The <em>MultiVersus</em> relaunch will be a free download on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game will be monetized through premium battle pass purchases and through direct purchases of Gleamium.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/atari/status/1793616648890470410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X today, Atari announced that it has officially acquired the Intellivision “brand and game library.” </p>



<p>Atari CEO Wade Rosen added that the acquisition is a “rare opportunity to unite former competitors.” Rosen also says it can “bring together fans of the golden age of gaming.” Intellivision will rebrand, but it will still continue distributing the Amico console.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/05/23/2887219/0/en/Atari-Acquires-Intellivision-Brand.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wide press release</a>, Atari elaborated on the acquisition. Atari plans to “expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games” and “potentially create new games.” </p>



<p>Fans will likely recognize Intellivision for its classic arcade titles, such as the home port of BurgerTime. Notably, Atari only purchased “certain games,” and did not identify the titles involved. </p>



<p>Atari will surely reveal more soon, since the purchase included rights to over 200 titles. It is also already selling merchandise with Intellivision T-shirts.</p>



<p>In today’s press release, Atari also confirmed it will “explore brand and licensing opportunities.” </p>



<p>Intellivision Entertainment CEO Phil Adam expressed trust in Atari regarding its brand. Adam also said that Intellivision looks forward to an “expanded collaboration,” including “a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles.”</p>



<p>Late last April, Atari also decided <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atari-revive-infogrames/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to revive Infogrames</a> as a publishing label. The move intends to gain IP and publish games outside of Atari’s core portfolio of games. Accordingly, Infogrames even purchased Totally Reliable Delivery Services from tinyBuild.</p>

                <p>Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann has teased the company's next game and discussed how he believes artificial intelligence can help shape the future of video game development.</p><p>In an<a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> interview on Sony's website</a>, Druckmann said he's working on potentially the "most thrilling" game he's ever been part of. He didn't share specifics, but he said he believes it could "redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming." He didn't elaborate on that point specifically, but he did highlight how the success of HBO's The Last of US TV show demonstrates that there is a growing fondness for gaming that "transcends all age groups," which is a marked contrast from when Druckmann was growing up.</p><p>"This shift is highlighted by our venture into television with The Last of Us, which I hoped would bridge the gap between gamers and non-gamers. The show's success has spotlighted gaming, illustrating the rich, immersive experiences it offers. This visibility excites me not only for our current project but for the broader potential of gaming to captivate a global audience. I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us," he said.</p><p>Naughty Dog is working on multiple games currently, and they have been described as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/" data-ref-id="1100-6519980">ambitious" and "brand-new."</a> These will be single-player games. Naughty Dog previously planned to expand into multiplayer in a big way with its The Last of Us multiplayer game, but it was ultimately canceled.</p><p>Also in the interview, Druckmann spoke optimistically--as many have before him--about the prospects for how AI can potentially positively impact video game development in the future.</p><p>"AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address," he said. "With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games. This evolution is truly empowering creators to bring their visions to life without the traditional obstacles."</p><p>He added: "AI will allow us to create nuanced dialogues and characters, expanding creative possibilities. However, it's crucial to precisely direct these tools to achieve the intended outcomes."</p><p>Naughty Dog's new games have not been announced yet, and there is no word on when they might be. Many believe there could be another PlayStation Showcase event on tap soon, but Sony has yet to confirm anything on that front. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>As for the HBO series, The Last of Us Season 2 is filming now and is expected to release in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/swap-plants-for-arcane-artifacts-in-strange-antiquities-the-follow-up-to-strange-horticulture/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=swap-plants-for-arcane-artifacts-in-strange-antiquities-the-follow-up-to-strange-horticulture<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="337" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Strange Horticulture</em>‘s developer Bad Viking has today announced a follow-up to its occult plant investigation and puzzle title: <em>Strange Antiquities</em>. The sequel is set in the same location of Undermere but explores the arcane artifacts, which puts you in a position where you’ll be meeting those interested in acquiring them. </p> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false">In <em>Stange Antiquities</em>, you’ll take on the role of an antique store owner. Running the business requires you to interact with all sorts of characters from Undermere and help them solve their fairly unique problems through the use of arcane artifacts. Along the way, there are mysteries and puzzles to be solved that will see you dive deeper into the town’s murky lore. </p> <h2 id="h-strange-antiquities-is-a-dark-and-cozy-adventure-that-welcomes-players-into-its-mysteries" data-injectable="false"><em>Strange Antiquities</em> is a dark and cozy adventure that welcomes players into its mysteries</h2> <figure data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bad Viking</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">The bulk of the gameplay in <em>Strange Antiquities</em> will revolve around solving puzzles and mysteries. You’ll do this by taking requests from customers in the store, helping them solve their problems with the artifacts you’ve procured so far, and uncovering as much information as you can about the local town, Undermere. </p> <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="803" data-injectable="true">There are books to leaf through in search of clues, information, and references you can use as you explore Undermere to help the locals in any way you can. The visuals make the game look like a cozy shop simulator, and I’m looking forward to seeing and feeling how the juxtaposition with cosmic horror elements pays off in action. I didn’t expect fishing and cosmic horror to go together so well in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dredge-indie-pc-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x-s-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dredge</a>,</em> so I’m hopeful this game will suck me right in. </p>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">The game is a sequel to <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, taking place years after its story came to a close. However, <em>Stange Antiquities</em> is designed to be a standalone experience, so you don’t need to have played the first game to enjoy it. However, it’s probably worth doing so just to see how the town has evolved. </p> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">With almost 10,000 positive reviews on Steam and over 500,000 copies sold, Bad Viking considers <em>Stange Horticulture</em> a massive success for an independent game developer. It hopes to live up to the reputation it built with that game and deliver yet another title that fans of the first will enjoy, but also welcome newcomers into its strange, cosmic horror-inspired world. </p>
 <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false">There is no release date for the game at the time of writing, but you can wishlist it on Steam to keep up to date with all the news and hear about any release windows as they are announced. </p>

<p data-characters="195" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are lots of side quests in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, and because you are likely to run into the Hero of the Leap quest at a random point, you might be very, very confused as you try to complete it. </p> <p data-characters="170" data-current-count="170" data-injectable="false">One of the steps in the quest is to use the sensor to find the optimal route, but you might not even have the sensor yet. If this has happened to you, I can help you out.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-use-the-sensor-for-the-optimal-route-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">How to use the sensor for the optimal route in <em>Wuthering Waves</em></h2> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">You can find the <strong>Hero of the Leap quest</strong> in the center of Jinzhou. A young man by the name of Dashbon can be found near the pools in the town, and he will tell you about great heroes who used to jump from roof to roof in the city. He will then give you the chance to follow in their footsteps and take on the Overdash challenge.</p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">If you agree, you will be teleported to the top of a building and will need to make your way across the rooftops of the city. If you touch the ground at all, then it will restart. At this point, you can use the sensor to see the optimal route, but only if you actually have the sensor.</p> <p data-characters="570" data-current-count="855" data-injectable="true">If you don’t have the sensor yet, you need to continue through the main quest and do the <strong>Echoing Marche quest</strong>. As you play through this quest, you will meet a young guard at a small base outside Jinzhou. He will ask you to keep an eye out for a missing person, and this is when you get the sensor. You will be able to switch to the center by bringing up your Utility Wheel by using the Tab key on the keyboard or the left D-Pad button. Make sure it is set to Utility and not Function. In this wheel, you will find the Sensor, which will look like a small eye icon.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="563" data-current-count="863" data-injectable="false">Select it, and it will then map to your controls the same way the grapple hook does. you can hold the left should button on the controller and then hit the Y button to use it. This will reveal the optimal route to you when you are performing the challenge in the Hero of the Leap quest and make your life much easier. Remember, you only need to have the grapple equipped to be able to use it for anything other than a prompted spot. If you have the sensor on, you can still grapple to the top of buildings and lamps with ease as long as you hover over the prompt.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-dlss-3-fsr-3-fixes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut post-launch patch is now live on PC, introducing stability improvements and fixes for some NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 issues.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215430/view/4160841636412305229?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1053.0.0522.1042 patch</a> focuses on improving stability and fixing some NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 issues. Specifically, the patch fixes visual bugs that could show when transitioning from cutscenes to gameplay with DLSS 3 Frame Generation enabled, and fixed other visual issues that could show when combining AMD FSR 3 upscaling with Dynamic Resolution Scaling.</p>
<p>This Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is only going the first one, as Nixxes and Sucker Punch confirmed they are working hard on future patches that will address issues raised by the community and further improve stability on specific hardware configurations for both the single-player campaign and the Legends multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Despite some users having stability issues, Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut managed to become the most successful PlayStation launch on Steam, setting a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sets-new-concurrent-player-peak-record-for-sonys-single-player-games-on-steam/">concurrent player peak record for Sony's single-player games on Steam</a>, soundly beating the previous record holder, God of War. With Helldivers II also doing incredibly well, it's clear that Sony is finding more success with its PC releases, hopefully convincing the company to release their former PlayStation exclusives on PC sooner than it has been doing these past few years.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4. You can learn more about the base game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/">review.</a></p>

		<h2 id="i">I.</h2><p>“One of my teachers recently passed away, and I wanted to make a little joke at his funeral… and say Press F to pay Respects. Would that be rude?”<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/9sg7in/is_it_rude_to_say_press_f_to_pay_respects_at_a?ref=remapradio.com"> <u>began a question</u></a> on Reddit.&nbsp;</p><p>Fellas, is it rude to eulogize a teacher with a video game meme? Is it rude to dunk on Call of Duty before the bereaved?</p><p>“Yeah, best not to meme at a funeral,” one Redditor replied.</p><p>“Saying it quietly to yourself would be fine, I guess,” said another. “The whole reason it ever became a meme at all was that it was so out of place for a supposedly serious moment. Don’t bring that into a situation that’s <em>actually</em> serious.”</p><p>The cultural legacy of the 2014 video game <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</em> is a single meme of its most awkward moment, and a ceaseless discourse over whether the meme can be both funny and a sincere gesture of grief.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/99g6n1/comment/e4zb7hy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u> “If you use F in real life, you suck”</u></a>;<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/f-to-pay-respect-is-the-perfect-example-of-a-joke-turning-serious-when-used-often-enough.187857/page-2?post=31748376&amp;ref=remapradio.com#post-31748376"> <u>“Honestly prefer F to RIP because life and death should be something to laugh with since it affects us all”</u></a>;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cl0570/comment/evs1910/?ref=remapradio.com"> <u>“If I died and I didn’t get some Fs I would be kinda disappointed.”</u></a></p><p>More thought has been given to this question of decorum than to the creation of the <em>Call of Duty </em>moment itself. “I don’t remember whose idea it was, really,” <em>Advanced Warfare</em> level designer Steve Bianchi told me. “It was not something that we really put a lot of thought into.”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure it was me, and I'm pretty sure that I wrote it,” says <em>Advanced Warfare</em> creative director Bret Robbins. “I’m the guy. I’m really the guy that was responsible for it.”</p><h2 id="ii">II.</h2><p>In <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</em>, you play a U.S. Marine in the year 2054, deployed with your comrade and best friend Will Irons to repel a North Korean incursion into Seoul, South Korea. In the game’s first half hour, you and Irons battle North Korean soldiers and drone swarms in the streets of the abandoned city, scurrying under quadrupedal tanks and jetpack-jumping over derelict buses. All the while, the game urges you along with various button prompts: <em>Hold Right Mouse to Aim Down Sights</em>; <em>Hold F While Falling to Safely Descend</em>;<em> Press Q to Throw a Threat Grenade.</em></p><figure></figure><p>After you find a demolition team killed in action, you must then finish their mission to blow up a mobile heavy weapons platform. You fight first to the demo team’s corpses—<em>Hold F to Grab Charges</em>—then to the target. Will slides open an access panel—<em>Hold F to Give Will the Charges</em>—and plants the explosive, but his arm is trapped when the panel closes.</p><p>“We’re outta time!” Irons shouts as the weapons platform begins to take off. “It’s okay. I’ll see you on the other side.”</p><p>You watch from the ground as Irons is consumed in the blast. “Why is one man spared while another one taken?” your character muses. “To this day I couldn’t give you an answer…. All I knew was my best friend was gone, and that part of me wished I had been taken instead.”</p><p>Two weeks later, you’re at Arlington National Cemetery, standing by Irons’ coffin. Irons’ father stands and—solemnly, silently—lays his hand upon the casket. Then it is your turn: <em>Press F to Pay Respects.</em></p><p>Muddling through <em>Advanced Warfare</em> for a segment on his former TBS show, Conan O’Brien stops and looks to the camera. “What does that mean?! That’s crazy! Is there a button for, ‘I’m here ‘cuz I thought I might meet somebody?’” The audience laughs; they laughed harder at the appearance of the prompt itself. “Okay, here we go. This is a really emotional moment for me,” O’Brien deadpans, as we watch his index finger depress a button on an Xbox controller.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b82idSYHSu8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Clueless Gamer: Conan Reviews &quot;Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare&quot; | CONAN on TBS"></iframe></figure><p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/games/press-x-to-pay-respects-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-funeral-scene-is-so-call-of-duty-9837696.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>The Independent</u></a> called it “gleefully tasteless”; <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/the-qte-is-deadlong-live-the-qte?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Paste</u></a> said it was “transparently lazy”; <a href="https://kotaku.com/nothing-says-funeral-like-a-quick-time-event-1653938147?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Kotaku</u></a> just called it “very odd”. “It was a valiant attempt at pathos,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/11/4/7151865/call-of-duty-press-x-to-mourn?ref=remapradio.com"><u>wrote Polygon</u></a>, “the first time in a long time that a triple-A game was trying to communicate to me at a higher level. But at the same time, it felt hollow. Voyeuristic. Tawdry.”</p><p>But why did it elicit this kind of response? In 2011, the video game <em>Batman: Arkham City</em> featured an almost identical scene, inviting the player to “Pay Your Respects” to the chalk outlines of Bruce Wayne’s murdered parents. Only two months prior to <em>Advanced Warfare</em>’s release, <em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em>, directed players to enter stealth mode and press X to kiss their wife. Neither was considered “the dumbest interactive moment in gaming”, <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-press-to-pay-respects?ref=remapradio.com"><u>per <em>GQ</em></u></a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.thegia.com/2014/11/03/all-due-respect-press-f-for-farce/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>In an article for the now-defunct Gaming Intelligence Agency</u></a>, game developer Andrew Vestal examined an important syntactic distinction between <em>Advanced Warfare </em>and <em>Arkham City. </em>“Arkham City asks the player to ‘[A] Pay Your Respects’ – a complete action, with the contextual button prepended as a UI element. <em>Call of Duty</em> asks the player to ‘Press [F] to Pay Respects’ – to push a button in a video game in order to perform the action. With this small change, the player’s action (push a button) now overwhelms the in-game result (Pay Respects).”</p><p>“Press F to Pay Respects” is a ludicrous and sticky bit of language. It can be read to suggest that pressing ‘F’ is not the keyboard shortcut for the gesture of respect, but the gesture itself. R.I.P., sorry for your loss, thoughts and prayers, hearts go out, I really am sincerely sorry, F.</p><p>This is how it’s been interpreted, anyway, in the decade since <em>Advanced Warfare</em>’s release. A Twitch streamer who inadvertently trips Arthur Morgan into the path of a train, or eldritch blasts a goblin off a roof, might ask viewers to throw some F’s in the chat. Lost 10,000 runes in <em>Elden Ring</em>? F. Stream goes down? That’s an F.</p>

To date, Activision has published a major <em>Call of Duty </em>every year since 2005. Initially, the studios Infinity Ward and Treyarch alternated titles; after Sledgehammer assisted on Infinity Ward’s <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>to good results, Schofield’s studio was promoted into the rotation as a primary developer, with <em>Advanced Warfare</em> as its first Call of Duty assignment.</p><p>“Suddenly we had a three-year window to do our own game, almost like a new IP within the <em>Call of Duty</em> universe, the opportunity to write our own epic summer blockbuster,” Robbins says. “We were flush with victory on [<em>Modern Warfare 3</em>] and ran into <em>Advanced Warfare</em> really pretty confident and feeling pretty good about the studio and our place in [the franchise].”</p><p><em>Advanced Warfare</em> broke from the series’ historical and contemporary theaters of war, looking to a futuristic fantasy of action and military tech that Schofield enthusiastically portrayed with walking tanks and rocket jumps. “When I first pitched it, they were like ‘What the fuck are you thinking? That’s so crazy, that’s not <em>Call of Duty</em>. You can’t use a walking tank. No such thing as that,’” Schofield recounts. “I go to NASA, and the guy goes, ‘Oh, by the way, you’re in for a surprise today. We’re gonna show you a walking tank.’ And they lowered this giant metal tank, I got pictures of it somewhere. So, you know, the executives, they’re like, ‘Okay, man, go ahead and make it.’”</p><p>“The end of the first level is a banger,” says Robbins. Not only does Will Irons die, but the player loses his arm, pretext for outfitting the player with a robotic prosthesis and seducing him into a nightmarish world of private military contractors. Irons’ funeral, which immediately follows the intro, shoulders heavy narrative responsibility. First, the player must look down at the coffin, which is really an excuse for them to see that they are still missing their arm. Second, the player must meet Irons’ father — ultimately the game’s villain — who will recruit the player into his PMC. Thirdly, the player must have a moment to mourn Irons.&nbsp;</p><p>“We really wanted you to have that emotional connection,” Bianchi remembers. “I don’t think you necessarily got that a lot in <em>Call of Duty </em>games, where you really take the time to mourn someone’s loss and move forward.”</p><p>“That was the intent,” development director Anthony Schmill says. “To, at some level, show that loss is part of combat and warfare, that people sacrifice themselves in these situations, and that the community of people who experience war are deeply impacted by the loss of comrades and soldiers and partners in battle.”</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>Was Advanced Warfare this trend's greatest offender? Photo credit: Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, Rocksteady Games</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>At funerals for Navy SEALs, there is a tradition of pounding a gold trident pin, which depicts an eagle with a cocked-back flintlock pistol and symbolizes fraternity between SEALs, into the lid of a coffin. The <em>Advanced Warfare</em> developers envisioned a similar beat for Irons’ funeral. The player would be prompted to walk up and hammer in a pin, and in doing so, conveniently reconfirm the absence of their arm. “We could have done it in a cinematic,” says Robbins, “but I always like it when things are a little more immersive.”</p><p>However, the pin idea was nixed by a military advisor late in development because Irons was a Marine, not a Navy SEAL. “They were really adamant that we couldn’t have that in there,” Bianchi remembers. Not wanting to lose the emotional beat, Robbins cast around for alternatives — would the player put a flag on the coffin instead? a medal? a photograph — but there was no time. But maybe that was okay; maybe all the moment needed to be was a hand resting on Irons’ coffin — briefly, meaningfully — and then having the player wal away.</p><p>“Yeah, okay, that sounds fine,” Schofield remembers telling Robbins. “That’s all we have time for.”</p><p>It is Call of Duty house style that there is never a button prompt without text. “Anytime there’s a prompt, it’s gonna say, ‘plant bomb,’ ‘activate,’ ‘open door,’ you know. There’s just text. Flat out,” Robbins explains. Near the end of development, Robbins went through a spreadsheet supplying text for any “naked” prompts. “The coffin was a blank,” he says. “And you’re just going through and writing them all out, and innocently, you know, it has to say something here, that seems like an appropriate phrase to use.”</p><p>The response was “a little surprising,” Robbins says dryly, “to say the least.”</p><p>Schofield thinks that the mockery hurt the game’s Metacritic score. “It showed up in so many articles: ‘Press F for respects?’ That’s the stupidest shit!’” Caught off-guard, the developers at Sledgehammer deliberated whether or not to patch the offending phrase out of the game, ultimately landing on the side of… oh, well.</p><p>“There was great combat, there were epic moments, right and left… but that’s what people remembered,” says Anthony Schmill. “I’m sure that lots of people enjoyed the game, but if that’s what the biggest thing they took away from it? Oh, well.”</p><p>“I thought, if that’s the thing that people rip on,” says Bianchi, “the weak moment, then that’s… you know, fine. It is sort of funny.”&nbsp;</p><p>Ten years later, Robbins (now the head of Ascendant Software, developer of <em>Immortals of Aveum</em>) chooses his words carefully, given past experiences.</p><p>“It’s not what I wanted everyone to be talking about,” he says evenly. “I still think <em>Advanced Warfare</em> has some of the best level design and is one of the most beautiful Call of Dutys ever made. And it really felt like the internet had just decided to grab a small thing — which clearly wasn’t a small thing. It wouldn’t have happened if it was small. But in my mind, at the time, it was a small thing that overshadowed a lot of really great work. I was really surprised. I was like, ‘Why is this such a big deal? Why are people so laser focused on this?’ I asked friends, I asked people on the team, ‘What is this?’</p><p>“I think it was a criticism of a game overreaching. There’s nothing offensive about paying respects to your best friend who was just killed in front of you… If it had been in a cinematic, no one would have blinked an eye. If the text had been different, no one would have blinked an eye. It’s specifically those words, and specifically the action. It’s not a criticism of the scene. It’s a criticism of what the game was trying to make you feel. I think that’s the closest I can get to why this even was a thing. I don’t think if you did that today — honestly, I don’t think if you did it today, anyone would care. There was something about that time and where Call of Duty was at that time that just hit a nerve.”</p><p>Robbins knew about the moment in <em>Batman: Arkham City </em>when he was making <em>Advanced Warfare</em>; he thinks it might have been in the back of his mind. “I’m a huge fan of those games. I had seen it done. And it resonated. I had no problem with that. You put it maybe in the military context, maybe that ruffled more feathers? I don’t know. Maybe it was unearned. Maybe you didn’t feel that close to your friend that died. So don’t try to force it. You’re being clumsy.”</p><p>Robbins has more to say, more possibilities for why people reacted so poorly. There’s only one thing he is absolutely certain about. “I’m glad that my name wasn’t directly attached to it in any kind of way to start with,” he says. It is one thing to have your work go viral for all the wrong reasons, and another to be clearly identified as the author of it. “The internet is a strange and terrible place.”</p><h2 id="iv">IV.</h2><p>Almost 10 years on from <em>Advanced Warfare</em>, the meme has eclipsed its master. “Press F to Pay Respects” is an organism in and of itself. Its origins are forgotten and, actually, not important. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2pp5mz/comment/cmyyx54/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>One Reddit user said</u></a> they thought it was “a reference to Half-Life where the f button turns on the flashlight.” The details get all tangled, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/8ydijf/comment/e2alelr/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"><u>with one user saying</u></a> that they had “seen people claiming that ‘it's actually disrespectful because in the scene what happens when you do that is you piss on the coffin’.”</p><p>In April, 2020, Rick May, who voiced the Soldier in Valve’s enormously popular shooter <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, died of complications from COVID-19. In tribute, Valve placed a statue of his character in the game, which reappears every April.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/g11thm/press_f_to_pay_respects/?ref=remapradio.com"> <u>On Reddit</u></a>, in <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, and elsewhere, fans pressed ‘F’. Just the letter ‘F’, in chats and comment sections, pressed sincerely to pay respects. (Or for other reasons: “I was pressing F expecting some secret or free item lol,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/16h44ve/comment/k0dshpr/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"><u>said one <em>Team Fortress</em> player</u></a>.)</p>

<p>In August, 2018, two <em>Madden</em> esports players — Eli Clayton and Tyler Robertson — were killed in a shooting at a <em>Madden </em>event in Jacksonville, Fla. During an EA Sports memorial Twitch stream, the following month, fellow gamers filled the chat with ‘F’s.&nbsp;</p><p>“As a generation that grew up with meme culture and social media,” <a href="https://dotesports.com/culture/news/maddens-jacksonville-tribute-stream-and-a-new-language-of-digital-mourning?ref=remapradio.com"><u>wrote Nicole Carpenter at Dot Esports,</u></a> “the Twitch community was genuine in its expression, using the tools it has—memes—to mourn. It’s an extension of social media mourning, which is growing more and more common as our population faces mass tragedy and the loss of public figures.”</p><p>The meme is controversial, however. When news of streamer Desmond “Etika” Amofah’s death by suicide in 2019 hit the internet, some Redditors also took the ‘F’, although it caused some friction on the post. While some said the statement was in poor taste (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SmashBrosUltimate/comments/c5bl28/comment/es1alxi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u>one poster called it</u></a> “awful” and “disrespectful”), others said it was appropriate. “He would have loved it. it is to pay respects,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SmashBrosUltimate/comments/c5bl28/comment/es171uz/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>said one Redditor</u></a>.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SmashBrosUltimate/comments/c5bl28/comment/es171uz/?ref=remapradio.com"> </a>“Of anyone out there Etika is the right person to be honouring with memes,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SmashBrosUltimate/comments/c5bl28/comment/es1qevj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u>said another</u></a>.</p><p>“Press F to Pay Respects” us still a meme; <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/f-to-pay-respect-is-the-perfect-example-of-a-joke-turning-serious-when-used-often-enough.187857/page-2?post=31748376&amp;ref=remapradio.com#post-31748376"><u>one might say</u></a> that it’s one generation’s equivalent of RIP — a brief, if perfunctory, expression of sincere sympathy. What has happened in the last 10 years is not that “Press F” went “serious”; rather, death went online. If you are online, you do not learn of Etika’s death in the newspaper or of Rick May’s from a mutual friend at a grocery store. You learn online, in your space, with your friends, where you are comfortable, but you still don’t know exactly what to say. This has not changed: it is not as if before the internet condolences were always expressed appropriately. </p>

<p>What’s changed is that news of a school shooting comes to you in the same feed as a meme of<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/b8utpx/press_f_to_pay_respect/?ref=remapradio.com"><u> Ant-Man flying into Thanos’ asshole.</u></a> To both, you respond with an ‘F’. To Thanos, you say sorry for your loss as a joke; to the victims, you are sorry for real. Maybe you say it in both cases because it’s something you’ve seen people say before. Maybe you’ve internalized that “Press F to Pay Respects” only works as a joke because of the juxtaposition of sincere condolences with absurd circumstances. Maybe you don’t even know what you’re saying. Maybe you’re just grieving.</p><p>“The F meme seems kinda disrespectful in my opinion”, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/g11thm/comment/fndx6yd/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>one poster in the <em>Team Fortress </em>subreddit said</u></a> of the tributes to Rick May.</p><p>“The old man would’ve found it humourous,” someone replied. “Y’all obviously didn’t know the legend”.</p><p>“Dude literally no one would think it’s funny for their death to be respected with an ‘f’ meme. And you wouldn’t even know if he found it humorous because you didn’t even know him personally.”</p><h2 id="v"><strong>V.</strong></h2><p>In February 2020, Rick May suffered a stroke, and was moved to a nursing home. Two months later, he was gone. After his death, Jeremiah Foglesong, a gamer, whose father-in-law was May’s cousin, informed the family of the wealth of tributes that had been posted online: art, poems, Valve’s memorial inside <em>Team Fortress 2. </em>For Diana Lilly, May’s widow, an actor herself who wasn’t particularly tech-savvy, Foglesong printed hard copies of everything. “I did have to explain the lists of ‘F, F, F, F,” Foglesong says. He didn’t know the reference was from a Call of Duty game, but he told her it was “like throwing up a heart emoji, or a thumbs up.”</p><p>The concept of an internet community was fairly alien to Lilly, but the sentiment was clear, and she loved it. “It really meant a lot to me,” she says softly. “I was in such mourning at that time. And it was so nice to hear that other people were thinking about Rick, too. I knew he would just love that, because that meant so much to him: his voice work. Something that was so special to him, to think that other people thought it was special, too.”</p><p>It’s nice to be remembered. “In a way, I’m glad [Press F] got a little bit of attention,” says Robbins. “If that’s what it takes for people to remember that game, fine, because it’s a great game. It’s something I’m really proud of. I think everyone that worked on it really felt like we were making something special.”</p><p>It’s also hard to be remembered. “As we get further and further away from the date that he died, you hear his name less, just a little less,” says Foglesong. Still, every April, he returns to <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, a game he doesn’t play as much as he used to, to see May’s statue. “I think that’s beautiful, that they’re doing that.”</p><p>May was the artistic director at the Renton Civic Theatre in Renton, Wash. when he met Diana Lilly. In 1994, he appeared opposite her in a production of the Ira Levin play <em>Deathtrap</em>, where they played husband and wife. In the play, May’s character conspires to and kills Lilly’s character. Lilly’s mother was “disgusted” that she would date a man who kills her on stage. “He was somebody who was very talented and always fun to be around,” Lilly remembers of her husband. “If he showed up anywhere, people were always so happy to see him. He was always so funny, and had fun stories, and was just a good person to be around.”</p><p>“Rick would really love this,” she says. “He would love to be remembered.”</p><p>What a blessing it is to be remembered at all.</p>

                <p>As part of its long-term strategy, Sony briefly showed a concept for a high-tech PlayStation controller in a new promotional video. To detail its Creative Entertainment Vision strategy designed to show what its products could look like a decade from now, the video showed off a controller with a radical redesign compared to the current DualSense model.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq7Jg_1hGTo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mq7Jg_1hGTo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Ten years from now, we will be living in a more multi-layered world where physical and virtual realities overlap without boundaries," Sony said in the video synopsis. "If Sony, as a creative entertainment company, would be filling the world with new <a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/alphauniverse/stories/kando-attitude" rel="nofollow ">Kando</a>--a Japanese word meaning 'emotional involvement' or 'deep impression'-- in that future, what kind of experiential value would we be offering to make that happen? To explore this question, we conducted a prototyping exercise under the concept of Creative Entertainment Vision."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4307191-sony-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307191" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4307191-sony-controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307191"></a><figcaption>We'll miss you, traditional D-pad.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4307191-sony-controller.jpg"></figure><p>This controller still has analog sticks and a familiar shape, but regular face buttons and the D-pad have been replaced entirely by new inputs. There's also a floating screen above the controller--accessed via a fancy virtual- and mixed-reality headset in the video--and gameplay of a character exploring space. Someone at Sony is clearly a big fan of Minority Report.</p><p>Of course, this is just a brief snippet of what Sony <em>wants </em>to aim for in the future, and technology like this rolling out on a large scale will likely be a lot more than just a decade away.</p><p>Looking toward the more immediate future, it has been reported that Sony is preparing to launch a mid-gen refresh of the PS5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-leaked-specs-reportedly-show-huge-graphical-leaps-forward/1100-6522652/">dubbed the PS5 Pro</a>. Recent leaks suggest that it will have a more powerful GPU and a slightly faster CPU mode, and Sony is reportedly asking game developers to create an enhanced- graphics mode in their games so that these titles can have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-wants-new-ps5-pro-enhanced-mode-in-games-report/1100-6522687/">PS5 Pro "Enhanced" label</a>.</p>

                <p>Mad Max director George Miller wants Metal Gear designer Hideo Kojima to make a Mad Max game, and he also sounded off on 2015's Mad Max game and why he didn't love it.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/mad-max-director-hideo-kojima-game-adaptation-960558-20240523" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gaming Bible</a>, the Australian filmmaker said Kojima would be a top choice of his to make a Mad Max game, though he said he "would never ask him" because Kojima already has so much "fantastic stuff in his own head" that keeps him busy.</p><p>Miller also spoke candidly about 2015's Mad Max game from Just Cause studio Avalanche. He said plainly, "It wasn't as good as I wanted it to be." Upon reflection after that game came out, Miller said, "I'm one of those people that I'd rather not do something unless you can do it at the highest level."</p><p>2015's Mad Max was a tie-in of sorts with Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road, and Miller said his team gave "all our material" to Avalanche to make the game. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mad-max-review/1900-6416232/" data-ref-id="1900-6416232">Mad Max review</a> scored the game a 6/10. Reviewer Peter Brown said, "Mad Max is too focused on providing you with an open-world that's filled with missions, and not focused enough on making those missions worth your time."</p><p>Former Avalanche boss Christofer Sundberg <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reacted to Miller's comments on social media</a>. He said the game suffered from releasing at a "terrible" time, and his efforts to convince Warner Bros. to move the date were not successful. The game released on the same day as Metal Gear Solid V, and Sundberg reflected that Warner Bros. "blamed us for the bad sales" and canceled DLC for the game that was "just sitting there waiting to be released."</p><p>Sundberg added that Avalanche pitched an open-world Mad Max game but was forced to convert the experience to be more linear in structure.</p><p>"We threw away a year of work and got to hear that 'players want autonomy in this day and age.' Well, no shit," he said. "I'm sure Hideo Kojima would make an awesome Mad Max game, but it would be a completely different experience."</p><p>In other Mad Max news, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga comes to theaters on May 24. It stars Anya Taylor-Joy as Furiosa and is a prequel set before the events of Fury Road.</p>

        <p>Amico games console not included but still in development</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Atari has a picked up the Intellivision brand name and 200 games from Intellivision LLC.</p>
<p>Details on the games were not shared, but Intellivision LLC will continue to develop the Amico games console separately with a license from Atari to distribute games on the platform.</p>
<p>The Amico console was originally due to release in October 2020, but a lack of funds has caused a delay to the product and as of November 2023, the firm stated it didn't have the money needed to distribute the machine.</p>
<p>Atari says it will continue to digitally and physically distribute Intellivision titles, explore licensing opportunities and 'potentially create new games'.</p>
<p>Atari and Intellivision were once fierce console competitors in the 1970s and early 1980s.</p>
<p>“This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision and the golden age of gaming,” said Atari CEO Wade Rosen.</p>
<p>Intellivision Entertainment CEO Phil Adam added: "Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellivision brand. We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms."</p>
<p>It is part of Atari's continued investment in its retro games business, including the acquisitions of Digital Eclipse, Nightdive, RetroAge and numerous games IP.<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ataris-re-focus-on-retro"> We spoke to CEO Wade Rosen last year on the firm's retro focus.</a></p>

		<p>Having already faced several delays ahead of a planned Early Access release, Paradox Interactive has now delayed their The Sims rival <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-by-you">Life By You</a>&nbsp;indefinitely.</p>
<p>Where previous delays had been accompanied by a video, this latest delay has been done with a simple statement on the Paradox Interactive website:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>After much consideration, we regret to announce that we have decided to retract Life by You’s Early Access release date, previously set for June 4th. This was not an easy decision, especially since we understand the anticipation and excitement that many players have for the game. However, we believe that additional development time is needed.</p>
<p>While we would have preferred to commit to a new release window, we believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead, rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet.</p>
<p>We will provide more information as soon as possible, until then we want to sincerely thank you for your continued support and patience.</p>
<p>Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developed by Paradox Tectonic, a team led by The Sims veteran Rod Humble, Life By You is an ambitious attempt to take on the life sim juggernaut that is The Sims.</p>
<p>Life By You would naturally cover all of the main bases of the genre, but Paradox Tectonic planned to go even further by adding a far deeper degree of customisation and control for the player. You’ll be able to build your person’s home, with ingrained customisation for colour palettes and designs, and then guide your humans through life, through careers, love and more. You’ll be able to take direct control of people (any person in the world) and move them in the world, and be able to engage in contextually generated conversations with other people. Pretty much all of this can then be modded, from creating custom styles to writing your own dialogue, create events, items, shops, careers, skills, traits and more.</p>

<p>It’s very ambitious in that regard, and seems that Paradox Tectonic need longer to make all of this hang together. Early Access releases were once synonymous with very early builds of games that were severely lacking in features, but as time has gone by, expectations for what an Early Access release offers have grown – not least when it’s a fairly large publisher using this business model. With the quality of Paradox’s game launches currently very much in the spotlight, it makes sene to hold off until Life By You and meet as many expectations as possible.</p>

            <p>An intrepid Super Mario 64 player with far more skill and patience than I can ever hope to obtain has done the once unthinkable. They have completed the game without pressing the A button - you know, the one that makes Mario jump and therefore is pretty darn useful when navigating the platform and enemy laden world - once. Not one single time. Really.</p>
<p>While Super Mario 64 first released in 1996, the <a href="https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/A_Button_Challenge">Super Mario 64 A Button Challenge</a> started picking up traction in the 2000s. And, while there have been many attempts at completing the game without that pretty essential button, no one has managed to complete the game without using A. Until now.</p>

<p>This Super Mario 64 feat was achieved a couple of days ago by a streamer known as <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/marbler">Marbler</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/for-the-first-time-in-28-years-super-mario-64-has-been-beaten-without-using-the-a-button-and-it-only-took-86-hours/">GamesRadar</a>). Thanks to a number of glitches, secrets (like green shells and air currents) and countless heroic dives, Marbler managed to complete the world's first no A button run on the Wii Virtual Console version of the game. Apparently this is the only version that it is actually possible to complete the game without pressing A. They did not remap any buttons to achieve their goal.</p>
<p>You can see the moment Marbler completes their Super Mario 64 A button challenge in the video below. Is this something you fancy trying out for yourself?</p>

<p>Super Mario 64 has had quite the month. Along with this week's achievement, earlier in May, an unopenable door in Super Mario 64 - which was thought to be impenetrable from the outside without the use of mods - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-27-years-super-mario-64s-last-remaining-locked-door-has-finally-been-opened">was finally opened</a>.</p>
<p>I wonder what else the community will achieve before Super Mario 64 turns 30 (which, honestly, I am still trying to wrap my head around, because I am still only 21...).</p>

			<p>Ryujinx, one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last remaining major Nintendo Switch emulators</a>, is already able to run today's Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake at 60FPS.</p>
<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is out today for the Nintendo Switch, but those owning the Remake's ROM were already able to successfully run and play the game on PC through the Ryujinx Switch emulator. Not only that, but the emulator managed to run the game at 60FPS, whereas, on Nintendo's platform, the game is locked at 30FPS. In addition, the game runs in higher resolutions on PC than on the Switch. We've included a video of Ryujinx running the game emulated on PC below (courtesy of '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2IhbStna8E&amp;amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reznoire</a>') below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Ryujinx 1.1.1319 3xIR | Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (60fps Mod) Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q2IhbStna8E?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As most of you will know, this isn't the first time that a Switch title is playable on PC on launch day - as a matter of fact, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-wonder-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Super Mario Wonder</a> could already be played ahead of their global Switch release.</p>
<p>In other Paper Mario-related news - as covered earlier today - <a href="https://wccftech.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-remake-4k-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's remake seemingly contains a 4K performance profile</a>, which might be related to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's upcoming Switch successor</a>.</p>
<p>As said, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Remake is out today for the Nintendo Switch. Here's what we wrote about the game in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> launch review from earlier today:</a></p>
<p><em>"While the new Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door preserves the gonzo charm that made the original game a cult classic, not a lot has been done to deal with its padding and other design quirks. If you’re a hardcore Thousand-Year Door fan, worry not, you’re going to love this spiffy new version. If you’re new to the game or weren’t entirely sold the first time around, you’re still likely to find plenty to enjoy here, but you may also notice a few tattered edges."</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-might-a-playstation-controller-look-like-10-years-from-now-sony-has-an-idea<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>What will playing a video game look like 10 years from now? Will video games be something we beam directly into our brains? Or will be still be gaming in front of a big television, monitor, or mobile much as we do today?</p><p>In a new <a href="https://youtu.be/mq7Jg_1hGTo?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>, Sony has imagined what a PlayStation controller might look like 10 years from now, and it's something straight out of Star Trek.</p><p>"Sony’s Creative Entertainment Vision" YouTube video showed a number of designs for futuristic devices including a gaming controller. Now, while Sony makes a point of saying the content in this video is not directly related to any existing Sony product, it’s fun to imagine playing a video game with this:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/23/screenshot-2024-05-23-112707-1716460830447.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Sony / YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The image shows a PlayStation controller connected to what looks like a floating and curved screen. Is the screen merely a projection from the controller, or an actual physical screen that floats in space, perhaps via the power of magnets? Sony doesn’t explain, and it doesn’t have to. This isn’t a prototype, just a fanciful imagination brought to life with special effects.</p><p>Here’s the official blurb on the video:</p><blockquote>10 years from now, we will be living in a more multi-layered world where physical and virtual realities overlap without boundaries. If Sony, as a creative entertainment company, would be filling the world with new Kando in that future, what kind of experiential value would we be offering to make that happen? </blockquote><blockquote>To explore this question, we conducted a prototyping exercise under the concept of “Creative Entertainment Vision.” Envisioning through the lens of Sony’s creativity and technology, here we present the future as an extension of our lives today.</blockquote><p>Reaction to the controller is a mix of disbelief and mockery, with some likening it to real-life PlayStation prototypes that never saw the light of day, such as the unreleased PS3 controller affectionately called the '<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/12/01/the-boomerang-what-might-have-been">Boomerang</a>.'</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/23/what-if-sony-stuck-with-the-ps3s-boomerang-controller-20081201033209544-000-1716461081594.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It’s all a bit of fun, of course, but let’s entertain the idea for a moment. In a decade from now, so in 2034, we will perhaps be on the PlayStation 7 generation, assuming Sony is still pumping out consoles. But perhaps Sony will have gone down the hybrid console route, ala Nintendo Switch, by then. All you’d need to game on the go is a lightweight controller, looking something like the controller we see in the video, that projects a screen to look at wherever you are. Perhaps PS7 <em>is</em> the controller.</p><p>Which Call of Duty will we be on by then? That’s quick math I can’t quite wrap my head around. As long as the ping is low and the k/d high, I’ll be there.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Back in the world of the present, Sony is reportedly preparing to release a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-specs-leak-online">PS5 Pro</a>, and last year it released the <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-portal">PlayStation Portal</a> peripheral. Maybe we should take the PlayStation Portal and this video as a hint that PlayStation’s future is wherever we want to take it.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        <p>Co-founders discuss their plans to create a sustainable company and how they want to champion indie developers</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sega veterans Jarvis Crofts, Luke Greenaway, and Mark Dallamore have formed a new publisher-agency hybrid, Alibi.</p>
<p>Based in London, Alibi draws on the three co-founders' experiences in data analytics, publishing, and more to help support developers in pitching and publishing games.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>spoke with two of its founders, CEO Jarvis Crofts and CSO Luke Greenaway, about the formation of Alibi and why they believe a publisher agency hybrid is a sustainable way forward in the industry.</p>
<p>Alibi formed at the beginning of last year after Greenaway looked back at his time working in the music industry. He noted the importance of scouting in that industry, and wondered why it wasn't of bigger importance in games.</p>
<p>"You live and die by the success of your titles, the same way record labels do with their artists," he notes. "I had that idea in my head for a while, and when I left PTW I thought, 'You know what, I'm going to build this out."</p>

</figure>
<p>"It's obviously incredibly challenging because there is no science to making successful games, and I think publishers struggle to be sustainable because innately they almost feel like hedge funds," Greenaway continues. "You have to have a quantity to balance the successes from those that aren't going to succeed. And I think the way we looked at it was actually, you can do this better."</p>
<p>Crofts, Greenaway, and Dallamore have over fifteen years of experience in the games industry. Crofts worked as a data analyst at Sega for a decade, moving from a junior to senior position on the publishing side before moving to Curve Games to head up portfolio and strategy.</p>
<p>Dallamore worked at Sega for six years as a project lead and product launch executive, with experience in product development. Greenaway worked in QA for fifteen years before moving outside the industry working in music software and business development. He then came back to work for PTW as director of commercial strategy.</p>
<p>Greenaway adds that publishing is high risk, which is why he wants Alibi to stay small and to be selective about the developers it works with and the games it signs. That way, the team can pour their focus onto a select few and help them succeed. So far, Greenaway says that the developers they've spoken with have been "very receptive" to that.</p>
<p>"Our approach is that we're not necessarily pursuing representation super proactively – it's more of an emergent thing," Crofts adds. "Our objective first and foremost is to meet great developers. If there's a great game there and a mutual desire for us to work together, we'll ensure there's a way for us to work together no matter what.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/luke-greenaway.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>"So if we can sign a title and publish it, brilliant, let's do it. If our slate is full but the team wants to work with us, we can help represent or consult them, help them self-publish and get this stuff built up. It's really about maximising and being really efficient with the limited focus that we have."</p>
<p>Greenaway agrees that efficiency is the key to being sustainable in this industry, which Crofts says is at the core of what they hope to achieve with Alibi.</p>
<p>"If you're speaking to a developer and you don't sign a game, you've still invested a lot of time and resources into that negotiation," he explains. "Whereas for us, we can pivot into representation and consultancy and maintain that relationship and still generate revenue. But, more importantly, we can help a developer take their game to market through publishing partners."</p>
<p>For Crofts, this is what sets Alibi apart in such a competitive space among other publishers and agencies.</p>
<p>"It's all about being a smart first person to reach out to, and hopefully that gives us opportunities to help games really early to make sure their pitches are the best and make sure they get the best funding and release."</p>
<p>Greenaway adds that what separates Alibi from other companies is its small team, and how it can be laser-focused on giving constructive feedback.</p>
<p>"I know it's cheesy in a way, but one of the reasons we set Alibi up is that we often have those conversations of 'Why hasn't anyone made this game?'," he says. "And then you think about it, it probably has but no one's seen it and they haven't been given the guidance.  That's what separates us from other agencies, as well as our ability to fully fund the title as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>"It's about maximising and being really efficient with the limited focus that we have"</p><cite>Jarvis Crofts</cite></blockquote>
<p>"So it's really the developer's choice of how they work with us, rather than Alibi being an agency that will take your game to several publishers and just get you a deal. We can sign your title, we can help you achieve this part better and guide you through the process. For developers the legal side and the contracts are quite daunting – they don't want to focus on that. They want someone to assist them so they can make their game."</p>
<p>As for the sort of developers Alibi intends to focus on, the co-founders are passionate about championing indie developers and giving them the support they need to succeed in the industry.</p>
<p>"I feel like these developers are the vanguard of creativity in this industry," Greenaway notes. "The accessibility for indie developers now has never been greater. We really want to work with them and give them a better platform, provide them with the opportunity to succeed."</p>
<p>Crofts adds: "The great thing about these games is they're not asset-intensive or massively multiplayer. The best games in these segments are often from individuals or small teams, so it's mutually beneficial and that's a really sustainable model to be right now. Especially when you're looking for smaller titles because capital is really difficult without compromising a game like that."</p>
<p>That's not to say Alibi won't work with bigger, AAA titles in the future.</p>
<p>"While we may not be signing first-party titles ourselves, we can absolutely help them," Crofts adds. "Just to prove it, even a little bit, to get over that threshold and get signed by a publisher or an investor."</p>
<p>Greenaway describes this sustainable approach as "liberating" as it enables them to be selective about the titles they pick and not worry about how they're going to achieve revenue objectives.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We have a responsibility as publishers to be sustainable and to ensure that we're not letting people go or cancelling projects. These are people's dreams and their passion"</p><cite>Luke Greenaway</cite></blockquote>
<p>"We can sell the games when we can, which allows us to be liberal and work with the developers that we really want to work with," he explains.</p>
<p>However, he also feels that sustainability as a whole in the industry is a long way off.</p>
<p>"We're quite open with our model, because we just want the industry to improve," he says. "We can see our model being replicated by other people, but the irony is that while sustainability is so far off, developer opportunities and creativity are so accessible – it's never been better. There are so many brilliant games and so many people working in the industry and so much creativity.</p>
<p>"I think we have a responsibility as publishers to be sustainable and to ensure that we're not letting people go or cancelling projects. These are people's dreams and their passion."</p>

He’ll ask for a steep upfront payment of 100 coins. Pay him that, and he’ll ask for 100 more. Pay him that, and he’ll ask for 100 more. After you’ve paid 300 coins, he’ll say he has enough. He’ll then depart after Chapter 4. Despite his earnestness, there’s something sketchy about the whole deal. It’s probably the way he gets indignant if you refuse.</p>
 <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="192" data-injectable="false">However, if you do make an investment, <strong>he does stay true to his word</strong>. He’ll return to Rogueport after Chapter 6, and will give you a share of the earnings that your investment helped enable.</p> <figure data-current-count="492" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-how-much-does-lumpy-give-you" data-injectable="false">How much does Lumpy give you?</h2> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">In <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, Lumpy will return from Dry Dry Desert after Chapter 6, and will bring you stories of his adventure, as well as a return on your investment.</p> <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">Here are what you get depending on what you invested.</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false"> <li>100 coin investment – 300 coins</li> <li>200 coin investment – 600 coins</li> <li>300 coin investment – 999 coins</li> </ul> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">Each level of investment is tripled, so no matter what you give to Lumpy, you get a decent stack of coins for your trouble. However, <strong>the 300 coin investment nets you the largest profit</strong> by a pretty hefty margin.</p>
 <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false">So, yes, <strong>you should definitely invest in Lumpy’s enterprise</strong>. This might sound obvious, but I’d recommend 300 coins if you can spare it since it will completely fill your pockets.</p> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="false">Speaking of which, the maximum number of coins you could carry in the GameCube version is 999. This means that if you had coins in your pocket when you collected from Lumpy, it would subtract from the number you’re given. However, this has been increased in the Switch version. I’m not sure what the maximum is, but I’m guessing 9999. Either way, <strong>you should now be able to fit all of his reward in your pockets</strong>.</p>

<p data-characters="230" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">To really get into the meat of Chapter 3 in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, you’re going to need a Blimp ticket. You’re told that, in order to get a blimp ticket, you need to see Don Pianta. Actually, let’s start there.</p> <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">To talk to Don Pianta, you first need to meet his rival, Robbo. To get there, you need to slip through the crack next to the Trouble Center. There, you’ll have to pay 64 coins. Robbo will then tell you that, in order to see Don Pianta, you’ll need to buy a Dried Mushroom and a Dizzy Dial, then give the clerk the password “Yellow.” Well, first she’ll ask what color your mustache is. You can say yellow, but she’ll then just correct herself and ask what your favorite color is. Give her the answer “yellow,” and you’ll be let through the back door.</p>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">Up the stairs, you’ll meet with Don Pianta. He’s vaguely threatening, but eventually will give you the deal that if you can track down his daughter and former underling, he’ll give you the blimp ticket. They’re planning on eloping, and he needs to “talk” to them.</p> <p data-characters="68" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">Once the conversation is over, you’ll need to <strong>head to the Docks.</strong>&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="160" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false">These are South of Rogueport’s main square. You’ll need to go right onto the docks further south, as the couple are standing at the end of it. Talk to them.</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true"><strong>It doesn’t matter what you tell them</strong>. You can say that you won’t rat them out to Don Pianta, or, inversely, you can tell them that you are. It doesn’t matter. Once the discussion is over, return to Don Pianta. At that point, the couple will burst in and hijack the conversation. It’s a pretty mild scene. Cute even. This is a <em>Mario</em> game, after all.</p>
 <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="186" data-injectable="false">In any case, Don Pianta will excuse the couple through some more veiled threats. Afterward, he’ll give you the blimp ticket. You can disembark through the area north of West Rogueport.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-%E2%80%93-how-to-get-optional-partner-ms-mowz.879174/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-how-to-get-optional-partner-ms-mowz/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-how-to-get-optional-partner-ms-mowz<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="286" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em> you get all your partners throughout the course of the story. That is to say, all the <em>required</em> partners. There is one that you don’t need in order to complete the game, but she requires a detour to get. This is how to add Ms. Mowz to your party.</p> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">Ms. Mowz is the flirtatious rat-thing you meet a few times in the narrative. She shows up in Hooktail Castle, for example, and then again in the Great Tree. Each time, she talks about how hunky Mario is and gives him a little peck before running off.</p> <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">After Chapter 4, you can actually recruit her into your party. To do so, you need to head to the Trouble Center in Eastern Rogueport. If you’ve never used it, this is essentially a bulletin board for side-quests. While some of these only result in getting a pocketful of change for your troubles, others will reward you with extremely useful items or, as we’re talking about here, Ms. Mowz.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true">In the list of quests, you’re looking for one called “Elusive Badge!” posted by someone anonymous (???). The request will tell you to meet on top of Zess T’s house, which you can get to by going into the inn, climbing the stairs to the second floor, and exiting through the door on the left.</p>
 <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="196" data-injectable="false">If you peek into the badge shop before talking to Ms. Mowz, you’ll discover her secret identity. She’s the assistant at the badge shop, if the shape of her tail didn’t give her away earlier.</p> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">Talk to Ms. Mowz on the rooftop and she’ll tell you the badge she’s looking for is in the room that Hooktail was defeated in. However, she can’t find it, which is where you come in.</p> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-find-the-elusive-badge-in-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door" data-injectable="false">How to find the Elusive Badge in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</h2> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">To get the Elusive Badge in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, you need to return to the room you defeated Hooktail in. Getting back can be a pain. It isn’t difficult now that you’ve got more chapters under your belt, but it is a long trek. I don’t have any shortcuts for you; you just need to go back to Hooktail Castle and retrace the path back to the top.</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">When you reach Hooktail’s Room, you’ll find it quiet and empty. Search around, and you probably won’t see anything out of place. However, if you go straight right from the door, you’ll eventually bump into something invisible roughly in the center of the room.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">Switch to Flurrie and use her ability on the invisible blockade. A sticker will give way and reveal a chest. Inside the chest is the Elusive Badge.</p>
 <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="195" data-injectable="false">As a note, you cannot immediately equip the Elusive Badge. It isn’t considered a Badge at this point. However, at the end of the quest, it will be handed back to you in the form of Attack FX B.</p> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">With that in mind, return to Ms. Mowz. She’ll reveal that this was simply a test to see if you had what it takes to be a successful badge hunter. She will then join your team. You aren’t given a choice.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-what-are-ms-mowz-s-abilities-in-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door" data-injectable="false">What are Ms. Mowz’s abilities in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</h2> <p data-characters="125" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">While not required to complete the game, Ms. Mowz is an extremely useful ally to have in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Her partner ability, in particular, is one you’ll probably keep returning to use. She can sniff out nearby items, hidden or otherwise. Her nose will begin to twitch when one is nearby, and you can hit the X button to have her take a deep whiff and tell you exactly how close it is.</p> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">In battle, she has another useful ability. Her “Kiss Thief” skill costs 2 FP and will steel an item from an enemy. Since some enemies hold badges, this enables you to build up your badge collection further by swiping them. Plenty of enemies in the Pit of 100 Trials, for example, will have badges on them, and Ms. Mowz can snatch them for you.</p>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">Aside from that, her default attack is a physical slap. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-level-up-your-partners-in-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When upgraded</a>, her 3 FP “Tease” will make enemies Dizzy. When ultra-upgraded, her 10 FP “Smooch” ability can heal Mario, which is helpful when you don’t have the items or star power to heal any other way.</p> <p data-characters="112" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Overall, Ms. Mowz isn’t that terrific in combat, but she more than makes up for it with her thief-y abilities.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/after-selling-and-shutting-down-studios-embracer-group-wants-to-release-over-70-games-by-march-2025/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=after-selling-and-shutting-down-studios-embracer-group-wants-to-release-over-70-games-by-march-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="345" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In its financial report on its 2024 fiscal year, the Embracer Group has shared its intentions to put out over 70 projects across its PC, console, mobile, and tabletop gaming divisions within the 2025 fiscal year. This comes after <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/embracer-group-restructure-studio-closures-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructuring efforts that began last June</a>, which led to mass layoffs and some studios being sold off or shut down.</p> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">The report was published on <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2024-adjusted-ebit-increased-by-56-to-sek-1426-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Embracer Group’s website</a> on May 23, which reveals that net sales were overall an improvement compared to the previous fiscal year, having increased by 12%. As for the 2025 fiscal year (which covers April 2024 to March 2025), Embracer says there is plenty of potential growth for its various gaming divisions, particularly for tabletop and mobile. Over 70 gaming related projects are expected to launch by the end of next March, which includes “three important unannounced titles.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Deep Silver</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="837" data-injectable="true">Embracer obviously doesn’t comment further on what those three are, but it does name two key releases it has scheduled: <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> and <em>Killing Floor 3</em>. Both games will launch for consoles and PC though only the former has a launch window of 2024, so the latter may not release till early 2025. Embracer also believes these two games will perform similarly to 2023’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/dead-island-2-review-destructoid-deep-silver-zombie-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Island 2</a></em> (which <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2023-net-sales-increased-by-79-to-sek-9356-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sold over 2 million copies in its first month</a>) and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-remnant-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remnant 2</a></em> (which <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2023-net-sales-increased-by-13-to-sek-10831-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sold over 2 million copies in its first two months</a>).</p>
 <p data-characters="787" data-current-count="787" data-injectable="true">While there’s optimism for the future, with Embracer planning to dedicate a lot of resources towards the many, many IPs it owns (particularly <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>), CEO Lars Wingefors does acknowledge the layoffs. Around this time last year, the company employed 16,601 people, but that number has dropped to 12,069. That means 4,532 employees were let go in the past 12 months, which is a reduction of roughly 27%. “These were necessary but difficult decisions, and it has been important to carry out the changes with compassion, respect and integrity towards those affected,” says Wingefors. He also says the restructuring efforts are now over, and have “created a stronger foundation for improved profitability, cash flows and long-term value creation.”</p>
 <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">The games industry has a whole has been suffering from severe layoffs, but Embracer in particular has closed several of its studios, such as Free Radical. That one especially hurt since Embracer had <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/timesplitters-studio-free-radical-reunites-for-new-series-entry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helped in reforming it to revive Free Radical’s <em>Timesplitters </em>series</a>, only to close it before we even got to see what the studio was cooking. Embracer also <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/take-two-is-buying-gearbox-from-embracer-next-borderlands-is-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold off <em>Borderlands</em> developer Gearbox</a> (less than three years after it was bought out) and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kotor-remake-developer-saber-interactive-to-leave-embracer-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saber Interactive</a>, with the latter still <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-still-in-active-development-saber-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planning to release a remake of <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em></a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="478" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="false">Embracer’s rapid growth and subsequent downsizing has made it a popular target of criticism, but soon the name Embracer Group won’t be a thing anymore. The company is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/embracer-group-is-ditching-its-name-and-splitting-itself-into-three-separate-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">splitting itself into three separate entities</a>, and none of them will bear the Embracer moniker. Hopefully, there’ll be no further layoffs out of Embracer, but <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/">Microsoft’s closure of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> developer Tango Gameworks</a> has proved studios can make successful games and still be shut down.</p>

            <p>
Blizzard is removing the Hero Mastery Gauntles PvE mode from Overwatch three months after it launched as "it hasn't resonated with players".
</p>
<p>
The mode will no longer be available to play from Season 11 on 18th June, after it launched in March this year. 
</p>
<p>
Players therefore have until then, during Season 10, to complete the Lifetime Challenges for the mode and compete on its Top 500 leaderboards.

"As we prepare for Season 11, we've taken the time to evaluate a variety of game modes based on how much they are being played," reads a notice on the <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/update-regarding-hero-mastery-gauntlet/901366">Overwatch forum</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Hero Mastery Gauntlet was intended to bring the high score-chasing excitement of Hero Mastery missions into a multiplayer format. Unfortunately, it hasn't resonated with players in the ways that we hoped."
</p>
<p>
Individual Hero Mastery Solo Courses will continue to be available, with more expected in future seasons.
</p>
<p>
Overwatch PvE has been a bone of contention for Blizzard. The online free-to-play shooter's expected <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2s-long-promised-flagship-pve-mode-has-been-scrapped">Hero Mode was scrapped in 2023</a> as development "hasn't made the progress we would have hoped," it said at the time, though it promised other PvE modes were on the way.

</p>
<p>
Then in March this year, Bloomberg reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2s-pve-content-scrapped-as-devs-are-denied-bonuses-for-the-first-time-report-claims">all PvE content had been scrapped</a> due to "poor" sales and Blizzard would "double down" on PvP gameplay.

Despite this, the Hero Mastery Gauntlet was added in March: a three player co-op mode that featured tower defence-style gameplay.
</p>
<p>
An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-is-revitalising-the-overwatch-2-experience">earlier blog post from Blizzard in February</a> insisted the developer had "heard [the] feedback" from players about competitive play and stated plans to introduce "big updates" for players to "see how you progress through the competitive ranks".

</p>
<p>
Still, the reputation of Overwatch has plummeted since its early glory days, with Blizzard seemingly testing new features and modes that don't seem to stick.

</p>
<p>A new Hero was added last month called Venture, revealed in the trailer above.</p>

            <p>
Players of EA games such as Apex Legends, FC 24 and The Sims 4 have been greeted with warnings that their "games have been removed from your library". 
</p>
<p>
EA acknowledged the issue as a bug yesterday, and said that it had now been resolved. "We fixed the issue with EA services on PC. Log out and log back in to access your games. Thanks for sticking with us!" EA Help <a href="https://x.com/EAHelp/status/1793255707808268465">wrote</a> on social media platform X.
</p>
<p>
But users of the EA app (the PC replacement for Origin) have said the problem still remains - and Eurogamer has verified this morning that the warning message is still showing for us.

<p>Eurogamer logged into the EA App today and found the notice that stated: 'Games have been removed from your library. View details for more information'. But when we clicked for more information, nothing was shown.</p>

<p>
Players impacted by the issue have reacted in anger, as access to games they've paid for has been interrupted. 
</p>
<p>
"It's outrageous that I spent a fortune on Sims 4 and can't play it," one player wrote. "I never thought you could make an app worse than Origin. But you did!"
</p>
<p>
Others complained that while access to their games had been restored, they still lacked the ability to load DLC. 
</p>
<p>
"By fixed you mean it's still broken right? No DLC is available in DA:I," one user wrote. "Still missing some BF1 stuff from account," wrote another.

            <p>Sometimes you gotta know when to fold, and trying to get new hotness <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wuthering-waves">Wuthering Waves</a> to play nice with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> has got me creasing like an origami crane. While its Epic Games Store release can be worked around, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-proton-ge-on-the-steam-deck">Proton GE</a> will get the game’s own launcher running, no combination of software, compatibility tools, or installation folder deep-diving seems capable of actually booting the game proper.</p>
<p>As such, I’m accepting defeat. Obviously with apologies to any studious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-academy">Steam Deck Academy</a> readers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I don’t want to say Wuthering Waves will <em>never</em> work on the Deck, as pretty much all its issues with running on SteamOS can be dealt with – right up to that final hurdle of, y’know, launching the game. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-epic-games-launcher-on-steam-deck">Epic app is installable</a> either directly or via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">Lutris</a>, and I could at least get to the launcher stage by grabbing the standalone Windows installer straight from Wuthering Waves’ <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames-ads.com/download/?lang=en">website</a>. Said launcher wouldn’t fire up by itself – I had to dig out its executable, add it as a non-Steam game, and force it to launch with the latest version of Proton GE – but eventually it was onscreen and downloading the game files.</p>
<p>It's literally just that final stage where all the tools and tricks stop working, the launcher’s "Start" button merely looping back to itself after a few seconds of nothing. Reinstalling, switching Proton versions, and keeping the Epic launcher simultaneously running in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-enable-desktop-mode-on-the-steam-deck">Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode</a> all proved inadequate solutions. It’s tempting to have a big "Why! WHY!" tantrum about this – I might have one after this post goes live – but sadly these "just not that into you" situations can still happen with SteamOS, despite the long-running and ongoing efforts of Valve and other game developers to improve compatibility.</p>
<p>One alternative – if you’re not willing to wait for a potential fix, either to Proton or the game itself – is to run the Android version of Wuthering Waves on the Steam Deck using <a href="https://waydro.id/">Waydroid</a>. Youtuber 10 Minute Steam Deck Gamer has <a href="https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamOS-Waydroid-Installer">produced an installation guide</a> for this tool, which can essentially spoof a full Android system within the Linux-based SteamOS, though be warned it’s a pretty complex process, with plenty of command line action.</p>
<p>Patience might just pay off, though. Think of it this way: now that I’ve publicly admitted I don’t know how to get it working, the probability of someone else managing it within a few hours, humiliating me, must have shot up to something like 97 or 98 percent. You’re welcome.</p>
