<p>Following the positively stellar month of February, a relatively quiet month in March, and now looking forward to the upcoming summer, one would expect April to be relatively tame. Well, that’s correct. The biggest video game releases in April 2025 don’t overly impress, with a few remasters and plenty of niche titles, but don’t expect much in the way of AAA.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-hottest-game-releases-of-april-2025">The Hottest Game Releases of April 2025</h2>



<p>It appears April is the month of visual novels and niche role-playing games, with a heavy dose of action-adventure tossed in for good measure from the indie and AA scene. For those of you who have spent time awaiting The Last of Us Part II on PC, that’s the big release for the month, and it’s not even a new one!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</strong> (PC) – April 3, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Koira </strong>(PC/PlayStation 5) – April 17, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – April 24, 2025</li>



<li><strong>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</strong> (PC/Nintendo Switch) – April 24, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Tempest Rising</strong> (PC) – April 24, 2025</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with this small handful of titles, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time launches on Nintendo Switch sometime in April 2025, though we don’t have an official release date yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-looking-forward-to-may-2025">Looking Forward to May 2025</h2>



<p>As of publishing this piece, May is a relatively quiet month with only a handful of titles, most of which are TBA currently, but we suspect more will come as we delve into the year further.</p>



<ul>
<li>Sonic Wings Reunion</li>



<li>Revenge of the Savage Plenty</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-pc-game-of-2024-best-new-pc-games-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PC gaming in 2024 was nothing short of extraordinary. This year, developers pushed boundaries, delivering games that dazzled with immersive visuals, innovative mechanics, and stories that kept players glued to their screens. From blockbuster titles redefining beloved genres to indie gems that captured hearts with their creativity, the lineup was packed with unforgettable experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we look back on the year, these are the standout PC games that left their mark and reminded us why gaming on PC is truly unmatched. Let’s dive into the best PC games of 2024 – the ones that raised the bar and set new standards for the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before we get into it, it’s worth mentioning that these are games that are either exclusive to PC or released first on the platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-pc-game-of-2024-winner-hades-2">Best PC Game Of 2024 Winner — Hades 2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game may have released in “early access” in May, but Hades 2 feels like anything but an early access title. The game takes so much of what made the first game great, and adds to it in ways that make it nearly perfect.</p>



<p>Set after the events of the original game, Hades 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">puts players in the role of Melinoë</a>, the Princess of the Underworld and sister of Zagreus, the first game’s protagonist. Guided by her mentor, Hecate, Melinoë’s mission is to stop Chronos, the Titan of Time, who has risen to challenge the gods and mortals who once opposed him.</p>



<p>While the game has a lot of similarities to the orginal, the addition mechanics and features put it over the top. Hades 2 adds a new  Magick Bar that players use for various moves that you recharge as you play. There’s even a new sprint ability that opens up a new world of movement and agility while you play. Hades 2 also introduces multiple pathes to the surface: from&nbsp;Erebus&nbsp;to Tartarus or&nbsp;Ephyra&nbsp;to&nbsp;Mount Olympus.</p>



<p>What makes the game even better, is that it can be completed in under 20 hours if that’s your cup of tea. However, if you are a completionist who needs to do everything in a game, then Hades 2 can teak you nearly 60 hours to do everything. It’s really up to how you want to play.</p>



<h2>Best PC Games of 2024 Nominations</h2>



<p>While Hades 2 stood out as the best PC game of 2024, that doesn’t mean there weren’t other great options for players. From action to city-building, there was something for every type of game this year. Here are some of the other top PC games to release over the last 12 months.</p>



<h3>I Am Your Beast</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Released in September, I Am Your Beast is another excellent game from Strange Scaffold. You play as former government agent Alphonse Harding who is asked to do “one last job”. After turning it down, you find yourself against the same group that tried to recruit you in the first place.</p>



<p>The game features fast-paced action that has made it popular for speed running. It also has some of the most violent yet enticing gameplay you’ll find from any game, let alone an indie title. I Am Your Beast features 25 levels that make you feel like you are playing a modern version of classic Doom and Duke Nukem 3D just in shorter bursts. Those short bursts — the levels take only a couple minutes to get through — helps with that feeling of wanting to keep coming back for more.  It’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a great hook</a> that gives you that “just one more level” feeling every time. It’s a game that becomes hard to put down once you get started.</p>



<h3>UFO 50</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Dozens of games within a single game make for a great game. Yeah, you read that right. UFO 50 features 50 different games from various genres. The game acts as a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“showcase” of the games</a> developed by UFO Soft for the LX-I, LX-II, and LX-III consoles during the 1980s. While the fictional showcase is a cool concept, it’s the games you can play that make it just so good. </p>



<p>Bushido Ball takes a simple concept like Pong and adds samurai swords, ninjas, and shot abilities. Then there’s the RPG Grimstone that feels like the old Final Fantasy games. My favorite, however, is the Metroidvania Mini &amp; Max. It takes a number of great concepts from the genre, and makes t hem easy and accessible. It’s one of those games that even as a standalone game would be considered a good indie game.</p>



<p>No matter what you’re into, there’s bound to be a game in UFO 50 to feed your appetite. Of course, there’s also the hidden 51st game that’s just as much fun as the first 50.</p>



<h3>Frostpunk 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A highly-anticipated city-builder, Frostpunk 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released in September</a> to mass acclaim from most players and critics. The game is set 30 years after the “Great Storm” of the first title, and sees players take on the role of the “Steward” following the death of the original Captain. As you play, you have to handle population issues, resource scarcity, and the transition into a new era. Building upon the first game, Frostpunk 2 also lets you build a bigger city with districts that serve specific purposes.</p>



<p>As you expand and create districts, you also have to manage factions with different ideologies, leading to potential conflict among citizens. Lastly, there’s a council that represents the different factions that you present your laws and regulations to. You function more like an actual government in Frostpunk 2 than any city-builder I’ve played before it, and it sets a stage for what I believe future games in the genre should strive for.</p>



<p>This PC game was so well received that it even won the Best Gameplay award at the Gamescom Awards 2024. It’s so much more than your typical city-builder that Frostpunk 2 is a game that you can easily get lost in for hours at a time. </p>

			<p>A team of modders is working to add multiplayer to Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man on PC, and they've got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu8e-Q2l_ek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer</a> to prove it already works. The original game, of course, offered no such feature, and neither did the sequel, despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-co-op-mode-teased-by-miles-morales-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short-lived rumors</a> and the fact that you do actually collaborate with the other Spider-Man (both Peter Parker and Miles Morales are playable <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the game</a>, and you can swap between them while in the open world), but only as an NPC.</p>
<p>However, Insomniac did at least toy with the idea several times. Back in 2021, the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-new-multiplayer-game-pve-melee-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for a multiplayer game with PvE (player versus environment) melee combat. That turned out to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-leak-spider-gwen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spider-Man: The Great Web</a>, a cooperative multiplayer game that leaked as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insomniac's hack</a>. The game would have allowed five players to take the roles of various members of the Spider family, including Spider-Gwen.</p>
<p>Let's go back to Marvel's Spider-Man, though. Modders <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-remastered-code-includes-co-op-multiplayer-mode-references/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified</a> multiplayer references in the game's code as early as two years ago. There might have been some hooks they're now using in the project. The team has shared the following FAQ on its Discord:</p>
<p><em>When is this mod coming out?</em><br>
<em>No release date as of yet.</em></p>
<p><em>Is there PVP?</em><br>
<em>No, it currently isn't a feature to fight other players in Multiplayer but it may get looked at in the future.</em></p>
<p><em>What is the Player Limit?</em><br>
<em>The Player Limit in Spider-Man Multiplayer is 16 players.</em></p>
<p><em>Is this a mod for MSM1 or MSM2?</em><br>
<em>This is a mod for MSM1, however we will look into porting to MSM2 once it releases.</em></p>
<p><em>Does the main story work?</em><br>
<em>Some main story missions do work but we're working on free roam content currently and will look into main story more at a later date.</em></p>
<p><em>Do mods work?</em><br>
<em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>Can my friends see my mods?</em><br>
<em>Friends can see your suit mods so long as you both have the same suit mods installed. If you don't then the person who doesn't have the suit mod installed will not be able to see the person with the suit. Additionally if you use animation mods it's better for all players to have it installed.</em></p>
<p><em>How long has this mod been under development?</em><br>
<em>This mod has been in development since August 2024.</em></p>
<p><em>How does connecting to players work?</em><br>
<em>You create a lobby, and then other players can either join via a Steam invite or you can add the host's IP and join that way.</em></p>
<p><em>What platforms are supported?</em><br>
<em>Steam and Epic Games Store versions are the supported Marvel's Spider-Man copies in which multiplayer will work.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Spider-Man Multiplayer Trailer (Mod)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nu8e-Q2l_ek?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now, there's many ways this could go wrong. Mod teams blow up all the time, either due to insurmountable technical hurdles, internal drama, or just plain old real life commitments (they're not professionals, after all). Sony could also kick the Marvel's Spider-Man multiplayer mod to the curb to prevent it from being released. Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod-creators-attacked-by-nintendo-through-copyright-strikes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did it</a> for the Breath of the Wild mod, effectively killing it.</p>
<p>Still, there are plenty of instances where this actually worked<span><span>—more or less.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-together-reborn-co-op-mod-is-finally-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyrim Together</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sekiro-online-mod-pvp-coop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sekiro multiplayer</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://wccftech.com/just-cause-3-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Cause 3 multiplayer</a> are some of the most famous examples of multiplayer mods successfully added to single-player only games</span>.</span> Another interesting project to keep track of is '<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CyberMP</a>,' which plans to introduce multiplayer to Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

			<p>While 2024 didn't see the release of new entries in staple franchises like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, the past 12 months were still very good for action games fans thanks to the release of a variety of very solid games coming from both veterans of the genre and newcomers that left more than a few players surprised with the high level of competence shown in their debut titles, so high that it is almost difficult to tell that they haven't been developed by studios with more experience in the action games genre.</p>
<p>Here are the five best action games released in 2024 on PC and consoles, alongside a few other games that, while not as good as the best five, definitely deserve to be mentioned for their quality and for what they brought to the genre as a whole.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a></em></p>
<h2>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Prince-of-Persia-The-Lost-Crown-header.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Prince of Persia series has always been at the forefront of the action games genre, but for a very long time, the series has been away from the spotlight. The long-dormant franchise, however, was finally brought back this year with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and what a way to come back it is. Returning to the roots of the series, the game developed by Ubisoft Montpelier is an amazing Metroidvania game featuring an engaging story and extremely solid gameplay mechanics that make it not only one of the best action games released in the past few years but also one of the best Metroidvania games ever released. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review.</p>
<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown couldn't have brought back the series after its more than a decade-long hiatus in a better way. With an engaging story, well-crafted Metroidvania mechanics, and a touch of character-action games features in its combat system, Sargon's adventure will be remembered by fans for a long time, even with its minor issues.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Blade (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Stellar_Blade-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like with Black Myth Wukong, the hype surrounding Stellar Blade was definitely bigger than what one may have expected for a debut title of a developer who had released only mobile games up until this point, but in the end, like for Game Science's first game, Korean studio Shift Up proved they had what it takes to make a compelling action game. While the over-sexualized character design may be offputting for some players, there's no denying that the Korean developers knew what they were doing, enriching the obvious inspiration from Yoko Taro's NieR series with some light RPG and Soulslike mechanics that make the game a joy to both look at and play. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about the game in his review.</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>
<h2>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/">8</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hellblade-II.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Ninja Theory released quite a few games over the course of the years, but none managed to become commercial successes, except for Hellblade: Senua's Saga, a narrative-focused game that offered solid action combat in the vein of the previous titles developed by the studio. With Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Ninja Theory doubled down on everything that made the original game so unique, keeping the oppressive atmosphere and combat system and turning it up to eleven with one of the most impressive visual showcases of the generation powered by Unreal Engine 5. A remarkable game that is definitely not for everyone, but one that is worth experiencing for those looking for an extremely immersive experience. Here's what Alessio Palumbo had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II keeps virtually the same scope and structure of the independent triple-A game made in 2017 by Ninja Theory. The story is just as poignant, the visuals are stunning, and the experience is one that every Game Pass user should check out for themselves. However, those hoping for a more traditional game in the vein of the God of War reboot will inevitably be disappointed, and this is unlikely to have nearly that level of success, which is what Microsoft still desperately needs.</em></p>
<h2>Black Myth Wukong (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">8.5</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/black-myth-wukong-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Right from its out-of-the-blue announcement in late 2020, it was clear how Black Myth Wukong was going to be an extremely popular game, as the trailer showcasing the pre-alpha build reached 2 million views on YouTube and over 10 million views on Chinese video-sharing website Bilibili in just 24 hours. Being the very first PC and console game by an unproven developer, however, there was the chance that all the hype could have been for nothing, but Game Science proved detractors wrong by releasing a solid action game inspired by FromSoftware's Souls series. While being based on the popular Journey to the West novel may have contributed to the game's huge popularity, especially in China, Black Myth Wukong is definitely a game that fans of the genre should experience, even if it doesn't exactly attempt to break the mold to offer anything innovative. Here's what I had to say in my review:</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>
<h2>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-coming-back-to-life/">8</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dead-Rising-Deluxe-Remaster.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Dead Rising is among the many CAPCOM series that were put to the side following the disappointing performance on the market of their latest entry, but the Japanese publisher has been showing over the past few months that it is finally willing to bring some of these franchises back to their former glory. In this regard, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster couldn't have brought back Frank West's iconic first adventure in a better way, as exploring Willamette Parkview Mall and killing zombies with all sorts of makeshift weapons has never been so much fun.</p>
<p>While the basic experience feels a little dated, and the visual remaster leaves something to be desired in some ways, the quality-of-life improvements make this remaster-meets-remake a game that is worthy of experiencing both for veterans of the franchise and newcomers. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review.</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is a solid remaster that enhances the original game with some welcome gameplay and quality-of-life improvements that go a long way to make the experience more enjoyable than ever. However, the remaster falters in the visual department, with dull colors that pale in comparison to the vibrant visuals of the original. Still, there's plenty to like in the Deluxe Remaster, as Frank West's journey to Willamette remains as engaging as ever, though the mostly faithful recreation of the original gameplay feels a little dated compared to its sequels.</em></p>

The 2001 Dreamcast game introduced a new brooding antihero in Shadow the Hedgehog, and expanded the <em>Sonic </em>mythos into some dark territory. <em>Sonic 3 </em>isn’t a one-to-one retelling of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, however. After two movies and a TV show, the live-action series has its own established lore, so the third film makes some pretty big changes to the original storyline while still keeping the darker tone and themes of <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>intact. Well, when it’s not doing the corny dance breaks and cheesy one-liners, at least. If you’ve never played <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, you might be curious just what was changed for the big screen, so here are a few of the major differences between <em>Sonic 3 </em>and <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. Spoilers ahead!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-recommend-id="image://65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rouge flies through the White Space holding a Chaos Emerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rouge flies through the White Space holding a Chaos Emerald." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-recommend-id="image://65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rouge flies through the White Space holding a Chaos Emerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The most glaring difference between <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>and <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>is the absence of Rouge the Bat. The Dreamcast game had two dueling stories: Hero and Dark. The Hero story followed Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles as they attempted to thwart Eggman’s latest plan to rule the world, while the Dark side followed Eggman’s story alongside those of two new companions: the Ultimate Lifeform Shadow the Hedgehog, and a double agent government spy named Rouge the Bat. Rouge has yet to appear in the live-action universe, but she acts as Knuckles’ rival and Shadow’s teammate in the video game continuity. Elements of her story in <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>still exist in <em>Sonic 3</em>, with the heist segment in the second act an obvious stand-in for her level Security Hall, but there’s no sign of the treasure hunter in the movie itself.</p><p>There have been reports that Paramount plans to give Shadow his own spin-off, and since Rouge didn’t show up in the movie based on her debut game, this would be the most logical place for her to appear next.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-recommend-id="image://5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Doom looms over Shadow as he clutches his head in pain." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Doom looms over Shadow as he clutches his head in pain." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-recommend-id="image://5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Doom looms over Shadow as he clutches his head in pain." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The <em>Sonic </em>movies have established that the speedy anthropomorphic animals saving the world are aliens from other planets. It was eventually revealed in <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em> that Shadow has some alien DNA in him in the games, but he was initially presented as a creation made by humans when he debuted in <em>Sonic Adventure 2. Sonic 3</em> fully commits to the alien backstory, revealing that he was found 50 years before the events of the film when a mysterious meteor landed on Earth. The GUN forces who investigated found Shadow inside and began running experiments on him in a hidden facility on Earth, rather than the Space Colony Ark orbiting the planet seen in the games.</p><p>Shadow’s backstory in the games is a bit more complicated, to the point where I’m not surprised they simplified it for the film’s shorter run time. In <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Shadow is revealed as an invention by Gerald Robotnik, Eggman’s grandfather. The hedgehog was meant to be the Ultimate Lifeform, capable of unlocking the key to immortality. In <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>, it’s revealed that, in desperation, Gerald made a deal with an alien despot called Black Doom, who used his own DNA to help the professor finalize Shadow’s creation. In return for Black Doom’s help, Shadow would assist the Black Arms alien invaders take over the world. Shadow doesn’t know where he came from in <em>Sonic 3</em>, so it’s still possible that the Black Arms will play a role in a future film as his origins are revealed, but Gerald Robotnik didn’t create him in this continuity; he merely led the project that researched him after he fell to Earth. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-recommend-id="image://9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a collapsed Maria." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a collapsed Maria." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-recommend-id="image://9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a collapsed Maria." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the games, Gerald was deeply invested in finding the key to immortality because his granddaughter, Maria Robotnik, had a terminal illness called Neuro-Immune Deficiency Syndrome. This led to the creation of Shadow and his prototype called the Biolizard, immortal creatures made with the hope that they could help facilitate similar breakthroughs for humanity. However, Maria seems to be a perfectly healthy kid in <em>Sonic 3</em>. I suppose, since Gerald isn’t creating Shadow in this timeline, there was no need to include her sickness as a motivator for his research. The sibling-like relationship between Maria and Shadow still hits many of the same notes, however. In both continuities, the two become inseparable friends that bond even as Shadow is being subject to experiments every day. Eventually, Maria’s death at the hands of GUN agents leads Shadow to try to destroy the world in both the games and the movies, but she lived her life as a healthy young girl in the films.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-recommend-id="image://b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maria prepares to send Shadow to Earth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maria prepares to send Shadow to Earth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-recommend-id="image://b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maria prepares to send Shadow to Earth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though Maria <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374">does reach a tragic end</a></span> in <em>Sonic 3</em>, her death is slightly different than it is in the source material. In most versions of the story, whether that be the games, anime, or comics, Maria is shot by GUN agents. In the live-action universe, Maria is nearly shot as she and Shadow attempt to make their escape after GUN shuts down the project and puts Shadow into stasis. However, the GUN agent that had her in his sights is interrupted by Commander Walters, who gets into a scrap with the shooter, leading to a shot being fired into a tank containing deposits of Shadow’s Chaos energy, setting off an explosion that results in Maria’s death. I imagine Paramount didn’t want to put a scene of a child being shot by the military in its widely distributed feature film, though elements of the original scene remain, as her death was still caused by GUN shutting down the project and attempting to eliminate loose ends.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-recommend-id="image://8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gerald is shown wearing a white lab coat and red shirt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gerald is shown wearing a white lab coat and red shirt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-recommend-id="image://8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gerald is shown wearing a white lab coat and red shirt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Jim Carrey plays two Robotniks in <em>Sonic 3</em>. The eccentric mad scientist Ivo “Eggman” Robotnik who he’s played in every movie thus far, and his grandfather Gerald Robotnik. In <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Gerald was long dead and had brainwashed Shadow to carry out his revenge-fueled plan to destroy the world in his absence. The movie version of Gerald is still alive, and able to manipulate Shadow and his grandson into doing his bidding. Eggman has gone his whole life without family, so he’s more than happy to help out his grandfather to make up for lost time, and Shadow’s grief for Maria is so strong, he’ll do anything if he’s told it will be in her honor.</p><p>Gerald dies at the end of the movie, though it’s in a much different way than he dies in the games. Eggman kills Gerald in a frankly anticlimactic fight inside the Eclipse Cannon space station, where in the games he’s killed by a firing squad after his descent into madness.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ea11b66ea6e95e76b7aa9b1dec706a42" data-recommend-id="image://ea11b66ea6e95e76b7aa9b1dec706a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1041" data-height="586" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Amy approaches Shadow as he looks down at Earth from the Ark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amy approaches Shadow as he looks down at Earth from the Ark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea11b66ea6e95e76b7aa9b1dec706a42" data-recommend-id="image://ea11b66ea6e95e76b7aa9b1dec706a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1041" data-height="586" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Amy approaches Shadow as he looks down at Earth from the Ark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rouge is one big character who doesn’t appear in the film’s main story, but there’s another key player who doesn’t show up when they do in the games: Amy Rose. The pink hammer-wielding hedgehog shows up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285">in the post-credits scene</a></span>, but in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, she tagged along with Sonic’s crew, and was eventually the person who reminded Shadow of his true memories of Maria, rather than the distorted ones Gerald gave him to carry on his revenge plot. Since Amy’s not around and Shadow isn’t brainwashed, his turn from villain to hero comes from a different source: Sonic. After the two enter their super forms and beat each other senseless, Sonic comes to his senses and has a heart-to-heart with his rival about the futile nature of revenge, eventually reminding Shadow that even if Maria is gone, his love for her still lives on, leading to the sick as hell team-up as the hedgehogs save the day.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-recommend-id="image://9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2068" data-height="1159" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow looks up at a broken Moon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow looks up at a broken Moon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-recommend-id="image://9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2068" data-height="1159" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow looks up at a broken Moon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Eggman and Shadow use the Eclipse Cannon, a superweapon developed by Gerald Robotnik, to destroy part of the moon. This is meant as a show of power to make the people of Earth surrender to Eggman’s rule. In <em>Sonic 3</em>, however, our heroes divert its aim away from Earth, so instead of a direct hit on the moon, the cannon slices off the southern end. It looks like the world is just gonna let it stay that way, too, as you can see the severed section hanging out in the moon’s orbit in the post-credits scene.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-recommend-id="image://bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Biolizard thrashes in anger." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Biolizard thrashes in anger." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-recommend-id="image://bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Biolizard thrashes in anger." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> In the final few minutes of the film, Sonic and Shadow team up, use the Master Emerald to take on their super forms, and save the world from cataclysmic destruction. This also occurs in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, but while the movies have the two face an army of Gerald’s robots, the speedy hedgehogs fight something else as a final boss in the game. As a last-ditch effort to destroy the world, The Biolizard, the prototype for the Ultimate Lifeform, fuses with the Space Colony Ark and attempts to keep it on a collision course toward the planet. The Biolizard isn’t mentioned in the movie and seemingly doesn’t exist in the film universe, so while the final battle still has most of the elements that matter, our heroes are squarely focused on fighting Gerald in the climax. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-recommend-id="image://f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eggman touches one of Sonic's quills to his tongue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eggman touches one of Sonic's quills to his tongue." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-recommend-id="image://f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eggman touches one of Sonic's quills to his tongue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>After our heroes divert the Eclipse Cannon from Earth, the facility becomes unstable and self-destructs. To prevent the explosion from contaminating Earth’s atmosphere, Eggman and Shadow sacrifice themselves to move it away from the planet. Shadow was presumed dead at the end of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, but was revealed to have survived in <em>Sonic Heroes</em>. Eggman, meanwhile, survives the events of the Dreamcast game and lives to bother Sonic and his friends another day. If Carrey’s version of the series villain is well and truly dead (there’s no tease of his survival like there was at the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>), then that’ll be one of the biggest deviations <em>Sonic 3 </em>makes from the source material.</p><p>It’s still unclear how the movies will go on without him, but given the sendoff the character got, it would feel cheap to bring him back. We’ll know more when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-sequel-confirmed-paramount-2027-sega-release-1851725410&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-sequel-confirmed-paramount-2027-sega-release-1851725410"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4 </em>premieres in 2027</a></span>. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the smooth always comes with the rough, and the past year really has been a rocky one for the things we love and the people who make them.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From layoffs and studio closures to costly consoles, underwhelming adaptations and struggling sequels, these are the biggest disappointments in 2024. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gaming Industry Layoffs and Closures</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The games industry found itself facing a crisis in 2023 as many publishers and studios, both large and small, made scores of staff redundant in an effort to cut costs. But the pains of that year would be repeated in 2024, which has seen an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated 14,600 job losses</a> - a 39% increase year-on-year. The cuts have seen thousands of talented studio staff thrown into the most difficult job market the games industry has ever seen, with developers attempting to find new roles in a landscape where companies are slimming down. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the major companies cutting staff loose have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-lays-off-more-league-of-legends-developers-while-promising-to-increase-team-size">Riot</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">Microsoft</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">Bungie</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unity-software-laying-off-25-percent-of-staff-amid-company-reset">Unity</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-announces-layoffs-while-canceling-multiple-in-development-projects">TakeTwo Interactive</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">EA</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close">PlayStation</a>. Such businesses have reduced their staff numbers for a variety of reasons and factors, be that rising development costs, shifting player habits in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, and the global impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Whatever the reasons, remaining staff at these publishers and studios must continue to work in uncertain times without the aid of their former colleagues. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is if their studio still exists. Adding to the dismal picture are several studio closures. Perhaps the most prominent among them is Arkane Austin, Bethesda’s immersive sim specialist responsible for the acclaimed Prey. Sadly its most recent release, Redfall, was a critical and commercial bomb – a situation that seemingly sealed its fate. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Arkane Austin was shuttered by parent company Microsoft, along with Alpha Dog Games, Roundhouse Games, and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a>.

A PvP hero shooter, its long and costly development meant it arrived long after the genre had peaked in popularity. But, despite being developed by many FPS veterans hailing from the likes of Bungie and Activision, what could have been PlayStation’s next big multiplayer phenomenon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">struggled to stand out from the likes of Overwatch and Apex Legends</a> thanks to its lacklustre character kits and standard fare objective design. From the outside Concord simply looked like another typical hero shooter, which meant few wanted to see what was going on inside. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not an exaggeration to say that almost no one turned up for its August release – it achieved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-shooter-concord-debuts-to-a-tragic-697-concurrent-players-on-steam">a high of just 697 concurrent players on Steam</a> during its first week. Less than two weeks later, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">Sony pulled Concord from sale</a>, refunded players, and shut the game down. By the end of October, Firewalk Studios was closed for business. It all sadly means Concord is gone without a trace. Well, almost – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-ill-fated-concord-animation-shows-potential-of-this-world-and-characters-creator-says">an episode of Amazon’s Secret Level</a> animated series serves as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-secret-level-episode-explained#episode-13-concord">a prequel</a> to the ongoing Concord in-game story that never happened.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A similar, thankfully less tragic story also happened earlier this year with Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. After months of poorly-received marketing, Sucide Squad launched as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">critical </a>and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">commercial bomb</a>. As with Concord, much of Kill The Justice League’s failings were due to chasing trends that players have long since largely tired of – in this case, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2024-is-the-year-live-service-shooter-trends-need-to-die">Destiny-style live-service shooter grind</a>. It didn’t help that Suicide Squad resembled Crystal Dynamics’ ill-fated Avengers game from a few years back, which similarly annoyed players for being a repetitive multiplayer PvE game. In Suicide Squad’s case, it was a shattering fall from grace for a studio that previously made beloved single-player Batman games. Many of us just wanted more of that best-in-class superhero action with a villainous twist, but sadly Warner Bros’ chase of live-service revenue seemingly got in the way. Not that it paid off - an initial lack of sales and dwindling players has contributed to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue">significant revenue decline</a> for the company.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hardware Hiccups</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/ps5-pro-1728648448665.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">PlayStation 5 Pro</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The time-compressing effect of the pandemic years has disguised the fact that, yes, we’re already at the midpoint of the current console generation. Right on cue, Sony delivered its mid-cycle refresh PlayStation 5 Pro, and it’s safe to say that practically <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/polls-ps5-pro-price-reveal">no one was pleased by its $700 price tag</a>. That’s not just down to the cost of living squeezing everyone’s wallets – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ps5-pro-reveal-full-technical-presentation">Mark Cerny’s presentation</a> that apparently showcased the console’s ability to render The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered so much better than the base console was basically the “They’re the same picture” meme from The Office in action. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s definitely time for the PS5 Pro to prove why it costs $200 more than the regular PS5, the initial results have been pretty disappointing. Rather than eliminate the need to decide between quality and performance modes, developers have added even more options to Pro-patched games, with confusing names such as ‘Fidelity Pro’ and ‘Versatility’. Remember when you just plugged in a console and it worked? Halcyon days. Plus, all the Pro’s extra power can’t even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps5-pro-can-you-see-the-difference">make Bloodborne look any better</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least Sony fans got a console, though. After months of rumours that Nintendo was due to announce its successor to the Switch, the company announced a brand new piece of hardware: an alarm clock. Yes, the Alarmo is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-switch-2-nintendo-just-released-a-100-interactive-alarm-clock-called-alarmo">a $100 clock with game-themed alarms</a> and a motion sensor that can detect when you’ve got out of bed. It’s hardly the Switch 2 we were hoping for. And even when it comes to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-latest-in-long-line-of-weird-nintendo-hardware-some-failed-hard">Nintendo’s history of weird hardware</a>, Alarmo is far from the most interesting or bizarre. A true disappointment from the house of Mario.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Unreliable Reliables</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/acolyte-ep-4-blogroll-1718749369038.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Star Wars: The Acolyte</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Over in the realm of television, things have largely been bright thanks to the likes of Arcane, Shogun, and Fallout. But 2024 also saw some traditionally reliable shows struggle to maintain their quality. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-bear-season-3-review">Season 3 of The Bear certainly wasn’t bad</a> – it once again provided some solid character drama and beautifully-shot kitchen nightmares. But, compared to the incredible highs of the first two seasons, this third chapter fell significantly short. Its frustratingly slow pace clashed with the lightning speed of previous years, and the focus being almost entirely on Carmy’s inner crisis forced valuable characters like Sydney into the sidelines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, we saw this year’s Star Wars project struggle to hit the highs of The Mandalorian and Andor. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-acolyte-season-1-review-disney-plus">The Acolyte</a> was built on a fascinating premise that delved into the galaxy’s past, exploring the late High Republic era. It was packed with Jedi and featured one of the coolest lightsaber battles in the entire franchise, but even that couldn’t save the series from its sloppy and often infuriating storytelling. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Acolyte’s saving grace could have been Manny Jacinto’s Sith lord The Stranger, who sports one of the most menacing helmets in all of Star Wars. But while deeper exploration of his character could have resulted in a much-improved season two, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-acolyte-wont-be-renewed-for-a-second-season-on-disney-plus">we’ll never get to see that</a> thanks to Disney axing the show entirely. This isn’t just a Disney problem – Netflix has also continued its habit of cancelling shows after barely giving them a chance to realise their full potential. 2024’s Netflix cull included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jeff-goldblum-netflix-series-kaos-cancelled-after-one-season">Kaos</a> and Dead Boy Detectives, which join last year’s Lockwood &amp; Co in the “cancelled after a single season” club. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Awful Adaptations</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/30/yakuzadragon-thumb-1727718807880.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Like a Dragon: Yakuza</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s Fallout was a stellar exercise of how to adapt a video game for television, with Amazon’s wasteland show being among our TV highlights of 2024. But it seems like Fallout’s success isn’t a guaranteed indicator that every Amazon video game show will be fantastic, as proven by the dreadful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video">Like a Dragon: Yakuza show</a> that landed on the service several months later. Featuring no karaoke, far too little Majima, and far too much melodrama, Like a Dragon totally failed to capture the stark contrast between serious and silly that the Yakuza games thrive on.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t just Japanese RPGs that were treated poorly for TV this year, though. Famed Japanese manga Uzumaki also received its long-awaited animated adaptation, and the results <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uzumaki-full-series-review-adult-swim">couldn’t have gone any worse</a>. The four-part Adult Swim show turned Junji Ito’s monochrome horror into a rushed mess that sprinted to the finale, undermining plot points, character arcs, and scares on the way. The biggest disappointment, though, was the severe drop in animation quality following a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uzumaki-review-adult-swim">visually rich episode one</a>. Uzumaki transformed from beautifully chilling into a low-budget nightmare in the space of a week – it was a rug-pull scarier than anything Junji Ito could write.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Box Office Bombs</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/15/borderlands-movie-criticism-uwe-boll-1723718855132.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Borderlands</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, terrible adaptations weren’t limited to the small screen. One of the biggest box office bombs of the year came in the form of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-kevin-hart-jack-black">Borderlands</a>. Gearbox’s wacky looter shooter was transformed into a hideously miscast Guardians of the Galaxy rip-off for its live-action big screen adventure. Many of the games’ best-know qualities, such as its sweary sense of humour and love of turning humans into piles of goopy gore, were toned down to the point of vanishing completely. The result was bland, recycled MCU-ish ideas geared toward mass marketability. In short: a complete disaster. Unsurprisingly it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disastrous-borderlands-movie-ends-its-theater-run-with-just-31-million">died an unceremonious death</a> when it launched in cinemas – with Lionsgate’s CEO saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lionsgate-ceo-on-borderlands-movie-nearly-everything-that-could-go-wrong-did-go-wrong">“nearly everything that could go wrong did go wrong.”</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s arguable that an FPS like Borderlands was never going to survive the transition to cinema. A sequel to the most profitable comic book movie of all time and the first R-rated film to pass a billion-dollars at the box office, though? Surely a second Joker was going to be an easy win. Not so much. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/joker-folie-deux-review-joaquin-phoenix-lady-gaga-todd-phillips">Joker: Folie à Deux turned out to be a miserably dull follow-up</a>, with director Todd Phillips undoing almost all the good he established in the first film. When not even Lady Gaga can save your kinda-sorta musical from its snoozefest courtroom drama scenes, you know you’re in trouble. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the classic-mould movie buff, though, almost certainly the biggest disappointment of the year is Megalopolis. The years-in-the-making, self-financed magnum-opus from The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola was (perhaps, if we’re honest, somewhat predictably) an indulgent catastrophe. Some people have seen method in the madness (including our own reviewer, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/megalopolis-review-francis-ford-coppola-adam-driver">gave it a 9/10</a>) but for many this opulent fable set in a futuristic, Rome-like New York City was a bloated, pretentious, dull mess. Quite how the creator of the quintessential Mafia movie got here may prove to be one of the universe’s greatest mysteries.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From studio closures to box office catastrophes, 2024 has had some real low points. It’s hard to find a silver lining in some of them, and we continue to hope that the industries that make our favourite things will turn a better corner in 2025. But in other instances it’s the downs that make the ups shine brightly – and you can find many of those bright stars in our roundup of the best reviewed games of 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Somehow, over 25 years of Halo content has leaked online, showing off some of the classic designs of the game before it was even released. The leaked content seems to have originated from a <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-co-developer-certain-affinity-was-acquired-by-keywords/">Halo Studios</a> collaboration<a href="https://x.com/DogbrainLudus/status/1872256501982839002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1872256501982839002%7Ctwgr%5Ec6b6f375408eaad6b9e74c85bc73019a4ea93aac%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Fover-25-years-of-classic-halo-content-has-leaked-online%2F"> with modders</a> who are fans of the franchise, where they aimed to restore cut content from previous Halo titles. This included the Halo 2 E3 2003 demo, which was released last month. The demo that was showcased at E3 2003 is available on the Steam Workshop after being added on November 9 as a mod for Halo: The Master Chief Collection.</p>
<p>The mod team has been working alongside Halo Studios since last summer to restore content from the games that never made it to the final cut. This includes multiplayer maps that were specifically designed for the PC port of Halo: Combat Evolved.</p>
<p>There is a lot of content to sift through, and Halo fans are going to have a field day with the content that is now available, thanks to the modders from Digsite. One of the most significant pieces of Halo content that has resurged, thanks to their efforts, is the Macworld demo from 1999. It was supposedly meant to be restored for Halo: The Master Chief Collection, but that didn't happen. This demo shows that Halo was originally meant to be a third-person exclusive title for Mac, but it eventually shifted perspectives and ended up going to Xbox instead.</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that the content that has leaked online is legitimate, but a former member of Digsite said that none of the current or former members of the team are responsible. There is over 100 GB of content for Halo fans to explore, even though it's uncertain at the moment who even leaked the content in the first place, as it's been confirmed that no one from Digsite would do so.</p>
<p>Additionally, a significant amount of members from the Digsite team have quit the project as there has been a dispute over the team doing the work for free and that they haven't been given sufficient pay or resources to continue working on such a hefty project.</p>
<p>Lots of <a href="https://x.com/BajatomicBlast/status/1872350986280558818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1872350986280558818%7Ctwgr%5E432819c51648dcc4b0d99ffec9d1c81373e28c4c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Fover-25-years-of-classic-halo-content-has-leaked-online%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments</a> from the team at Digsite can be found on social media, especially X. They have spoken about how the Halo E3 demo was reportedly more important than anything else they worked on, but they are still not getting paid for their efforts.</p>

                <p>It's been hard to keep up with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-vr-games/2900-5339/">VR games</a> in 2024, and that's a good thing. The Batman Arkham series got a great new entry, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/batman-arkham-shadow-review-i-am-batman/1900-6418308/">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a>, exclusively on Meta Quest 3. Metro Awakening introduced itself as a VR rendition that acts as a prequel to the Metro series, while Skydance's Behemoth is betting on dark fantasy, building upon the ideas of the underrated The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners games. The psychedelic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/thumper-review/1900-6416533/">Thumper</a> got a spiritual successor with Thrasher, and there's even been a quality remake of an old VR game, Arizona Sunshine, after a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arizona-sunshine-2-review-the-walking-shred/1900-6418163/">sequel</a> in 2023.</p><p>From the outside, VR seems to be going through a pivotal period. If you look at 2023, the space was already gearing up for this momentum with Asgard's Wrath 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-nexus-successfully-translates-acs-earliest-adventures-into-first-person/1100-6518430/">Assassin's Creed Nexus</a>, and the VR version of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/">Resident Evil 4 remake</a> releasing in the latter half of the year. But these are all big bets considering that the space remains a niche market; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66980483" rel="nofollow ">motion sickness</a> continues to be one of multiple issues. Though some games have been better at offering more accessibility options, the platform is far from suitable for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/virtual-reality-accessibility-disabilities/" rel="nofollow ">disabled players</a>.</p><p>While game releases have been a highlight, the same can't be said for the companies behind them and the headsets themselves. Sony reportedly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-pauses-playstation-vr2-production-to-clear-backlog-of-unsold-units" rel="nofollow ">paused production</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vr-2-review-running-in-place/1100-6511528/">PSVR 2</a> in March to clear a surplus backlog of units, and PlayStation London Studio (which was behind the likes of Blood &amp; Truth and PlayStation VR Worlds) was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24084509/playstation-layoff-900-workers-feb-2024" rel="nofollow ">shut down</a> in May. Meanwhile, Meta <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/meta-laying-off-workers-within-reality-labs-division" rel="nofollow ">laid off</a> workers within the Reality Labs division; shut down <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216240/meta-ready-at-dawn-echo-vr-shutdown" rel="nofollow ">multiple games</a> since last year, as well as the studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216240/meta-ready-at-dawn-echo-vr-shutdown" rel="nofollow ">Echo VR</a>, which the company acquired four years ago; canceled plans for an Apple Vision Pro <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/meta-reportedly-cancels-plans-for-high-end-mixed-reality-headset/">competitor</a>; closed down the augmented reality studio <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-will-shut-down-augmented-reality-studio-spark-angering-creators-2024-8" rel="nofollow ">Spark</a>; and put the VR version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on hold <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-san-andreas-meta-vr-cancelled-release-date-gta-6-1851623636" rel="nofollow ">indefinitely</a>.</p><p>It's unclear how long Meta will continue to fund VR game development, which could be a meaningful hit to the industry, given its publishing branch was responsible for games like Among Us VR, Rock Band VR, and Batman: Arkham Shadow. With Sony <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-no-longer-cares-about-the-psvr-2-and-you-shouldnt-either" rel="nofollow ">reportedly</a> cutting back on investment in VR development, with only two first-party titles in the pipeline, it's uncertain whether or not a release calendar like 2024's will happen again, or if we're witnessing a swansong in disguise.</p><p>Aces of Thunder, Hitman: World of Assassination, and Zombie Army VR are only a few games that were delayed to 2025. Throughout 2024, there have been numerous examples of not only delays but generally rough launches. Bulletstorm VR was deemed unplayable until a series of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-vr-gets-hefty-patch-following-broken-launch" rel="nofollow ">patches</a> improved anything from physics to visuals and enemy AI. Two anticipated horror games, Madison VR and Phasmophobia, were <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/horror-madison-vr-release-delay-psvr-2-steamvr/" rel="nofollow ">delayed</a> multiple times. For the latter, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r_4kVzpsYY">reviewers</a> have advised avoiding it until the port quality improves--in a similar fashion to the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvFDiv1FI4">Hitman 3 VR Reloaded</a>.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQvFDiv1FI4">Inverse</a>, developers pointed out some of the issues VR developers face: engine-compatibility issues with games originally built in certain versions of Unity, the use of reprojection to artificially boost frame rates at the cost of image quality (leading to blurry visuals), and demanding VRC processes (a virtual reality checklist of technical requirements that each game must pass during certification). Even QA testing is more taxing than usual. In interviews with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240413184350/https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/12/26/vomit-and-ginger-candy-inside-the-vr-qa-process" rel="nofollow ">Game Informer</a>, testers mentioned the process is physically demanding, while it can take a while to get used to testing in VR, especially for longer periods of time, with one former developer saying he'd often feel "detached from reality" for the first two weeks at the job.</p><p>Looking ahead, some studios continue to show active investment in the space. In an interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240713051000/https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/04/capcom-keeps-bringing-resident-evil-to-vr-heres-how-and-why" rel="nofollow ">Game Informer</a> about the VR rendition of the Resident Evil 4 remake, producer Masato Kumazawa said that one of the reasons for releasing VR versions of Village and RE4R for free is to help expand the VR market.</p><p>"VR also matches with the Resident Evil franchise really well," director Keisuke Yamakawa said. "I would like VR to get much more popular with the public. Since headsets can still be quite expensive and heavy, I would love for the kits to continue getting lighter and more affordable to make it more [approachable] to the general audience.”</p><p>Headsets are indeed getting lighter, but the cost of entry is still high. The Meta Quest 3 256 GB model costs $499, in contrast to the PSVR 2 at $549 and the Pico 4 Ultra at €600 (around $630). Out of the three, the PSVR 2 isn't wireless, and it originally required a PlayStation 5. Sony launched a PC adapter back in August priced at $59. If you have a decent PC that can run VR games, the catalog is greatly increased, and so is the longevity of the headset as a result. Speaking of which, there are a number of PC-specific headsets out there, such as the Valve Index ($999) and the Vive series (starting at the $600 to $700 price range). But the aforementioned headsets are by far the ones driving the mainstream interest at the moment. (The Apple Vision Pro, starting at $3,499, is undoubtedly not targeted at the average consumer, so I'm not counting it here.)</p><p>There's also market fluctuation to consider. Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro are ceasing sales by the end of 2024. So is the Meta Quest 3 128 GB model, which has already been <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/and-it-s-gone-discontinued-meta-quest-3-model-already-selling-out-online" rel="nofollow ">selling out online</a>. The company hopes to replace these gaps with the Meta Quest 3S, released in October at the price of $299. However, this model has some hardware compromises, such as using the Quest 2's per-eye single-display setup, as opposed to the Quest 3's dual-display setup, resulting in a lower resolution and bulkier lenses.</p><p>In terms of games, the occasional oddities, such as Triangle Strategy presenting its campaign as floating dioramas in mixed reality, continue to surprise. Smaller studios deserve attention, too--The Exit 8, Sushi Ben, and Umurangi Generation VR all stood out in 2024. Genres like rhythm games continue to thrive, with more studios betting on adaptations, like Metal: Hellsinger VR and Spin Rhythm this year, and existing games receiving ongoing updates.</p><p>Beat Saber continues to get both free and paid songs, and Synth Riders has a mixed-reality mode on Quest 3. But it's hard to look at the landscape to find that many of the games that fiddled with genre novelties couldn't withstand the passage of time. Rock Band VR, Audica, and Dance Central<em>,</em> all Harmonix joints, haven't had official support for years. Sure, Just Dance VR was released back in October, but new games feel more like fleeting replacements rather than new entries in emerging subgenres.</p><p>With 2025 around the corner, the future is uncertain. Meta seems more invested in the so-called metaverse aspect of the headset, pushing an ecosystem that's more suitable for meetings and networking, with avatars for jumping on "got a minute?" calls or built-in calendar apps that can be synced with Google and Outlook, or using your headset during <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/travel-mode-lufthansa-airplane-flight-entertainment/?srsltid=AfmBOorEId3uWbQMgy9HTuXsubyv_1J4D77vOkHTrxemyUj3wAqpQUoC" rel="nofollow ">flights</a> or <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-quest-v71-update-horizon-os-refresh-calendar-remote-desktop/" rel="nofollow ">train rides</a>, rather than video-game experiences.</p><p>Community efforts like Flat2VR continue to innovate by adding VR support to a plethora of games. The modding team started with highlights like the Half-Life 2: VR mod, and has since <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/flat2vr-studios-announcement/" rel="nofollow ">formed a studio</a> working on licensed adaptations in an official capacity, such as Trombone Champ: Unflattened. The modding scene, particularly on PC, continues to be a standout. You can now play Halo: Combat Evolved in VR with full motion controls, while other people have been working tirelessly to achieve the opposite, such as a flat version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/half-life-alyx-review-catch-these-hands/1900-6417437/">Half-Life: Alyx</a>.</p><p>VR might still have a niche audience, but the interest in its future isn't fading. Games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gorilla-tag/">Gorilla Tag</a> have amassed over 12 million lifetime players and maintain a million daily active users, with the game's interest being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-gorilla-tag-became-a-generational-obsession-and-conquered-vr/1100-6526437/">spearheaded by Gen Alpha kids</a>. We can only hope that future development focuses more on video games, for both adult and younger demographics, rather than digitizing even more daily-life aspects, especially with work as the focus. As the PSVR 2 and Meta Quest 3 get closer to two years in their life cycles, I hope more studios can look back at 2024 as a bar to surpass instead of a ceiling that will forever be out of reach.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

The 2024 release calendar was spotty at best, and even some of the more notable games that did come to the handheld hybrid, of which there were strikingly few, struggled to run on the nearly eight-year-old tech. Eight years, incidentally, is almost the stretch of time between the launch of the SNES and the PlayStation 2. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,195670,196698" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Nintendo has found a way to keep the Switch alive—just barely—heading into 2025, but this year mostly felt like being in line at the DMV, waiting for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-reveal-release-date-reddit-1851725408&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-reveal-release-date-reddit-1851725408">glimpse of the Switch 2</a></span> only for the office to close just before you got called to the front desk. While everyone else was focused on the future, Nintendo was stubbornly attached to the Switch’s present, going so far as to wage an all-out war on Switch emulation enthusiasts and ROM pirates alike to stop the platform from completely transforming into a hacker’s paradise.</p><p> 2024 was most notable for what we didn’t see or get than for any actual moves or announcements Nintendo made. No news about the Switch 2, other than it will be revealed in the next few months and will be backwards compatible with the existing one. No major <em>Mario</em> or <em>Zelda</em> game; instead we got two great but flawed smaller spin-offs from those franchises. No major changes to the Switch itself, as best evidenced by how much of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-eshop-switch-slop-clones-unpacking-scam-ai-art-1851722248&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-eshop-switch-slop-clones-unpacking-scam-ai-art-1851722248">a laggy slopfest the eShop still is</a></span>.

It was also a good year to continue exploring in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span> which, almost two years later, is still the system’s most ambitious and sprawling achievement. Anyone getting a Switch for the first time this holiday season ahead of the Switch 2 announcement might elicit pity, if not for the fact that Nintendo’s current console still has one of the best catalogs ever assembled in the history of gaming. </p><h2 id="h74928"><a id=""></a>The Hardware</h2><p>What’s left to say about the Nintendo Switch? The promise it offers of gaming on the go or on a big display is as compelling as ever, though its ability to truly deliver a smooth and seamless gaming experience has eroded  with time. The difference between how even mid-range to smaller games perform on Switch versus other platforms like PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC has only continued to grow. Framerate hiccups, visual detail, and loading times have all gotten worse, while rival portables like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Deck</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/px7r53p0uhgq7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/px7r53p0uhgq7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asus Rog Ally</a></span> offer fewer tradeoffs at a slightly higher price, at least when it comes to third-party ports and indie releases. </p><figure id="" data-id="83d3fbca6fe9591536240ef0931d01c1" data-recommend-id="image://83d3fbca6fe9591536240ef0931d01c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1003" data-height="564" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An alarm clock sits on a table.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And whither the Switch 2? Nintendo’s much-speculated-about successor has yet to be revealed but, if an ongoing torrent of alleged leaks are to be taken seriously, appears to be a more straightforward upgrade to the existing hardware than Nintendo’s done in quite some time. Whatever gimmicks it may offer, like magnetized Joy-Con that stick to the side of the screen rather than sliding on, don’t seem to be central to the pitch of the new console. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048">It might even be called the Nintendo Switch 2</a></span>.</p><p>I’m not supposed to be spending this section on the state of the current Switch writing about the future one, but it’s a more accurate depiction of what most of 2024 has felt like for current Switch owners: pinning for what’s behind the red curtain as we growing increasingly impatient and frustrated with what’s already in our hands. As for things Nintendo actually did announce this year, there was a clock. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175">It’s called Alarmo</a></span> and it uses motion sensors to serenade users with video game music. Reviewers got their hands on it early but the actual thing won’t ship until early 2025. Fans did get a gold, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/atdzz1ts5hjt2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/atdzz1ts5hjt2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zelda-themed Switch Lite</a></span> this year. It’s probably the best-looking special edition one yet. </p><h2 id="h74929"><a id=""></a>The Software</h2><p>Although the Switch hardware is hanging on by the skin of its teeth, the UI, interface, and general feel of actually navigating the home screen, eShop, and app-only features has grown increasingly grim. It’s sluggish, poorly optimized, and messy. The sleekness of the central row of tiles belies a stark lack of options when it comes to customization or getting any kind of meaningful information about your system, games, or the wider Nintendo ecosystem at a quick glance. </p><p>The eShop is a special point of pain. I quietly sigh every time I have to open the store to go and buy a game, check what’s on sale, or try to see what just came out. It feels like it takes a minor marathon for the store to boot up, and then even longer for the actual parts of it to individually load. Finally getting into the shop is just the start of the headaches, with shovelware and cheap rip-offs of famous games crammed throughout the catalog as you scroll. It’s not great, and it doesn’t help that Nintendo has seemed very unresponsive to the legitimate issues with it. It’s an ominous sign for how the digital purchasing experience may or may not end up changing when it comes to the Switch 2.</p><figure id="" data-id="2a652cf54674939b3eac957f64b47040" data-recommend-id="image://2a652cf54674939b3eac957f64b47040" data-format="png" data-width="859" data-height="631" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows eShop scams.

An eclectic batch of retro games joined the rest of the catalog as well, from <em>Super R-Type </em>on SNES to <em>Vectorman</em> on Sega Genesis. Xbox Game Studios brought over a bunch of games like<em> Killer Instinct</em> and <em>Perfect Dark</em>. And the original Game Boy library was inundated with<em> Mega Man</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> games.</p><figure id="" data-id="79dcf79bd120dd1b0c388ba3da9cb6ec" data-recommend-id="image://79dcf79bd120dd1b0c388ba3da9cb6ec" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Samus fights a giant alien.

A big appeal of the Expansion Pack was access to new DLCs like the additional <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>courses, but as Nintendo first-party releases have stalled and its online multiplayer games get quickly abandoned, that particular perk has languished. It’s also still a major blow to Nintendo’s retro offerings that none of the games can be purchased separately as Sony now allows with its PlayStation Classics. It’s 2024 and fans still have to pay $50 a year to rent <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time </em>running on a Nintendo 64 emulator.</p><p>However, the biggest addition to Switch Online this year wasn’t a game at all. It was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-reveal-date-n64-mini-ocarina-remake-1851686263&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-reveal-date-n64-mini-ocarina-remake-1851686263">a Nintendo Music streaming service</a></span> that lets fans play game soundtracks from their phones, like <em>Donkey Kong Country 2</em>'s enigmatic Bramble Blast and the chiptune title music for the original <em>Metroid</em> on the NES. If only fans could also buy that music and download it DRM-free. Additionally, Nintendo used Switch Online to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142">launch a playtest</a></span> for a secret project that seems like a mashup of an MMO and <em>Minecraft</em>. The service has also been used to offer week-long free trials of various eShop games like<em> Cursed Golf </em>and <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. Switch Online is more valuable than ever, but still lacks the one thing its competitors have going for it: access to a Netflix-like library of new games. </p><h2 id="h74931"><a id=""></a>The Games</h2><p>Nintendo is masterful when it comes to making an off year feel like it’s still full of big games. The Switch’s 2024 calendar was a mix of remakes and smaller spin-offs buoyed by a good year for indie games. The first half of the year ramped up with <em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong</em>, <em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em>, and <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>. It then brought things home with<em> The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="4e09cd6f6b657310be9c0ee6579731c0" data-recommend-id="image://4e09cd6f6b657310be9c0ee6579731c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="829" data-height="466" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario and a Koopa talk to a dragon.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The quantity was there in 2024 for sure, but it definitely felt like a second-string year while Nintendo rested its starters. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> experimented with really neat and novel ideas but fell just short of greatness. <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership </em>was a great RPG-lite sequel that didn’t quite manage to truly transform the series the way other Switch games have for their respective franchises. The best game Nintendo put on the Switch in 2024 was arguably <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, a remake of a two-decade-old GameCube game that, in another universe, would have come to the platform without the HD upgrade simply the via Switch Online back catalog. </p><p>Fortunately, the Switch also had another banner year for indie releases to fill in the gaps. Some of 2024's top games—<em>Balatro</em>, <em>1000xResist</em>,<em> Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>,<em> Animal Well</em>,<em> Arco</em>,<em> Botany Manor</em>, <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>, and <em>Neva</em>—all arrived in a timely manner, even if their ports to other consoles were delayed. Microsoft’s multiplatform push also saw the Switch get <em>Pentiment</em>, the excellent Renaissance-era murder mystery RPG, while some third-party GOTY contenders like <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> and <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> were present day-and-date. </p><p>The Switch’s 2024 library didn’t reach the same heights as it has in past years, but there was still plenty to play, an incredible feat for a console that should have been replaced long ago. And there’s still more coming. Ports of<em> Donkey Kong Country Returns</em> and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>arrive early in 2025. <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, announced ages ago, is also still set to come to the platform, as will <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, the next game in the hit franchise after an unprecedented year off from new Pokémon games. Nintendo is clearly saving its best for the launch of the Switch 2. In that context, a quiet year for the current Switch was still way better than it had any right to be. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
