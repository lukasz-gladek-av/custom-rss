			<p>Battlefield 6's unique destruction mechanics are not possible on a generic engine like Unreal Engine 5, but this is only one reason why the series will hardly leave the Frostbite Engine behind.</p>



<p>Speaking with Spanish publication <a href="https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/battlefield-2025/noticias/que-hacemos-no-posible-motor-generico-padres-battlefield-6-dicen-no-a-hacer-maletas-seguir-moda-industria">3DJuegos</a>, Senior Producer David Sirland commented on the possibility of the series ever switching to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine</a>, saying that the destruction mechanics seen in Battlefield 6 are not possible on a generic engine, as the Frostbite Engine is tailor-made for the new entry in the series and its features as much as the studio is tailoring the game itself for the engine. Achieving similar results on a generic game engine, pushing it to the limit, is achievable, Sirland added, but the developers are specialists with the engine, and he thinks this shows in the game. The Frostbite Engine being tailor-made for Battlefield 6 and the game itself being tailored for the engine isn't the only reason why the franchise is unlikely to leave its current engine behind, as the development studios are used to Frostbite and have engineers knowledgeable about the engine, which allows them to work in harmony, according to Producer Alexia Christofi, something that would likely require a lot of time to achieve with an engine switch.</p>



<p>Soon enough, players worldwide will be able to get a first, proper taste of Battlefield 6 ahead of its launch this October. The open beta, which is now available for <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/">pre-load</a>, will allow players to test out the game this weekend from August 9 to August 10 and from August 14 to August 17. The open beta includes, for the first weekend, the Iberian Offense, Liberation Peak, and Siege of Cairo maps, and a selection of play modes, including Conquest, Breakthrough, Domination, and King of the Hill.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10. You can tide yourself over while waiting for the open beta to go live by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">first impressions</a> on the game.</p>

<figure><a title="RTA Japan - DK" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c519742fe14b6/rta-japan-dk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Japan's largest speedrunning event, <a href="https://rtain.jp/">RTA</a>, is set to kick off later this week on 9th August, and will see some of the speediest gamers in the biz ploughing through the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cuphead">Cuphead</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier: Automata</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim">Skyrim</a>, all in aid of Doctors Without Borders. We learnt a few months ago that Nintendo games would not be included in the lineup, and now the RTA group has explained why (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japans-biggest-charity-speedrunning-event-wont-have-nintendo-games-because-nintendo-couldnt-help-but-nintendo">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>In a new post shared on the <a href="https://rtain.jp/rtaij/nintendo/">RTA website</a> (and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-owned-titles-excluded-from-japans-biggest-speedrunning-event-after-organizers-were-told-they-had-to-apply-for-permission-for-each-game/">Automaton</a>), the event organisers explain that they were contacted by Nintendo back in June, informing them that "as a legal entity, they would have to ask for permission in advance" if they wanted to feature any Nintendo game in the event. What's more, the Big N apparently stated that all previous instances of Nintendo games being streamed from the event are now considered "unauthorised use".</p>
<p>RTA has long featured Nintendo games in its lineup — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> is a staple, natch — but the Big N's interest this year seems to stem from the event's relatively recent (2020) transition into an official legal entity. The event remains non-profit, with all proceeds going to charity.</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn't necessarily the end of Nintendo's RTA appearances completely — the organisers state that they are working with Nintendo to get game permission for future events — but the proximity to the Summer 2025 event meant that the team couldn't possibly get all permissions through and approved in time.</p>
<p>It's disappointing to hear that RTA speedrunners won't get to take a pop at Mario &amp; co. this year, though it's hardly surprising. Let's not forget that Nintendo has historically been <em>very</em> cagey about which events can and cannot feature its titles. It <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/nintendo-releases-full-statement-after-cancellation-of-smash-world-tour">cancelled the Smash World Tour</a> back in 2022, and we regularly hear reports of streamers and other events that have been similarly hit by the ninjas.</p>
<p>Let's hope the permission-giving goes smoothly for RTA next year.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-drops-playstation-4-support/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-drops-playstation-4-support-due-to-hardware-limitations-and-platform-application-size-increased-pc-system-requirements-confirmed.1263156/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Genshin Impact will drop PlayStation 4 support due to hardware limitations and platform application size, developer HoYoverse confirmed today.</p>



<p>The game's PlayStation 4 support will be phased out gradually, starting with the game's removal from the PlayStation Store on September 10. All those who have already downloaded the game will be able to continue playing until April 8, 2026, when service will officially end. From February 25, however, the experience will be somewhat limited with the removal of all in-game purchases, but everything that's been purchased but not yet claimed can still be obtained until the end of service in early April.</p>



<p>As technical reasons are behind the termination of PlayStation 4 support, it's unsurprising that the system requirements for the PC and mobile versions have increased. Devices below the system requirements will still be able to run the game after the Song of the Welkin Moon update launches, but users playing on devices with specs lower than the minimum may experience performance and stability issues. Still, the <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408846">increased requirements</a> are not particularly high, especially the PC requirements, so most players should have no trouble playing the game even after the Song of the Welkin Moon.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-age-assurance-security-settings-leaks-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-age-assurance-security-settings-leak-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1263150/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Reports of GTA Online adding new age verification measures were recently leaked. Now, a new claim has shown the GTA age assurance settings with preview screens that aren’t live in Grant Theft Auto just yet.</p>



<p>Age verification has gone from being a concept to a full-blown enforcement of the practice. The UK has seen a huge clampdown on certain content—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/uk-age-verification-laws-online-safety-act-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including gaming websites</a>—and it could be spreading to gaming. It was recently claimed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-play-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online was gearing up to add age verification</a> to the game.</p>



<p>A new development shows it’s more than likely happening.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-online-age-assurance-preview-leaks">GTA Online Age Assurance Preview Leaks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What does this mean for the future of GTA? Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Trusted source <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tez2</a> was the one to break the initial age assurance story. Now, the leaker has shared “A preview of age assurance in-game,” but said, “This is not active yet.”</p>



<p>The first screenshot shows a new screen for GTA Online saying: “Verify Age – Please verify your age to access online features.”</p>



<p>Whereas the second screenshot shows ‘Additional Settings,’ which include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Verify Age</li>



<li>Online Access (On/Off)</li>



<li>Store Access (On/Off)</li>



<li>Snapmatic Upload (On/Off)</li>
</ul>



<p>This information should be taken with a pinch of salt as it is a leak. Until Rockstar Games officially announces the introduction of age assurance and verification methods, it’s not absolute. However, Tez2 is rarely wrong, and we’ve already seen the code in the game files.</p>



<p>Plans could always change, so stay tuned.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A preview of age assurance in-game. This is not active yet.
</span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTAOnline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GTAOnline</a></p></article></div>



<p>I think this is only the beginning of age verification across the UK and the rest of the world. Many apps, games, sites, and pieces of content won’t be safe from these new rules and regulations. Will age assurance stop you from enjoying the content you like? Or will you go ahead and do it anyway? We’re keen to hear your thoughts over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Hooray! In fact, it's launching <em>today</em>, which is <a href="https://www.playday.org.uk/">National Playday</a> here in the UK. What are the chances?!</p>
<p>We've been very impressed with what we've seen from <a href="https://www.ludocene.com/">Ludocene</a> thus far; it all looks very nice and swishy, like a fancy Apple-designed Tinder but for finding games to love. Y'know the vibe.</p>
<p>And we're not just saying that because founder Andy Robertson is also behind <a href="https://www.familygamingdatabase.com/home">Family Gaming Database</a>, whose family-friendly ratings you can find in some of our reviews here at Nintendo Life. No, this genuinely seems really cool and useful, actually.</p>
<p>Essentially, what the app does is take your game-related initial search and construct a deck of suitable games around it. But rather than just being a simple filter affair, there's lots of effort been put in here to get the guidance of a bunch of gaming industry professionals. So you can have bespoke decks of games to check out, enhanced by pointers from folk who've proper melted their minds playing stuff.</p>
<p>Here's some more deets about the launch from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What Ludocene does:</strong></p>
<p>Presents a stream of Game cards<br>
You swipe to Love/Discard and build your deck.<br>
We suggest matching games for you to Pin.<br>
Add Expert cards for specific gaming taste.<br>
<strong><br>
Ludocene has been built to solve the challenge of finding what to play when over 1000 games launch every month. It does this not with AI or heavy algorithms but meticulously researched data built over the last five years:</strong></p>
<p>Free and ad-free to use, including all game cards.<br>
All human-researched data, rather than heavy algorithms or AI.<br>
Mobile and Desktop web-app.<br>
Save your runs and suggestions across both.<br>
Supported by a subscription tier (£3.99/month) that grants Discord access, more experts and monthly digest emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing that's got this writer particularly interested in this, even as someone who considers themselves fairly well-read on games, is the idea that you have a sort of game built into the thing itself, with all of the experts to choose from and, as the press release puts it " the ability to create as many game-finding runs as you need." As the sorts of people who sit browsing game stores for absolutely no reason a lot of the time, this sounds like it's threatening us with a good time.</p>
<p>Right, we're off to type "games for when you need coffee really badly" into this thing. Let's see what these boffins come up with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Publisher Nacon and developer Rogue Factor have announced demos across both PC and consoles for upcoming slasher Hell is Us.</p>
<p>Hell is Us - which stars <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-lands-september-release-date-as-well-deus-exs-elias-toufexis">Elias Toufexis, aka Adam Jensen from the Deus Ex series, as the game's protagonist Rémi</a> - is set to release later this year, on 4th September. Ahead of this, the team is releasing a demo across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>The demo will be available on 12th August. So, that's just under one week's time.</p>

Not sure yet what Hell is Us is all about? "If war is the closest we get to hell on earth, it's because Earth harbours the worst of demons: humankind," reads the official blurb. "In an isolated country ravaged by infighting, discover the secrets of your past and deal with the repercussions of a mysterious calamity."

</p><p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sci-fi-action-rpg-hell-is-us-gets-pc-demo-out-today-on-steam">Hell is Us team previously released a demo on PC</a>, which plopped players into the start of the game. At this time, the studio said the demo wasn't going to be available on consoles due to "technical constraints". Those constraints have clearly been resolved for next week's demo.</p>
<p>As for what you can expect from the upcoming demo, it <em>sounds</em> like it will be the same as the earlier PC demo. In a <a href="https://x.com/HellisUsGame/status/1952756941345747256">post on social media</a>, the studio said: "Oh yes, PC is coming back too!" I have emailed Nacon to ask for clarification on what the demo will include.</p>
<p>The team has promised, though, that this version of the demo on PC will be "even better" than the one that came before. "4k can actually run at 60fps now," the Hell is Us studio said. "Isn't that great? We got you."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/HellisUsGame/status/1952848364900692225">subsequent reply</a>, Rogue Factor confirmed that PS5 will also support 60fps.</p>

<p>"The narrative already has me hooked - the human story of a country drowned in war, its people barely surviving, running alongside a supernatural mystery of unknown horrors emerging from the dark - while combat mechanics show excellent promise for when Hell is Us is released," she wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-abandons-maps-and-quest-markers-and-channels-brilliant-immersion-in-return">Eurogamer's Hell is Us Gamescom preview</a>.</p>

            <p>If you're planning to hop into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta later this week, you might have to do some digging around in your PC's settings in order to get in. EA have elected to make enabling secure boot on your hardware mandatory, as part of an effort to limit cheating. </p>
<p>It's not that surprising a move, given the publishers opted to make it a hard requirement for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1517290/view/501699915816108629">earlier this year</a>. EA's not alone either, with the likes of Riot having <a href="https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/22291331362067-Vanguard-Restrictions">already done the same</a> with fellow online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a>. You see, the real war isn't about nations, resources, or petty rulers' personal grievances - it's to ensure you don't get sniped by a Terminator with permanent x-ray vision or auto-aim.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"To play on PC, you must have Secure Boot turned on," the EA Help account announced on the socials last night, "It’s a system setting that’s on by default on most PCs and keeps gameplay fair." Basically, it's being used as an extra measure alongside EA's Javelin anticheat software, stopping your machine from loading up any software not flagged as 'safe' when you start it up.</p>
<p>The company has at least provided both <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/">written</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHFSelMXXX8&amp;t=3s">video</a> instructions to follow if you need to delve into your BIOS settings and either check whether you've got secure boot enabled already, or turn it on.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>PC soldiers: read this before you deploy in the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> Open Beta</p><p>To play on PC, you must have Secure Boot turned on.

<p>As with a lot of anti-cheat related debates, the question is whether the potential elimination of some hacking or other exploitation you might run into in a game that's aiming for fair fights is worth the extra palavaer and publisher-exerted control over what you do with your hardware.</p>
<p>For folks running Windows 10 and 11, it hopefully shouldn't be too much of a practical inconvenience if you follow the instructions, but other setups might be in for a more complicated time.</p>
<p>If you've yet to double-check which modes, maps and changes from previous Battlefield Labs testing you'll be in for if you do jump into the open beta when it opens its doors from August 7th (early access) or August 9th (general), EA's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback">shared all of that info this week</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-have-complete-destruction-says-devs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-won%E2%80%99t-have-%E2%80%9Ccomplete-destruction-%E2%80%9D-says-devs.1263123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Destruction has always been a big selling point in Battlefield. With EA, DICE, and Battlefield Studios as a whole working hard to develop and market Battlefield 6, we know there’s a huge helping of destruction in the game, but you should temper your expectations.</p>



<p>My life changed the day I properly got into Battlefield: Bad Company, being my introduction. I’d only ever known using doors to enter a room, not grabbing a grenade launcher and blowing a gaping crater into the side of a house. Whereas Battlefield 4’s Levelution is still some of the most visually impressive gaming I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-took-huge-inspiration-from-bad-company-2s-destruction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 takes inspiration from Bad Company 2’s destruction</a>, that’s a fact. It’s been confirmed BF6 won’t let you flatten maps, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-dice-wants-interesting-scene-changes-in-battlefield-6">DICE Wants “Interesting Scene Changes” in Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Automated wrecking balls. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GNN</a> (through <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1952869411125100656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>) learned many new details about Battlefield 6 through a special multiplayer event.</p>



<p>The game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-time-to-kill-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time-to-kill system</a> was covered in great detail—an ever-controversial topic in the community. But additional details about the game’s destruction were discussed.</p>



<p>GNN managed to grab an interesting quote on BF6 destruction: “We’re not aiming for complete destruction of entire areas, like turning a battlefield into a parking lot with nothing left. Instead, we aim to create interesting, environmentally stimulating effects through destruction – primarily creating interesting scene changes.”</p>



<p>If you have a village of houses, for example, I think it’s fair to assume you won’t be able to destroy them all until they resemble nothing but rubble. Certain houses might have scripted destruction or limitations—one house will only let you blow holes through the floors and walls, maybe?</p>



<p>Either way, we’ve seen from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-reveal-will-contain-3-hours-of-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer reveal event</a> and other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leak-shows-battle-royale-map-poi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay leaks</a> that Battlefield 6 doesn’t skimp on the level of chaos and anarchy you can inject into every match.</p>



<p>Is it a good thing that you can’t fully destroy entire maps? Or should it have specific maps and modes where this is possible? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. Worst case, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-upgrade-players-build-own-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Portal</a> should have something along these lines.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an interview <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Taiwanese website GNN</a> at the Hong Kong Battlefield 6 reveal event, Development Director Anna Narrevik shared some juicy details about the upcoming first-person shooter game.</p>



<p>The first one is that the game will support bots, automatically adding them to a multiplayer match whenever a server is not full of regular players.</p>



<p><em>The way the game uses AI is that when the server is not full, AI will be added to fill the gap.</em></p>



<p>Of course, players could join at any time to take over from bots. Still, this is a somewhat controversial design choice that is sure to leave at least a few disgruntled fans. At the same time, it's probably for the best, as Battlefield matches need to be filled at all times to feel truly as epic as they are meant to be.</p>



<p>Narrevik also commented on the addition of further classic maps post-launch:</p>



<p><em>It won't be available in today's event, but there will be a Firestorm map in Battlefield 6 in the future . It's a classic map. We'll introduce classic versions or maps based on fan or player requests. Of course, we have so many options, and we want to choose the best possible one to bring back the good old days of playing Battlefield.</em></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Development Director confirmed that fans can expect regular quarterly updates. Additionally, she expressed her preference for the improved tactical destruction as the game's best feature:</p>



<p><em>For me, it's really about tactical destruction, because it can suddenly change the battlefield. For example, if you see a building suddenly collapse, it gives you new ways to play and new opportunities to face the enemy. Not only does it look good, but it also gives you more combat options and more control.</em></p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta officially starts on Saturday, August 9, but early access begins tomorrow. Preload <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already available</a> on all platforms. The game will be released on October 10.</p>

<p>The PS4 version of Genshin Impact will be removed from the PlayStation Store later this year, on 10th September. Then, on 25th February next year, all of the in-game purchases will be removed from both the PlayStation Store and the in-game shop.</p>
<p>"Before Genshin Impact's update discontinuation on PS4, any items purchased from the PlayStation Store but not yet claimed in-game can still be obtained by logging into Genshin Impact on PS4," the team assured.</p>
<p>Service for those playing Genshin Impact on PS4 will then officially end on 8th April, 2026. "Any items purchased from the PlayStation Store but not yet claimed in-game can only be claimed by logging into Genshin Impact on PS5 after this date," the developer said.</p>
<p>HoYoverse noted that those on PS5 will not be impacted by these changes, and the game will "continue to operate normally" on the console, as well as other available platforms. It has advised anyone playing on PS4 to transition over to either PlayStation 5 or other supported platforms. "Your game progress will not be affected," it said.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic%E2%80%99s-tim-sweeney-denies-report-on-%E2%80%98slow%E2%80%99-collaboration-with-disney.1263090/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In February 2024, Disney <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-a-persistent-universe-in-fortnite-based-on-its-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a $1.5 billion investment in Epic Games to create a persistent universe within Fortnite based on its own franchises: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar, and more.</p>



<p>We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-talks-about-disneys-persistent-universe-in-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> a bit about that project from Epic Games Executive Vice President Saxs Persson:</p>



<p><em>Disney wants a persistent place where all things Disney can be there, but they want to be part of an ecosystem we’ve built. We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to flow between a Fortnite experience, a Disney experience, or any experience. We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to be able to flow between a Fortnite experience, a Disney experience, or any experience really.</em></p>



<p>Now, though, the Wall Street Journal has <a href="https://www.tovima.com/wsj/is-it-still-disney-magic-if-its-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a report</a> that cites anonymous sources within Epic who allegedly are disgruntled with the speed of the collaboration. According to the report, the project is codenamed Bulldog, but it is being slowed down by Disney's requirement for signoffs 'from so many divisions' before proceeding. </p>



<p>However, Epic founder and president Tim Sweeney has countered this claim. Posting on X, he set the record straight on the matter:</p>



<p><em>The anonymous quote is BS. The speed of Disney and Epic collaborations like Darth Vader has been awesome and is around 10x the ordinary speed of media company dealings in this business. We even provided a statement to the writer of this article saying so, but they chose not to print it.</em></p>



<p>Sweeney did not, however, appear to counter the report's claim that the Fortnite x Disney project is targeting a Fall 2026 release window 'at the earliest'. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The HoYoverse team has announced that support for Genshin Impact on PS4 is being <strong>shut down</strong> and that the game will receive no further updates after April 8th, 2026. It was stressed that this decision was made due to hardware limitations and ‘platform application size’, and that PlayStation 5 support will continue as normal.</p>



<p>From September 10th, 2025, you won’t be able to search for or download Genshin Impact on PlayStation 4.</p>



<p>This decision garnered immediate backlash from the Genshin Impact fanbase still playing on the platform, which launched way back in 2013.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impactful-decision">Impactful Decision</h2>



<p>In a post on the HoYoLab page, the decision to shut down Genshin Impact on PlayStation 4 was unveiled:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your continued support and love for Genshin Impact on PS4! Due to limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size, we will be discontinuing support and updates for Genshin Impact on PS4 in future versions.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact on PS5 will continue to operate normally and is not affected by the removal and update discontinuation on PS4. Traveler will still be able to enjoy the latest content updates on PS5 and other supported platforms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was then stressed that the removal of Genshin Impact will unravel across three phases on PS4:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game Removal (September 10th, 2025) – You will no longer be able to search for or download Genshin Impact on PS4</li>



<li>In-Game Purchases Delisting (February 25th, 2026) – Store purchases for Genshin Impact will be removed from the in-game shop and the PS Store</li>



<li>End of Update Support (April 8th, 2026) – No more updates will be rolled out across Genshin Impact’s PS4 version</li>
</ul>



<p>The article from the HoYoverse team <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained how users</a> can port their progress to other platforms.</p>



<p>In the comment section under the article, the backlash was fairly instant and aggressive, with users branding the decision ‘disgusting’, ‘the biggest middle finger’, and ‘gross and dumb’.</p>



<p>Let me know in the comments if this move will impact you as a Genshin Impact fan.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-and-saints-row-%E2%80%98at-risk%E2%80%99-of-being-delisted-in-adult-games-debate-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1263084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent weeks, few topics in the gaming space have earned as much attention as the ‘adult games debate’. It was recently revealed that payment processors for certain gaming outlets are cracking down on adult and NSFW games, targeting some of the smuttier titles that sit on storefronts like Steam.</p>



<p>It has brought about the rise of some activist actions from the likes of GOG, a storefront that made a bundle of NSFW games free to claim for a short time to protest the ‘financial censorship’ being pushed by some payment providers and processors.</p>



<p>However, it has now been claimed that games such as Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row, and Duke Nukem could be targeted by payment processors, potentially resulting in them being delisted.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-potentially-at-risk">‘Potentially at Risk’</h2>



<p>In an article penned by GamingOnLinux, it was highlighted that a digital retro storefront had been ‘targeted’ by payment processors looking to clamp down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/itch-io-latest-site-strike-down-adult-games-payment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on adult games</a>. The storefront, ZOOM Platform, <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/news/preserving-and-protecting-artistic-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained in a statement</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As you are likely aware, there have been a number of adult title de-listings across the industry. One of our payment processors made us aware that a “fellow member of the industry” was concerned about our content.</p>



<p>We have no plans to remove any titles, and will do absolutely everything in our power to prevent such de-listings. We are fervent supporters of artistic freedom and always will be.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/zoom-platform-also-had-payment-processor-issues-say-they-have-no-plans-to-remove-any-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a> reportedly received an email from the ZOOM Platform team, explaining that ‘they expect the de-listing situation to expand further.’ It was specifically said that games like ‘Grand Theft Auto, Duke Nukem, and Saints Row were described as <strong>potentially at risk.</strong>‘</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto has long been one of the most controversial franchises in gaming, but the ‘NSFW elements’ of the game only make up a small part of what’s on offer. It’s not one of these smut titles that are hidden in the libraries of some questionable gamers on Steam, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>That being said, the violence, behaviors, and destructive potential of franchises like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row could be described as gratuitous and harmful to the wrong people, like minors.</p>



<p>Is the answer taking them off the shelves and preventing people from buying them? <strong>Absolutely not.</strong></p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that ZOOM Platform is a retro-focused site, and these claims could be angled towards more classic titles, especially where the likes of Duke Nukem are concerned.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>It's been another solid year for arcade racing fans on Nintendo platforms so far, and there's even more to come...</p>
<p>The independent studio 3DCloud has announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/formula_legends">Formula Legends</a> will be racing onto the original Switch later this year on <strong>18th September 2025</strong> for <strong>£19.99 / $19.99 / €19.99</strong>.</p>
<p>This new title, offering a "mixture of arcade and sim-focused racing gameplay" which "emulates the last seventy years" of the world's premier motorsport - including the tracks, drivers, teams, and cars, which are all "playfully inspired by racing's past and present".</p>
<p>There's also a Switch eShop demo "coming later this month", so be on the lookout for that. This demo includes two game modes (custom and time attack), two tracks (Belgium and Hungary), three iconic racing eras, new extreme weather, fully customisable gameplay and new camera modes.</p>
<p>Apart from a Switch release, this title is also coming to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. If we hear anything about a Switch 2 version, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>Whether you are on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC, here is everything you need to know about whether Madden 26 is available on your preferred platform or console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/#:~:text=Madden%2026%20Release%20Date&amp;text=Madden%2026%20officially%20releases%20on,game%2C%20starting%20on%20August%207." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> pushes the series forward in new and exciting ways. For <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-gets-gameplay-deep-dive-showcasing-on-field-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay</a>, EA brought over the wear and tear system from College Football 25, and also introduced the Coach DNA system, which mimics real-life playstyle tendancies. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-franchise-deep-dive-shows-new-coaching-updates-gameplan-changes-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Franchise</a>, some of the big new changes include coach archetypes, weekly playsheet updates, a new weekly highlights show, and more. As for&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-presentation-updates-include-updated-gameday-experience-new-mascots-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">presentation</a>, Madden 26 features former NFL legends in stadium pre-game rituals, has licensed more than 40 songs for stadium music, and includes official team mascots. With that all in mind, let’s take a look at which platforms the upcoming game is coming to. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Madden 26 on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Madden 26 ends a 13 year drought for Nintendo fans. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Madden 26 is available on the Switch 2</strong>, making it the first game in the series available on a Nintendo console since Madden 13 on the Wii and Wii U in 2012. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/gridiron-notes-madden-26-pre-order-details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA</a> confirmed that Madden 26 on Switch 2 will have all of the same features as other platforms, meaning this isn’t a “lite” version of the game, as we have seen from other stripped down versions of other sports games on the Switch. </p>



<p>That being said, there is a slight visual downgrade compared to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamespot</a> reported that the game feels smooth in handheld mode, however it is reported to perform at around 40 frames per-second on the Switch 2 and the menus load slowly. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-playstation-4-and-5">Can You Play Madden 26 on PlayStation 4 and 5?</h2>



<p><strong>Madden 26 is available on PlayStation 5, but is not on PlayStation 4</strong>. This is the first time that a Madden game won’t be on last-gen consoles. </p>



<p>It’s odd that Madden 26 won’t be available on PlayStation 4, because EA is still developing EA FC 26 for PS4. Regardless of the reason, it’s time for previous generation console owners to make the upgrade. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-xbox-one-and-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Madden 26 on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>Like PlayStation, <strong>Madden 26 will be on Xbox Series X|S but not Xbox One</strong>. </p>



<p>On the Xbox Series X, Madden 26 supports 4k Ultra HD, HDR 10, ray tracing, spatial sound, and performs at 60 frames per second or better. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-pc">Can You Play Madden 26 on PC?</h2>



<p>Yes, <strong>PC users can download Madden 26 on Steam or Epic Games</strong>. </p>



<p>EA recommends playing Madden 26 on PC with a controller, and Xbox and DualShock controllers are both supported. It’s unclear if the game will be able to run on a Steam Deck. </p>



<p>Which platform do you plan on playing on? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/is-madden-26-on-nintendo-switch-2-all-platforms-consoles-explained.3201/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>. </p>

<p>For more on Madden 26, there was a change to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/change-made-to-madden-26-broadcast-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broadcast team</a>, and all of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-rookie-ratings-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rookie ratings</a> were revealed. </p>

<p>Before pre-ordering Madden 26, it’s worth reviewing every edition and understanding the differences between them. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/#:~:text=Madden%2026%20Release%20Date&amp;text=Madden%2026%20officially%20releases%20on,game%2C%20starting%20on%20August%207." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> officially releases soon, meaning you don’t have much longer to take advantage of the pre-order bonuses. Madden is much different than other sports video game franchises because EA develops both Madden and the College Football franchise. </p>



<p>EA used that luxury to its advantage and offered a package that includes both games. Not only that, but you can take the player you created in College Football 26 and continue their journey in Madden 26, after spending four seasons in school. </p>



<h2 id="h-madden-26-pre-order-bonuses">Madden 26 Pre-Order Bonuses</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There are several different coach archetypes in Madden 26. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pre-ordering any edition of&nbsp;Madden 26 comes with a few bonuses, including Franchise Coach Ability Points, a MUT Cover Athlete Elite Player Item, and a Super Star Legendary XP Boost. </p>



<p>Coach Abilities are a new feature in Madden 26, and there are 22 offensive and 24 defensive abilities available at launch. For example, the&nbsp;Trimmed Edges&nbsp;ability gives your offensive tackles an increased chance to win against various pass rush moves, while Sure Hands increases the likelihood of receivers catching passes. Coach Ability Points are used to unlock new abilities. </p>



<p>As the name suggests, the Superstar Legendary XP boost significantly accelerates the amount of XP earned in Superstar mode for your created pro. If you bring over your created player from College Football 26 and combine it with this boost, you will have a massive head start. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-madden-26-editions-amp-prices">All Madden 26 Editions &amp; Prices</h2>



<p>The Standard Edition of College Football 26, priced at $69.99 and this edition includes all of the previously mentioned pre-order bonuses. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Deluxe Edition, priced at $99.99, comes with seven days of early access, Early Access Solo Challenges, and Madden Points to spend in Ultimate Team. </p>



<p>Finally, the MVP Edition costs $149.99. It includes all of the previously mentioned bonuses, as well as the College Football 26 Deluxe Edition, which contains 4600 CUT Points and a Names of the Game Player Item in Ultimate Team. </p>



<p>Each of the editions has a slight price reduction with an EA Play membership, which is included in an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>

<p>Here are the full patch notes</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>When Nintendo launched the Switch 2 earlier this year in June, it also released multiple free game updates for select Switch titles.</p>
<p>One of these updates was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/game_builder_garage">Game Builder Garage</a> - adding visual optimisations, Joy-Con 2 mouse support and more. Now in a new update, it's rolled out Version 1.1.1. This particular patch tackles some issues when playing this title on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's support page. If there is anything else going on with this latest patch, we'll let you know.</p>
<h2>Game Builder Garage: Ver. 1.1.1 (Released August 5, 2025)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General Fixes</strong></p>
<p>Fixed issues with system functionality when playing using a Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>Note: An update addressing the issue above is now available for <em>Game Builder Garage: Demo Version</em> as well (Ver. 1.1.1).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>In the previous update, Nintendo also released a patch for the demo version of Game Builder Garage.</p>
<p>These latest updates for Game Builder Garage also happen to tie in with the four year anniversary. In June, the game's community even held an unofficial 'Direct' presentation, showcasing the many games and demos made within the software. You can see more in the video above and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/game-builder-garage-fan-made-direct-reveals-multiple-amazing-new-creations-alongside-switch-2-update">our previous story</a>.</p>

<p>This patch for Game Builder Garage follows an update to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> earlier today.</p>

<p>Following Nintendo identifying a bug in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> last week, an update has now been officially rolled out.</p>
<p>This issue was tied to the game's upload records of rankings, and it's apparently operating as it should once again. Apart from the Switch 2 version, this same update is also available for the original Switch release.</p>
<p>Here are the official patch notes, courtesy of Nintendo's support page. If we find out about anything else going on behind the scene, we'll let you know.</p>
<h2>Latest update: Ver. 2.1.1 (Released August 5, 2025)</h2>
<blockquote>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-time-to-kill-system/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-devs-say-game%E2%80%99s-time-to-kill-system-%E2%80%9Cwill-evolve%E2%80%9D.1263015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 is set to enter open beta in the coming days, and its developers have addressed on of the game’s primary multiplayer concerns: Time-To-Kill.</p>



<p>Time-To-Kill or TTK is exactly what you think it is. It’s the amount of time it takes for a player to kill an opponent. As part of a media event in Hong Kong, developers from DICE addressed how the team is handling the system in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p><strong>“We’ve done in-depth research on TTK,”</strong> DICE’s Jac Carlsson said <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via GNN</a> courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1952869411125100656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>. <strong>“In fact, in Battlefield 6 we’ll be dealing with complex gunfights and environments. TKK is typically fastest in close combat (where it’s very fast), and the scenes we’ve shown in the trailers are mostly close combat.” </strong></p>



<h6 id="h-more-battlefield-6-battlefield-6-servers-will-use-bots-if-not-enough-players">More Battlefield 6: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-bots-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Servers Will Use Bots If Not Enough Players</a></h6>



<p>Carlsson continued: <strong>“We’ve actually done a lot of testing on the game itself, as well as a lot of historical experience, and based on this experience, we’ve found the most enjoyable and comfortable combat situations for players. Based on our own experience, the TTK in the dynamic battlefields of Battlefield 6 needs to be fast enough to keep up with the changes on the battlefield. </strong></p>



<p>Carlsson said that they used “a lot of data analysis” in order to get the TTK results that currently exist. However, the studio will listen to feedback from the players during the betas and after the game launches in order to “evolve” and “adjust” the game.</p>



<p>What do you hope to see from the TTK system in Battlefield 6? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>EA and DICE plan on using AI bots to fill Battlefield 6 servers if there aren’t enough players for a game.</p>



<p>As part of a multiplayer event in Hong Kong (per <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Taiwanese outlet GNN</a> and spotted by <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1952869411125100656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>), DICE said AI soldiers will “backfill” servers if they’re unpopulated.</p>



<p>It was said that Battlefield Studios’ philosophy is to “allow as many players as possible to play at the same time”. This would just be used on the off chance should a game need a few players in order to get started. DICE’s Jac Carlsson also gave an example use case of AI bots in Battlefield 6’s multiplayer, saying players could create a custom game mode in Portal that allows players to get more comfortable in the game.</p>



<p>While not confirmed, it should be expected that should more players join the servers, those bots will then be replaced. There was also no mention of the skill level of the bots.</p>



<p>Sticking with multiplayer, it was said that the game will also have a number of “seasonal events” that include new weapons, maps, and modes in order to keep things fresh. How often those seasons come, however, wasn’t revealed.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game is set to have two beta weekends starting August 7 for those who managed to get a code for a two-day early access (closed) period. The beta will open up on August 9-10 before returning from August 14-17.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While it wasn't ready for a gameplay demo at Evo, the new Virtua Fighter project was still one of the most exciting games of the show, thanks to a brand new trailer released during Finals day that gave us our best look yet at what Sega and RGG have cooking for this revival of a series that has been dormant for more than two decades at this point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the show, I got a chance to sit down with Riichiro Yamada, producer on the New Virtua Fighter project, to dig into some of his previous statements about the game, ask about how he plans to modernize the series to compete with other more, current 3D fighters, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[<em>Editor's Note: This interview has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The concept gameplay that we've seen for the new Virtua Fighter project has been very fluid with guards going for each individual attack, the arms moving to block each individual attack. How close to this do you expect the final game to look? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Riichiro Yamada, Producer on New Virtua Fighter Project: </strong>In terms of how it looks, yes, [the battle system is] 70% there, and tomorrow there will be an announcement made at EVO [Editor’s Note: This interview was recorded the day before the trailer release]. So I really feel that I’ll be able to showcase what the current situation is. And from a vision perspective, I really have a very strong vision and really feel that we are getting very close to that vision.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So fighting games are in a very different place than they were when Virtua Fighter V was released. What are some of the ways that you're ensuring that the new Virtua Fighter project will modernize the series?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>Virtua Fighter originally was a very simple game. It only has three buttons and everyone could basically touch and play it, but as the series went on, it became very complicated. And in terms of that and in terms of the progression, I feel that Virtua Fighter 5 is the complete version. In terms of a new Virtua Fighter, we need to keep progressing even more, not just in the gameplay but function as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I really feel that I need to look towards how do we progress this game, how do we improve this game, in terms of functionability, gameplay and how do we make it more modernized? Otherwise, I really feel like it won't sell. So those are the places that I’m really looking into. Not only gameplay, but functionality as well. We need to modernize those parts.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I really feel that modernization is very vital in order to sell.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>In a previous video, you said that the two words that come to mind when asked what is Virtua Fighter were innovation and reality. Can you explain a little bit more about what that means and how those words have guided you through production on this new game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>So in terms of innovation, I really won't be able to specify in details, but it used to be graphics at the very beginning, and then computer graphics like CG has been improving. But with CG, it's really up there right now. It's really difficult to improve the current CG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CG is already innovated, it's really up there. So in terms of innovation, I really feel that bringing up more ideas is very important when it comes to that term. And then as for reality, I feel like reality is a very difficult word, but Virtua Fighter, it's not a very UFC-like battle. It's more of like a kung-fu movie battle. It's more of that type.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And when I played Virtua Fighter at the very beginning, I felt like the reality of being hit, when you're being hit by an opponent, you felt that hurt in your arms or your legs, your body. So that sensation, I really felt that. So with the new project, not just the battles but reality, I really want that reality to be felt within the players, not only the battles but the other places as well, which I feel is very important. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So with this new Virtua Fighter project, do you envision this as a new beginning for the franchise? Not just for the franchise but for the characters? Like Akira obviously looks a lot different than what we're used to. He is not in his traditional gi, his hair is not styled up, he's wearing a hat. Are these the same characters from the previous games or is this kind of just a new reboot of Virtua Fighter?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>So in terms of characters, I really feel that new characters are necessary, and as you said, Akira looks different. So in this one, Akira is a little bit older than the previous series. So in terms of that, I feel that a new generation of characters is needed and [I’m not] saying that the character designs in the previous VF is not very good. That's not true.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We need to make the character designs look better, to look cool.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't want to say that the VF characters previously, that the character designs were a little bit weak. I’m not trying to say that. I feel that they were stylish, but we do need to evolve these characters, we need to make the character designs look better, to look cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not saying that they were bad before, but I just need to make them cooler. So that's why when I think about new characters, I said reality is one of the statements that I’m really focusing on. That too, when I create new character designs, I have to bring this reality to it and to make it a more good-looking character. So yes, using the same characters, but evolving it from the past, putting more elements to it, putting more design characters to it, making it more real is my stance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Speaking of characters, in a previous Virtua Fighter direct, you revealed Stella, a character that bears a striking resemblance to Sarah Bryant. Is there anything you can tell us about this character? And on the screen the text says that she's the bridge between worlds. Can you elaborate a little bit about what that means?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>Unfortunately, I won't be able to answer your question on that, sorry. But please be excited. Please look forward to that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You touched upon this earlier, Virtua Fighter traditionally is a three-button game — punch, kick and guard — but it derives a lot of depth from that very simple control scheme. Do you feel like the three-button control style for Virtua Fighter is core to the series, or is that an area where you see an opportunity to evolve the franchise by either adding another button or just changing the way the typical Virtua Fighter core gameplay works?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>So originally when Yu Suzuki created the Virtua fighter, he did a lot of testing. He actually tested with more than three buttons, like a lot of buttons. But they came to the three button conclusion. At the time it was more of a Game Center (Arcade) focused game, so that was the best at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the concept was that they wanted to create a game that was not too complicated and that anyone could enjoy. And so from that concept, I feel like, yes, I need to respect that concept. I want to create a game where anyone can play.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want to create a game where anyone can play.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But currently, or moving forward, it's not just a Game Center game, it's more of a household game. So when you think about how people could enjoy playing this game in their living room or in their house, that's when it kind of changes a little. So yes, the concept does stay the same, But… I’m not really focused on, oh, we need to keep it to three buttons. The more important thing is I want to create a game where anyone can play in their household when it comes to the new style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>For all the years that Virtua Fighter has been around, Akira has been the face of the franchise and he's also the character that you revealed the new Virtua Fighter project with, but we don't really get to see his face all that much. Do you feel like Akira is still the kind of face of this series or is it a new generation? Is there going to be a new person that's going to take that mantle of being the face of the franchise?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>So when it comes to the protagonist, I really feel that users will still buy a game because of the protagonist. For example, for Street Fighter, it's Luke, there's probably a reason why it's still Luke. For Ryu-Ga-Gotoku (The Yakuza series), it used to be Kiryu, but it's changing. They did bring a new protagonist, Kasuga. Originally, RGG fans love Kiryu.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So I think there were challenges in bringing a new protagonist, a new character, Kasuga, into the series. Ideally, I would like to bring out more characters, but it feels like users really like Akira. History has proven or is proving that there is a lot of love for Akira.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, I would like to bring out new characters, but I really feel that the protagonist, because Akira has been a strong face, the users will still look forward to or see or would like to buy the game because it's Akira. So I feel that changing characters or bringing new characters is not a very easy thing to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

                <p>Call of Duty developer Raven Software has now secured a contract for its union after after three years of work. Workers at Raven "unanimously voted to ratify their first union contract between Game Workers Alliance-CWA (GWA-CWA) members and Microsoft," according to a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> from the Communication Workers of America (CWA).</p><p>The collective bargaining agreement secures a few conditions for the 19 quality assurance testers at Raven. This includes a 10% wage increase over two years, along with additional raises through merit and promotion. CWA says this follows 18 months without wage increases and 45 months without promotions.</p><p>The contract also addresses crunch time, with "seven days' notice required for mandatory overtime, no excessive overtime on back-to-back weeks, flexible scheduling of overtime, and no mandatory overtime of any duration for the majority of weeks in a quarter."</p><p>Finally, the contract includes provisions for bridging of time worked as contract and temp employees, with defined job descriptions, a fair promotions process, expanded disability accommodations, and layoff protections.</p><p>This comes after "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/raven-software-qa-testers-can-move-ahead-with-union-vote-following-nlrb-ruling/1100-6502770/" data-ref-id="1100-6502770">three years</a> of organizing and bargaining," according to QA tester Erin Hall. "From day one, we made it a priority to include every voice in the room, and the contract we came out with reflects what we need--better pay, real career paths, and protection from burnout. It’s a contract that actually values the work QA does. I’m proud of what we accomplished, and I hope it shows other game workers that organizing works—and it’s worth it."</p><p>Microsoft has laid off thousands of workers through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">multiple rounds of layoffs</a> in recent months, and one tactic of questionable legality in corporate playbooks to fight unions is to simply lay off the unionized workforce. For this contract to stick, Microsoft will have to respect the contract and the union. With that said, a secured union contract is a big step forward for game developers.</p>
