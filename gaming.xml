			<p>In the realm of gaming auteurs, Swery and Suda51 are synonymous with incredible and outlandish presentation. The likes of Deadly Premonition, Killer 7, No More Heroes, and many more all share a style DNA whilst managing to retain their own identity. If you’re a fan of these creators then you’ll be well used to zany dialogue, weird moments, and a requisite amount of jank. Hotel Barcelona feels like the perfect distillation of this collaboration as it oozes style, but requires some perseverance to overcome the initial limitations.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hotel Barcelona Official Launch Trailer  PC Gaming Show | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qEun1BEcit4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Agent Justine sets out to investigate a mysterious case, only to find herself trapped in the titular Hotel Barcelona and stuck in an unwanted possession by the infamous serial killer Dr Carnival. While they are polar opposites in their intentions and approaches, they are forced to bond over their imprisonment at the hands of an evil witch who is closely connected to both of their pasts. Their mission is made more complicated by the fact that the Hotel is now home to the spirits of the most notorious and evil serial killers in American history.</p>


<p>Hotel Barcelona plays out across two main modes but one is effectively an option select screen given a graphical overhaul as you explore the Hotel to talk to characters and unlock skills and weapons. After you talk to each merchant they are added to your phonebook, so eventually you hardly need to leave your room in between attempts. This may sound like there are a range of characters with which to interact, but in fact there are only four in total. One sells consumables, one weapons, another allows you to apply challenge penalties to access greater bonuses and the last is in charge of character upgrades. This makes the Hotel feel like a surprisingly lonely place, though there is some background flavour text.</p>


<p>There’s a fantastic grindhouse cartoon aesthetic throughout, which features splashes of colour and a cast of over the top characters. The various levels have distinctive styles that reflect the deranged personalities of the bosses too. The Hotel and the levels also feature a myriad of Easter egg references to classic slasher and horror icons from Jason Vorhees to Pennywise. Dialogue takes place through static character images that look destined to become cult classic Halloween costumes in the future with inspirations taken equally from The X Files and Rocky Horror. Music and voiceovers are in keeping with the atmosphere and work well, with Dr Carnival’s gravelly tones being a particular highlight.</p>
<p>At heart, the game is a roguelite 2D action platformer with a focus on close quarters combat and large-scale boss fights. The narrative framing of this repetition is based on the action taking place in Justine’s dreams, a framing that works well with the overall surreal nature of the game. You can choose between three different melee weapon types as you progress, with knives, axes, and whirling sawblades. Each type has numerous unlockable variations that you can buy, giving different strengths and bonus parameters. These range from simple damage buffs to others that gain benefits from specific contexts such as rain or aerial attacks. You also have access to a support ranged weapon that can be used with a cooldown, with a simple pistol being your starting point. Shotguns and flamethrowers are also available later on, so there is an element of strategy in choosing your loadout.</p>

<p>At first you only have very basic combo attacks to take on the many enemies you’ll face, but the permanent upgrade system features multiple unlockable attacks for each melee type. Some of these feel far more useful than others which speaks to a lack of balance, but that could also be due to my own playstyle. The roguelite system means that there is a lot of grinding repetition required to get to the fun stuff. This is a problem as the basic controls are not great, with Justine feeling turgid and clunky to control. Action platformers live and die through their movement and Hotel Barcelona is a far more rigid experience than most. Attacks seem locked in and it is easy to take damage with little to no way of countering it.</p>
<p>Exploration in each level requires you to jump between platforms, fight off enemies and destroy environmental objects for collectable currencies. Dollars, bones, teeth, and ears are the various forms of payment needed for upgrades and consumables which can be frustrating as these are locked to each run so leftovers are lost. With there being a random element to what you collect each time this can make grinding for upgrades a frustrating process. There is a skill that lets you keep a percentage in storage but this is also slow to upgrade.</p>

<p>Bosses are the high point of the game’s combat and are hugely challenging at first. You do have the ability to repeat fights a limited number of times, during which your previous attempts are played out in the form of Slasher Phantoms and continue to do the attacks and damage of that run. This leads to a neat layered approach in which failed runs can make the next one easier, but it’s a concept that never felt as fleshed out as I would have liked. Combined with random elements like weather effects, day and night cycles, and even player size (being giant makes for some comical encounters given the scale of the levels and enemies), there is a welcome variety to runs but the actual combat and level design quickly becomes repetitive.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I am left conflicted with Hotel Barcelona. It absolutely oozes the kind of style you’d expect its leading creators and there is real potential in the setting and story, but the actual game just isn’t that fun to play. The clunky controls stand out against the many similar action platformers and the multiple currencies make upgrades an unwelcome grind. I can’t help but think the story would be better suited to an anime rather than its current form. It’s worth a look if you can see past the jank (and many longtime fans of Swery and Suda51 are well used to that) but its shortcomings make this a booking you might regret.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>GTA creator Dan Houser, a co-founder of Rockstar Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-dan-houser-co-founder-leaving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famously left the company in early 2020</a> after a twenty-two-year career. The following year, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-creator-dan-houser-new-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded a new company called Absurd Ventures</a>, which has so far released <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/abetterparadise/audiofiction/podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a podcast series</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/43G4zWS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a graphic novel</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/4nAQwZR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a novel</a>, with games also in development.</p>



<p>Houser, who wrote all Rockstar videogames from GTA London: 1969 to Red Dead Redemption 2, was recently featured in a massive, nearly three-hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3gbXDjNWyI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video interview on the Lex Fridman podcast</a>. As you'd imagine with such a lengthy conversation, it spanned a myriad of topics, from games to films to the process of creating game characters. Out of all of them, the writer picked Niko Bellic, the Serbian immigrant who served as the protagonist of GTA IV, as his favorite.</p>



<p><em>I think he's the most innovative and the most morally defensible in some ways. He does a lot of stuff where he's fighting for what's right. He's the nicest person in some ways. Is he the best protagonist of a GTA game? I think he's the most innovative protagonist of a GTA game. Structurally, he might be too nice in some ways. He's also tough. I loved CJ in San Andreas. I thought Maylay did such… Just the way he spoke gave him such humanity. It wasn't the writing, it was the quality of the voice acting, it was just so strong for him.<br>I think aspects of Michael, he was so understated, but the actor loved the character, he brought so much humanity to this character who's so flawed, who has no principles. He sells everyone out. I think Ned Luke did such an amazing job and didn't necessarily get as many plaudits as Steven Ogg for Trevor, who was also wonderful. But I think the Ned Luke character anchors that game so much. So I like all of them in different ways, but I probably love Niko the most.</em></p>



<p>Regarding the secret of the GTA series, Dan Houser said that the fact that the games did not come out as often was a factor in their success, driving anticipation which, in turn, drives sales for the next installment. Indeed, he predicts that Grand Theft Auto VI (which he didn't write for) will sell 'really well' when it comes out next year <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on May 26, 2026</a>. Of course, there's also the aspect of Rockstar constantly trying to innovate and push the boundaries of the medium forward.</p>



<p>The GTA creator also commented on the rise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in particular, saying he's not too worried as they are unable to come up with 'magic' and will most likely be relegated to making decent, cheap stuff.</p>



<p><em>Based on my fairly limited understanding of how language models work, they're not going to replace good ideas. They can't really come up with good new ideas. What they can do is do low-level stuff. So I think it's going to be harder for people to start out in some of these spaces. If you're not a very good concept artist, you're in a lot of trouble. If you have original ideas, I think you're fine. But I also think that they've done the first 90% of the work to sound human, 95% possibly in some areas. The last 5% is going to end up being about 95% of the work. I think that last bit with tech, in my experience with things like facial animation, it's always been the last bits and pieces that take far longer than the first bit. </em></p>



<p><em>And so I'm probably a hideous Luddite, but I'm less scared than a lot of people. I think you're going to end up with a lot of work that looks the same. It's going to help people be creative in some ways. It's going to get some people who probably shouldn't be in that space out of that space. But if you've got talent, I think it'll be fine. I don't think they're going to come up with magic. I think they're going to be fantastic at coming up with really cheap, decent stuff.</em></p>



<p>On that note, one of his new settings, <a href="https://wccftech.com/american-caper-a-better-paradise-gta-creator-dan-houser-absurd-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Better Paradise</a>, is a near-future dystopia where Houser explores characters such as a conflicted, semi-sociopathic AI named Nigel Dave, which knows everything but lacks wisdom of its own and envies the human experience. Houser confirmed that a game based on A Better Paradise is in early development at Absurd Ventures' Santa Monica studio. Moreover, an open world videogame based on a third setting, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-co-founder-dan-houser-teases-his-new-game-with-cast-of-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Absurdaverse</a>, is also in the works but will take a few years before it's ready.</p>

            <p>November is here. The sunny uplands are far behind us. The great gilded procession of Videogaming trundles and cavorts through the deep forest. The bells of the indie jesters are muffled by fog, and the CEOs peer anxiously from their carriages of scarlet and bronze, instructing their guardsmen to beware the union organisers concealed in the undergrowth. Keep watching the trees. Everytime you glance away, they look a little more like placards. Do you see the moths, idly winking on boughs? They are the Maw's eyes. Those distant, whistling spirals of pine, somehow immobile behind the foreground trunks, in defiance of the rules of perspective? They are the Maw's lungs. Those squirrels having shouting matches with magpies? Erm. The Maw's thrombocytes, maybe.
</p>
<p>Listen! The crunch of twigs and leaves under hobnailed boots. Approaching torches. It is a refugee party of freshly released PC games. Let us pick the heartiest or strangest from their ranks to bolster our forces, before the shadows close in for good.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/just-cause-5-no-go-avalanche-founder/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/just-cause-5-%E2%80%98would-be-a-no-go%E2%80%99-says-avalanche-founder.1341943/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Earlier this year, reports surfaced suggesting that Just Cause 5 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/just-cause-5-reportedly-cancelled-mid-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was canceled</a> midway through development, putting a final nail in the coffin for the open-world action series. In a recent post on social media, Avalanche Studios’ founder, Christofer Sundberg, revealed that the current makeup of the company would prevent Just Cause 5 from ever resurfacing.</p>



<p>In his words, even the reappearance of Just Cause 5 wouldn’t be enough to ‘save’ Avalanche.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-might-never-see-another-just-cause-game">We Might Never See Another Just Cause Game</h2>



<p>Just Cause debuted in 2006, emerging as an open-world action title like never before. It was an enormous game that pushed the PlayStation 2 and Xbox to unforeseen limits, offering players a massive world to trek through while undertaking gun-blazing missions and death-defying stunts.</p>



<p>It was expanded on with a second, third, and fourth (and final) release, but the latter title proved to be the killing point for the franchise, which is something that Christofer Sundberg, founder of Avalanche Studios, shouldered some of the blame for:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The problems with JC4 was partly me (unwillingly) moving away from creative leadership to more corporate crap, publisher problems, team composition and roles and more. Sad, because looking at JC4 now, it shows SO much promise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sundberg <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1985261958044553563" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was speaking</a> to his followers about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-screenshots-canceled-xbox-avalanche/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent topic of Contraband</a>. Images of the canceled game surfaced recently online, prompting Sundberg to address his relation to the project:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Me and my team pitched Contraband back in 2017 to MSFT (and signed it). It’s changed quite a lot since then obviously, but it would have been fantastic to see it being released one day somehow. #JC5 <strong>would be a no-go </strong>since extremely few from the original team are there still.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments under his post, Sundberg became critical of Avalanche’s current operating model:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I doubt it. They need to find the fire again, take risks, piss people off and make games the rest said was impossible. I started Avalanche to break the mold, not to fit into one.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you wish we’d seen another Just Cause game? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The Springfield map in the Fortnite mini-season themed around The Simpsons is packed full of easter eggs and iconic locations, including Homer’s House, the Simpsons family’s iconic home.</p>



<p>With a stacked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a> and limited time to get through it all, with the launch of Chapter 7 looming toward the end of the month, gathering XP quickly is crucial so that you don’t miss out on any rewards.</p>



<p>Whether you’re on the hunt for Homer’s House for a specific Fortnite quest or want to enjoy the environment and the easter eggs, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-homer-s-house-in-fortnite">Where is Homer’s House in Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Siiiimpsooooons…. House. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Homer’s house and the residence of the rest of the Simpsons family is found slap bang in the middle of the Evergreen Terrace POI in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re a fan of The Simpsons, the house will stand out like a sore thumb. If you’re not as well-versed in the iconic show, the giveaways are the brown roof and Homer’s iconic car outside. Next door is Ned Flanders house, which is easily spotted by the purple roof, and there’s a blue bungalow on the other side.</p>



<p>Visiting the location for the first time will reward you with an XP boost, with even more if it’s your first time in Evergreen Terrace, but there’s still a few more things you can do to stack up XP.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-do-in-the-simpsons-house-for-easy-fortnite-xp">What to do in The Simpsons House For Easy Fortnite XP</h2>



<p><strong>There are a bunch of quests you can complete in or near The Simpsons’ house, so it’s worth taking advantage of your time in the area.</strong></p>



<p>One of the easiest, if you haven’t done so already, is to head inside the house and interact with the couch in the living room, which provides 5,000 XP and is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-simpsons-fortnite-hidden-gag-quests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 Hidden Gag</a> quests there are to complete.</p>



<p>It’s worth looting the area too to find specific items, as there’s a chance you can get the Blinky Fish, which unlocks the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-point-dash-blinky-fish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Point Dash</a> for a limited time, and Steamed Ham—the latter being another Hidden Gag quest.</p>



<p>Once you’re done in Evergreen Terrace, head south to the Burning Tires and look around the area for a mound of dirt. Interact with it to dig up Mr. Sparky, ticking off another Hidden Gag quest in the process.</p>

While it is not an Xbox Game Studios-published video game, Microsoft played a key role in its marketing ahead of its much-delayed release date in November 2024. It even worked with the Ukrainian studio on a 90-minute documentary that revealed the difficulty the developers faced building the game amid Russia’s full-scale invasion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As confirmed by the Xbox app, Stalker 2 is set to leave Game Pass on November 16, 2025, alongside four other games detailed below.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/03/screenshot-2025-11-03-093646-1762165019350.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Stalker 2 is set to leave Game Pass this month.</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Games set to leave Xbox Game Pass on November 16, 2025:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">Stalker 2</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/football-manager-2024">Football Manager 2024</a> / <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/football-manager-2024-console">Football Manager 2024 Console</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blacksmith-master">Blacksmith Master</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/spirittea">Spirittea</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s Stalker 2’s exit that has caused the most kerfuffle, with some Game Pass subscribers criticizing the move a year after launch, and just ahead of the game’s release on PlayStation 5 on November 20.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Microsoft backed GSC through all the delays and even the invasion, so it’s surprising they weren’t able to secure a better deal,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1omgg67/stalker_2_is_about_to_leave_game_pass/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor JBishie</a>. “I think it’s a matter of principle: the game was incomplete at launch and is only now starting to resemble a finished product, yet it’s being removed from the service just as the 1.7 update approaches, and with the PS5 release coming up, the timing looks especially poor.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, the fact Stalker 2 launched first on Xbox and PC with quite a few problems, which are only now ironed out in time for the PS5 launch, is being highlighted by those who believe the game should remain on Game Pass for a while longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's been a year, which is a pretty standard time for non MiS games,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1omgg67/comment/nmpb4mf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said VickyCriesALot</a>. “I'm not sure why this is such a shock to people like it's unprecedented.

It's been in early access not a finished product so now’s a great time to rip it off the service.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it’s a really bad precedent that a game stays shorter in Game Pass than we had to wait for it to launch, beyond waiting MONTHS to become properly playable patch after patch,” <a href="https://x.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1984925333204689052" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complained X / Twitter user @ZakkenKloot</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's bad that Stalker is going,” <a href="https://x.com/Matty_Cs_World/status/1984936078235598902" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added @Matty_Cs_World</a>. “It was good but basically released very buggy.

In the case of Ultimate, it went up a whopping 50% to $29.99 a month. That amounts to an extra $120 a year. To justify the price hike, Microsoft upped the number of day one releases per year to 75, and added Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics for the first time ever. There were also upgrades to Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Stalker 2 on PS5, it launches on Sony’s console with full support for the DualSense controller’s features, including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Further technical enhancements for the PS5 Pro are also in development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>If you are planning on clicking your heels together and setting off to the cinema to watch Wicked: For Good, the next film in the musical adaptation of Oz's witches Glinda and Elphaba, you may also get a first proper peep at another famous duo.</p>
<p>According to insider accounts <a href="https://x.com/MyTimeToShineH">@MyTimeToShineH</a> and <a href="https://x.com/TheWickedSource">@TheWickedSource</a>, a trailer for The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> Movie - which is to say, the upcoming sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">2023's hugely successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a> - will be attached to screenings of Wicked: For Good, which is set to release on 21st November.  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-super-mario-bros-movie-will-release-in-2026">Mario movie sequel was first teased for a 2026 release back in March of last year</a>. At this time, we were told the next film in the franchise will "broaden Mario's world further", though further details were kept largely under wraps. Following this, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-movie-2s-new-characters-will-include-old-favourites-and-really-deep-cuts">Toad voice actor Keegan-Michael Key teased the film would feature an "intriguing" setting alongside "old favourite" characters and "really deep cuts"</a>, but again stopped short of revealing <em>too </em>much.</p>
<p>Then, just this September, Nintendo gave us a better idea of just how much broader this film's setting will be, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-first-look-at-the-mario-movie-sequel">when it announced the official title as The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>. Perhaps later this month we will get a look at Rosalina, who surely will make an appearance in the film. I mean, Lumalee popped up in the first Mario Bros. film, so was this all a bit of foreshadowing? Well, there's potentially not much longer until we find out, with some now hoping Ariana Grande will voice Rosalina. </p>

<p>Along with a Mario sequel, Nintendo also has a live-action Legend of Zelda film in the works. Earlier this year, the studio announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reveals-its-link-and-zelda-for-forthcoming-the-legend-of-zelda-film">Link and Zelda will be played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth and Bo Bragason</a>.</p>

<p>Series' 30th anniversary looms</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="30a0495948c20"><a title="Lady D" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30a0495948c20/lady-d.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/1984834530994508196">has announced a new collaboration</a> between <strong>Resident Evil</strong> and Japanese metal group <strong>BABYMETAL</strong>, but its debut has fans divided on the franchise's apparent obsession with Lady Dimitrescu.</p>
<p>The collaboration will result in some special Resident Evil / BABYMETAL merchandise landing in 2026, presumably to directly coincide with the series' 30th anniversary on <strong>22nd March</strong>. However, the inclusion of Dimitrescu – a relatively minor antagonist from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a> – has got fans wondering why Capcom isn't focusing more on legacy characters like Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield.</p>
<p>Fans are voicing their concerns over on social media, with <a href="https://x.com/SonnyBauer8462" tabindex="-1">@SonnyBauer8462</a> stating "I feel like Jill/Chris would be more befitting":</p>


<p>Of course, it's pretty clear to us why Dimitrescu is being utilised so much for marketing purposes at the moment. The character was the true standout star of Resident Evil: Village (which, don't forget, is getting a fresh Switch 2 release on <strong>27th February 2026</strong> alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Requiem</a>), and the performance from voice actor Maggie Robertson remains iconic to this day.</p>

<p>Robertson also provided an overview of the franchise as part of Capcom's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQODLCylKbM">'Road to Requiem'</a> video posted last week. During the almost 11-minute presentation, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-switch-2-pro-controller-and-amiibo-confirmed">it was announced</a> that a new themed Pro Controller would be released for the Switch 2, alongside a Grace Ashcroft amiibo in Summer 2026.</p>
<p>So yeah, we're pretty torn over Capcom's focus on Lady Dimitrescu. On the one hand, yes, the character is excellent and we imagine the company is probably busy conjuring up some sort of spin-off game for her at this very moment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Resident Evil has always been known for the events of Raccoon City – even 30 years later – and it's perhaps a bit odd that not more focus is being put on the characters that started it all. Especially when you consider that we'll be revisiting the scorched remains of the city in Resident Evil Requiem in 2026.</p>

<p><em>What do you make of this? Are you fussed that Lady Dimitrescu is seemingly the face of Resident Evil now, or would you rather Capcom shift the focus back over to the legacy characters? Let us know.</em></p></section>

            <p>Birds chirp and gentle breeze floats by as you sip your tea. A tank rolls by, a shell explodes, and someone gets wiped out by machine gun fire. You remain relaxed. This is, after all, the stated goal of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s freshly introduced Casual Breakthrough mode, designed for those who wish to battle fields "without the intensity of a full PvP lobby".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Casual Breakthrough's aimed at providing "a more relaxed way to play while still earning progression and completing challenges", EA said in their <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1984667774430691819">announcement of the new mode</a> over the weekend. Its matches feature smaller teams which feature 32 bot teammates/enemies outnumbering 16 real players, with each squad made up of 16 bots and eight human field battlers. Siege of Cairo and Empire State are the maps it's been applied to out of the gates.</p>
<p>While Casual Breakthrough doesn't dish out dogtags, accolades, or update your career stats, it does offer several forms of XP progression and the chance to complete challenges. To be precise, Career XP, Weapon XP, and Battle Pass XP are all on offer, with actions involving real players dishing out full XP and those involving bots only offering half.</p>
<p>That mix, coupled with the XP and challenge farming that's been an element of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> since it prone-crawled into its full release state, seems to pitch the mode as a sort of holiday retreat where folks can grind away at individual goals without having to focus as much on trying to win matches for their team. Well, at least without risking having an uber-competitive teammate shout at you. I assume there's still the risk of someone shouting at you because you're getting in the way of them leveling up their gun. We'll see how the mode fares in time in terms of living up to that purpose.</p><p>Meanwhile, in other XP-related news, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1984674602006855747">EA have picked up on an "issue"</a> affecting the amount of XP being earned in Strikepoint matches. From the looks of it, another exploit that could be used to farm XP without putting in intended hard yards is the issue in question. "To maintain fair and consistent progression, we've made some temporary adjustments to XP in this mode while we investigate a longer term solution," EA wrote.</p>
<p>Yeah, whatever, you respond. Jets fly overhead as you place the bits of cucumber back over your eyes and sink into your camo-liveried sun lounger.</p>

<p>The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite is in full swing, offering plenty of excitement across the map in Battle Royale, and there’s a host of Hidden Gag quests to complete too.</p>



<p>With a much shorter season length than usual, there’s less time than ever to complete the Battle Pass, though it is significantly smaller than other passes, and completing the Hidden Gag quests provides a huge bonus of XP that will surge you through the levels on the pass.</p>



<p>To make it easier for you, we’ve got all the details on how to complete all of The Simpsons Hidden Gag quests in Fortnite this season.</p>







<figure><figcaption>POIs a plenty. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 12 Hidden Gags to complete during The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite, each providing a one-time bonus of 5,000 XP when completed.</strong></p>



<p>These quests cannot be tracked like normal quests, as there will be no indicators on where to go, hence the ‘hidden’ name. However, most won’t require too much legwork to do, and you will likely tick off the majority just through exploration across the Springfield map.</p>



<p>Some are harder to locate than others, however, as there won’t be a prompt in a specific location. Therefore, unless you know what you are looking for, it’s easy to miss something off the list. </p>



<p>The full list of Hidden Gags to complete during The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite is shown in the table below.</p>

            <p>Arc Raiders now has an official roadmap for the rest of 2025, and considering there's only two months left in the year, it's slammed full of a substantial amount of new experiences for players to try out.</p>
<p>Initially posted by the Arc Raiders social media accounts, the Arc Raiders roadmap reveals that in November's 'North Line' update, we'll gain access to a new map: Stella Montis. There'll also be two new Arc enemies, a community-unlock event, as well as new quests and items.</p>
<p>As for December, the ‘Cold Snap’ update will bring the new snowfall map condition, the ‘Flickering Flames’ event, more new quests, a new raider deck for players to progress through, as well as the game's first departure window (or, in common parlance, an optional character reset).</p>

</figure>
<p>Now, some of these additions remain largely mysterious, we don't know what the community-unlock event actually entails as of writing, but even with these gaps in knowledge that's at least one major thing added to the game each month. That is, it's safe to say, a huge amount of new content coming to Arc Raiders so soon after release.</p><p>It's a similar cadence to what Embark Studios brought to The Finals, which had some manner of in-game event or other twist on the formula every few weeks or so. Whether it can keep the strong momentum going for Arc Raiders remains to be seen, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-passes-250000-concurrent-players-on-steam-alone-breaking-records-for-the-extraction-shooter-genre">but given it's performing exceptionally well for an extraction shooter</a> so far, things are certainly looking up for the game.</p>
<p>If you've not jumped in yet, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">Eurogamer's preview of the game</a>, which opens with the following: "There's a rare experience with video games when an entire genre just clicks for you. A moment when the appeal makes sense. Crawling onto an elevator with a backpack full of loot, hastily initiating the extraction sequence with seconds left to live, Arc Raiders did exactly that. It let off a firework in my head. How was I ever not a fan of this?"</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/skywind-morrowind-fan-made-remade-skyrim-new-teaser/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skywind-morrowind%E2%80%99s-fan-made-remake-in-skyrim-shares-new-halloween-2025-teaser.1341886/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Skywind team has released a new teaser for Halloween 2025. In the footage, which runs for nearly four minutes, we get a glimpse at the spooky side of Vvardenfell, such as skeletons, ghosts, and demons, or more accurately, Daedra and followers of the Daedric princes. </p>



<p>The teaser is narrated by the following voice actors: Dom “Hentus” Tromans, Harry Frost, Anna Pluta, Kit Cambridge, James Cattle, Sara Dunham, CommanderXander, MoonWorks, Ryan Cooper, Argyle, and LacunaFish. However, do note that the voiced lines were created specifically for this teaser and will not be found in the game.</p>



<p>Skywind, a fan-made remake of 2002's The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind in the engine of 2011's The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, has actually been in the works for even longer than Skyrim itself has been available. That's because it started as a port of the original The Elder Scrolls Renewal project called Morroblivion, which sought to bring Morrowind to the Oblivion engine. With the release of the Creation Kit on February 7, 2012, the porting began in earnest, and six months later, Skywind had a name and logo. Since then, the project's nature has evolved into a game that will recreate every asset, from textures to meshes to sounds.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/skywind-total-conversion-mod-gets-call-of-the-east-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first covered it</a> back in 2019. Recently, the team has been more active, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skywind-gets-new-gameplay-demo-and-progress-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showing off a gameplay demo in late May</a>. In early September, for this year's Creation Mod Con, the developers of Skywind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRp7aIoGpak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">streamed about an hour of the game</a> while talking about it. There, we learned that every NPC in Morrowind now has a voice actor cast. Recording and editing are still ongoing, but the milestone guarantees all roles will have lines.</p>



<p>Progress has been made when it comes to ambient audio, too, with fuller voice lines and more complex background chatter, making Vvardenfell's towns feel more alive. New houses and expanded houses will ensure that every Skywind NPC with a daily routine has somewhere to sleep, unlike in the original game. Work is also still ongoing on environmental art, with unique ruins and custom murals confirmed to be planned.</p>



<p>The team did not comment on the completion status of the remake project. They only said that experienced volunteers are still needed to work on 3D clothing modeling, audio mastering, SFX, VFX QA, and animation. Moreover, volunteers without prior modding experience can assist with file cutting. To apply, <a href="https://tesrskywind.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">head to the official website</a>.</p>



<p>There's no telling when Skywind will be completed, unlike its sister project, Skyblivion, which is technically still scheduled to launch in 2025 (although delays can always occur).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Like Fallout, Grand Theft Auto Won’t Ever Leave the United States (Again)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-wont-leave-united-states-like-fallout/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/like-fallout-grand-theft-auto-won%E2%80%99t-ever-leave-the-united-states-again.1341880/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, Dan Houser, one of the founders of Rockstar Games, revealed why the United States has always been the setting for Grand Theft Auto, save for a brief outing to London in 1999. It’s a similar reason why Fallout, a famed post-apocalyptic franchise, won’t ever leave the United States.</p>



<p>In Houser’s words, there’s too much ‘Americana’ in the DNA of Grand Theft Auto for it to work in any other country. The stint in London in 1999 with a top-down classic on the PS1 was an experiment more than anything, and Houser dubbed it ‘cute and fun’.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-and-fallout-forever-in-america">GTA and Fallout, Forever in America</h2>



<p>During the Summer Game Fest showcase, we sat down with Bethesda Game Studios to learn about a recent update and the future of the franchise. One of the questions we had was regarding the ongoing setting of the United States being the base formula for the post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>I was told that Fallout ‘probably won’t’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/never-say-never-bethesda-fallout-leave-united-states/">ever leave the United States</a>, and that’s because it <strong>needs </strong>everything that happened in the USA in the franchise’s universe to succeed. It’s deeply rooted in Americana and the post-war, atom-mad landscape that kind of existed in real life.</p>



<p>Similarly, Dan Houser recently explained on the Lex Fridman podcast that <strong>Grand Theft Auto </strong>can’t leave the United States:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We made a little thing in London 26 years ago, GTA London, for the top-down one for the PS1. That was pretty cute and fun.</p>



<p>There was so much Americana inherent in the IP, it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else. You needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters.</p>



<p>The game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider’s perspective. That was so much about what the series was that it wouldn’t really have worked in the same way elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/dan-houser-says-rockstar-games-only-attempted-gta-london-once-in-26-years-because-the-series-is-so-much-about-america-that-it-wouldnt-really-have-worked-in-the-same-way-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>Historically, Grand Theft Auto has taken players from fictional renditions of Miami to Los Angeles, and from New York to a minuscule foray into North Dakota. There are few places outside of the United States that could serve as a strong enough canvas for the art that Rockstar Games needs to create what it does best.</p>



<p>That’s the same with Fallout, of course. In 2024, Todd Howard backed up the sentiment that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-leave-united-states/">Fallout can’t exist outside the United States</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My view is, part of the Fallout schtick is on the American naivete and part of that. And so, for us right now, it’s okay to acknowledge some of those other areas, but our plans are to predominately keep it in the US. It’s okay to leave mystery or questions, ‘What’s happening in Europe, what’s happening here’. The worst thing you can do to mysterious lands is to remove the mystery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ARC Raiders is proving to be such a success that it’s becoming a victim of its own victory. Hours ago, the all-new extraction shooter from Embark Studios suffered from network stability and server issues under the weight of an immense number of players, with a new all-time high player count being secured.</p>



<p>In one moment, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">354,836 concurrent players</a> <strong>on Steam alone </strong>were enjoying the new extraction adventure from Embark, the creators of The Finals. This puts the game’s success (on Steam at least) on par with the likes of GTA 5, Starfield, Monster Hunter: World, and Borderlands 4.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-is-taking-the-world-by-storm">ARC Raiders is Taking the World by Storm</h2>



<p>As ARC Raiders hit new lofty heights on Sunday evening, the game started showing cracks that impacted users worldwide. Embark was forced to arrange a server queue system and seemed to switch off crossplay while recovery actions took place.</p>



<p>For a while, players were forced to contend with those queues, party issues, network instability in-game, and even some crashes.</p>



<p>It wasn’t a long-lived issue, but it was indicative of the sheer success and scope of ARC Raiders, widely considered one of the best extraction shooters around and an immense contender to the monopoly held by the likes of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders recently received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-2025-roadmap/">a sizeable roadmap</a>, detailing the next few months of content for the sensational game. That’s in addition to Embark Studios’ promise to support ARC Raiders <strong>for the next decade</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s proving to be a hit with players, of course. On Steam, ARC Raiders has managed to secure more than 37,000 reviews, 90% of which are purely positive. It’s a transformational extraction shooter that’s seriously disrupting the genre right now.</p>

<p>When you open up the website for the upcoming To The Moon expo, you’re greeted with a message that reads, ‘a gaming expo with more games than merch stalls.’ If you’ve read our recent report on the state of EGX and the wider expo scene in the United Kingdom, you’ll appreciate why that’s a hugely exciting prospect.</p>



<p>To The Moon is a brand-new gaming and tech expo coming to the UK with its inaugural event <strong>next week</strong>, and it’s trying to pick up and reposition the pieces of an ecosystem that’s falling apart as we speak.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-to-the-moon-expo">What is To The Moon Expo?</h2>



<p>To The Moon is ‘a gaming expo for gamers, by gamers’, and everyone is heading to the event hoping that the company behind the expo can deliver on that promise. Here’s the blurb from the site for the expo:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t just another gaming expo: This is a call to players, creators, and fans who know the industry can be more. We are here to craft an experience for YOU! From high-energy esports tournaments and meeting your favourite voice actors, to discovering new games and learning how you can break into the gaming industry – we have something here for every kind of gamer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Held at the NEC in Birmingham, To The Moon walks in the footsteps of the Insomnia Gaming Festival, once the shining gem of the UK’s gaming expo scene and now a shrivelling shadow of its former self. The team behind To The Moon has promised a visitor capacity of 15,000 gamers and more than 150 exhibitors, alongside a ‘full-blown esports arena’.</p>



<p>It’s a much smaller affair than Insomnia Gaming Festival was, up until going bust a couple of years ago (and weirdly resurfacing in recent months), but everybody has to start somewhere.</p>



<p>To The Moon will feature an indie zone packed with playable games, a creator zone, an industry hub for networking, guest appearances, and several talks and workshops.</p>



<p>On the list for guests, speakers, and meet and greets are some pretty prestigious folks. From Glen Schofield, founder of Sledgehammer Games and Striking Distance Studios, to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">Tom McKay</a> and Luke Dale of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II fame, there are plenty of opportunities to rub shoulders.</p>



<p>VOID Interactive is bringing an immersive Ready or Not SWAT experience to the venue, and a VR arena will be set up for fans to participate in competitions.</p>



<p>There’s a retro gaming arcade, board games, (some) merch stalls, and even an invitational League of Legends tournament, all being held under the roof of one of the most popular event venues in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>To The Moon could be one of the best up-and-coming gaming events in the business, and the gamers in the United Kingdom desperately need something like this to succeed, given the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-death-uk-gaming-expo/">recent collapse of EGX</a>, Insomnia, <strong>and </strong>WASD.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.tothemoonexpo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tickets for To The Moon</a> can be bought online now for the showcase that’s set to run from November 12 – 13.</p>



<p>Do you think To The Moon sounds like your kind of event? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a whole new week, and a fresh start to the penultimate month of the year, but do you know what the most important thing is for you to do today? That’s right, it’s <strong>solve another NYT Connections puzzle</strong>. Fortunately, I’m here to help you get off to an easy start, providing the best NYT Connections hints and solutions to get you there quickly.</p>



<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections hints without any delay.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-3">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 3)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #876:</p>



<ul>
<li>SEA MONKEY</li>



<li>JIGSAW PUZZLE</li>



<li>BALLOON ANIMAL</li>



<li>CLOWN NOSE</li>



<li>WHOOPEE CUSHION</li>



<li>MARASCHINO CHERRY</li>



<li>FUNKY CHICKEN</li>



<li>LEGO SET</li>



<li>FIRE ENGINE</li>



<li>JUMBO SHRIMP</li>



<li>PICK-UP STICKS</li>



<li>BOUNCY CASTLE</li>



<li>WATER WINGS</li>



<li>LITE-BRITE</li>



<li>STOP SIGN</li>



<li>DARK HORSE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of objects that scream “stop,” “sweet,” or “silly” — all dressed in crimson.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These puffed-up pals are party staples, poolside protectors, and prankster favorites.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>If you’ve ever stepped on one barefoot or spent hours assembling, you know the pain and joy.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These quirky phrases pair unexpected adjectives with creatures — some real, some imaginary.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 3.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-3-876">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 3 (#876)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CLOWN NOSE, FIRE ENGINE, MARASCHINO CHERRY, STOP SIGN</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BALLOON ANIMAL, BOUNCY CASTLE, WATER WINGS, WHOOPEE CUSHION</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – JIGSAW PUZZLE, LEGO SET, LITE-BRITE, PICK-UP STICKS</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – DARK HORSE, FUNKY CHICKEN, JUMBO SHRIMP, SEA MONKEY</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-liquidates-rtx-5070-gpus-asus-model-at-new-record-low-for-early-black-friday-2000640678</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your current graphics card struggles to maintain 60fps on modern AAA games and forces you to lower settings until everything looks like a PlayStation 3 title from 2008. The good news is that the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5293/">Asus GeForce RTX 5070 just dropped to $584 from $739 on Amazon, offering 12GB of GDDR7 memory and Nvidia’s latest architecture for the lowest price this card has ever seen</a>. That’s flagship gaming performance before the holiday rush clears inventory, and gives you the horsepower to max out Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5293/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Raw Power That Delivers 4K Gaming</h2>
<p>The RTX 5070 has 12GB of GDDR7 memory running on a 192-bit bus which delivers <strong>huge bandwidth for textures, shadows and ray-traced reflections</strong> that the older cards choke on. Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace architecture brings third-generation RT cores and ups performance for ray tracing three times over previous generations, and allows you to actually enable those gorgeous lighting effects without watching your framerate collapse.</p>



<p>The 5888 CUDA cores tear through modern game engines, pushing consistent 60+ fps at 4K resolution in demanding titles like Alan Wake 2, Starfield, and the latest Call of Duty. <strong>DLSS 3.5 with Frame Generation uses AI</strong> to create additional frames and doubles your framerate in supported games and achieves buttery-smooth 120fps gaming in graphically intense scenarios.</p>
<p>The Asus TUF design wraps this <strong>GPU in military-grade components and a protective PCB coating against dust, moisture, and static discharge</strong>. That matters with rigs that run hot during marathon gaming sessions or live in less-than-pristine environments. The triple Axial-tech fans feature a unique barrier ring design that increases air pressure by 31% compared to standard fans and pushes more cool air through the heatsink to keep temperatures under control during extended gaming.</p>



<p>PCIe 5.0 future-proofs your system for future motherboards and processors but the card works just fine in the PCIe 4.0 slots that most current systems are using. You get <strong>two HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1 outputs</strong> to support multiple 4K displays at 120Hz or one 8K monitor, depending on what you’re trying to do with multi-monitor setups or cutting-edge high-refresh displays.</p>
<p>This deal makes the RTX 5070 cheaper than many RTX 4070 Ti models at $584, with superior performance and newer technology. This is the lowest price ever, so if you’re still waiting for an excuse to upgrade from a struggling GTX or older RTX card, there’s no reason to keep suffering through low settings and choppy framerates anymore.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-dumps-its-14-inch-vivobook-at-40-off-now-cheaper-than-most-budget-laptops-2000640675</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-dumps-its-14-inch-vivobook-at-40-off-now-cheaper-than-most-budget-laptops.1341838/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Asus hardly ever runs sales on its laptops, let alone its best-sellers like those in the Vivobook series. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5292/">14-inch Vivobook is now available from Amazon for $476, down from $799</a>, and it’s an all-time low price cut for a configuration that<strong> packs 24GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and Intel’s 10-core i5-1334U processor</strong>. That’s a straight 40% discount that pushes the price of a premium ultraportable below most budget laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5292/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h3>Great Laptop in 2025</h3>
<p>Inside this Vivobook sits an Intel Core i5-1334U processor with a total of 10 cores divided between performance and efficiency architectures which boosts to 4.6GHz when you need maximum speed for more demanding tasks. This multi-core design crushes workloads that include Excel data analysis, Photoshop editing and light gaming without the stuttering usually experienced with dual-core budget laptops.</p>



<p>Heavy lifting-like compiling code or exporting videos-is left to the performance cores, while efficiency cores manage background processes and lighter tasks to conserve battery. The 24GB of DDR4 RAM means even the most strenuous multitasking-scenario virtual machines, 4K footage editing, and 50-plus browser tabs open across multiple research projects-run smoothly.</p>
<p>For this price, <strong>you get a 1TB PCIe SSD with read speeds over 3,000 MB/s</strong>. It means Windows will boot in less than 10 seconds, applications launch instantly, and you are never left waiting. With its huge storage capacity, you can hold years of documents, photos, videos, and software without being pushed onto cloud subscriptions or external drives.</p>



<p>The <strong>14-inch FHD display pushes sharp text and vibrant colors</strong> through an IPS panel with ultra-narrow bezels that maximize screen real estate. A 16:9 aspect ratio provides enough vertical space for productivity work like writing and coding without losing the widescreen format so great for streaming shows and movies. Anti-glare coating on the display reduces eye strain in marathon study sessions or all-day work sprints.</p>
<p>From a security point of view, <strong>the HD webcam includes a physical privacy shutter</strong>, which, when slid into place, physically covers the lens, offering the best and fullest assurance that no defective software or malware could turn on the camera without your knowledge. The video call quality remains clear and sharp for seamless Zoom meetings, online classes and remote collaboration.</p>



<p>The<strong> battery life extends up to 8 hours for typical use</strong>, and covers most workdays or class schedules without hunting for outlets in between.<strong> Windows 11 is pre-installed with integrated Microsoft Copilot AI</strong> to help with drafting emails, summarizing documents, creating creative content, and automating repetitive tasks using natural language-based commands. Wireless connectivity is taken care of by Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.1 to support modern peripherals, hotspots, and home networks. The <strong>port selection includes USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and a headphone jack</strong>.</p>
<p>At $476 instead of $799, this deal is the lowest price Amazon has offered on an Asus Vivobook with this configuration. Budget laptops at similar prices ship with half the RAM, a quarter of the storage and processors that struggle with anything beyond web browsing.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-1tb-hp-laptop-at-70-off-is-practically-free-amazon-adds-299-bonus-bundle-on-top-2000640664</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-1tb-hp-laptop-at-70-off-is-practically-free-amazon-adds-299-bonus-bundle-on-top.1341814/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A $2,000 laptop typically means you’re buying a MacBook Pro or high-end Windows machine with premium specs that justify the investment. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/">HP 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop originally carried that same $1,999 price tag but just crashed to $626 on Amazon</a>, and drops into mid-range laptop territory while packing specs that embarrass most competitors at double the cost.</p>
<p>The 69% discount makes this <strong>one of the best HP laptop deals of the year</strong>, delivering <strong>32GB of RAM, a full 1TB SSD, and an Intel Core i3 1315U processor</strong> that handles work and study without breaking a sweat. Amazon sweetens the deal further by<strong> throwing in an exclusive accessory kit worth $299</strong> including a mouse, laptop sleeve and other essentials you’d normally buy separately.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fantastic Specs for Everyday</h2>
<p>Inside, this laptop has an Intel Core i3 1315U processor <strong>with six cores that boost up to 4.5GHz</strong> and give you enough horsepower for video calls, document editing, web browsing with dozens of tabs and light content creation. The 10th generation architecture of the processor balances performance cores for demanding tasks with efficiency cores for background processes so that your battery lasts longer during all-day classes or work sessions.</p>
<p>Again, 32GB of DDR4 RAM ensures that multitasking is smooth even when running virtual meetings on Zoom, editing spreadsheets and keeping research tabs open all at once. Most laptops at this price point ship with 8GB of RAM that chokes under moderate workloads which makes this configuration a huge upgrade for professionals who need real multitasking capability.</p>
<p>With the 1TB SSD, you get years of document and media file storage without being forced into cloud storage subscriptions or external drives. Employing SSD technology, near-instant boot times and application launches eliminate waiting that turns productivity into procrastination. The read and write speeds of this drive make file transfers and software installations dramatically faster compared to conventional hard drives.</p>



<p>The intuitive touch further extends to an interactive <strong>15.6-inch HD touchscreen that changes how you will be working</strong> with spreadsheets and creative applications. Touch gestures-such as pinch-to-zoom, swipe navigation, and tap selection-are natural to anyone who uses a smartphone daily, which makes it easier on the learning curve for new users. The HD resolution of 1366×768 balances clarity with battery efficiency: it’s sharp enough for everyday tasks without the power-hungry requirement of 4K displays.</p>
<p>Advanced features such as BitLocker for encrypting sensitive files and Hyper-V to run virtual machines <strong>come pre-installed in Windows 11 Pro</strong>. A dedicated Copilot AI key launches Microsoft’s AI assistant in an instant to help users with everything from drafting emails and summarizing documents to generating images to automating repetitive tasks without needing to open individual apps. Wi-Fi 6 connectivity provides faster downloads, smoother streaming and more reliable connections within crowded networks.</p>



<p>The connectivity suite rounds out with two USB-A 3.0 ports for legacy devices, a single USB-C 3.0 port for modern peripherals and fast data transfer, and an HDMI port for easy connecting of external monitors or projectors during presentations.</p>
<p>At $626 instead of $1,999, this deal represents the steepest discount Amazon has offered on a fully-equipped HP laptop with these specifications. The included $299 accessory kit saves you from having to hunt for compatible mice, sleeves, and cables once your laptop arrives.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-v11-drops-to-record-low-amazon-practically-giving-it-away-for-pennies-2000640660</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-v11-drops-to-record-low-amazon-practically-giving-it-away-for-pennies.1341802/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mid-range vacuum cleaners sell for around $400 and deliver middling performance that leaves you vacuuming the same spot three times. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">Dyson V11 cordless stick vacuum drops to $399 from $629 on Amazon</a> and puts great Dyson engineering at the exact price point where most people settle for inferior suction and frustrating battery life. This <strong>all-time low means you’re paying mid-range money for a flagship vacuum</strong> that actually picks up everything in one pass instead of pushing debris around like a broom with commitment issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Suction Power That Works on Real Dirt</h2>
<p>The Dyson V11 generates <strong>185 Air Watts of suction through its Dyson Hyperdymium motor</strong> which spins at 125,000 rpm to create cyclonic forces that capture 99.97% of particles down to 0.3 microns. That microscopic filtration traps allergens, dust mites and pet dander instead of blowing them back into your air like cheap vacuums with inadequate sealing.</p>



<p>The fully sealed filtration system ensures what gets sucked in stays trapped in the bin rather than escaping through gaps and vents. <strong>Three cleaning modes adjust power output based on floor type</strong>: Eco mode conserves battery for light cleaning, Auto mode intelligently adapts suction to different surfaces, and Boost mode delivers maximum power for ground-in dirt and stubborn pet hair.</p>
<p>The torque drive cleaner head features stiff nylon bristles that dig into carpet fibers to extract embedded debris while anti-static carbon fiber filaments capture fine dust from hard floors without scratching. Dynamic Load Sensor technology automatically detects floor type and adjusts suction power in real time, so you’re never wasting battery on bare floors or leaving dirt in carpets.</p>



<p><strong>Battery runtime reaches up to 60 minutes in Eco mode</strong> with non-motorized tools and covers most homes in a single charge without the anxiety of dying mid-clean. The seven-cell lithium-ion battery delivers fade-free power that maintains consistent suction from full charge until the last minute, eliminating the frustrating power drop that plagues cheaper cordless models. The LCD screen displays remaining runtime in real time based on your current power mode and attachment, so you know exactly how much cleaning time remains.</p>
<p>The point-and-shoot bin emptying mechanism ejects dirt with a single push and keeps your hands away from dust and allergens. The 0.2-gallon bin capacity handles typical cleaning sessions without constant trips to the trash can, though homes with multiple shedding pets may need more frequent emptying. The hair screw tool features a conical brush bar that spirals hair off and into the bin instead of tangling around bristles like traditional attachments.</p>



<p>The vacuum <strong>converts from stick to handheld configuration in seconds</strong> by removing the wand, transforming it into a powerful tool for stairs, upholstery and car interiors. <strong>Six included attachments</strong> cover every cleaning scenario: the combination tool for quick dusting, crevice tool for tight gaps, mini motorized tool for upholstery, soft dusting brush for delicate surfaces, stubborn dirt brush for dried-on messes, and up-top adapter for high-reach cleaning. Wall-mounted docking station charges the vacuum and stores all attachments in one organized location, eliminating the tangle of tools stuffed in closets.</p>
<p>At $399 instead of $629, this deal delivers Dyson’s flagship cordless performance at the price point where competitors offer vacuums that struggle with basic cleaning tasks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Screenshots of the canceled Xbox exclusive Contraband have surfaced online. With the new look, we see what the multiplayer game could’ve looked like had it come out. </p>



<p>The game, created by Just Cause’s Avalanche Studios, was revealed in 2021 with a neat trailer. We never saw gameplay, as it was just a teaser, but it seems the game was doing fine <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/job-listing-shows-contraband-is-still-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">behind the scenes</a>. However, infrequent updates and notable absences from presentations hinted that development may not have been going well. In August, it was confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">active development had stopped</a> to evaluate the game’s future. Furthermore, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avalanche-studios-closes-office-lays-off-staff-after-contraband-cancelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many were laid off</a> due to the move, seemingly ending the game for good. Now, we have a clue as to what it would’ve looked like.</p>



<h2 id="h-contraband-would-ve-had-four-player-multiplayer-and-stylized-graphics-screenshots-reveal">Contraband Would’ve Had Four-Player Multiplayer and Stylized Graphics, Screenshots Reveal</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Contraband - Official Reveal Trailer 4K | E3 2021" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5qlGpqHggw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>A portfolio of one of Contraband’s UI artists was found online. In it, new screenshots of the canceled game’s UI and design are shown. Furthermore, we see the vision that Avalanche was going for with the design. <br></p>



<p>The pictures, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pqZvhpr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available here</a>, show off a retro-like art style for the character models and typeface, reminiscent of the late 1900s. We also see how the game would’ve been done, with players joining sessions and teaming up in groups of four to tackle maps. One of the maps, Downtown, is seen in one of the photos and may show what it would’ve looked like in-game.<a href="https://imgur.com/a/pqZvhpr"></a></p>



<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/pqZvhpr"></a>It’s important to note that, even if true, take it with a grain of salt.&nbsp;As mentioned before, no gameplay has been released, so this may be the best we’ll have for a while. Still, it’s cool to see what could’ve been for the multiplayer game. It hasn’t been outright canceled, though it likely has given the lack of updates, so perhaps things could work out. If so, we could have one of Xbox’s most unique titles in a while.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-creator-pondsmith-keanu-reeves-2077-sequel/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-creator-on-keanu-reeves-in-2077-sequel-%E2%80%9Ccontact-me%E2%80%9D.1341775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The creator of Cyberpunk wants Keanu Reeves back for Cyberpunk 2077’s upcoming sequel, despite how the story goes. Furthermore, he said he ‘has ways of bringing him back’.</p>



<p>Released in 1998, the Cyberpunk tabletop game, created by Mike Pondsmith, has been a staple of TTRPG fans for decades. In 2020, CD Projekt Red, known for The Witcher series, brought the edgy techno-dystopian world to gaming. While mixed at launch, subsequent updates, and a brilliant anime adaptation (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-another-new-netflix-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a>) made the game a must-play. If you were around during the late 2010s, you know how huge the hype was, especially when Hollywood icon Keanu Reeves was announced as Johnny Silverhand. His portrayal of the rebel rockstar was a highlight for many, given how much time the player spends with him. Unfortunately, the endings don’t leave much room for the rocker to continue. However, it seems the creator may have a way to bring him back.</p>



<h2 id="h-mike-pondsmith-wants-keanu-reeves-back-for-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">Mike Pondsmith Wants Keanu Reeves Back for Cyberpunk 2077 Sequel</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="REDstreams special — Interview with Mike Pondsmith" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_HsIlaqMkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a livestream from CD Projekt Red, Mike Pondsmith, the TTRPG creator, joined the crew to discuss Cyberpunk 2077. When talking about Keanu Reeves’ portrayal as Johnny Silverhand (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc?si=07ai4guwLhOQuEPL&amp;t=3619">at around the hour mark</a>), he said,</p>



<p>“<strong>Not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again</strong>,” Pondsmith states. “<strong>I have ways to do that, Keanu, contact me.</strong>“</p>



<p>Given the DLC was able to get Idris Elba and it’s worldwide success, it’s not suprising that the John Wick star would want to return. If Mike Pondsmith wants him back and can make it happen, then we may have it happen. All we know about Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel is that it’s in development, but no set release window. CD Projekt Red is currently working on The Witcher 4, but, for Cyberpunk fans, Cyberpunk Edgerunners 2 is in production, so it won’t be long before we return to Night City.</p>



<p>Do you want Johnny Silverhand to return for Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel? How do you think he’ll come back? Did you enjoy Cyberpunk 2077? Phantom Liberty?

<p>Use these Brainrot Tsunami monthly redeem codes for October 2025 to get free rewards in the game, including in-game currencies as well as potions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brainrot Tsunami is often described as a weird <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-raise-animals-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> simulator game where players must navigate tsunami waves and run through the map. Starting with a low speed, players are tasked with training to improve their pace, thereby making the process of dodging the tsunami waves that much easier. Another key mechanic in the game requires players to train with Brainrots. The game also allows players to spawn special tsunami waves, which can be used to troll the competition. As simple as the gameplay sounds, there is a decent amount of strategy involved, and with that in mind, any way to get ahead of the other players must be considered. That’s exactly where these codes will come into the picture.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-brainrot-tsunami-codes">Expired Brainrot Tsunami Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Brainrot Tsunami. However, as soon as one of the active codes expires, we will immediately update this page to indicate that. Players are hence urged to redeem the active codes as soon as possible, as there is no fixed timeline for their validity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike many Roblox games today, redeeming codes in Brainrot Tsunami is a fairly straightforward process. The developers haven’t imposed any prerequisite steps on the players, in that all they have to redeem the codes is navigate through the menus and input one of the active codes given above into the correct text box. For players who may be new to the Roblox ecosystem though, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide on how to redeem codes in this game:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Brainrot Tsunami.</li>



<li>Click on the shop button on the left side of the screen.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Codes’ tab.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box that pops up.</li>



<li>Click the ‘Verify’ button to claim your rewards.</li>
</ol>

<p>Brainrot Tsunami recently had an update, but unfortunately for players, they didn’t release any new codes. However, fans of the game mustn’t lose hope, as the developers are still working on the game, which means that new codes are likely on the horizon. New codes are often released through the game’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ycveZcDGFV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a> or through the Roblox game page. However, to make staying up to date with the codes easier, we recommend that you keep this page bookmarked. We update this article as soon as any new codes drop, so check in every once in a while to maximise the number of rewards you can get.</p>
