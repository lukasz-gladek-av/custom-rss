            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Canadian developer Eidos Montréal has laid off 75 employees. The studio <a href="https://x.com/EidosMontreal/status/1906728993061020142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the news with the following message shared on social media channels:</p>
<p><em>Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end. It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services. These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition. Eidos Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development.</em></p>
<p>Besides the unfortunate (albeit sadly common in the industry lately) fact that people are losing their jobs, the message's wording is definitely interesting. Eidos Montréal singled out the end of a specific work commission as the cause of the layoffs, and the mind cannot but go to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-studio-eidos-montreal-is-helping-out-on-xboxs-fable-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> that the developer had been helping out Playground Games with the Fable reboot. While the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to 2026 earlier this year, it was originally supposed to launch in 2025. It's possible and even likely that Fable is now content complete and Playground Games simply does not need any further help from the Canadian studio as it approaches the polishing phase.</p>
<p>Still, it's unfortunate that Eidos Montréal could not reassign those employees to its other projects. This is not the studio's only recent round of layoffs; it also had to cut 97 employees in January 2024 following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancellation of a new Deus Ex game</a>. It is unclear what else the studio might be working on right now; its latest game is still the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-what-kind-of-name-is-avengers-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underrated Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, sister studio Crystal Dynamics, which worked closely with Eidos Montréal on projects like Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Marvel's Avengers, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-team-members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the removal of 17 employees. Crystal Dynamics is also helping out with the reboot of a Microsoft-owned IP, <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-a-collaborative-effort-between-the-initiative-and-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Dark</a>, in collaboration with The Initiative.</p>

<p>Ubisoft’s stock is falling again. Just days after the French-based publisher announced a deal for a new subsidiary in partnership with Tencent, the company’s stock fell by double digits on Monday.</p>



<p>Looking at the markets in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), and France, the company’s stock fell by at least 11.80%. As of <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/market-stock/0NVL/ubisoft-entertainment-sa/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">closing in the UK</a>, Ubisoft was trading for €11.19 compared to the €12.15 it opened at. In France, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ubi?countrycode=fr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stock prices fell</a> 12.06% down to €11.16.</p>



<p>The fall fully erases the 11% gain the company saw in stock prices on Friday, less than a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">day after it was announced</a>.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-exclusive-yves-guillemot-s-internal-memo-on-ubisoft-and-tencent-s-new-subsidiary">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXCLUSIVE – Yves Guillemot’s Internal Memo on Ubisoft and Tencent’s New Subsidiary</a></h6>



<p>Shortly after the deal was announced, multiple employees reached out to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-worried-about-layoffs-after-tencent-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">express worry over layoffs</a> at Ubisoft for those not working on the included franchises.</p>



<p>Ubisoft says that it expects the deal with Tencent for the new subsidiary to be completed before the end of 2025. When it closes, Ubisoft will maintain 75% control of the new company that includes Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry games.</p>

<p>ASUS is teasing something big for its Republic of Gamers (ROG) lineup on social media. In a short video teaser posted on Monday afternoon, ASUS teased what’s next for the ROG Ally. And what’s next is expected to be the rumored ASUS Xbox handheld currently known as Project Kennan.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-launching-partner-gaming-handheld-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors</a> and reports, this device isn’t going to be the standalone Xbox handheld that Microsoft is actively working on. Instead, it’s going to be a third-party device that will include Xbox branding.</p>







<p>Specifics on what the device will be remain scarce, including exact details on how it will fit as an Xbox device. A recent report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-is-partnering-with-asus-for-upcoming-gaming-handheld-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Central</a> seemed to make it clear that the system won’t play Xbox games as it will be a “tried-and-true Windows PC in essence”. Instead, it will be act like the current ROG Ally while featuring an Xbox Guide button and “more prominent grips”.</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s also unknown if it will feature any other spec updates over the original ROG Ally or will be similar to the anticipated ROG Ally 2.</p>



<p>What do you think the ASUS-Xbox Handheld known as Project Kennan will include? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows launched on March 20, and it got off to a hot start in the US. The game was the best-selling title overall in the US during its launch week, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3llom4qat5c2g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to analyst Mat Piscatella of Circana</a>. This counts sales through March 22, so Shadows achieved this after only three days.</p><p>Piscatella added that, after three days of sales, Shadows is already one of the top five best-selling games of 2025 in the US based on dollars. In terms of a comparison, Piscatella pointed out that only Capcom's Monster Hunter: Wilds had a better first week in terms of dollar sales in 2025 so far.</p><p>Wilds is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">No. 1 best-selling game of 2025 so far in the US</a>. March's complete sales data for the US will be published by Circana on April 23, at which point we will have a better picture of how Shadows sold in March and how it compares to other titles in the

<p>Fighting mobs is fun, but we’re after The First Berserker Khazan’s bosses for the tense, multi-hour fights that leave you wanting to pummel your controller. We’ve rounded up every main boss fight in the game and can tell you how many there are.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-trophy-list-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is one of the hardest Soulslikes I’ve ever played. I’m not sure how Neople managed it, but they’ve put together a collection of unique, challenging, and rewarding boss fights. Very rarely are they unfair, either—a rarity, as when I die in a Souls game, I blame anyone but myself.</p>



<p>The boss fights in Khazan are fantastic. If you’re just starting or wondering how many are left, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-bosses-are-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">How Many Bosses Are in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This guy… Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 16 main bosses and a further 10 optional side bosses in The First Berserker Khazan.</strong></p>



<p>If you want to beat <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The First Berserker Khazan</a>, you need to overcome 16 boss fights. Encounters can have several phases, and enemies have a large moveset of attacks they inevitably cycle through.</p>



<p>I had the pain of fighting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-nerfs-hardest-bosses-in-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-patch Viper before it was nerfed</a>, and I can tell you I spent <em>over 2 hours</em> on this fight alone! Your mileage will vary depending on your ability, your patience, and how adept you are at studying and memorizing attacks.</p>



<p>Also, there are ways to make particular boss fights easier. <strong>The Aratra fight—for example—requires you to target the enemy’s weak points</strong> to inflict massive damage. If you coordinate your attack well enough, you can lop off its limbs simultaneously and bring yourself very close to the finishing line.</p>

<p>Eidos-Montreal, a development studio known for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and support on games like Marvel’s Avengers and Tomb Raider, has announced a wave of large-scale layoffs.</p>



<p>The Embracer-owned studio posted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eidosmontreal_nous-avons-inform%C3%A9-aujourdhui-les-membres-activity-7312494582850543616-TzUD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> on Monday afternoon that it was letting go 75 employees.</p>



<p>“Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end,” the article reads. “It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.</p>



<p>“These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition.”</p>



<p>The studio closed its statement saying that it was “committed to deliver” the projects it has currently in development.</p>



<p>Currently, Eidos-Montreal is supporting Playground Games on the Fable reboot that is scheduled to launch in 2026. The game’s delay into 2026 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recently announced</a> by Playground Games.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Embracer Group about the layoffs at Eidos-Montreal and whether the Fable delay had anything to do with the decision. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article.</p>



<p>What do you make of the layoffs at Eidos-Montreal? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1796/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

Just weeks after an "amazing" <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>-themed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> mod drew praise from Larian Studios co-founder Swen Vincke, it's been targeted by lawyers representing Dungeons &amp; Dragons company Wizards of the Coast, and hit with a DMCA takedown.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-baldurs-gate-3-mod-gives-you-another-way-to-romance-sultry-vampire-astarion">Baldur's Village mod released earlier this month</a> after more than a year in development, giving players the chance to explore a new village north of Stardew Valley's Pelican Town that's populated by some "rather unusual" residents. Its Baldur's Gate 3-inspired additions included a romanceable Astarion, alongside a new tavern and more.
</p>
<p>
At the time, its creator, Xun, said the release was just the start, with a storyline for Halsin also planned in addition to more "world-building, background stories, and gameplay". But even this initial version was enough to catch Larian boss Swen Vincke's eye, and he <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1898633725417504953">shared its release on social media</a>, writing, "So much love went into this - amazing work!"

<p>
Unfortunately, it seems Dungeons &amp; Dragons' license holder Wizards of the Coast was less impressed by the whole thing, and Baldur's Village has now vanished from modding website NexusMods after the company's laweyers hit it with a DMCA takedown over the weekend.
</p>
<p>
In a statement <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wizards-of-the-coast-scores-pr-masterstroke-bullies-bg3-stardew-mod-that-had-swen-vinckes-personal-approval-off-the-internet-with-a-dmca/">provided to PC Gamer</a>, Nexus Mods described Baldur's Village - which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888">remains "under moderation review" on the site</a> at the time of writing - as an "an incredibly creative cross-over to Stardew Valley that the community loves|. It optimistically added, "Hopefully, this is an oversight from WotC, who often use external agencies to hunt down violating content, and they will revert their decision. Fingers crossed for Baldur's Village."
</p>
<p>
Larian's Swen Vincke also <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219">shared his thoughts on social media</a>. "Free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth," he wrote. "IMHO they shouldn't be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property. Protecting your IP can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled. There are good ways of dealing with this."
</p>
<p>
Wizards of the Coast and parent company Hasbro have, of course, expressed considerable interest in continuing the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> franchise following the mega-success of Baldur's Gate 3 - despite the fact Larian won't be attached after it instead opted to focus on its own IP.
</p>

Earlier this month, Hasbro <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">insisted there are plenty of other developers "very interested" in continuing the series</a>. "We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that," it added. "And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."

As a game about learning to see reality and Senua's visions as one and the same, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hellblade II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> delivers an experience that utilizes unique visual and, most especially, audio effects that emphasize the protagonist's state of mind throughout her journey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the 2025 Game Developers Conference, Ninja Theory principal sound designer Daniele Galante gave a detailed presentation on the sound design of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and how the original game's innovative use of binaural audio was expanded for the sequel. In addition to breaking down how actors performed their sessions with binaural audio setups, the sound designer explained the challenges and benefits of heightened sound design for games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Creating a hallucinatory soundscape">Creating a hallucinatory soundscape</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developer Ninja Theory has built quite a pedigree for crafting games with rich visual styles and impressive sound design. The original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hellblade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> received significant praise for not only being a game with a modest budget and scope but also for how the developers managed to push their resources to produce a visually stunning game with stellar audio design and clever use of binaural audio – audio design that re-creates sound within a 3D space.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/supergiant-denies-recasting-hades-ii-actor-over-interim-sag-aftra-contract-request" target="_self" data-discover="true">Supergiant denies recasting Hades II actor over interim SAG-AFTRA contract request</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Senua's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Saga: Hellblade II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Ninja Theory received more resources and a larger team to make a more high-end follow-up, and the sound design was one area that the developers wanted to improve upon. Throughout the game, Senua battles foes from rival clans and other unsettling foes—but her journey is fraught with visual and auditory hallucinations that turn her already dire circumstances into a harrowing ordeal. Ultimately, she uses her survival skills and perception to center herself, and by the game's end, she once again accepts herself and comes to terms with traumas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Galante, continuing with the use of binaural audio was necessary as it allowed them to help players get a better understanding of how individuals hear auditory hallucinations and to immerse them within Senua's perspective.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Many people think that you hear [auditory hallucinations] inside your head, but that's not accurate." In most peoples' experiences, they hear voices around them, very much like how I'm speaking to you or when we talk to each other," said Galante. "Using binaural audio was an obvious choice because we want to reproduce these voices around the player to get them within this experience. On top of that, we can give our performers a very powerful tool, which is their body language movement. They usually cannot use it when they play video games. They have to stand in front of the mic, which is a powerful tool. They have to fill their performance with more emotion, and because of that, we found that actors with a theater background usually work very well with binaural audio."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord-composer-winifred-phillips-wins-grammy-award" target="_self" data-discover="true">Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord composer Winifred Phillips wins Grammy award</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Galante explained with several videos in his presentation, the actors playing the Furies (Abbi Greenland and Helen Goalen)—the voices that Senua hears throughout the game – performed their lines while also moving around a Neumann KU 100 Binaural Dummy Head mic during the capture sessions—treating the mic as if it were Senua and both the player. The special mic simulates the average-sized head and captures sound in a 3D space, but Galante made a point to mention that the effectiveness of binaural audio tends to vary for some people, and he stressed the best way to experience the game's sound design is with headphones.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sound drives story, but story is “king”">Sound drives story, but story is “king”</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One note that Galante stressed was that the game's audio design had to serve the storytelling. For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hellblade II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the principal sound designer treated the binaural audio recordings from the actors as if it were an acoustic instrument. The reverb created from the performers' voices and the sound designers adjusting it in post-production with Visual Studio Technology (VST) helped put players in the state of mind that Senua was in.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/deep-dive-sound-design-for-the-living-world-in-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora" target="_self" data-discover="true">Deep Dive: Sound design for the living world in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The use of non-verbal voice capture – to create eerie noises and other off-putting sounds—proved especially important in helping to create an unsettling mood, all in service of Senua's perspective. Actor Edward Spence provided voice lines and non-verbal audio for a sequence where Senua travels through a sunken cave filled with the voices of the dead reaching out to her.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our voice is an extremely powerful instrument, and we should use it more when we do sound design," he said. "We also record nondialect stuff, so any possible noise you can make with your mouth is there because we want to be experimental and take it to the player's brain and make them feel uncomfortable. Because when we hear a voice that is not supposed to be there, that can make you feel weirded out by it."</span></p><p>Image via Ninja Theory/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ninja Theory/Microsoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the major sequences in Ninja Theory's sequel was Seuna's confrontation with the Tyrant—an emotionally challenging and brutal boss battle against the protagonist's father. To present this boss battle as a sequence where Senua confronts a major source of trauma and abuse in her life, the developers combined the voices of six different voice actors to make the voice of the Tyrant. They utilized the 3D audio effects to give the sequence an oppressive and all-consuming feel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Galante later stated that, despite the massive benefits of binaural audio for immersion, it also presents several challenges. In addition to being time-consuming to produce, extensive post-production work is required to ensure the binaural audio works in the game for general audiences. Most importantly, Galante stated you need to have a clear vision of what you want to do when recording, as 3D audio is set in stone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One mistake the Ninja Theory sound designer made came early into the making of the audio design for the Tyrant battle, and it was because the rest of the team didn't have a specific vision for what the fight would be like. When he revisited the first actor's recording following the team having a clearer idea of how the encounter would play out he found it wasn't quite suitable for the new concept, and he had to do the painstaking process of readjusting the 3D audio, which meant duplicating the track and inverting and altering the sound to make it work for the concept of six different actors providing voices for the sequence.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, he remarked that binaural audio has tremendous advantages for immersing players in the game. Still, because there have not been many uses in the creative fields, it can be challenging to find a clear vision and roadmap for its uses, but he expressed that it was worth trying and that he hoped more developers would try to pursue it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For now, there's not much documentation regarding binaural audio on the creative side as it's mostly used for scientific purposes and not often in a creative field," said Galante.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gdc-awards-deck-nine-laid-off-developers-life-is-strange-double-exposure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Contrasted against the <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2024-future-class-game-changer-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ever-unsatisfactory brouhaha</a> of Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards, the annual GDC Awards in San Francisco are an oasis: a relatively quiet night of industry professionals honoring each others’ accomplishments. This year, however, the main headlines coming out of the show were not exactly positive, though they were certainly telling: Variations on “No One Was Around To Collect <em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em>'s Award For Social Impact Following Layoffs” circulated a couple days after the show, painting a grim picture of a night meant to be celebratory. But while the broad arc of those stories was correct, they didn’t quite nail the particulars.&nbsp;</p><p>Though articles on sites like <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/we-all-got-laid-off-says-former-deck-nine-narrative-designer-after-no-one-was-around-to-pick-up-life-is-strange-double-exposures-gdc-awards-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/life-strange-double-exposure-award-gdc-2025-layoffs-1851771282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku</a> clarified in their body text that some former Deck Nine employees were present at GDC, a narrative prevailed that nobody who worked on <em>Double Exposure</em> was in the room when the big moment happened – that nothing more could’ve been done. This is incorrect.</p><p>"On the night of the GDC Awards, I was in the audience, sitting in the section meant for the general public," narrative designer Giselle Francis told Aftermath. "I was unaware that anything I had worked on had been nominated and had kind of went on a whim. When we won the award for Social Impact, and [presenter] Jay [Justice] announced that ‘The team was unable to be here this evening,’ I felt like I was going insane because I was right there! I was stunned and confused and hurt and angry. No one had told me anything. No one had given me the choice. If they had, I would have gladly gone on stage to accept the award."&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I felt like I was going insane because I was right there!</p></blockquote></figure><p>Francis has publicly taken issue with the way publications and pundits framed the moment because, well, she’s not “no one.” "So often Black people are erased from our accomplishments and from the conversation,” she <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bewarethesiren.bsky.social/post/3ll5j35iwz22r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Bluesky</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On <a href="https://gdconf.com/gdca#:~:text=Social%20Impact%20Award,players%20in%20a%20meaningful%20way." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its official website</a>, GDC says the Social Impact award is meant to recognize “a game that advances equality, justice, intersectionality, and/or sustainability, and works to positively impact the lives of its players in a meaningful way.” Though Deck Nine is not the original creator of the<em> Life Is Strange</em> series, a previous entry developed by the studio, <em>Life Is Strange: True Colors</em>, won the Games For Impact award at the Game Awards in 2021, as well as a GLAAD Media Award in 2022. Despite this impressive track record, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-hidden-nazi-symbols-were-the-tip-of-a-toxic-iceberg-at-life-is-strange-developer-deck-nine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2024 report from IGN</a> suggested that management wasn’t so supportive behind the scenes and allowed a toxic work environment to fester at the studio. According to the report, Deck Nine’s C-suite “protected multiple abusive leaders, encouraged crunch, and allowed bullying of individuals advocating internally for more authentic representation in<em> Life Is Strange</em>."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the past couple years, Deck Nine has been hit hard by layoffs, cutting around 30 employees <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/life-is-strange-dev-deck-nine-games-hit-with-staff-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in May 2023</a>, letting go of around 20 percent of remaining staff <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-true-colors-studio-deck-nine-lays-off-20-of-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in early 2024</a>, and then parting ways with an unspecified number of additional employees <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-double-exposure-developer-deck-nine-announces-its-second-round-of-layoffs-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in December 2024</a>. "This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing," CEO Mark Lyons <a href="https://x.com/DeckNineGames/status/1865138496601575468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a statement</a> at the time of the most recent round of layoffs.</p><p>Francis told Aftermath that upon realizing that Deck Nine had failed to coordinate with current or former employees to accept the award, she began messaging members of her old team, at least five of whom were in town for GDC. It was only after Francis and others sounded alarm bells <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bewarethesiren.bsky.social/post/3lkrtg24ugs2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Bluesky</a> that Justice, the writer, game dev, and accessibility-focused consultant who presented the award, realized what was going on.</p><p>"As the presenter for the Social Impact award at the GDCAs, I was not told who the winner would be in advance. I found out as I read the teleprompter, at the same time as everyone else,” Justice told Aftermath. “I had been told in rehearsals that the – at the time, unnamed – winner would not be there, but I know Giselle, I knew she had worked on [<em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em>], and I knew she was attending GDC this year, though I did not know she was in the audience at this time. So after I read the name I realized there was at least one person who could have accepted it. Still, with seconds to keep the show running on time, I took the award backstage and handed it off to event staff. I then checked my phone, where on Bluesky I had been tagged in a thread where another developer who worked on [<em>Double Exposure</em>] commented about winning the award."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Imagine what it could have done for our careers if we had been allowed to go on stage and speak? To have our faces streamed out to the thousands of people who were watching?</p></blockquote></figure><p>Justice proceeded to invite Francis and other former Deck Nine employees backstage for a photoshoot. They were then allowed to collect the award, spend the final 30 minutes of the show in the VIP section, and attend the GDC Awards afterparty, same as other nominees.&nbsp;</p><p>But as far as Francis is concerned, the kerfuffle still proved consequential.</p><p>“I keep thinking about all of the opportunities that were denied to us because of our exclusion,” she said. “All of us have since [we worked on <em>Double Exposure</em>] been laid off from Deck Nine, and most of us are still looking for jobs. I have been out of work for a year. Imagine what it could have done for our careers if we had been allowed to go on stage and speak? To have our faces streamed out to the thousands of people who were watching? To get a seat in the VIP section and actual time to mingle with the executives who might have been looking to hire?”</p><p>Another ex-Deck Nine employee who attended GDC, former staff writer Alice Camp, backed up Francis’ account of events, noting that in her estimate, at least nine current and former Deck Nine devs were present at GDC – including COO Jeff Litchford, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7306008799817912320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on LinkedIn</a> about attending the conference. Further, she told Aftermath that awards show organizers let ex-employees know the next day that Deck Nine had been informed about the nomination, even as studio co-owner Lucie Lyons <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lucielyons.bsky.social/post/3lkvkjzd6f22g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Bluesky</a> that she and others “were not aware.” “So glad you were there to accept the award,” she said in response to a since-deleted post from an ex-employee.</p><p>Based on Deck Nine’s actions and Lyons’ supportive reply, ex-employees in attendance assumed that the studio was not interested in receiving the award and decided it should go to a former lead whom they felt contributed a notable amount to <em>Double Exposure</em>’s social impact, but who had not traveled to GDC. However, on GDC’s final day, they received word from organizers that Deck Nine wanted the award after all – and that former employees would have to return it.&nbsp;</p><p>"When we heard from GDC that we needed to return the award, we thought there might've been a misunderstanding, so we tried to get in contact with someone at [Deck Nine],” said Camp. “The person we got through to told us that Jeff Litchford had just gotten on the plane and wouldn't be reachable until after the deadline GDC gave us. Later, a GDC organizer clarified for us that [Deck Nine] had in fact contacted them to ask for it back, so we returned it."</p><p>“We were forced to give the award back, and… it was because [Deck Nine] demanded it,” said Francis.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Personally, I've been out of a job for an entire year.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Aftermath reached out to Deck Nine and GDC for additional details, but the former did not reply as of this publishing, and the latter declined to comment on record.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bewarethesiren.bsky.social/post/3ll5j35wljs2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On Bluesky</a>, Francis published the speech she would have given had she been able to come up on stage and accept the award.</p><p>"I did not prepare a speech because I did not even know we were nominated. But I am truly honored to accept this award on behalf of my amazing team,” she wrote, also thanking her narrative team colleagues by name. “When I was first getting into this industry, I was a college student, unsure of whether or not to change my major. The original <em>Life Is Strange</em> was one of the games that made that decision for me, so it was a full circle moment and an honor for me to get to work on this game: bruises, bumps, and all. … And to all of you out there with narrative jobs: all of these amazing people were let go, including myself. Personally, I've been out of a job for an entire year. We are all talented, award-winning writers and you won't regret having us on your team. So please, hire us.

Her defensive Ultimate helps your team and hurts your enemies at the same time with only one real weakness, and her healing primary attack has limited aim assist. She’s a great healer to get started with. Cloak, on the other hand, is somewhat similar to Scarlet Witch, who is a Duelist. He has a mid-range attack that deals steady damage, but he can also debuff enemies, reducing their visibility, dealing damage, and causing them to take more damage for a time. He also has an ability that grants invincibility for a few seconds. </p><p>Since you can instantly switch between them, fans of both healing and damaging will find a lot to love about this pair.</p><h2 id="h197240"><a id="play"></a>How should you play Cloak &amp; Dagger?</h2><p>Dagger is a very approachable healer since you don’t need to have great aim to heal well with her Lightforce Daggers bounce and bend towards allies and enemies.</p><figure id="" data-id="d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-recommend-id="image://d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Brian Barnett / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-recommend-id="image://d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In spite of this, there is still skill required to play her and her comrade to their maximum potential—and much of that involves how much time you spend playing as Cloak.

Bounces towards enemies and allies, damaging enemies and healing allies. A very easy attack to use, and one you should be constantly holding down. It needs a reload, but you can quickly switch to Cloak and back again to reload faster.</li><li><strong>Eternal Bond (Ultimate): </strong>Same as Dagger’s.</li><li><strong>Shadow’s Embrace: </strong>Switches to Cloak. Switching to Cloak and back again will reload Lightforce Dagger slightly faster than the standard reload animation.</li><li><strong>Light Explosion:</strong> Throw a large rectangle of light towards your target, healing them a slight amount and boosting subsequent healing they receive. Use this on enemies who are getting hurt a lot before using Lightforce Dagger or Dagger Storm on them.</li><li><strong>Dagger Storm:</strong> Throw a ball of light that expands into a dome, healing all allies within it over time. The primary way Dagger can heal herself, so throw it at your feet if you are getting hurt and the other Strategist is far away. You can also switch to Cloak after creating Dagger Storm to fight back against approaching Dualists like Spider-Man, and more.</li><li><strong>From Shadow To Light (Team-Up: Passive):</strong> Teaming up with Moon Knight will give him the ability to create a sphere of invisibility for himself.</li></ul><h2 id="h197242"><a id="cloak"></a>What are Cloak’s Abilities?</h2><figure id="" data-id="5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-recommend-id="image://5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Cloak's abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Cloak's abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Brian Barnett / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-recommend-id="image://5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Cloak's abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Darkforce Cloak: </strong>Your primary attack. Like Scarlet Witch, this ability deals constant damage to enemies who are in the close and mid-range. So long as you hold the button down, and aim near the enemy, they’ll keep taking damage. A great way to strike back at enemies trying to take Dagger out.</li><li><strong>Eternal Bond (Ultimate):</strong> Same as Dagger’s. Four dashes, each aimable, lay down a Light/Dark power on the ground, damaging all enemies and healing all allies standing on it. A very powerful Ultimate ability, and one which charges very quickly. Be aware that enemies like Magneto can kill you in-between dashes, so try to have a teammate like Punisher or Star Lord bait it out before you use this, or have a Loki on your team to have two Eternal Bonds.</li><li><strong>Light’s Embrace:</strong> Switches to Dagger.</li><li><strong>Terror Cape: </strong>Throws a rectangle of dark energy in the direction you are aiming, significantly reducing visibility for enemies struck with it. Also deals damage and makes them Vulnerable, making them take more damage from all sources for a time. Use this every 12 seconds, when it comes off cooldown, against the most vulnerable targets on the enemy team.</li><li><strong>Dark Teleportation: </strong>Causes yourself, and nearby allies, to become invisible, untargetable, and quicker movement speed. A well-timed Dark Teleportation can completely negate certain enemy Ultimate abilities. Iron Man shooting his ultimate at your team? Switch to Cloak and use this ability, and you’ll take no damage. It only lasts a moment, so your timing will need to be precise.</li><li><strong>From Shadow To Light (Team-Up: Passive): </strong>Teaming up with Moon Knight will give him the ability to create a sphere of invisibility for himself.</li></ul><hr><p>With all these tips in hand, you are prepared to become a true master of both light and dark. Good luck!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But nobody seems to be talking about how great the Yankees performed over the weekend; instead the conversation is entirely focused on the weird “Torpedo” bats used by some Yankee players like shortstop Anthony Volpe, who hit two home runs over the weekend. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/did-yankees-physicist-designed-torpedo-bats-play-role-in-9-hr-power-surge-vs-brewers-224436396.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/did-yankees-physicist-designed-torpedo-bats-play-role-in-9-hr-power-surge-vs-brewers-224436396.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Torpedo bats</a></span> look very strange when compared to the standard tube-like design of most professional baseball bats.

This tumor-like spot looks odd, but it has more mass and, the theory is, that leads to harder hits and more home runs. And so far, the bat seems to be legal based on the MLB’s rules. </p><p>“The concept makes so much sense,” said  Volpe before Sunday’s game. “I know I’m bought in. The bigger you can have the barrel where you hit the ball, it makes sense to me.”</p><p>Three other Yankee players as well as two other MLB pro players used the strange bat over the weekend, too. Yet not all of them hit multiple home runs. Meanwhile, Yankee player Aaron Judge was able to hit six homers over opening weekend without using the new bats. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/whats-the-deal-with-the-yankees-torpedo-bats-and-are-they-really-a-competitive-advantage-000747259.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/whats-the-deal-with-the-yankees-torpedo-bats-and-are-they-really-a-competitive-advantage-000747259.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>Yahoo Sports</em></a></span>, when asked about the new bats, Judge said: “What I did the past couple of seasons speaks for itself. Why try to change something if you have something that’s working?”</p><h2 id="h116905"><a id=""></a>Reactions to the new Torpedo bats</h2><p>Still, the Yankees hitting so many home runs while using strange new bats has ruffled some feathers, in a sport that is filled with tradition and is slow to change. At least one player for the Brewers, Trevor Megill, wasn’t happy about the opposing team using Torpedo bats over the weekend. </p><p>“I think it’s terrible,’’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/sports/brewers-closer-fumes-over-yankees-new-bowling-pin-bats/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/sports/brewers-closer-fumes-over-yankees-new-bowling-pin-bats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Megill told the <em>New York Post</em></a></span>. “We’ll see what the data says. I’ve never seen anything like it before. I feel like it’s something used in slow-pitch softball. It’s genius: Put the mass all in one spot. It might be bush [league]. It might not be. But it’s the Yankees, so they’ll let it slide.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/mlb-reactions-to-yankees-torpedo-bats-range-from-its-terrible-to-they-should-send-a-few-over-here-044054221.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/mlb-reactions-to-yankees-torpedo-bats-range-from-its-terrible-to-they-should-send-a-few-over-here-044054221.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Other players were more open to the new bat design</a></span> or suggested it might not work for everyone. </p><p>It should be noted that other teams besides the Yankees used the new bats over the weekend, and there’s some evidence that they’ve been around since last season. What makes things confusing is that the Torpedo bat isn’t a singular design, but more a new way to build bats where you place more mass in a specific spot. There’s also some debate as to how helpful they are and if they really provide a massive advantage. It still takes a lot of skill to swing a bat fast and accurately enough to hit a home run against MLB’s skilled pitchers.</p><p> Still, in a sport where even a slim advantage can be very important, that hasn’t stopped teams from taking notice. <em>Yahoo Sports</em> reports that after opening weekend, 29 other teams are now looking to optimize their own equipment to create their own Torpedo bats. </p><p> . </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Building on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-arcane-more-league-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the success of the Arcane series on Netflix</a>, Riot Games is reportedly considering a live-action project for its next series. The developers of League of Legends are also reportedly close to finalizing a shoot locations that will bring one of the game’s iconic regions to life.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-pirate-haven-of-bilgewater-be-brought-to-life-in-vietnam">Will the Pirate Haven of Bilgewater Be Brought to Life in Vietnam?</h2>



<p>According to a post from an official Vietnamese government Facebook account, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thongtinchinhphu/posts/pfbid027nU7FnBtEjTDbTviX5q83PDB2i1ojhCNd6otx6uf4bLoYmoM7cD9YyKbsR21LawTl?rdid=LoxCDuRbRi6vVDxk&amp;checkpoint_src=any#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot is planning to film</a> a nine episode television series based on League of Legends later this year. Riot is reportedly very interested in the Cát Bà Archipelago in northern Vietnam as a filming location, and could start shooting by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Among the Riot representatives that met with Vietnam’s Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism was Rose Lam, a long-time executive producer for shows like The Last of Us and Altered Carbon. According to Lam, Riot Studios surveyed many other countries in Asia including Japan, Korea, and Thailand, but found Vietnam to be the most suitable.</p>



<p>Earlier today, esports and gaming news outlet Sheep Esports <a href="https://www.sheepesports.com/en/articles/lol-rumors-of-a-live-action-series-set-to-begin-filming-in-2025/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speculated</a> that the “rugged cliffs, deep blue waters, and maritime atmosphere of Cát Bà” point toward a series that could be set in the <a href="https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/region/bilgewater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">region of Bilgewater</a>. In League of Legends’ lore, Bilgewater is a port city and pirate haven, home to several nautical or sea-faring in-game champions like Gangplank, Tahm Kench, and Miss Fortune, among others. The first two seasons of Arcane took place in the glittering, progressive city of Piltover and the dark, industrial undercity of Zaun.</p>



<p>The success of both Arcane and other live-action video game series has evidently Riot to motivation to pursue a live-action show of its own. Arcane received massive critical acclaim, especially in its first season, leading to numerous awards in the field of animation. In the past two years, two different live action shows based on games, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-best-adaptation-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a> and The Last of Us, have been met with critical acclaim and commercial success.</p>



<p>When do you think a live-action League of Legends would actually come out? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1794/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

Alongside its planned Title Updates, director Yuya Tokuda has confirmed a few additional goals the team has, as post-launch support for the latest entry in the Monter Hunter franchise carries on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/topics/director-letter/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter from the director</a>, Tokuda started by laying out the roadmap <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-everything-announced-for-title-update-1">seen in the recent Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase for Title Update 1</a> and beyond. The first big Title Update drops on April 4, this Friday. Then, the seasonal event Festival of Accord: Blossomdance runs from April 23 through May 7. Additionally, April 30 through May 21 will see the Arch-tempered Rey Dau storm into Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of May, Update Ver. 1.011 will bring an unannounced Capcom collaboration and some "other additional features." Title Update 2 is then planned for this summer, with a new additional monster and seosonal event. Tokuda confirms more free updates are arriving beyond that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A greater challenge awaits</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of the Mosnter Hunter Wilds' director's letter dug into the question of challenging monster content. Already, fights like Tempered Arkveld, the aforementioned Arch-tempered Rey Dau, and a refight with Zoh Shia are confirmed. Tokuda also confirmed Mizutsune, arriving with Title Update 1, will have an 8-star Tempered Mizutsune fight, available at HR 41 or higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end-of-May update will add even more 8-star Tempered monsters to the Wilds. Tempered versions of Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad will make their way to the game in this update.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each of these monsters have had various behind-the-scenes adjustments to make them more resilient, such as increased health, resistance to wounding, and tweaks to multiplayer scaling," Tokuda said. "Challenging monsters will also appear in future updates, so keep an eye out for further information about them."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Balancing it all out</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically addressing feedback from launch, Tokuda said that Capcom is planning to make "various adjustments," including weapon balance changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These will be implemented gradually with each upcoming title update in order to make the game more enjoyable for everyone for a longer period of time," Tokuda said. "Depending on the content, these changes may take some time to prepare."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The director noted the Hammer as one weapon being considered for "upward adjustments," which sounds like good news for Hammer mains. Some "unintentionally overpowered" things will be adjusted down — the Corrupted Mantle is one example — but Capcom said it plans on adjusting other parts upward, making for a "generally balanced" update. The team is currently aiming to implement the overall weapon balance adjustments in either the end-of-May update or in Title Update 2 this summer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Performance adjustments</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Capcom is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-director-commits-to-addressing-stability-issues-with-pc-improvements-coming-in-title-update-1">targeting stability and performance for Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, specifically noting the PC version. Title Update 1 is planned to bring a reduction in VRAM usage and an upgrade to the DirectStorage version of the Steam version, which should result in an "overall improvement" of stability for PC players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More improvements are planned, to bolster the overall technical experience for players on all platforms. Additionally, the in-game economy, balance, and other areas are planned for improvement too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Quality-of-life is also a major target for the Monster Hunter Wilds team moving forward. The Grand Hub, arriving in Title Update 1, is part of this, condensing various functions into one end-game area. The team has also reduced waiting times for facility functions at each location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team is continuing to work on UI/UX improvements and other quality-of-life updates too. A few items on the docket include restocking items, checking skill information, engaging in multiplayer quests, using the Seikret, and camera behavior during hunts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rollout stars with Title Update 1 this Friday, April 4, and on into the summer as we approach Title Update 2. Though it's still fresh, Monster Hunter Wilds is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-breezes-past-10-million-sold-capcom-explains-why-its-done-so-incredibly-well">already one of the year's most popular games</a>, and it doesn't look like Capcom is planning to slow down its roadmap for it anytime soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/runescape-dragonwilds-announced-as-jagexs-new-take-on-the-open-world-survival-genre<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Jagex has announced that it's bringing the world of RuneScape into a new genre: survival. The developer revealed RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a cooperative open world survival game coming to early access this spring.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragonwilds takes place in Ashenfall, a new continent within the RuneScape universe, where one to four players can work together to learn new skills, build camps, grow stronger, and survive against powerful enemies, including lots and lots of dragons. Ashenfall has two regions, with five unique biomes, and the potential for more to be added later post-launch. Though Ashenfall is not the same continent most of RuneScape proper takes place on, RuneScape fans will find a lot of familiarity in the world, including some locations that may resemble familiar places from RuneScape itself, like a wizard's tower, or a certain castle...</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">RuneScape: Dragonwilds First Look Screenshots and Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monsters may also look familiar, but come with a twist. While you'll still see rats, dragons, trolls, cows, and other creatures you'll recall from RuneScape, Ashenfall's wild magic has warped these creatures into strange, nature-fied versions of themselves with new appearances and fusions with plants, thorns, and other wild bits.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Core to survival in Dragonwilds is development of skills, and yes, they include classic RuneScape activities like cooking and woodcutting. These skills allow you to interact with the world in various ways - when I saw a few clips of the game at the Game Developers' Conference earlier this month, I was shown clips of a player using wind runes to gain the ability to glide through the air across distances. Even more nostalgic was a woodcutting skill that allows players to line up a row of trees and throw a spectral axe to chop them all down at once. It's a move I was told was referred to as "ax-tral projection." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">RuneScape: Dragonwilds is entering early access on PC sometime this spring, with hopes for a wider launch (including console) sometime in 2026. Jagex will host a deep-dive reveal of the game on Twitch on April 15 at 9:00 AM PT.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-don%E2%80%99t-have-4k-output.1150071/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-dont-have-4k-output/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is set to get its full reveal on April 2, and there are plenty of rumors and speculation about what the latest console from Nintendo will feature. One such rumor is that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support 4K resolution in some fashion. </p>



<p>Past rumors suggest that the Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support 4K when docked</a>. When in handheld, however, it will have a 1080p resolution.</p>



<p>Despite the claims of 4K support, however, there is some question as to whether that’s accurate based on what was said during the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco earlier this month.</p>



<p>“I heard this from one developer at GDC and also heard it separately in an email but the dev kits, or some of the dev kits, don’t have a 4K output,” Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLUrxzSPZhU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-will-nintendo-switch-2-support-4k">Will Nintendo Switch 2 Support 4K?</h2>



<p>It should be emphasized that the lack of 4K output on a dev kit doesn’t automatically mean that the system won’t support it. Console development kits don’t often fully match the specs of the final system. For example, some dev kits could offer more memory to allow for better debugging and leave out features that don’t impact testing too much like, in this instance, a 4K output.</p>



<p>Sticking on the topic of dev kits, to follow up on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prior Insider Gaming report</a> on developers expecting them in June, it was clarified that it’s likely that some of the major third-party developers have them already. It’s the smaller studios that are still waiting on them to come in.</p>



<p>Do you think the Nintendo Switch 2 will support 4K in some manner? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1794/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Jagex has officially revealed its new game in the RuneScape franchise called RuneScape: Dragonwilds. The game, set in the same universe as the traditional RuneScape titles is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to release</a> in early access this spring.</p>



<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds takes place on the continent of Ashenfall where up to four players work together to build camps, improve skills, and work to survive a land where “dragons have awoken”.</p>



<p>“Journey through the vast, vibrant regions of Ashenfall and unveil the ruins of forgotten civilisations to discover why&nbsp;wild, transformative magic&nbsp;spills from its fractured lands,” the game’s description reads. “Explode ore veins with a snap of your fingers. Conjure a spectral axe to chop down a line of trees in an instant. The Anima-rich landscape of Ashenfall offers you a power unlike any other.”</p>



<p>There will also be various quests to complete while level up your skills and even wield the runes the series is known for.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The continent itself will be made up of two regions with give biomes. Players of the franchise will be able to recognize various creatures from the series, however they will look a bit different due to the magic of Ashenfall. Some will be fused with thorns or other plant elements. </p>



<p>Ahead of the game’s early access release later this spring, Jagex will be holding a deep-dive for players on April 15 at Noon ET/9am PT. Though not confirmed, it’s expected that an early access release date will be announced at, our around, the deep dive event.</p>

The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2025-release/1100-6518649/" data-ref-id="1100-6518649">first trailer for the game</a> revealed even more realistic visuals than previous GTA games, but it's just another step forward. According to Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of GTA's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, animation that is indistinguishable from live-action footage may be arriving sooner than anyone expects.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M53-LKlECk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Zelnick noted that games have not reached the 'technological asymptote" of movies and TV shows, but he believes the industry is heading towards a future where games can truly replicate the appearance of reality.</p><p>"Our game, NBA 2K, if you squint, looks like real basketball," said Zelnick. "But you still have to squint a little bit. It's still animation. It's terrific animation. But we don't really have interactive entertainment yet that really looks like live-action. Technology will get us there, but probably [in] a shorter period of time than maybe even I expect. That doesn't mean that every game is going to look like live-action. That wouldn't make any sense creatively, but that will be another tool in our toolkit that's generated by technology."</p><p>Zelnick made similar remarks about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/graphics-will-become-indistinguishable-from-realit/1100-6469068/" data-ref-id="1100-6469068">games with realistic graphics</a> back in 2019, before PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S were released. There have been significant graphical improvements during this console generation, but not yet to the level that Zelnick describes.</p><p>During another recent interview. Zelnick suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trumps-tariffs-may-impact-console-sales-says-ceo-of-gta-parent-company/1100-6529312/" data-ref-id="1100-6529312">President Trump's tariffs may significantly impact console sales</a>, potentially including Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-some-believe-the-switch-2-may-not-launch-until-june/1100-6528854/" data-ref-id="1100-6528854">upcoming Switch 2 launch</a>. Zelnick also reiterated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/single-player-is-not-dead-despite-rise-in-multiplayer-and-live-services-take-two-ceo/1100-6487280/" data-ref-id="1100-6487280">his belief in single-player games</a>, despite the increase in live-service and multiplayer games.</p>
