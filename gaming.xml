She spins a yarn about her crew going feral and slaying one another, but her demeanor is quite antagonistic. It certainly doesn’t help that your other companion, Garryck, already seems not to trust her. This can make it hard to tell whether she’s telling the truth and whether you should lend her a hand. But don’t worry—we’ve got the info you need.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h114415"><a id=""></a><strong>Should you free Ilora in <em>Avowed</em>?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spoiler Warning" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s get the easy part out of the way first: <strong>Yes, you should probably free Ilora</strong>. Surprisingly, she’s telling you the truth about what went down on the island. Granted, whether you opt to help her or not should depend on what type of person you’d like your character to be and what type of playthrough you’re aiming for, but there are definitely positive reasons for freeing this prisoner.</p><p>For starters, she’ll accompany you through the remainder of the island and help you fight off foes that stand in your way. Additionally, a quest you encounter later in Dawnshore (which we won’t spoil here) will go much more smoothly if Ilora has been freed.</p><p>Alternatively, choosing not to free Ilora will result in you having to fight her at the end of the tutorial, as well as the aforementioned quest having a far less peaceful turnout. So, ya know, you could just save yourself the trouble and free her. Or if it’s trouble you’re after, leave her behind bars.</p><figure id="" data-id="e97bd62baabfc5ba762b95cb3b2caa45" data-recommend-id="image://e97bd62baabfc5ba762b95cb3b2caa45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1064" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Illora behind bars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Illora behind bars." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e97bd62baabfc5ba762b95cb3b2caa45" data-recommend-id="image://e97bd62baabfc5ba762b95cb3b2caa45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1064" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Illora behind bars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h114416"><a id=""></a><strong>How to free Ilora in <em>Avowed</em></strong></h2><p>To free Ilora, climb the box in the corner of the room where she’s being held prisoner.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gaming-peripherals-maker-corsair-clarifies-gta-6-pc-early-2026-release-date-comment<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Corsair has clarified recent comments from one of its executives who claimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> would release on PC early 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During a financial call, Corsair Gaming’s VP of finance, Ronald van Veen, said: “Yeah, GTA 6 is probably the one everyone is talking about. And we’ll get a glimpse of that, I think, later on in the year for console. My understanding now it’s going to come out in the fall for console, and then early 2026 for PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was enough to spark a number of headlines about Corsair’s apparent insider information on GTA 6’s release window, but a representative of the company told IGN that Ronald van Veen’s comments were speculation, and confirmed Corsair does not have release dates supplied from Rockstar or Take-Two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">Take-Two recently committed to launching GTA 6 fall 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only</a>, despite concern around a potential delay. But what does this mean for the PC version, which remains unannounced?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an omission in keeping with developer Rockstar’s playbook for its previous games, but in 2025 feels outdated. And, given the increasing importance of the PC for a multiplatform game’s success, is GTA 6’s no-show on PC a missed opportunity or even a mistake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put that question to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick ahead of the company’s recent financial results, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">in his response he teased GTA 6’s <em>eventual</em> release on PC</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away,” Zelnick said of Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. “With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar fans have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question of how long PC gamers will have to wait for what could end up being one of the biggest games ever remains. Given GTA 6’s fall 2025 release window, it seems likely PC players won’t get to play the game until 2026 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6">Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Nvidia's new 50-series graphics cards just aren't as good at running certain older games as previous hardware generations were, some PC gamers have discovered. With its latest generation of GPUs, Nvidia has quietly removed support for PhysX, a physics simulation technology that was used in a number of popular titles in the early 2010s.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1irs8xk/rtx_50_series_silently_removed_32bit_physx_support/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit post</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615768/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-drop-physx-support-32-bit" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, one user questioned why PhysX was suddenly turned off by default, or when turned on was forced to run on the CPU--causing major performance issues in games designed for GPU-enhanced PhysX. Responding to a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/557200/geforce-grd-57242-feedback-thread-released-21325/3501715/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on the Nvidia forums</a>, the company confirmed that PhysX has effectively been discontinued, due to Nvidia ending support for 32-bit CUDA applications for 50-series graphics cards and future generations. While the end of support for 32-bit CUDA was noted in a <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5615/~/support-plan-for-32-bit-cuda" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">brief support article</a>, Nvidia never explicitly mentioned the impact to PhysX, or noted which games might be impacted with the sunsetting of this technology.</p><p>PhysX's GPU-accelerated physics tech was acquired by Nvidia in 2008, and its realistic simulation of moving cloth, liquids, smoke and fog, and shatter particle effects was implemented in a number of popular AAA games of the time--including Borderlands 2, Assassin's Creed Black Flag, the Batman: Arkham trilogy, and the first two Metro games.</p><p>While PhysX is now mostly defunct and hasn't been implemented in new games for some time, many gamers were still disappointed to discover it had been discontinued without warning. Users on the Resetera forums have since banded together to create a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rtx-50-series-gpus-have-dropped-support-for-32-bit-physx-many-older-pc-games-are-impacted-mirrors-edge-borderlands-etc.1111698/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">list of games</a> that will be impacted by the end of PhysX support. The list also notes how well each game will run when using the CPU for PhysX, with users testing each game individually. The full list includes a little under 50 games, but include some popular titles from the period between 2007-2014.</p><p>Previous Nvidia generations, including the 40-, 30-, and 20- series will continue to support 32-bit CUDA applications, meaning gamers who play a lot of older games may be better to stick to an older graphics card for the time being. As is standard for a new generation of graphics cards, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geforce-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards-where-to-buy-new-nvidia-gpu/1100-6528684/" data-ref-id="1100-6528684">new 50-series GPUs</a> are pretty hard to find at the moment, anyway.</p>

                <p>Author George R.R. Martin, who was involved in coming up with some of the lore of From Software's Elden Ring, has commented on the possibility of the game becoming a movie.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-reveals-there-is-some-talk-about-making-a-movie-out-of-elden-ring-but-theres-one-big-obvious-thing-that-could-limit-his-involvement-with-it-ign-fan-fest-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Martin said he "can't say too much about it," but did indeed confirm that there is "some talk about about making a movie out of Elden Ring."</p><p>In Hollywood, nothing is certain, so no one should get their hopes up to see an Elden Ring movie soon, or ever. Martin acknowledged this, saying "we'll see" if the movie "comes to pass." Even if an Elden Ring movie does materialize, Martin said he's not sure what the extent of his involvement could be. "I don't know," he said, before going on to acknowledge that he's "a few years behind" on his long-awaited Winds of Winter. "So that limits the amount of things that I can do," he said.</p><p>Before this, From Software's own Hidetaka Miyazaki said there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-movie-there-is-interest-dev-says/1100-6524511/" data-ref-id="1100-6524511">"some interest" in an Elden Ring movie, but the team wants to be careful about finding the right partner for it. </a></p><p>Back in 2021, Bandai Namco said Elden Ring was already being developed for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-not-just-a-game-bandai-namco-says/1100-6492709/" data-ref-id="1100-6492709">"variety of other areas,"</a> and many took this to mean some kind of film or TV adaptation. Nothing has materialized as of yet, however.</p><p>Elden Ring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-rapidly-catching-up-to-dark-souls-sales/1100-6528496/" data-ref-id="1100-6528496">sold nearly 30 million copies</a> to rank as one of the best-selling RPGs ever. Given the immense commercial success of the game, along with Martin's involvement, it's no surprise to hear Hollywood studios might be interested in trying to adapt it. Next up for the game is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">Nightreign</a> standalone co-op spinoff, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-apologizes-for-elden-ring-nightreign-test-server-problems/1100-6529508/" data-ref-id="1100-6529508">launches this May.</a></p><p>It's still early days for a potential Elden Ring movie, and there is no word yet on if it's animated or live-action, or who may direct and star in it. As for confirmed releases, the next two video game movies on tap are A Minecraft Movie (April 4) and Until Dawn (April 25).</p><p>Check out the gallery below to see some of the other video game movies in the works now.</p>

                <p>A couple of years ago, the idea of PlayStation-exclusive games being ported to PC would have seemed highly unlikely, but times have changed. Insomniac's Spider-Man games, Housemarque's Returnal, and the Horizon series are just a few of the big PlayStation properties that have recently made their way to PC since 2020, and former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida recently spoke about how doing so was almost like having a license to print money.</p><p>"Releasing on PC does many things: it reaches a new audience who do not own consoles--especially in regions where consoles are not as popular," Yoshida said in an interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home" rel="nofollow ">Sacred Symbols+</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/ex-sony-exec-says-pc-ports-of-old-ps5-games-are-almost-like-printing-money" rel="nofollow ">Push Square</a>). "The idea is that those people may become fans of a particular franchise, and when a new game in that series comes out, they may be convinced to purchase a PlayStation. It also adds additional income, because porting to PC is way cheaper than creating an original title. So, it's almost like printing money. And that helps us to invest in new titles now that the cost of games has increased."</p><p>The benefit to Sony's push into PC gaming is that it has also allowed it to reach very lucrative markets like China, where PCs are far more popular than consoles. "China is a growing but very small console market. In order to reach the audience in countries like China then it's crucial to release on PC. So, I believe PC versions really reach a new audience," Yoshida added.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-comes-to-pc-in-april-requires-psn-account/1100-6528451/">Sony's next PC port will be The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, which comes shortly after the release of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 earlier this year. Yoshida has participated in several interviews since he bid farewell to Sony in January, a company he worked at for 38 years. Starting in 2019, Yoshida was put in charge of a new indies initiative for Sony, a position <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-indies-job/1100-6529536/">that he says he had no choice to accept at the time</a> as it was either that or he would have been forced to leave the company.</p><p>Yoshida has also spoken candidly about how he would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-he-would-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push/1100-6528881/">attempted to "resist" the push into live-service games</a> had he still been SIE president and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/">why there is no Bloodborne remaster</a> yet.</p>

<p>Nowlin is best known for adapting The Maze Runner book series into film, and also wrote the 2022 Netflix film The Adam Project, which starred Ryan Reynolds and Zoe Saldana.</p>
<p>87Eleven, meanwhile, is developing various projects including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shogun-star-in-talks-for-ghost-of-tsushima-film-role">Sony's Ghost of Tsushima film</a>, a Rainbow Six film starring Michael B Jordan, a new Highlander film with Henry Cavill, and more.</p>
<p>Story Kitchen partner Derek Kolstad was previously linked with the project, following his work on the John Wick films. The Sifu adaptation was described as "John Wick meets M. Night Shyamalan's Old".</p>
<p>Sloclap's game follows a young martial artist seeking vengeance against the death of his master. Thanks to a magical talisman, he's resurrected after each death but ages every time until old age eventually makes his death permanent.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-review">game reviewed well</a> and proved popular, following Sloclap's previous action game Absolver.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Sifu has been adapted either, after it featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-latest-secret-level-trailer-includes-sifu-megaman-spelunky-and-a-nightmarish-pac-man">Amazon's Secret Level series</a>.</p>
<p>Next for Sloclap is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-developers-next-game-will-give-football-a-fresh-perspective">football action game Rematch</a>, which promises a fresh perspective on the beautiful game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3-adds-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-and-path-tracing-support-on-amd-intel/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-out-now-with-game-ready-driver-in-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tomorrow-in-delta-force-black-hawk-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> integrated support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation as part of the game's third update. The game was also updated to support the latest DLAA and DLSS Super Resolution transformer-based AI models, which offer improved quality, as well as Ray Reconstruction, which improves ray tracing. Ray traced shadows also now optionally include all light sources, significantly increasing the quality of shadows in interior locations. But the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/502817574909640811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a> also reveal good news for AMD and Intel owners, too:</p>
<p><em>This update brings Path Tracing to supported Intel and AMD GPUs. To use Path Tracing, your Intel or AMD graphics card must support Hardware Ray Tracing and have at least 16GB of VRAM. Please make sure to download the latest drivers from your GPU manufacturer.</em></p>
<p><em>Note that in foliage-dense locations, such as Sukhothai, reducing Vegetation Animation Quality below the “Ultra” settings can reduce the occasional shadow “popping” that may be seen on all graphics cards using Path Tracing.</em></p>
<p>Moreover, the third Indiana Jones and the Great Circle adds support for AMD FSR 3.1 upscaling and frame generation technology, allowing players without GeForce RTX 40 or 50 graphics cards to take advantage of frame generation in the game. Lastly, the patch&nbsp;also adds support for Intel XESS 1.4 upscaling.</p>
<p>There are also a few technical fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements have been made to environment lights to present a more natural appearance when Path Tracing is enabled</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Nvidia Low Latency mode would cause inconsistent frame rates</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Nvidia Frame Generation became disabled when HDR was toggled on</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Indy’s hair was missing in reflections when using Path Tracing</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with light leaks in underground locations in Gizeh when Path Tracing is enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>As we had assumed, the previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Hair feature</a> is not available in this update. Indeed, the patch notes mention it as a possible addition for future Indiana Jones and the Great Circle updates alongside HUD modification, which the community has requested.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-lawless-update-chapter-6-season-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has released the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>Lawless update for Chapter 6 Season 2, and it's bringing sweeping heist-themed changes to the map, as well as a&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>crossover and much more.</p>

<p>New crime-themed locations like the Hostile Hotel, the Wise Guys Bookstore, and the Launder Mat (I see what you did there, Epic) have been added to the map, as well as "high-end hangout luxury spa" the Outlaw Oasis and the rather unfortunately-named Shiny Shafts mining operation.</p>

<p>You'll also have the opportunity to do battle with the lupine crime boss Fletcher Kane, and beating him will reward you with a Mythic Pistol and a Medallion that increases your sprint speed. Of course, like all Medallions, it'll also reveal your location to other players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-lawless-chapter-6-season-2-big-dill.jpg?itok=YzfNuClL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-lawless-chapter-6-season-2-big-dill.jpg?itok=wr7ZQZ0m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s new Season has more than just crime-themed updates to offer.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the aforementioned changes, you'll also find the hip-hop duo known as the Tasty Bois making their debut in this Season, and their debut track "Runamok" is available as a Jam Track in the new Battle Pass.</p>

<p>As a reminder, XP earned in any of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s gameplay modes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified" rel="nofollow">now contributes to Battle Passes</a> across all of those modes, so you won't need to stick to Battle Royale to earn enough XP to play that track in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>.</p>

<p>Included in the new Season's Battle Pass are a number of skins, many of them originals; you'll be able to get the likes of Big Dill, Fletcher Kane, and Cassidy Quinn as skins if you pick up the paid pass.</p>

<p>However, you'll also get access to Lin Kuei ninja Sub-Zero, who's joining the pass as&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s first&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>crossover skin. Prominent&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>leaker Shiina has also <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1890484917613498532" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that revenant Scorpion will be available later in the season.</p>




<p>In addition to all of the above, Chapter 6 Season 2 also brings&nbsp;<em>Cowboy Bebop</em>-themed quests, new gameplay systems to engage with across&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s new map, and much more. You can read the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/run-amok-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-6-season-2-lawless?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full rundown of what's new right here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free across pretty much every platform going. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-friends-pass-will-support-crossplay-on-any-platform.1115337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>Friend's Pass will allow you and a friend to enjoy the co-op adventure together on any platform, as long as at least one of you owns the full game.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/features/friends-pass-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> detailing the Friend's Pass, EA says that you can invite a friend to play with you for free on PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S, and it doesn't matter which platform you're playing on; "as long as one of you owns the game, both of you can play".</p>

<p>This works in a similar way to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em></a>'s Friend Pass, which also allowed you and a friend to play the whole game together with just one copy, although that pass didn't support crossplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay-sci-fi.jpg?itok=6fQ3REuh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay-sci-fi.jpg?itok=YciDjkgj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is the latest game by&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>studio Hazelight.</figcaption></figure><p>The Friend's Pass can also be used as a demo to let you and a friend experience the first few levels of&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>. All you need to do is download the Pass, make sure your friend has done the same, and fire the Pass version of the game up on your platform of choice.</p>

<p>What's more, the Friend's Pass can be used any number of times, so as long as you're playing with someone who owns the full game, your Friend's Pass will work, whether or not you've already used it.</p>

<p>Of course, if all of this doesn't sound like your bag, you can still enjoy&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>in local co-op. There are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">plenty of things</a> about which to (heavily) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements" rel="nofollow">criticize EA</a>, but this isn't one of them, it seems to me.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game by&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight, led by Josef Fares.</p>

<p>The game sees two writers, Mio and Zoe, "trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas". You'll bounce between sci-fi and fantasy worlds, solving co-op puzzles and learning more about both characters in the process.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/split-fiction/9N1WXXD1RL8D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 6th. You can take a look at our Erren's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/split-fiction-preview-double-vision" rel="nofollow">very enthusiastic preview of the game here</a>.</p>

This can be a big help against the foes you’ll encounter ahead, as filling an enemy’s stun meter allows you to wallop them with a big hit. Before you leave, also grab the Kith Meat on the ground. Eating this will temporarily improve how much damage you do to Kith (any humanoid enemies), making it a good food to chomp down on before facing the boss of this tutorial area.</p><hr><p>For finding the hidden room, you’ll also earn the “Hawkeye” achievement.

Despite giving away tons of free games every year to people just for logging on, Epic’s storefront feels like its stalled out (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/epic-store-free-games-stats-steam-mobile-fortnite-1851764053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/epic-store-free-games-stats-steam-mobile-fortnite-1851764053">though lots of new features are on the way in 2025</a></span>). <br></p><p>“The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam,” Evans wrote. “It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one. And it worked well. At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren’t going to switch platforms just because a new one was available.”</p><p>What the retired executive is essentially saying is that Amazon thought people would show up simply because it was Amazon, when if it really wanted to take Steam on, it needed to actually give players a reason to switch. “We needed to build something dramatically better, but we failed to do so,” he wrote. “And we needed to validate our assumptions about our customers before starting to build. But we never really did that either. Just because you are big enough to build something doesn’t mean people will use it.” It’s a testament to Valve as much as it’s an indictment of C-suite brain rot. </p><p>For all of the valid criticism of Steam—the lack of moderation, terrible discovery tools, Nazi-ridden forums, and aging infrastructure—it still works pretty damn well. Then you have all of the ecosystem lock-in, from the social network aspect to new Steam sales adding more cheap games to players’ libraries every season. Plus it’s now basically the de facto launching ground for the biggest unexpected hits of any given year, from<em> Balatro</em> to <em>Palworld</em>. In addition to everything else, Steam is one of the main drivers of the attention economy around gaming, which is why a cool timed exclusive might hit the Epic Games Store and you never hear a peep about it. </p><p>It doesn’t feel great that one company controls so much about one of the largest and fastest-growing ways people play games, but then again it also sucked when companies tried to compete by making everyone maintain five different windows for booting up PC games. Maybe instead of competing for market share and platform dominance, more companies could follow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">GOG in creating a DRM-free</a></span> future for PC gaming.

<p>PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes reward you for playing the game. It’s a nice feeling, in all honesty, and to make sure you don’t miss out on new rewards such as clothes and consumables, we’ve got the latest PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes for February 2025.</p>



<p>2K has a habit of including Codes and Keys across its games. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands</a> is known for using Shift Keys to give players in-game bonuses. Whereas most of 2K’s sports games use the Locker Codes feature. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> is the latest example of incorporating Locker Codes into the gameplay.</p>



<p>Codes can be hidden in the game or on social media. But they’re not so hidden when we’re around.</p>

<p><strong>You need to go to the Settings menu, find the Locker Code Redemption, and input the code to secure your free goodies in PGA Tour 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is very straightforward, but here are the steps to follow:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to PGA Tour 2K25’s home menu screen.</li>



<li>Head to your <strong>Profile Menu</strong>.</li>



<li>Scroll across to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>



<li>Flick through the options until you get to <strong>Redeem Locker Code</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on it.</li>



<li>Enter one of the Active PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes.</li>



<li>Confirm your choice to receive the applicable bonus!</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-expired-locker-codes">PGA Tour 2K25 Expired Locker Codes</h2>



<p><strong>There are currently no expired Locker Codes in PGA Tour 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>As I write this, the game is still very new, so any active codes valid from its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a> launch are still going strong. You don’t have to miss out if you get on the codes above early enough. But don’t expect it to stay this way.</p>



<p>Make sure you keep checking back to see if any new codes are available. Plus, it’s always handy to know which no longer works.</p>



<hr>



<p>2K will likely add new PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes. The goodies likely vary from code to code, so ensure you’re not missing out on good stuff. Which rewards are you most desperate to be included as part of Locker Codes?</p>

            <p>
The Pokémon Company has won "substantial" damages after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-sues-chinese-clone-seeks-62m-and-public-apology">long-running battle against a Chinese mobile rip-off</a>, following years of legal wrangling.
</p>
<p>
While the final amount has not been made public, The Pokémon Company previously said it was owed $72m (£57m) by the makers of an unlicensed Pocket Monsters smartphone app that clearly used Pokémon characters and gameplay.
</p>
<p>
The Pokémon Company looked to have initially won its case last September, though two of the companies involved (Guangzhou Maichi Network Technology and Khorgos Fangchi Network Technology) appealed the decision, prompting a further delay (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-pokemon-company-reaches-costly-settlement-in-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-over-chinese-mobile-game/">Automaton</a>).

<p>
Now, a Chinese court has decided upon the matter for good, and the companies have been forced to admit defeat and issue a public apology.
</p>
<p>
"We have deeply realised that our acts had violated relevant laws during the second-instance trial and settlement process," the companies said in a <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/PostImages/pokemon_news__2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9.pdf">joint public statement, published on The Pokémon Company's corporate website</a>. "[Our] game has extensively used design elements of the well-known Pokémon video game series, infringing the copyrights related to the Pokémon video games, and has unfairly taken advantage of the fame and reputation of the Pokémon video games, thereby constituting acts of unfair competition. 
</p>
<p>
"Our copyright infringement and acts of unfair competition have caused significant economic losses to the rights holders and severely damaged the image of the original Pokémon video games. We hereby sincerely apologise to TPC and other rights holders, as well as the vast number of players, consumers, and the general public."
</p>
<p>
The game, known variously as Pocket Monster: Remake or Pocket Monster: Issue/Reissue, has now been permanently removed from sale. The companies behind the game also say they have paid "a substantial economic price and incurred significant reputational damage".
</p>
<p>
"We have deeply reflected on it and learned our lessons."
</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others">Fortnite maker Epic Games forced a competitive cheater to publicly apologise</a> after unfairly winning thousands of dollars in prize money. The money was taken back, the cheat was banned from playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> competitively for life, and they had to publish a humiliating public message as a stark warning to others.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-again-to-july.1115313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-delayed-july<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Private Division and developer&nbsp;Wētā Workshop have announced that cozy hobbit life sim&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>has once again been delayed, this time to summer.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1892635375165731165" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;Wētā announces that the game's new release date will be July 29th. Rather endearingly, the studio says it wants&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>"to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth" for all players, "no matter where you play".</p>

<p>While the platform isn't mentioned by name, that wording could suggest that the delay has been put into place to make sure the Switch version of the game is up to par, given that the console is significantly less powerful than its peers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-july-home.jpg?itok=sFfIdc1L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-july-home.jpg?itok=_In8arGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>is now launching in summer.</figcaption></figure><p>Wētā goes on to say that it wants to make sure "every detail" is just right, "from foot-hair styles to the fluffiest cakes". Well, it wouldn't be a hobbit life sim without those things, I suppose.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's no sweetener to go along with this announcement, so if you were hoping to try out a&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>demo ahead of the game's release, it looks like you're out of luck, at least for now.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>, it's a cozy life sim set in the sleepy hobbit village of Bywater, where you'll be able to carve out a life for yourself as a peace-loving hobbit. Don't worry; you won't be tasked with throwing any rings into any volcanoes.</p>

<p>Instead, you'll be fishing, chatting to the locals, and arranging your hobbit-hole so that it looks just right. In general, if you've ever fantasized about living life in the Shire and shirking all of that pesky adventure nonsense, this is the game for you.</p>




<p>Revealed in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cozy-hobbit-game-tales-of-shire-announed" rel="nofollow">September 2023</a>,&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-gameplay-announce-pc-consoles" rel="nofollow">set for a 2024 launch</a>, but was subsequently delayed to 2025, eventually receiving the aforementioned <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-release-date" rel="nofollow">March release date</a> (which sadly no longer stands).</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016460/Tales_of_the_Shire_A_The_Lord_of_The_Rings_Game/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010195/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game/9pkkjbvpp4gw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on July 29th.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/persona">Persona</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/shin-megami-tensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a> composer Shoji Meguro is making a turn-based sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> about private military companies gunning through the ashes of a nuclear war. He's working with Ilya Kuvshinov, the illustrator who created character designs for Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2045, and Lotus Juice, a rapper who has contributed sick beats to any number of Personae. So if nothing else Guns Undarkness is probably going to look and sound quite fancy.</p>
<p>But how does it play? Meguro has made his name as a musician: I have no idea how well that expertise translates to designing combat systems. It's something to think about while you watch and listen to the below trailer for the game's first demo, out on 24th February.

<p>
Published by Kodansha, Guns Undarkness is set in 2045 and is a story about a social divide and, oh hey woah! They are certainly invoking some... rich material with this one. As summarised on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801140/Guns_Undarkness/">Steam</a>, the game takes place following a near-future period "of abeyance that allowed technology to flourish, but deepened the social divide between the rich and the poor, the Haves and the Have Nots". Please tell me those aren't the literal faction names.</p>
<p>Apparently, a bunch of "primitivist" poor people got together to pull off a "Great Reset" in the shape of a worldwide nuclear war. Now, it's up to your rookie soldier "to discover the truth behind love in a world wracked by devastation and whether humanity is capable of being revolutionized."
</p>
<p>
For context, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reset">the "Great Reset" in reality</a> was an initiative launched by the World Economic Forum to kindle economic growth (or at least, further enrich the plutocrats) following the Covid 19 pandemic lockdowns. It's also the name of a bunch of conspiracy theories which hold that corporations are trying to brainwash people with vaccines so as to destroy the very concept of property. So there is... ample topicality to unpack here, given some pretty delicate writing, and the Steam page blurb is anything but. It cites <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> as an inspiration, which worries me further - I'm not sure any other video game writer has Kojima's ability to somehow clown his way through a bunch of realworld parallels without setting anything on fire.
</p>
<p>

Still, let's shelve those concerns for the moment, and talk about the game's combat. You control a squad of four, including your protagonist, who venture out to mission maps from a submarine base. Battles are initiated during exploration by sneakily stacking people up at cover points and taking a pop at the foe - kind of like synchronising killshots in Rainbow Six, except that it's the prelude to a turn-based brawl. 
</p>
<p>
There are two broad kinds of action - regular attacks, which don't consume points, and skills, which are more powerful but do consume points. If you're in cover, however, you can fire off skills for free. If you're out of cover and you attack an enemy's weakpoint with a regular attack, "you'll be able to duck into cover". So a free move, then? 
</p>
<p>
There are also buffs and debuffs applied by guns, which level up separately to characters. Oh, and there's a Persona-style reputation system with characters improving their capabilities when fighting alongside their best mates. It seems like they have the makings of an enjoyably synergistickal framework, here. With any luck the game will be all about those synergies and not some kind of veiled/accidental piece of anti-vaxxer propaganda.
</p>
<p>
Guns Undarkness is out sometime this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has admitted porting PlayStation-exclusive games to PC is "almost like printing money", and provides an opportunity to invest in further games.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home">Sacred Symbols+</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/ex-sony-exec-says-pc-ports-of-old-ps5-games-are-almost-like-printing-money">Push Square</a>), Yoshida revealed he wanted to bring first-party games to PC sooner, but this wasn't Sony's business model at the time.</p>
<p>"Releasing on PC does many things: it reaches a new audience who do not own consoles – especially in regions where consoles are not as popular," he said. "The idea is that those people may become fans of a particular franchise, and when a new game in that series comes out, they may be convinced to purchase a PlayStation."</p>

<p>Beyond those benefits, it also allows Sony to reinvest money into other projects.</p>
<p>"It also adds additional income, because porting to PC is way cheaper than creating an original title," he said. "So, it's almost like printing money. And that helps us to invest in new titles now that the cost of games has increased."</p>
<p>What's more, releasing games on PC allows PlayStation to spread to new regions where that platform is more popular - China, in particular.</p>
<p>"China is a huge PC game market," said Yoshida. "And China is a growing but very small console market. In order to reach the audience in countries like China then it's crucial to release on PC. So, I believe PC versions really reach a new audience."</p>
<p>Beginning with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> in 2020, Sony has gradually been porting its PlayStation exclusive games to PC.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> released on PC, while The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is set to follow in April.</p>
<p>And while these releases have seen diminishing returns in terms of player numbers on Steam at least, the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was a huge success for Sony - it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest selling game</a> owing to huge success on PC. That success was hampered, though, by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">Sony's insistence on requiring PSN to play</a>.</p>
<p>In the same interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">Yoshida also discussed Sony's live service plans</a>, revealing he played <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s ill-fated The Last of Us Online, which he described as "great".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A lawsuit between Sony and a fired Bungie director is getting messy. Sony have revealed the text messages sent by the former director, which they say are proof of his "predatory behaviour" and justify their decision to dismiss him. Christopher Barrett was removed from his position last year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">in a dramatic reshuffle</a> and it was later revealed that the reasons included <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-reportedly-fired-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-for-unwanted-and-inappropriate-messages-to-female-staff">alleged "inappropriate" and "unwanted" messages</a> to female staff at the studio. In response to the allegations, Barrett sued Bungie and parent company Sony for breach of contract and defamation, claiming that the investigation that led to his dismissal was a "sham". The real reason for his firing, he says, was to stop a big bonus payout of over $45 million. </p>
<p>But lo, the Streisand effect has been initiated. His lawsuit has invited Sony to roll up their sleeves and dip their arms into their big gritty bag of exhibits. Examples of the texts he allegedly sent to employees have been revealed in a court filing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/830250465/Christopher-Barrett-v-Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-LLC-and-Bungie-Inc-2024-1285-No-97653544-97653546-Del-Ch-Feb-12-2025-1">128-page legal document</a> is basically a line-by-line response to all the claims Barrett is making in his lawsuit against his former company. It was first reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-bungie-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-response">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a>, who's been following the case <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/christopher-barrett-sony-bungie-lawsuit-marathon">since the lawsuit began</a>. In the document Sony first repeat their claims against Barrett, citing the original investigation they did into his conduct.</p>
<blockquote>"The investigation revealed that Barrett's misconduct with each employee was consistent: he targeted a lower-level, female employee he wasn't working with directly, initially engaged in friendly conversation, and progressively pushed boundaries with the employee by making subtle references to her physical appearance or expressing his interest in her romantically. Barrett attempted to create an unprofessional level of intimacy with his victims. He requested to follow personal Instagram accounts and would express anger to the women if they failed to respond to his messages. He would bring up inappropriate topics like their body, their relationships, his marriage, or his desire to date them. He would demand that they participate in sexually charged games of "Truth or Dare" and "Ask Me Anything." He texted them at all hours of the day and night. He offered to buy them gifts. He often referenced his wealth and his ability to advance their careers.</blockquote>
<p>Sony then goes on to include specific examples of the texts Barrett allegedly sent to female employees, as well as behaviour they say he engaged in, such as calling female employees while drunk to ask who they were dating. Here's some of what's included in the document:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Barrett asked VICTIM 1 to play "Truth or Dare" over text message and inquired, "what do you think is your best and worst feature physically[?]" He later told her in a text message that she was "hot".</li>
<li>Despite VICTIM 1's explicit request in writing for Barrett to recognize "boundaries," he called her late at night while drunk and after keeping her on a FaceTime call for hours, moved down a dark hallway to his bedroom and suggestively told her, "I can't believe I am lying in bed talking to [VICTIM 1]." She abruptly hung up.</li>
<li>Barrett sent VICTIM 2 Instagram direct messages stating, "You are the holy grail. I hope you find a person worthy of your attention" and qualified it with, "I'm not hitting on you. I hope it doesn't feel like that. I'm married. But I can be honest. You are the .000001 and better be treated like that forever." When VICTIM 2 responded that her boyfriend treats her very well, Barrett responded, "He better[.] Cuz i would hit on you if he wasn't."</li>
<li>Barrett also sent VICTIM 2 an Instagram direct message asking, "You want to be worshipped, I think? Why are you against that actually happening?" And a few days later messaged VICTIM 2, "[w]hat are the steps one would have to take [to date you?] What's the strategy guide[?]"</li>
<li>Barrett similarly told VICTIM 3, "I hope [your boyfriend] doesn't mind I text you a lot" and "I just worry. Like I really enjoy texting you and talking. I don't want him to get the right idea." Later in the conversation, when VICTIM 3 told Barrett she was busy, Barrett stated, "I want your attention, so annoying."</li>
<li>In another Microsoft Teams exchange, Barrett asked VICTIM 4, "Are you still in PJ s?" and "[i]s it like a button down top and bottoms? Sweat pants? Lululemons?".</li>
<li>Just three weeks into VICTIM 5's tenure at Bungie, Barrett called her late in the evening, while drunk, and told her intimate details about his personal life and asked her about who she was dating and what her "type" was. He sent her a personal Instagram follow request to connect that night, which she did not accept.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sony goes on to say that many of the women involved eventually reported these incidents to Human Resources, but were nonetheless afraid for their positions. </p>
<p>"Barrett's predatory behavior caused victims to seek guidance from other Bungie employees on how to manage Barrett's constant boundary-pushing given that he was a long-standing, senior member of the company," they say.

</p><p>"Some victims did tell Barrett to stop. But even in cases where he initially feigned compliance, Barrett promptly picked back up again with his disturbing behavior in his next communication."</p>
<p>All this essentially means that Sony is sticking to their decision to fire Barrett for reasons of "gross misconduct and gross negligence", which would cover them as terminating his employment "for Cause". </p>
<p>This is the part that Barrett disputes. He claims that he has been "scapegoat[ed]," "falsely" accused, and "defame[d]" all because Sony don't want to pay out a big bonus he says he is entitled to - a multi-million-dollar payout he is reportedly owed thanks to Sony's purchase of Bungie in 2022.</p>
<p>"Sony continues to disingenuously cherry pick text messages and alleged conversations," said Barrett's legal team in a message to Totilo at Game File. "[They] make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. It is telling that Sony does not include the full text messages as exhibits, or the full content of these conversations, and nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause."</p>
<p>Barrett's lawyers argue that the company did not have cause to fire him, as he did not "engage in any financial improprieties" or "have or solicit any improper sexual relationships with his colleagues."</p>
<p>Sony calls this line of argument "outrageous considering the evidence".</p>
<p>"Hundreds of Barrett's own written statements and the direct testimony of his many victims will demonstrate his termination for Cause was justified and this lawsuit is meritless," they say in the document.</p>
<p>It is hard to know how legal cases such as this will shake out. Totilo notes the "aggressive" tactics of both parties, and comments that many cases involving such sums of money are eventually settled. </p>
<p>Bungie has been in the spotlight over such issues before. In 2021 they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-ceo-apologises-after-damning-report-about-toxic-studio-culture">accused of a "toxic" studio culture</a> in which women and others did not feel safe or valued. A senior leader at the company called one woman "an unmanageable bitch", for example. Another senior leader allegedly made frequent racist remarks. The CEO of the company, Pete Parsons, apologised and promised changes to the studio, saying it was "clear we still have work ahead of us".</p>
<p>In related news, the studio has recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">sought to reassure fans</a> that their next game, an extraction shooter reboot of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, is still in production with new director Joe Ziegler having replaced Barrett. Though there hasn't been much news about the game since its reveal, and the studio has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-layoffs-couldnt-be-avoided-even-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-had-blockbuster-performance-says-report">since suffered from recent layoffs</a>. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-thinks-cheating-in-games-is-a-%E2%80%98low-severity-violation%E2%80%99.1115289/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Twitch recently posted an update to its terms of service, outlining changes to the platform’s enforcement system. In this update, it was confirmed that violations will now ‘expire’, and the less severe the violation, the faster it’ll disappear from your account history. The most abhorrent violations will remain on your account for up to two years.</p>



<p>However, the policy update penned by Twitch Support also confirmed that the platform believes cheating in video games is an example of a ‘low severity violation’. As such, it will remove any trace of these incidents from your record, if you’ve faced punitive action, in as little as 90 days.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-getting-away-with-it">Getting Away With It</h2>



<p>Twitch’s <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/An-Update-to-our-Enforcement-System?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">enforcement update</a> came with a graphic that shows how things work on the platform.</p>



<p>Every account starts in ‘good standing’ with zero violations. If you’re caught cheating in a game, you’ll get a <strong>one-day </strong>suspension and the record will be marked against your account for 90 days. If you’re caught cheating <strong>again</strong>, you’ll get a <strong>three-day </strong>suspension and that 90-day threshold will reset and be pushed further out.</p>



<p>Following that 90-day window, you’ll be returned to ‘good standing’.</p>



<p>That means that you can be caught cheating multiple times, and as long as you serve your suspension, you’ll only have to wait three months before Twitch views you as a model citizen once again.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Is this justice?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Cheating is one of the most disruptive acts in modern gaming – and it has been a growing issue for years. Some games are borderline unplayable at times because of cheaters ruining everyone’s fun, and publishers and developers have taken ‘cheat makers’ to court and sought out damages in the tens of millions of dollars.</p>



<p>And many have been successful in their pursuits of justice.</p>



<p>In South Korea and China, you can face a fine or even jail time for manufacturing or using cheats in a game – but Twitch is banned in China and around a year ago, the company withdrew from South Korea.</p>



<p>As a lover of all things multiplayer, I find it bizarre that you can publicly cheat in a game on Twitch and a) face just a one-day suspension, and b) have your record scrubbed in 90 days.</p>



<p>What about those cheating in professional tournaments to win cash prizes? Should that just face a one-day suspension?</p>



<p>At the least, you’re standing firm as a testament to the slacking policies of the platform, but in the worst-case scenario, you’re letting others know where and how to cheat in popular multiplayer games. Many cheaters will use their streams to actively promote the sale of cheats, with some dastardly operators securing referral bonuses for pointing malicious gamers to cheating sites.</p>



<p>Do you think Twitch should come down harder on those caught cheating in games? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

R.

FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco leaned heavily on Martin’s involvement in promotional material, and the game credits begin by saying the Elden Ring world was created by FromSoftware chief Hidetaki Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, would George R. R. Martin be interested in coming back for a sequel to Elden Ring, if he’s asked? That’s the question IGN put to the man himself as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/fanfest">IGN Fan Fest 2025</a>. In his response, Martin sidestepped Elden Ring 2, but did drop a big hint that an Elden Ring movie could be in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Well, I can't say too much about it, but there is some talk about making a movie out of Elden Ring,” Martin said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/21/gettyimages-1472023146-1740134288274.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">George R.

And indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-open-to-elden-ring-movie-if-a-very-strong-partner-were-to-step-in">FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki has said he’d be open to an adaptation of Elden Ring</a>, but only if a “very strong partner” were to come into play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of Elden Ring, a movie for example,” explained Miyazaki in an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Guardian</u></a>. “But I don’t think myself, or FromSoftware, have the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So that’s where a very strong partner would come into play,” continued Miyazaki. “We’d have to build a lot of trust and agreement on whatever it is we’re trying to achieve, but there’s interest, for sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, speaking to IGN, George R. R. Martin acknowledged that there may be a significant blocker to any heavy involvement he may have with the Elden Ring movie: he’s still working on The Winds of Winter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We'll see if that [the Elden Ring movie] comes to pass and what the extent of my involvement was, I don't know,” he said. “I'm a few years behind with my latest book, so that also limits the amount of things that I can do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy novels have long, long, <em>long, </em>awaited the planned sixth entry in the series, The Winds of Winter. But after more than a decade of delays, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-isnt-sure-hell-ever-finish-the-winds-of-winter-but-its-still-a-priority">even Martin is acknowledging the possibility that it may never come to be</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, Martin said: “Unfortunately, I am 13 years late. Every time I say that, I’m [like], ‘How could I be 13 years late?’ I don’t know, it happens a day at a time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But that’s still a priority," he continued. "A lot of people are already writing obituaries for me. [They’re saying] ‘Oh, he’ll never be finished.’ Maybe they’re right. I don’t know. I’m alive right now! I seem pretty vital!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's only the latest in what's been an increasingly bleak wait for The Winds of Winter, with the most recent entry in the series, A Dance With Dragons, publishing in 2011. That's the same year that HBO premiered the insanely popular TV series Game of Thrones, which is based on the A Song of Ice and Fire series and drew <em>a lot</em> more eyes to the world of Westeros.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Elden Ring, Martin explained his work on the game, telling IGN how he helped FromSoftware on worldbuilding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... when they came to me, FromSoftware, they wanted the world. They knew the action of Elden Ring that the players would get into would be in the ‘present.’ But something had created that present, had created that world. So where did that world come from? And I've done a lot of world building, most notably on Westeros and the backgrounds of A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones. And I like doing world building. So what had happened 5,000, 10,000 years before the current day action in Elden Ring that led them to that place? And I had some ideas about the magic and the runes. There was a lot about runes. And I worked it all out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was interesting that the team flew in and we had a number of sessions and they would fly back and do their magic, and then they would come back here a couple months later and show me what they had, which was always amazing to see what they came up with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Was everything Martin wrote used in the game, or is there more material that could be used in future installments?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, I think especially when you're world building, there's always more that you actually see on the screen,” Martin replied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And that's true of any of these big epic fantasies. I mean, you look at Tolkien and there are hundreds of pages of past history before you get to even the era of the Hobbit and dozens of kings and wars and things like that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Amanda Edwards/WireImage.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Cosy Hobbit life sim Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game has been delayed once again, this time until 29th July.
</p>
<p>
It's the second hold-up for the game after an earlier delay announced last year. Back in September 2024, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed">Wētā Workshop said it expected the game to arrive in early 2025</a>. Now, there's another five months to wait.
</p>
<p>
A statement <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1892635375165731165">published today on the game's social media account</a> does not go into detail on why the game has been postponed once again, other than to say that Wētā Workshop wanted to ensure "every Hobbit, on every platform, can enjoy the same cosy experience".

<p>
It seems possible that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>'s recent sale of Private Division, Tales of the Shire's original publisher, may have had some impact on the game's progress. But some Lord of the Rings fans have also raised questions about the game's quality level, based on previous trailers.
</p>
<p>
"We want this game to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth," today's statement notes, "and we are making sure that no matter where you play, you'll feel right at home in The Shire. From foot-hair styles to the fluffiest cakes, every detail will be just right."
</p>
<p>
It's been reported that Tales of the Shire, alongside other Private Division games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-taking-over-private-division-portfolio-following-take-two-sale">will now be aided by staff members</a> who previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">quit indie publisher Annapurna Interactive in a mass exodus</a> last year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/play-the-gothic-1-remake-demo-with-steam-next-fest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>THQ Nordic and Alkimia Interactive have announced that a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gothic-remake">Gothic 1 Remake</a> demo will feature as part of Steam Next Fest next week. The demo will be available from Monday 24th February at 6PM GMT.</p>
<p>This preview of the broader project will take players back to the Valley of the Mines in a faithful remake of the classic RPG. However, this is a standalone prologue that is separate from the main game. You won’t be playing as the Nameless Hero, but instead get to explore the Colony through the eyes of Nyras, a member of the Brotherhood of the Sleeper who plays a fairly significant role in the original’s story.</p>


<p>Nyras is a character that many will know from the original game, and playing as him in this prologue, he is a nobody, an inexperienced newcomer to this region. Through the self-contained prologue, you’ll see a slice of the Colony, get to experience the challenging combat, figuring how to survive through patience, skill and improving equipment.</p>
<p>This is a publicly playable build of a demo that has been previewed by some outlets over the last couple years – presumably Alkimia has brought some updates to this game to make it fit for public consumption.</p>
<p>Gothic has been in the works for quite some time. It was greenlit off the back of some canny marketing by THQ Nordic, first commissioning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/14/gothic-remake-playable-teaser-steam-download/">a playable teaser</a> that was made and released in 2019 to show what a Gothic remake might be able to offer, and then gathering what ended up being<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/19/next-gen-gothic-remake-development-unambiguous-feedback/">&nbsp;“unambiguous feedback” from fans</a>. Off the back of this, they founded Alkimia Interactive in Barcelona specifically for the remake, and they’ve been plugging away at it ever since.</p>

<p>There’s obviously some real progress being made, and we had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/get-a-deep-look-at-gothic-remakes-world-gameplay-and-story/">a deeper dive into the remake’s gameplay last summer</a>, though there’s still no sign of a release date. This playable demo is a nice touch, though we hope for a meatier reveal and announcement, perhaps at this year’s THQ Summer Showcase?</p>

            <p>Split Fiction will include crossplay for the first time across all platforms - PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (Windows, Steam, Epic) - via the Friend's Pass function.</p>
<p>This means Hazelight's forthcoming co-op adventure will be playable by two players online across any platform with only one copy of the game required.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> similarly included the Friend's Pass function, but players had to be on the same platform. Now, that's changed for Split Fiction.</p>

<p>As long as you own a copy of the game, you can invite any friend on any platform to join you online for free. The catch is that you both need EA accounts linked to your platform account in order to be friends.</p>
<p>Friend's Pass can also be used with "as many different friends as you want, one friend at a time", reads the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/features/friends-pass-playstation">FAQ</a>, essentially meaning it's not a one time use code so as long as you own a copy of the game, you can share the experience with an infinite number of friends. The host player will also determine the starting point, meaning they can invite a different friend to continue playing (or restart the game).</p>
<p>A demo version of the game will also be playable for free across platforms using Friend's Pass, or in local couch co-op. It includes the first few levels of the game.</p>
<p>And, of course, the game will be fully playable offline in local co-op without using Friend's Pass.</p>
<p>Further, all progress made while playing using Friend's Pass will be carried over into the full game, whether you're the player joining someone else's game via the function, or you're playing the demo version.</p>
<p>However, Trophies and Achievements will only be unlocked by players that have purchased the full game - that would be the host only, and not the player joining for free.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is set for release on 6th March - it's a co-op only game about two authors whose sci-fi and fantasy worlds collide. It follows It Takes Two, which won Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2021 among other accolades.</p>
<p>"What developer Hazelight has essentially done here is build on everything it's done so well with its previous co-op games A Way Out and It Takes Two, and dialled up its ambitions even further," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-riot-and-its-use-of-a-meat-grinder-might-one-up-that-infamous-elephant-scene-from-it-takes-two">hands-on preview of Split Fiction</a> from Victoria.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
