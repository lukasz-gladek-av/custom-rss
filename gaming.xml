            <p>Dead Rising will no longer reward players for taking intimate in-game photos of female characters.</p>
<p>While players can still level up by taking in-game photos of gory, violent, or funny scenes - categorised as horror, brutality, and outtake shots respectively - the hitherto "erotica" category will be removed when the remaster drops next month.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202408/13749">Famitsu</a>, this means that photographing women's underwear or cleavage will no longer give you prestige points.</p>
<p>Capcom hasn't expanded on why the feature has been removed for the upcoming remaster, but given the original game released way back in 2006, it's perhaps a testament to how times - and tastes - have changed over the years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-rising-deluxe-remasters-spruced-up-zombie-mall-slaughter-arrives-in-september">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster it coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 19th September</a>, with a physical release to follow.</p>
<p>Capcom's Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster revisits the original 2006 game - in which players, as photojournalist Frank West, have three in-game days to investigate Colorado's sprawling, zombie-infested Willamette Parkview Mall - giving its slapstick action a new lick of paint, quality-of-life improvements, and more.</p>
<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be available in two digital editions - there's the £39.99 Standard Edition, plus a £49.99 Digital Deluxe edition, which includes 17 costumes for Frank and 17 additional mall music tracks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Destiny developer Bungie has issued a short statement acknowledging concern over the future of its decade-old sci-fi franchise following "recent changes" at the studio.
</p>
<p>
Those "recent changes" are, of course, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">sweeping layoffs that have seen 220 Bungie staff out of a job</a>, less than a year after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">further 100 employees were let go last October</a>. A further 155 Bungie staff are also departing the studio for roles within parent company PlayStation. 
</p>
<p>
In response, Bungie has now said it remains "committed" to Destiny, though details of what's next remain thin on the ground. There's also no mention of the departures of key Destiny creatives Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, who were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-destiny-project-payback-no-longer-happening-senior-execs-depart">reportedly developing a now-cancelled Destiny spin-off named Payback</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, Bungie makes vague mention of a new "multi-year journey" to be had, presumably via further additions to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We know that recent changes at Bungie have created uncertainty surrounding the future of Destiny," Bungie <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1821619810645766275">wrote</a> on X. "Rest assured we remain committed to Destiny, to supporting our community with transparency, and to delivering regular updates about the game.
</p>
<p>
"We'll be talking with you all about the future of Destiny and plans for our next multi-year journey soon. Once we plant a flag for the date, we'll let you all know. Thank you for your patience, and we'll see you again soon." 
</p>
<p>
Bungie typically communicates with its Destiny fanbase via a weekly blog post, which was cancelled last week as the layoffs were announced and a wave of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">criticism from current and former employees</a> and the wider games industry followed. 
</p>
<p>
This week, Bungie has returned to its weekly blog posts and stated there that all previously-announced Destiny 2 content plans "remain unchanged".
</p>
<p>
"The recent changes within Bungie will present challenges that we'll need to work through," Bungie <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-08-08-2024">wrote</a>, "so please pardon our dust over the next few weeks. We may experience a few bumps here and there, but our teams are committed to keeping you in the loop and hearing what you have to say."
</p>
<p>
Bungie's cuts come at a climactic moment for Destiny 2, which completed its main 10-year narrative arc this year. Planned updates will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-post-final-shape-future-includes-vampire-hunting-and-the-dreadnaught">now take the shape of thrice-yearly "Episodes" with standalone stories</a>.
</p>
<p>
The developer is also still working on its new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon-2023">Marathon</a> reboot -  a sci-fi extraction shooter for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S expected to arrive next year.

<p>Remedy Entertainment has revealed that Control 2 is now playable, the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake has entered full production, and Project Condor seems to be progressing, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remedy recently spoke on the development progress of their upcoming titles through their latest <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-half-year-financial-report-january-june-2024-codename-condor-and-max-payne-12-remake-in-full-production-and-alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-launched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">half-year financial report</a>. Control 2 has entered the “production readiness stage”, and a build of the game has “showcased several important features in playable form”.</p>



<p>Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake is even further in its development cycle, progressing from “production readiness to the full production stage.” The developers are aiming to create an “early functional state from beginning to end while focusing on key differentiating gameplay features”.</p>



<p>Lastly, Project Condor has entered full production too. Developers have already worked on “multiple maps and different mission types”. They are also organising increased “internal and limited external playtesting”, which will help towards “feature validation and feedback’.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-gives-update-on-control-2-and-max-payne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last year</a>, Control 2 was still in its “proof-of-concept stage” as the plans for the sequel were “ambitious”. On the other hand, Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake was in its “production readiness stage”, as the developers had just “gained clarity on the style and scope of the game”. Moreover, Remedy also revealed this year that Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remakes are “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/max-payne-remakes-have-a-budget-similar-to-alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enabled by a similar development budget as Alan Wake 2</a>“.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tombi-special-edition-review.948936/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/09/tombi-special-edition-review-tomba/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>If you’re as old as I am, you might remember the heyday of demo discs that came with Official UK Playstation Magazine and, if you do, you might remember Demo Disc 37. On this disc was a demo for an odd little platformer called Tombi! (Tomba! In other territories), a demo that I quickly fell in love with. Whether you only played this demo or successfully begged your parents for it, I have great news, Limited Run Games have brought it back with Tombi! Special Edition.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomba! Special Edition | LRG3 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfYtEggYPI0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Opening with pigs beating up a child like a horror parody of Peppa Pig, I can tell you right now that Tombi! gets no less strange during its runtime. The premise is that you are said child and have been robbed by said pigs of your grandpa’s bracelet. So, the only thing to do is to follow them and get your precious keepsake back, drawing you into a wider plot surrounding Seven Evil Pigs and the curses they have placed upon the world.</p>


<p>In Tombi!, you’ll be doing a lot of platforming… very floaty platforming. It’s forgiving at most points to balance that out, and you do get some abilities and items later to help you with tighter and trickier platforming challenges, but you will notice immediately how long it takes for you to land, especially when it comes to combat in the game. Combat is basically jumping on the enemies to bite them and then throwing them at walls, the ground or other enemies.</p>
<p>You do acquire various weapons in the game, some of which provide a dual purpose of dispatching enemies and collecting distant items, but most of the enemies (and some of the allies) can be managed simply by the pounce and munch technique. The bonus with the weapons though is that you can aim and power them up by holding the attack button, so if a tricky enemy is causing you problems, you can dispatch them in a single hit.</p>


<p>This game is divided up into quests, of which there are 130 in total. Some of them are compulsory, such as the ones to hunt down and catch the Evil Pigs, and others are just for fun, really. The interesting thing about this being that each Evil Pig accounts for more than one quest. Clearing their curse on an area, and finding the correct Evil Pig Bag (yes, you read that right) to trap them in are separate quests.</p>
<p>Even more interesting is that the Evil Pigs are never hiding in the areas they have cursed, so you must find the Evil Pig Bag first to be able to see the doors they are hiding behind… but you also need to figure out where said doors will be. Once you do, you’re thrown into a simple puzzle encounter with these potent porcine adversaries as you need to work out how to throw them into the bag in the arena. They range from insultingly easy to infuriating, but honestly finding their doors is the hardest part.</p>
<p>Most of the other quests in the game involve simply fetching something either for someone or that you need to clear the way to progress, but the trickier ones are downright esoteric to work out – looking at you “Red+Blue=?”, which is not as simple as that sounds. I will say though that this game is so daft and charming throughout that you will likely find all the quests – or at least the lion’s share of them – simply by wistfully exploring and engaging with the various characters.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, also littered throughout the game are chests of increasing value. Each of these you can only access after befriending the old men of increasing ages in the world, where you’ll be given a key that is precisely the same age as each of them, so it’s a great idea to swing back through previous areas from time-to-time. Between these chests, the hidden quests, a ton of optional items and everything else Tombi! throws at you (including a little go kart mini-game), there’s a lot of “game” here to play in the best possible way.</p>
<p>Tombi! Special Edition’s release is pretty much the experience as it was back on the PlayStation – the in-game visuals don’t appear to have been touched at all in the game. It’s still the same colourful, cartoonish nonsense it was in the original release – with Limited Run Games instead focussing on a handful of&nbsp;quality-of-life changes, extras and an enhanced soundtrack.</p>
<p>The biggest of these additions is the ability to save anywhere instead of at signposts in the world which is an absolute godsend in this game, while a rewind feature gives added assistance, but honestly hinders more than helps. Another&nbsp;neat little addition is a new gallery, containing promotional graphics, box art, and other art pieces from the game not only from the European release but the Japanese and North America releases too.</p>

<p>Even the FMV cutscenes have been left untouched, so they retain their grainy appearance and wonky voice acting, which I’m so thankful for. The Special Edition has, however, remastered the soundtrack, and I’m unsure about this change. It feels odd to remaster the soundtrack but not the visuals, especially if you have kept the sound in the cutscenes unchanged. It’s hardly a dealbreaker, but you’d expect a remaster either do it all or none of it, right? That said, the soundtrack is joyous, and I’m happily humming it as I write.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-second-edition-updates-war-for-ring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game Second Edition</em> is on its way. Games Workshop's ongoing support for the miniature war game set in the fantasy world of Tolkien will lead to the first major change to its foundation since 2018, providing new streamlined rules and updates to various armies.</p>

<p>The announcement of <em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game Second Edition</em> came via an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/08/08/new-edition-of-middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-coming-soon/">Warhammer-Community post</a>. According to the post, this new edition will contain a new streamlined game manual containing revisions to armies and core rules.</p>

These books will contain new rules for miniatures from <em>The Lord of The Rings</em> and <em>The Hobbit</em> film trilogies. Each character's profile has been reworked for game balance and on-screen presence.</p>
<p>Regarding what major changes will come with <em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game Second Edition</em>, the post is light on detail. Aside from the supplements, the post mentions no major armies or core rules changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement was made alongside a new supplement for the game:<em> <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/08/08/middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-the-rise-of-angmar/">Rise of Angmar</a></em>. The book focuses on the Witch King, his wars with the kingdom of Arnor, and the chieftains of the <span>Dúnedain.</span> In addition, the post concludes with a tease for the next major addition to the game: <em>The War for the Rohirrim</em>.</p>

It originally started in 2001 as <em>The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game</em>, which released alongside the Peter Jackson film.</p>
<p>Updated rules came out coinciding with the theatrical release of <em>The Two Towers</em>, <em>Return of the King</em>, and finally in a comprehensive 2005 book titled <em>The One Ring Rulebook to Rule Them All</em>. A similar approach was taken with Peter Jackson's <em>Hobbit</em> trilogy before both games' rules were consolidated into the cohesive and cross-compatible <em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game</em> in 2018.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, Nic took James and I on a tour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>'s co-op campaign. A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.</p>
<p>It looks like the gargantuan <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game's PvP <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.</p><!--more-->

<p>Each multiplayer mode gives you six upgradeable and fairly self-explanatory classes - Tactical, Assault, Vanguard, Bulwark, Sniper and Heavy. Class abilities include a camo cloak and a banner you can heroically plant to saturate your battle-brethren's veins with zeal and allow them to brush away mortal wounds like cobwebs (i.e. it buffs their defences). Teams are divided into regular Ultramarines and perfidious Chaos Marines: they look and sound different, but function the same. You don't get to play as a Tyranid or other non-human species in PvP.</p>
<p>The Gears Of Warriness of the Space Marine 2 is prominent in the outsized character models, the stompy handling, the phatness of the weaponry, and the bulky regularity of the map layouts I've seen, which favour diagonals over curves. It doesn't have a cover system, of course. Space Marines don't take cover. Their faith is their shield. Also they are genetically engineered, century-old giants who wear elephant armour. One of the classes does get a handheld shield, though.</p>
<p>Look out for our collective thoughts on Space Marine 2 next week. My immediate verdict on the campaign is that it's great fun if you turn your brain off and just wallow in the spectacle of dozens of Tyranids swarming the fittings. With allowances for choice of difficulty setting/effectiveness of comrades, it's a game for button-mashers and AOE-fanatics and anybody who reacts to the suggestion of subtlety with righteously flared nostrils and a bellow of "heresy!" It's out 9th September.

			<p>Another Nintendo Switch 2 rumor emerged today on the Internet via the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Famiboards</a> forum, where users shared some details from supposed leaked shipping manifests. According to this information, the upcoming Nintendo console has a second cooler, which is likely to be placed on the dock.&nbsp;That being the case, fans already speculate that the dock might grant a stronger performance boost than the original Nintendo Switch. Additionally, references to a 60W charger have been found, potentially hinting at a fast charging option for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumored-to-launch-in-h2-2024-oled-version-already-in-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to launch at some point in the latter half of 2024, at least according to credible rumors. However, the most recent info <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">points</a> to March 2025 as the most likely release window. That would be around eight years after the debut of the original Switch. The console's reveal should happen at some point this Fall, though.</p>
<p>Previous leaks suggest that the console (once again a home/handheld hybrid will be powered by an NVIDIA Tegra 239 SoC, combining the Ampere GPU architecture with 1280 CUDA Cores and 8 Cortex A78 Arm CPU Cores with 12 GB of RAM. The game cards should use a Samsung 5th generation V-NAND with up to 1.4 GB/s Read Speed.</p>
<p>The console is expected to support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction (the Nintendo Switch 2 will also have hardware ray tracing capabilities thanks to its GPU architecture), but not DLSS Frame Generation. Even with these technologies, it won't be able to match the performance of the current generation's least powerful console, the Xbox Series S. Even Valve's Steam Deck may be superior. However, the Nintendo Switch 2 will receive games custom-made for its hardware, unlike Valve's portable PC.</p>
<p>Speaking of the lineup, Square Enix's Naoki Yoshida recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-xiv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Final Fantasy XIV might be ported to the console at some point, but it could take years. That was certainly the case with the Xbox port, which was in the works for years and ultimately only launched a few months ago.</p>

<p>Valorant players everywhere are preparing to bust open their wallets as the next Night Market window is revealed by Riot Games. It hasn’t been all that long since the last Valorant Night Market was held, and this will be the fourth window this year alone, but it’s always a welcome sight for Valorant fans worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-valorant-night-market">What is the Valorant Night Market?</h2>



<p>The Night Market is a term used to describe a period where Valorant’s cosmetics are offered at drastically discounted prices. It’s a unique event that sees players take advantage of draws that offer them randomised skins, subsequently giving them a discount based on the ‘rarity’ of the skins they roll. It means that users can secure skins for up to a 50% discount, and the ‘gambling’ mechanic of the roll system makes for an exciting practice.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-valorant-night-market">When is the Next Valorant Night Market?</h2>



<p>Riot Games has confirmed that the next Valorant Night Market will be held from August 15 – 28. This is the typical duration for a Night Market, so it’s nothing out of the ordinary.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-will-the-valorant-night-market-be-on-console">Will the Valorant Night Market Be on Console?</h3>



<p>Riot Games revealed that both PC and console players will get access to the Night Market at the same time. It was just days ago that Valorant was released on console, so this marks the first time that the event will take place outside of the PC platform. </p>



<h2 id="h-keep-your-eyes-open">Keep Your Eyes Open</h2>



<p>The Valorant Night Market is a time for players to cross their fingers and hope for the best. It may be that you land your dream skin in your first roll, or you could go the distance and not get anything you like the look of. </p>



<p>The beauty of the Night Market is that you’re not obligated to buy any one skin that you roll – you can hold out for something new in your next roll. </p>



<p>What skin are you waiting for in the Night Market?</p>

<p>Betby has become the first esports betting operator in the business to offer markets for Escape from Tarkov: Arena and Stormgate. While there were expectations that Stormgate betting would be a thing, it was considerably rare to think that Escape from Tarkov: Arena would be backed by esports betting markets, given the game’s struggling profile and lack of tournaments.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-there-regardless">There Regardless</h2>



<p>In a statement, the Head of Betby Games, Kirill Nekrasov, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Although Stormgate’s release is still a few days away, we at BETBY have long anticipated its success. To support interest in this upcoming RTS game, we have added pre-match odds for exhibition matches and Will continue to offer betting opportunities for all future tournaments. We are proud to be the first esports feed to provide Stormgate as betting content to our partners.</p>



<p>The same applies to Escape from Tarkov: Arena. Since its launch late last year, the game has garnered a significant following. As it continues to gain popularity, we recognise the need to offer this game to our partners. We are pleased to announce that&nbsp;Betby Games is currently the only esports feed offering content<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for official tournaments of Escape from Tarkov: Arena.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last year, Escape from Tarkov: Arena was ushered into the competitive scene with a tournament that boasted a €100,000 prize pool. It took place at DreamHack Hannover and went hand-in-hand with the release of the game, but since then, nothing has replicated the magnitude of that event in the Tarkov space.</p>



<p>Tarkov Arena has a decent enough grassroots tournament space, but it’s not the kind of thing you’d actively bet on.</p>



<p>Stormgate is expected to be much more impactful when it comes to esports betting. Many operators are poised to offer markets – however mundane – for the ‘disruptive’ RTS title that’s finally being released worldwide on August 13.</p>



<p>Will you bet on either of these games?</p>

<p>In an age where projects are being cancelled, postponed, and pushed back left and right, it’s encouraging to see that the most highly anticipated game in history is still on track to be delivered in the promised window. In a recent financial update, Take-Two Interactive confirmed that Grand Theft Auto 6 is still being released in the ‘Fall of Calendar 2025’, which is the window we’ve now been working with for a few months.</p>



<p>This news comes despite some rumours that GTA 6 would be pushed back into 2026 by Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar Games. It still <strong>could be</strong>, but for now, we’re on track, and that’s just perfect.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-hold-firm">Hold Firm</h2>



<p>GTA 6 is expected to be the biggest single-game release in the history of the industry. In December 2023, Rockstar Games dropped the first official trailer for the ambitious, open-world title, promptly breaking the internet and setting viewership records on YouTube. Now, gamers are patiently awaiting the arrival of the next-generation title, which will be the first new GTA game in more than a decade.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/606b4f51-58cd-4838-a9e2-55138ff5d8eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial update</a> handed out by Take-Two Interactive, the firm highlighted the future line-up of the business, which included <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization VII</a>, Judas, WWE 2K25, and of course, Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>Many rumours are still surfacing online regarding the content we’ll discover in GTA 6 when the game is eventually released late next year. However, almost all of them should be taken with a pinch of salt, as following the monumental leaks that tore apart the project in 2022, Rockstar Games has locked things down, requesting that all employees return to the office for security purposes.</p>



<p>That means that almost <strong>nothing </strong>is being revealed outside of official teasers.</p>



<p>Are you still excited about the impending arrival of GTA 6, or do you think the hype has worn off a bit?</p>

<p>With Escape from Tarkov’s next wipe on the horizon, Battlestate Games has revealed plans to host a Twitch Drops campaign. This is somewhat typical for the title, and it’s often the most popular period of the year for the at-times controversial extraction shooter. This will see the game skyrocket into pole position on Twitch as hundreds of thousands of players pour back into the game for the global reset event <strong>and </strong>look to earn high-tier rewards while doing so.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-make-it-work">Make It Work</h2>



<p>Last year, the Tarkov Twitch Drops campaign was a little rough. It required viewers to sit there and grind streams for hours on end, and the longer they watched, the better the rewards became. It meant that users needed to have streams running in the background for several hours <strong>a day</strong>, and more often than not, the rewards weren’t all that good.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a nice enough way to kick off Tarkov’s next wipe, though. It means that the game is guaranteed to find immense popularity (as always) on the leading streaming platform. It has been a rocky year or so for Escape from Tarkov, with the developer, Battlestate Games, having made some sketchy moves that have left the community in dismay at times.</p>



<p>For instance, a few months ago, the team revealed ‘The Unheard Edition’, a new high-tier edition of the game that broke promises and disappointed gamers worldwide, packaging up elements that were previously promised to be included in earlier purchases and stuffing them behind paywalls. Most recently, BSG suffered from a super-sized technical malfunction that wiped the profiles of thousands of players worldwide.</p>



<p>With all that being said, a Tarkov Twitch Drops campaign is a welcome enough thing. It’s free content at the end of the day, and watching Escape from Tarkov streams isn’t a new concept to the community – it’s one of the most consistent games on the platform for a reason.</p>

Support for the Microsoft Store version will be added "soon," with no mention of a console version.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/08/idstudio-beta-1-1723159113282.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>DOOM Eternal finally has mod support. Image credit: Bethesda Slayers Club</figcaption></figure></output><p>Those who opt into the beta branch will be able to create and publish original mods via the idStudio Beta program, which you can see above. You can <a href="https://idstudio.idsoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find idStudio tutorials</a> as well as an installation guide right here.</p><p>The addition of mods should add some more life to DOOM Eternal, which continues to enjoy a robust post-launch community. First released in 2020, DOOM Eternal received praise for its extensive single-player campaign and customarily amazing shooting action. </p><p>We wrote in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-final-review">our review</a> at the time, "Eternal tips its cap to DOOM 2 specifically while also building off of what made the modernized reboot a breath of fresh air for the genre. Whether you’ve been playing DOOM for a few years or a few decades, DOOM Eternal demands your attention.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Fans have been expecting official mod support for DOOM Eternal ever since <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/doom-eternal/mod-support-steam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game files uploaded on Steam's backend made reference to the feature</a>, eagerly anticipating the ability to add new maps, levels, and weapons.</p><p>"This is the first time idtech has been officially moddable in how many years now? Holy shit. They talked about it years ago but I thought I'd never see it happen. Eternal's engine has so much potential and now the modding community can fully tap into it instead of being restricted," one enthusiastic fan wrote in response to the announcement. "We saw hints of this coming in SteamDB, but I didn't expect them to give us tools as well. It's like a feverdream."</p><p>Mod support wasn't the only news to come out of QuakeCon. Bethesda also announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-and-doom-2-new-enhanced-versions-steam-listing-leaked-quakecon-2024">updated versions of DOOM and DOOM 2</a> with expanded multiplayer support, new content, and much more.

                <p>It's been nearly five years since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-3-review-six-sirens-one-god-queen/1900-6417293/" data-ref-id="1900-6417293">Borderlands 3</a> was released, and fans have been waiting to hear news about the next sequel. And since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-movie-review-generic-and-disposable/1900-6418265/" data-ref-id="1900-6418265">the Borderlands movie</a> is out this week, gamers are once again looking for any word about the follow-up. The good news is that Gearbox Software has finally confirmed that the next game is in development.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-movie-video-games-brothers-in-arms-wonderland-gearbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Epic Games store</a>, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford was specifically asked if the company was working on the sequel. Pitchford replied, "Of course we are. There's a moment when we're ready, and we can and will announce something because that's the moment to make a public promise. We're working on lots of Borderlands. We're working on lots of Brothers in Arms."</p><p>That was a more overt hint about Borderlands 4 than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-dev-teases-reveal-of-next-game-coming-soon/1100-6525370/" data-ref-id="1100-6525370">the previous update that Pitchford provided</a> in July 2024 when he said are there are "so many great things coming with Borderlands." At the time, there also rumors about a sequel to the spin-off title, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. As for the next Brothers in Arms game, Gearbox <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-brothers-in-arms-game-in-development-but-gearbox-wont-show-it-off-until-its-almost-done/1100-6496198/" data-ref-id="1100-6496198">conformed that title was in development back in 2021</a>. </p><p>Additionally, Pitchford hinted that Gearbox's other properties are also in play for new games, including Risk of Rain and Duke Nukem. It's possible that Gearbox may make some announcements during Gamescom 2024 later this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216379/doom-doom-ii-definitive-re-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you haven’t played <em>Doom</em> or <em>Doom II</em> for a while — or ever — a new re-release that Bethesda <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes?linkId=100000279162898">surprise-dropped</a> (<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1821578978462699748">sorta</a>) on Thursday might be the perfect excuse to jump in to the classic games. The re-release, which combines both games into one package called <em>Doom + Doom II</em> and is a free update for anyone who already owns <em>Doom (1993)</em> or <em>Doom II</em>, offers a long list of great new features — including a brand new single-player episode and online, cross-platform deathmatch multiplayer.</p><p>With <em>Doom + Doom II, </em>you’ll have access to both of those two games as well as extra single-player content like John Romero’s <em>Sigil</em> episode <a href="https://romero.com/sigil">released in 2019</a> and <em>Legacy of Rust</em>, which is a new <em>Doom</em> episode created by “individuals from id Software, Nightdive Studios and MachineGames,” according to Bethesda. You’ll also be able to download single-player mods through a new in-game mod browser.</p><p>On the multiplayer front, Bethesda has added 25 new maps for deathmatch, meaning you’ll have up to 43 to pick from. The cross-platform deathmatch and co-op also support up to 16 players.</p><p>The combined package will support up to 4K resolution and 120fps if you’re playing on PC, PlayStation, or Xbox Series X / S. There’s also updated music for the games by Andrew Hulshult (who worked on the music for <em>Doom Eternal: The Ancient Gods DLC</em>), and you can switch back and forth between the newer tracks and older tracks whenever you like.</p><p>There’s a lot more I didn’t touch on, and if you’re at all interested in this package, I recommend scrolling through <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes?linkId=100000279162898">the extensive patch notes</a>. The game is available on PC (via Steam, the Windows Store, the Epic Games Store, and GOG), Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.</p><p>There was one other cool piece of retro <em>Doom</em> news announced today, too: Limited Run Games is working on a re-release of <em>Doom</em> on <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1821642624735793232">the SNES</a>. The game is set to release in 2025 — and, naturally, there will only be 666 copies made.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>And it won't hog your hard drive either.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft Flight Simulator was already sounding pretty damned spectacular, but my excitement levels are now appropriately sky-high following developer Asobo's revelation you'll be able to get out of your plane, stroll about the countryside (or anywhere else), and watch the sun set in your preferred corner of its gorgeous recreation of the world.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Microsoft Flight Simulator boss Jorge Neumann, who shared the news while <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/flight-simulator-2024s-huge-ambition-means-you-can-now-exit-the-plane-walk-around-you-can-land-on-every-ship-and-it-looks-like-a-first-person-shooter-environment/">chatting to PC Gamer</a> - after reiterating just how much additional detail is going into Flight Simulator 2024's digital version of Earth compared to its already impressive predecessor.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the team has improved the look of every airport, has added glider airports, every oil rig, and every lighthouse in the world. That's alongside "hundreds of species of animals that run around", and it's also simulating "every ship on Earth" via their transponder signals - all of which, claims Neumann, you'll be able to land on. "I think we're in a new era of making games that I think are going to break new ground, from a scale and complexity perspective."

<p>
And then there are the trees. Trees are something Neumann has discussed before, but he now says Microsoft Flight Simulator has the capacity to feature every tree on Earth. "We have a machine learning look [it] up," he explains, "and then we know what the tree is, even down to the point where we know what the species likely is... and then we plant trees, literally trillions of trees, and it's all done in run time, so it's pretty damn accurate."
</p>
<p>
But the thing that's got me most excited is all that disembarkation chatter, with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 not only letting you be a digital tourist in the sky, you can be one on the ground too. "You can now exit the plane, walk around, in 2024," Neumann reveals. "You can literally walk your favourite mountain path to your favourite hut in the mountains. Sit on the lake. See the sunset. It is truly a digital twin you can absorb."
</p>
<p>
Actually, Neumann shares one additional detail that might just have the whole walking thing beat on the exitement scale. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, he says, won't hoover up your hard drive space like its absolutely gluttinous predecessor. 
</p>
<p>
"In 2020, the initial install is 130 GB," he explains "Then we have 17 world updates. If you calculate it up, we're at 500 GB. And then there are 5,000 add-ons that people have made, which I think are two terabytes... [But] for Flight Simulator 2024, we've changed all that. We basically went for a thin client architecture, and we're not done yet. We're shipping in November, but we think we're going to be... I'd say 50 GB or less, but with tons more data, because we are offloading more to the cloud."
</p>
<p>
And Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has a lot to squeeze in. Asobo has already confirmed it'll launch with a frankly staggering list of activities, including aerial firefighting, search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, air ambulances, crop dusting, mountain rescue, skydive aviation, aerial construction, cargo transport, air racing, glider piloting, scientific research, low altitude training, experimental trips, airship tours, hot air balloon trips, plus VIP charter and executive transport services. And that's before getting to the planes.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches for PC and Xbox Series X/S on 19th November, so there's still a bit of time left to pack a digital suitcase and prepare your flight plans.

But in today's earnings call, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25">any potential competitor to EA Sports FC</a> would face numerous complications.</p><p>"I would just note with regards to the FIFA license, it does not bring along with it rights; it doesn’t come along with players, teams, or leagues," Zelnick said. "So it’s not as simple, for example, as negotiating with the NFL, or the NBA, or MLB, where at most you have to negotiate with a league and a player’s association. So anyone who would want to compete in the straight ahead sim environment for soccer… you wouldn’t just have to address one particular brand license, there’s a whole lot more than that."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Unlike American leagues like the NFL, international soccer consists of a complex web of teams, leagues, tournaments, and players, many of whom must be negotiated with individually. EA has largely cornered the market in that regard, locking up the rights to the Premier League, La Liga, and other popular groups with EA Sports FC. Konami spent years trying to chip away at EA's dominance with Pro Evolution Soccer before <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/efootball-2024">finally pivoting to the free-to-play eFootball</a>, leaving EA largely uncontested in the soccer market.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-fifa-split-reasons">EA dropped the FIFA license in 2022</a> amid reports that the organization, which serves as the governing body for the various national associations around the world, was asking for more than $1 billion per four-year World Cup cycle. EA rebranded the series as EA Sports FC in 2023 with relatively few changes. Since then there has been speculation that Take-Two might take on the FIFA license, but there remain numerous questions about how it would approach the licensing for various teams and leagues.</p><h2>The benefits to making an EA Sports FC competitor</h2><p>Zelnick did point out that there are great potential rewards for developing a successful sim. "We’re very mindful that it’s incredibly difficult to build a great sim experience for console, it takes a long time, and if you do it right your users are very loyal and very embedded."</p><p>College Football 25, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/22-million-people-were-willing-to-pay-100-to-play-college-football-25-3-days-early">which finally released to big player counts last month</a>, spent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-wont-be-released-until-summer-2024">close to four years in development</a> as EA painstakingly negotiated with schools and players. Take-Two would face a similar challenge with a potential FIFA game, but without the added benefit of an established technological baseline unless its heavily repurposed tech from NBA 2K. Asked what its success might mean for Take-Two, Zelnick said that the company had taken notice of the revival's success but that it had nothing to announce regarding a potential return to college basketball, whether in NBA 2K or elsewhere.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN FIFA Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p>In the meantime, Zelnick was quick to remind listeners that Take-Two is already in the soccer business thanks to Top Eleven, which he called the "number one mobile soccer manager title." He also shouted out NBA 2K, WWE 2K, and the rest of the publisher's sports games, calling the various leagues "great partners."</p><p>"From our point of view, we have a great sports portfolio… I’m sure we will make more announcements in due course," Zelnick said.</p><p>He also commented on the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-responds-to-borderlands-movies-poor-reviews-give-the-film-a-chance">Borderlands movie's terrible reviews</a> in comments exclusive to IGN, asking fans to "give it a chance," and talked about the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-a-long-term-video-game-actor-strike-wouldnt-be-good-for-anyone">potential impact of the video game voice actor strike</a>.

Despite this, Bungie says it will do its best to maintain transparency and communication as it remains committed to the Destiny universe.</p><p>“We'll be talking with you all about the future of Destiny and plans for our next multi-year journey soon,” Bungie said. “Once we plant a flag for the date, we'll let you all know.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We'll be talking with you all about the future of Destiny and plans for our next multi-year journey soon. Once we plant a flag for the date, we'll let you all know.</p><p>Thank you for your patience, and we'll see you again soon.</p></div>— Destiny 2 Team (@Destiny2Team) <a href="https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team/status/1821619811908252119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It’s currently unclear how or when Bungie will launch into the next phase for Destiny. Its first major storyline, The Light and Darkness Saga, began with the launch of the original Destiny in 2014 and concluded with Destiny 2’s The Final Shape expansion this past June. Though many felt it was a fitting conclusion to a decade-long narrative (we gave it a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review"><u>our review</u></a>), one major question remained: Where do we go from here?</p><p>Uncertainty grew when the Sony-owned studio announced it would <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio"><u>cut 220 staff in late July</u></a>. It was a shift that saw 17% of the studio let go, with an additional 155 workers planned to move from Bungie into Sony Interactive Entertainment in the coming months. That leaves the developer with around 850 employees.</p><p>“I realize all of this is hard news, especially following the success we have seen with The Final Shape,” studio head Pete Parsons said in a statement. “But as we’ve navigated the broader economic realities over the last year, and after exhausting all other mitigation options, this has become a necessary decision to refocus our studio and our business with more realistic goals and viable financials.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/sony-s-bungie-maker-of-halo-and-destiny-faces-reckoning-after-mass-layoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a> report emerged in the aftermath of mass layoffs at Bungie, stating that the studio would move away from large expansions and instead <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-is-reportedly-not-working-on-destiny-3-will-focus-on-smaller-destiny-2-updates-that-may-be-free"><u>focus on smaller, potentially free updates for Destiny 2</u></a>. The report, which included information from 10 current and former Bungie employees, also explained that the team had no plans for Destiny 3 to take shape and that it had canceled a Destiny spinoff project known as Payback just months ago. Development on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-removes-chris-barrett-as-game-director">its Marathon revival</a> is said to still be ongoing.</p><p>While Bungie prepares to make its plans known, the future of the Destiny franchise is unclear.

            <p>
Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-zombies-mode-gets-a-first-trailer-and-story-details">brief introduction</a> to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Zombies mode earlier this week, Activision and developer Treyarch have shared first gameplay details of what it's calling a "purely round-based" Zombies experience for this year's game.
</p>
<p>
Storywise, Black Ops 6's Zombies mode begins after a group of former Requiem members are liberated from the remote Terminus Island complex in the Philippine Sea by Maya Aguinaldo and Dr. William Peck. Maya is one of four playable Operators in this latest iteration of Zombies - she's joined by Grigori Weaver, Elizabeth Grey, and Mackenzie "Mac" Carver - and unfortunately for them all, Terminus Island is a bio-research station for Project Janus, and those pesky Dark Aether undead are soon up and about again, ruining everyone's day.
</p>
<p>
Terminus Island is the first of two Zombies maps so far revealed for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's launch (the other being the West Virginian town of Liberty Falls), and here, up to four players must work together to discover and complete objectives in order to escape the maximum-security complex - all while fending off waves (or "rounds") of the undead.

<p>
Treyach calls Terminus Island "one of the largest round-based zombies maps ever created", and players are able to freely explore its landmarks, including the prison area, ocean, and smaller islands accessible via Tactical Rafts. There's a Main Quest to complete (as is the case for all Zombies maps), but exploration might also reveal hidden objectives, or audio logs, documents, and other artifacts pointing to further discoveries.
</p>
<p>
Progressing through a Zombies map requires players to spend Essence - accrued by slaying enemies - in order to unlock doors or remove obstacles, with some maps having multiple routes. However, Essence is also spent on Perks, to upgrade weaponry, to purchase ammo and additional weapons, and more - meaning players must think carefully about how they use their stash.

<p>
Additionally, there's player-specific Salvage to acquire out in the world, used to access Ammo Mods capable of applying elemental power to a current weapon, to upgrade a weapon's Rarity Tier so it inflicts more damage, and to build specific equipment at crafting tables.
</p>
<p>
While Blacks Ops 6's maps are said to be "more challenging" than those found in Black Ops Cold War, this latest iteration of Zombies is introducing a new guided mode to help newcomers progress through a Main Quest. This'll arrive "later in-season" after each map's launch, and players managing to complete a map's Main Quest before its guided mode arrives will earn a limited time Calling Card. There are also unique themed rewards to earn, with an extra reward available for those that complete the Main Quest without using guided mode.
</p>
<p>
And that's just scratching the surface. There's an absolute load more Zombies information - including confirmation Black Ops 6's so-called Omnimovement system will feature - in Activision and Treyach's <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel">extremely lengthy blog post</a>. There's a look at customisation Augments, weapons, load outs, and field upgrades, as well as talk of GobbleGums and Wonder Weapons. And if you want a breakdown of the creatures you'll encounter - from bipedal shamblers to the fleshy body horror of the Amalgam - that's in there too.
</p>
<p>
Activision says to expect more Black Ops 6 and Zombie details (including a look at the Liberty Falls map) as part of its next Call of Duty livestream, which airs on Wednesday, 28th August. Black Ops 6 launches for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on 25th October.

			<p>Today, id Software's Marty Stratton and Hugo Martin appeared on the main stage during QuakeCon. They announced the definitive re-release of DOOM and DOOM II, which are now available to all DOOM fans worldwide. In addition to the definitive release of the two iconic DOOM games, they also announced the <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-eternal-pc-mod-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM Eternal: PC mod preview</a>, which brings official mod support to the beloved shooter.</p>
<p>DOOM was first released in 1993 and became one of the pioneering games for the FPS shooter genre. Even today, DOOM is a major franchise, with Doom: The Dark Ages set for release in 2025. DOOM II, the critically acclaimed sequel to DOOM, was released in 1994 and received just as much love as the first.</p>
<p>The new definitive edition, available now, was developed alongside Nightdive Studios, combining these games into one neat package. The games are available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>
<p>The newly enhanced versions of <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM and DOOM II</a> offer many new features for players to explore, including a new Online cross-platform Deathmatch feature for up to 16 players. It also has an in-game mod browser with community-published single-player mods.</p>
<p>In addition, the renders have been optimized, and the game comes with multiple accessibility options to allow more fans to access it. In addition to all of these new features, an additional soundtrack is available, including the never-released IDKFA version of DOOM II.</p>
<p>A brand new episode has also been added, called "Legacy of Rust." This episode gives players access to new weapons and demons to tackle, created in collaboration with individuals from id Software, Nightdive Studios, and MachineGames.</p>
<p>Those who already own DOOM and DOOM II can get a free upgrade to the remastered versions while still being able to access the classic versions of the game.</p>
<p>In addition to this announcement, the DOOM Anthology was also announced at QuakeCon. This physical edition includes DOOM, DOOM II, DOOM 64, DOOM 3, DOOM, and DOOM Eternal Deluxe Edition. It comes with a steel book game case for the DOOM Anthology, as well as a five-inch statue of the BFG with LEDs and a stand.</p>
<p>This collection will go on sale on October 22, 2024, for those who want to get their hands on it. It will be available for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It is&nbsp;<a href="https://gear.bethesda.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently available for pre-order</a> for $79.99&nbsp;and is exclusive to the US and Canada.</p>
<p>Also announced at QuakeCon was DOOM SNES from Limited Run Games. This includes an updated 16-bit port of DOOM SNES with both a standard edition and a collector's edition. It comes with 14 new levels, circle strafing, and much more, set to be released in 2025.</p>
<p>It's looking like it will be an incredibly stacked year for DOOM next year, with the release of DOOM SNES and <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>.</p>

To kick off the massive event, id Software dropped a Mancubus-sized amount of news about <em>Doom</em>. </p><p>Here’s the biggest and best <em>Doom</em>-related news to come out of QuakeCon day one: </p><h2 id="h95789"><a id=""></a><strong>A New, Enhanced Way To Play <em>Doom, Doom 2, </em>And More Is Out Now</strong></h2><p>Arguably the biggest and coolest news to come out of QuakeCon 2024 was the reveal of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes?linkId=100000279162898&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes?linkId=100000279162898" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new “enhanced” port of <em>Doom</em> and <em>Doom 2</em></a></span><em>.</em> This new port combines the two popular and classic shooters into a single package. </p><p>This new port, which is available now on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Switch, is different than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/earlier-this-morning-listings-for-the-original-doom-do-1836729154&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/earlier-this-morning-listings-for-the-original-doom-do-1836729154">the previously released port from 2019</a></span>.

Id Software says this is the first time since <em>Doom 2</em>'s original release that the company has officially added new monsters and weapons to the classic FPS.</p><p>Oh, and this new port also supports full crossplay, letting you either play through the classic <em>Doom </em>games together regardless of platform, or letting you kill your friends even if they game on Xbox and you play on PC. </p><h2 id="h95791"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Doom + Doom 2</em> Enhanced Port Is Free For Previous Owners</strong></h2><p>Here’s the best news: If you already owned the previously released Bethesda ports of <em>Doom </em>or <em>Doom 2,</em> you get this new version of both classic games for free. Even if you just own <em>Doom </em>or <em>Doom 2</em> on PS5, doesn’t matter, you get access to this new enhanced port, too. </p><p>Id Software says getting the free updated version of <em>Doom </em>and <em>Doom 2</em> should happen automatically on consoles and PC. In fact, your copy of <em>Doom</em> might already be updated right now. </p><p>And yes, <em>Doom and Doom 2</em>'s new port is free for Game Pass members on PC and Xbox. </p><h2 id="h95792"><a id=""></a><strong>The Old Ports Of <em>Doom</em> &amp;<em> Doom 2</em> Aren’t Going Away</strong></h2><p>But, if you are someone who doesn’t like any of the changes included in the new port or you just hate change, Bethesda and id Software confirmed that the previous ports aren’t going anywhere. </p><p>On consoles, you’ll still have access to those older versions and can download them and play them freely even after today’s big update.

It’s impressive that this game was even ported to such an underpowered console back in the day. And now that SNES port of <em>Doom </em>is getting a full and fancy re-release. </p><p>Limited Run Games and id Software announced at QuakeCon that a new physical port of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1821642626740703719&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1821642626740703719" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Doom </em>on the SNES is arriving in 2025</a></span>.

<p>Take-Two Interactive’s CEO has addressed the rumors surrounding a possible partnership between FIFA and 2K Sports.</p>



<p>During their first quarter earnings call of fiscal year (FY) 2025, Strauss Zelnick was asked directly about the company’s interest in creating a simulation FIFA soccer game. </p>



<p>“We’re in the soccer business,” Zelnick said. “We have the number one mobile soccer manager title in Top Eleven and we’re really happy that we do.</p>



<p>“We’re also very mindful that it’s incredibly difficult to build a great sim experience for console; it takes a long time. And if you do it right, your users are very loyal and very embedded.” “</p>



<p>Zelnick then made note that with the FIFA license, having it wouldn’t bring along with it any rights that a traditional sports entity would.</p>



<p>“It doesn’t come with players, teams, or leagues,” he said. “It’s not as simple as negotiating with the NFL or the NBA or MLB where, at most, you have to negotiate with a league and a player’s association.</p>



<p>“For anyone who’d want to compete in the straight ahead sim environment for soccer, you wouldn’t just have to address one particular brand license.” </p>



<p>Zelnick brought up the company’s happiness with its current sports lineup, which he called a “great portfolio.” From the NBA to PGA to WWE and more, he praised where things stand. That said, he didn’t shut down the idea that a deal could be coming.</p>



<p>“I’m sure we will make more announcements in due course,” he said.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has heard on multiple occasions from multiple sources dating <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1757049502874189897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as far back as February</a>, that Take-Two and FIFA have had a number of discussions, and negotiations, regarding a possible FIFA 2K game. Where things currently stand regarding any potential agreement, however, is being kept close to the vest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-a-long-term-video-game-actor-strike-wouldnt-be-good-for-anyone<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But in the short term, he doesn't expect business impacts to the publisher.</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-officially-go-on-strike-over-ai-protections">Video game voice actors continue to strike</a> in an effort to push gaming companies toward a deal on AI protections for all actors. But while CEOs at major publishers like EA and Take-Two don't think the strike will have a short-term business impact, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledges that a "long-term strike wouldn't be good for anyone."</p><p>Speaking to IGN today ahead of the company's Q1 earnings, Zelnick responded to a question about whether or not the strike would impact the company's business broadly. Like EA CEO Andrew Wilson, he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-video-game-actor-strikes-wont-have-short-term-impact-on-the-company">doesn't expect an immediate impact to the business</a>. That's to be expected, given that technically games in production before August 25, 2023 are not officially struck work. While actors can still opt to express solidarity by refusing to work on them, it seems likely that most of Take-Two's upcoming slate of games already has most of its acting work complete anyway. GTA VI, for instance, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-among-games-exempt-from-video-game-voice-actor-strike">isn't expected to be impacted</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But should the strike wear on for longer, potentially impacting projects signed since last year or which don't have acting work captured yet, Zelnick admits it wouldn't be a good thing.</p><p>"We deeply value our talent relationships. Historically, we've worked really successfully with all the guilds, including SAG-AFTRA. We're going to continue to work hard to come to a resolution. We've already reached common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, so I'm confident we can find a way to get to a deal and we certainly hope that we will. That said, we do not expect the strike to have an impact on our business in the near-term. Obviously, a long-term strike wouldn't be good for anyone."</p><p>As Zelnick notes, SAG-AFTRA and game companies have come to an agreement on 24 out of 25 proposals, with the remaining proposal concerning use of artificial intelligence to create digital replicas of actors for use in games. Union members are demanding that companies disclose use of generative AI to create such models to actors and receive consent before doing so, as well as compensation for that use.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>SAG-AFTRA claims that among other disagreements, companies are attempting to exclude certain types of actors from these agreements, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-says-publishers-ai-measures-are-dangerously-incomplete-as-video-game-members-go-on-strike">while the union wants these agreements to cover everyone</a>: face, motion, and voice actors. We've <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamers">written elsewhere about what this strike</a> and its impacts might mean for gamers.</p><p>Take-Two reported total net bookings of $1.22 billion for the quarter, within its guidance, and projects net bookings between $1.4 billion and $1.47 billion for Q2. Its full year guidance remains unchanged, expecting between $5.55 billion and $5.65 billion in net bookings. The company also reported that GTA V sales have exceeded 200 million, and Red Dead Redemption 2 has sold over 65 million units today. Its expectations for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive">GTA 6's release in Fall of 2025 remain unchanged</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-deep-dive-confirms-you-can-turn-off-the-revamped-hud-confirms-item-durability-bar-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Dead Rising fans, you'll hear a familiar song if you watch the deep dive.</h2></div><section><p>Capcom has shared a new gameplay deep dive into <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a>, confirming that players can turn off the revamped HUD, confirming there will be an indicator for item durability, and more. </p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr6gWKQZASM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video uploaded onto YouTube</a>, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster director Ryosuke Murai and producer Kei Morimoto play through roughly 11 minutes of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. The gameplay shown in early segments of the duo shows off some familiar gameplay mechanics, along with some new changes exclusive to the upcoming remaster. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Among the biggest changes the duo revealed is that players can turn off the revamped heads-up display (HUD) available in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. "[T] here's an option to make it disappear after a while," Murai revealed during the deep dive. "[S]o If you think the UI gets in the way, you can just use that." </p><p>As gameplay before today's deep dive revealed, the upcoming remaster has significantly changed the HUD, providing a more minimalistic approach. Nevertheless, the HUD could still pose as a distracting indicator for those who want to see everything on the screen without any obstructions. </p><p>Two additional details in the gameplay deep dive revealed that items now include a durability bar. Unlike the original game, where you have to figure out how many hits you could use non-firearm before it broke, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster displays a small blue durability bar below the weapon to determine how much mileage it has before it breaks. Using item durability can potentially be a new defensive tactic for players when facing enemies with guns, as you can use some items, such as <a href="https://youtu.be/vrfXSnCBZsg?si=4924PVzNUZJC9ucz&amp;t=323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a barrel, to block gunfire</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>More importantly, Capcom has finally confirmed that the licensed music from the first game is back in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. As IGN previously reported, Capcom <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-confirms-licensed-music-from-original-dead-rising-will-be-in-deluxe-remaster">confirmed licensed music</a> was returning, and at the 7:55 mark of the deep dive, the footage shows Frank West in Leisure Park at night fighting the convicts. </p><p>Fans of the original Dead Rising are likely familiar with the Lifeseeker song Gone Guru, which will play every time you encounter this particular enemy. Of course, if you are a content creator planning to play Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster and fear getting a copyright strike, the deep dive revealed a setting that removes the licensed background music (BGM). </p><p>Another significant tidbit in the deep dive is Capcom <a href="https://youtu.be/Sr6gWKQZASM?si=85zfNUJO2Y1YPXb5&amp;t=265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealing Otis Washington's voice</a>. Fans of the series, particularly the first game, will know that Otis Washington was one of many NPCs who never got a voice actor despite the fact that you regularly interacted with him via calls received on the transceiver.</p><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is Capcom's second remaster of the 2006 game. Powered by the RE Engine, It introduces new facial expressions, realistic lighting, and more details for in-game environments. It also includes previously confirmed quality-of-life improvements, such as the ability to move while aiming, and improved survivor AI. </p><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is out on September 19 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.
