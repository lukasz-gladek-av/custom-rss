<p>In a new clip uploaded on social media, Nadeshot unveiled the ‘signing’ of Chris Hemsworth to 100 Thieves, the esports organization he founded several years ago. It’s a promotional stunt to boost ‘Crime 101’, an all-new movie starring Hemsworth as the lead, supported by Halle Berry, Mark Ruffalo, and Barry Keoghan.</p>



<p>On February 10, a special one-shot livestream will take place <strong>between </strong>Nadeshot and Hemsworth, and a limited range of 101 Thieves x Crime 101 apparel will be available to buy directly from the ‘101 Thieves Compound’ in Los Angeles.</p>







<h2 id="h-chris-hemsworth-joins-100-thieves-for-now">Chris Hemsworth Joins 100 Thieves… For Now</h2>



<p>In a clip uploaded on social media, Nadeshot pretended he was having a tough time playing ARC Raiders. He suggested that he needed to sign ‘someone new’ to the team, rather than relying on <strong>old talent</strong>. The promo featured Nadeshot pretending to <strong>scout </strong>Chris Hemsworth using clips from Crime 101, the new movie hitting theaters on February 13.</p>



<p>As the clip closed out, Nadeshot welcomed Hemsworth to 100 Thieves. Then, the camera jumped to Chris ‘You Know Him Best as Thor’ Hemsworth, who corrected the creator:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thanks Nadeshot, but I think you mean <strong>101 Thieves</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure></figure>







<p>The post said that Nadeshot would ‘run some games’ with Hemsworth, which could be interesting.</p>



<p>But does Chris Hemsworth play video games? In Avengers: Endgame, he’s enjoying some Fortnite with his friends, Korg and Miek, but does the iconic Australian actor enjoy a session or two away from the big screen?</p>



<p>Probably not. He has made some throwaway comments in the past and was recorded playing an old Thor game on Xbox 360 <strong>years ago</strong>, but that’s all we know. If he’s nursing a secret ARC Raiders addiction, then who knows? Perhaps he can teach Nadeshot a thing or two.</p>

It was actually Warhammer 40,000 owner Games Workshop, which took issue with an image of a shoulder pad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ftl-in-a-warhammer-40000-skin-game-pulled-from-steam-after-what-may-be-a-nuisance-dmca-takedown-from-a-troll-claiming-to-be-games-workshop">IGN reported on Void War</a>, a strategy game dubbed ‘FTL in a Warhammer 40,000 skin,’ after it was pulled from Steam. At the time, its developer, Tundra Interactive, suggested it may have been on the receiving end of a nuisance DMCA takedown from a troll claiming to be Games Workshop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Void War is often compared to both indie darling FTL and Warhammer 40,000, Games Workshop’s tabletop wargame set in the grim darkness of the far future — and it’s easy to see why. The gameplay looks incredibly similar to Subset Games’ hugely popular 2012 ‘spaceship simulation roguelike-like,’ and the aesthetic is very Warhammer 40,000. The voidships look like Imperial Navy Vessels. Some of the characters look like Space Marines. There’s an actual Psyker that’s called a Psyker. There are “Imperial Shrineworlds.” There’s even a mention of “Imperial astrogation authorities.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Void War Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the takedown, IGN asked Tundra Interactive for comment, and it responded with something quite unusual. It said that it had received a takedown notice from Valve stating that Games Workshop itself had claimed copyright infringement. But here’s what made this one odd: the claiming information came from Games Workshop’s public-facing infringements inbox and the name “Mal Reynolds.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mal Reynolds is a name that will be instantly familiar to Firefly / Serenity fans, because that’s the name of the main character, played by Nathan Fillion, in the beloved but short-lived sci-fi show. At the time, it was thought that it was unlikely that Games Workshop would have someone on its books named Mal Reynolds. But, well, it turns out Games Workshop really was behind the takedown, according to Tundra Interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tundra Interactive told IGN that Games Workshop eventually replied to the developer to confirm it was their notice, and that the concern was limited to a specific shot from one of the trailers on the Steam store page that it said could give the impression that Void War was associated with Games Workshop. The company specified that the element in question was “the oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim.” And, well, yeah, that Void War trailer did indeed have an image of a character who looked a lot like a Space Marine, complete with "oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/cover-art-1769428932329.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This isn't a Space Marine, it's a character from Void War. Or, was.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tundra Interactive told IGN that it disagreed with Games Workshop's assessment here, but in order to get Void War back on Steam and to avoid a drawn out DMCA fight, it pulled the trailer. It may re-upload it in the future after making an adjustment, but its priority is getting back to work on Void War, the developer insisted. And, to that end, Void War is now back on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Tundra Interactive’s statement in full to IGN:</p><blockquote>To recap, the initial takedown was triggered by a DMCA notice attributed to Games Workshop. At the time, we could not independently verify the submitter beyond the name and contact email Valve included. The contact email was GW's public infringements inbox, and the name listed was “Mal Reynolds,” which is also a fictional character from the sci-fi TV show Firefly.</blockquote><blockquote>After over a week of no response, Games Workshop eventually replied to our email and confirmed the notice was theirs. They said their concern was limited to a specific shot from one of the trailers on the store page, arguing that certain elements could create the mistaken impression that Void War is associated with Games Workshop, specifically what they described as “the oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim.”</blockquote><blockquote>All of the artwork in the trailer is original work created by our artists. While we disagree with their assessment, the simplest way to get the game back up and avoid getting bogged down in DMCA process was to remove that trailer and move on. We may re-upload an updated version later after we find time to adjust that shot, but for now our priority is shipping content and finishing multi-language font support so we can finally deliver proper translations.</blockquote><blockquote>Thanks for your patience, and thank you for the overwhelming support. o7 commanders.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All’s well that ends well? Perhaps. Certainly this case shows that Games Workshop and “Mal Reynolds,” who I’d love to meet one day, are keeping a close eye on video game characters and their shoulder pads. Perhaps it shouldn't come as a surprise, given Games Workshop's history of stringent IP protection. Be warned! The Inquisition is always watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

This included putting my face into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/03/hands-on-with-virtual-boy-nintendo-classics/"><strong>the recreated Virtual Boy accessory</strong></a>, savouring the party atmosphere of the new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/03/meetup-in-bellabel-park-brings-the-party-to-super-mario-bros-wonders-switch-2-edition/"><strong>Super Mario Bros.

I also got to dip a toe into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/05/resident-evil-requiem-and-pragmata-both-show-what-the-switch-2-is-capable-of/"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem and Pragmata on Switch 2</strong></a>, to see how they compare to my previous time playing on PS5.</p>

<p>In our MIO: Memories In Orbit review, I said, <em>“MIO: Memories In Orbit is an early contender for one of the most memorable games of 2026. It is an incredibly challenging game to play, with combat being a highlight, even if some platforming section can be frustrating. It looks fantastic, though, and the story is well told. MIO: Memories In Orbit draws you in, and does not let go easily. It is hard game but the journey is worth experiencing.”</em></p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:197043,196663 @ 1770469288 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I find myself in a rare position of being <em>between games</em> at the moment, so I've actually started to fill in one of my biggest blind spots that's haunted my backlog for years: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a>. I know, I know, I really should have played this one already, but I haven't, alright! I'm putting things right now, I promise.</p>
<p>I'm only an hour or two in at this point, and it's... weird. I like it, but it's definitely weird. Stay tuned for more revelations.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>Drama intensifies as I cleared <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> up to chapter 14. Not sure I will be able to finish it this weekend, but if not, it will very likely be the fault of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a> demos. Shadow dropping <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a> (and <strong>Ganbare Goemon! Collection</strong> on the Japanese eShop!) was unexpected and something I will certainly make some time to revisit. Smooth progress continues on the story mode of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition</a>, but it will have to share its wheel with the shiny and chrome new release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/carmageddon-rogue-shift">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift</a>. Too many games for only 48 hours, send help!</p><p>

My game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a>. I admit to not having completed the game back in the PlayStation era (too many great games coming out every single week!), but I really enjoyed the demo. Adulting truly is the greatest nemesis of JRPGs, and looking at the release schedule ahead, 2026 will indeed be the year of JRPGs on both Switches!</p></div>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>More <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing</a> for me. I've recently learned the DIY recipe for Glowing Stickers and can use them to make cool custom patterns for my walls which don't have to be stuck on a square canvas. Which means the various features of my Trek-themed house can now look infinitely more impressive!</p>
<p>Trouble is, I now need to find a reliable supply of that weird green moss to craft the bloody things before I can customise. Lots of trips to faraway islands with Kapp'n this weekend, then. Wish me luck, folks.</p>

<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>It’ll be no surprise what I’ll be playing this week. My copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> on the 3DS arrived this week so I’ve been making it a prework/morning routine of checking on my weirdos. (Yes I made Alex!) I’m really enjoying it so far and it’s perfect to get me ready for when the new one comes out. Outside of that, I have plenty more games on my backlog to finish so I’ll likely play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dredge">Dredge</a> this weekend and finally try out the most recent DLC. I’m not far from completing the game but I can’t help but get distracted by fishing for hours and avoiding the creatures as much as possible.</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>PIKMIN! I’m playing lots of Pikmin at the moment. I purchased two Game Vouchers before Nintendo killed the service, and since I finally discovered the Pikmin series last year, I thought it was about time I checked out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve beaten Pikmin 3 already, though I’ll be jumping back in this weekend and starting it on a higher difficulty – I honestly had no idea how short it is, but it’s still a banger. Pikmin 4, meanwhile, is just on another level. It’s wonderful, and I absolutely love the new camera angle. There’s a lot of chit-chat at the beginning, but I feel like I’ve gotten through the worst of it now. This might be cropping up quite a bit in future WAYP features…</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-aos-new-tzeentch-and-lumineth-releases-review-magical</link>
            <guid>1428862</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week sees another new batch of <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar </em>releases riding upon winds of ethereal magic, with Battletomes for the Disciples of Tzeentch and the Lumineth Realm Lords, as well as new models, hitting pre-order. Games Workshop sent us a sampling from each army to check out, so follow along as I jump in on my <em>Warhammer AOS</em> new release review!</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Lumineth Realm-Lords - New Battletome</strong></h2><p>The new Battletome for the Lumineth Realm-Lords brings this army into the modern era of <em>Warhammer AOS</em>, with updated lore, faction rules, and Warscrolls, along with Spearhead, Path to Glory, and Army of Renown rules. I won’t cover everything here, but I’ll highlight a few key points that stood out to me.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-aos-lumineth.jpg?itok=D2UYnYDr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="667">

  </picture><p>Lore-wise, this book does a wonderful job of setting the scene for the Lumineth, with over 30 pages dedicated to the history of the Lumineth (as is to be expected with these Battletomes).&nbsp;</p><p>There’s not a lot of time spent in the present, with the Vermindoom gnawing through the fabric of reality, but what little is there teases out the trouble the perfection-seeking Lumineth find themselves in.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wahammer-aos-lumineth-realm-lords.jpg?itok=Q6Xhk1tW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="938">

  </picture><p>As we jump into the rules, the first thing we see is the Lumineth’s Depict Rune battle trait. Once per round, you choose a rune to inscribe on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p><p>These runes give small bonuses like adding 1 to the run and charge roles of select units, or subtracting 1 from hit rolls by enemy units. But where it gets immediately interesting is how these combo with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>While only one rune is active at a time, these runes gain conditional bonuses if you’ve used <em>other</em> specific runes so far in the game.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-aos-army-rune-lumineth-realm-lords.jpg?itok=Vd5rd1dL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="600" height="459">

  </picture><p>Also known for their spellcasting, the Lumineth boast some spicy spells, with most of them handing out mortal wounds like pieces of Lembas bread (sorry, mixing mythologies here).</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Lumineth Realm Lords - New Model</strong></h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-aos-lumineth-realm-lords.jpg?itok=_66QMvLR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-aos-lumineth-realm-lords.jpg?itok=UAAAQDJr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>Along with the new Battletome, we also got to check out the new model releasing for the army, the Vasari Lord Regent.</p><p>With two optional builds, this Lumineth stands tall and proud no matter how you choose to assemble him. His stats are as follows: Move 6”, Save 4+, Control 2, Health 5. And his weapon, the Regent’s Sword has the <strong>Crit (Mortal)</strong> keyword, Attack 5, Hit 3+, Wound 4+, Rend 1, and Damage 2. Not too shabby, but his abilities really stand out.</p><p>His passive ability, <strong>Shining Example</strong>, states that each time a friendly Lumineth Realm-Lords unit wholly within 12” of him uses the ‘Rally’ command, you can make 3 additional rally rolls of D6. Imagine scoring even one extra six off this ability, the impact would be huge.</p><p>He also has the situational but impressive <strong>Wall of Blades</strong> ability (though, I suppose it’s not situational if you build around it) which allows you to pick a friendly Vanari Auralan Wardens unit wholly within 12” of him and select them to be the Wall of Blades, then choose an enemy unit in combat with the Wall to be the target. You roll a die for each model in combat with the target enemy unit, and on a 5+ you inflict 1 mortal damage on the target.</p><p>I love the flavor of this, here’s this regal, imperious general who can sweep into the battlefield, rally his troops not with screams and shouts but his own glittering, inspiring presence, then with a word turn a unit in the heat of battle into a slicing, precise wall of death. So fun and flavorful!</p><p>Now, if you’ve had just about enough of all this orderly Lumineth business, let’s get weird…</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Disciples of Tzeentch Battletome</strong><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-aos-disciples-battletome.jpg?itok=0etMvLgX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="706">

  </picture></h2><p>If you had to pick one army in all of <em>Warhammer</em> <em>AOS</em> to serve as the complete opposite of the Lumineth Realm-Lords, I don’t think you could do much better than the Disciples of Tzeentch. Bathed in the&nbsp; kaleidoscopic colors of Tzeentch, the Chaos God of change, the Disciples thrive on unrest and scheming, hoping to serve their god to bring about a great crystalline freakout.</p><p>As with the Lumineth Battletome, the Tzeentch Battletome is full of incredible lore - and I would argue paints an even better picture of the army, their beliefs, and how this varied group comes together for a greater (impossible to comprehend) purpose. There’s even a section of the Jade Obelisk, a <em>very</em> cool-looking Chaos <em>Warcry</em> army.</p><p>Shifting over to the rules, we see a bevy of Battle Traits the army starts with. These include <strong>Eldritch Illusions</strong>, allowing you to set up three units in reserve during deployment, <strong>Smoke And Mirrors</strong>, which allows you to swap a unit for one of your units in reserve, and <strong>Silver Simulacrum</strong>, which lets you set up a second Argent Shard during deployment (vs. when you’d normally be able to, during faction terrain setup).</p><p>There’s also <strong>All Part of the Plan</strong>, which lets you gain Fate points whenever (to put it simply) certain things go <em>wrong</em> for your army, <strong>Destined to Serve</strong>, <strong>Destined Arcana</strong>, and <strong>Destined for Battle</strong> which let you spend said Fate points to remove damage, boost casting rolls, and add to your charge rolls, respectively.</p><p>This creates an incredibly malleable and, what I would call, “slippery” army that’s hard for your opponent to wrap their arms around (just as Tzeentch intended).</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Disciples of Tzeentch New Models</strong><picture>

  </picture></h2><p>Now let’s close out this review with a quick look at some of the new models coming up for preorder today. First up is the Fatemaster.</p><p>This military mastermind comes out swinging with the following stats: Move 5”, Save 4+, Control 2, Health 6. His weapon, the Cursewrought Glaive, sports Attack 4, Hit 3+, Wound 4+, Rend 2, Damage 2. Which is fine for a single model unit, but his abilities are what really make him shine.</p><p>First, there’s <strong>Long in the Planning</strong>, a once per turn Activation during the Enemy Hero Phase that let’s you spend 2 fate points to simply remove a friendly unit with 12” from the battlefield if an enemy unit charges them and gets within 3”. Again… slippery!</p><p>Then there’s the <strong>Bound Retinue</strong> ability, which you can trigger once per turn on your movement phase. This one’s so interesting, and could be a real doozy! If it is masked by illusion (i.e. set up in reserve, as described above), you can pick it <em>and another unit </em>masked by illusion, and set them both up just about anywhere on the battlefield (the only restriction being they need to be more than 9” from an enemy unit). What!?</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Finally, we have the new faction terrain Argent Shards. I love the look of these bizarre shards of crystal and eyeballs, and their abilities aren’t too shabby either. There’s the <strong>Magical Focus</strong> ability, which allows a shard to act as a magical foci, meaning your spell casters can use its position instead of the position of the spell caster for measuring and determining line of sight on their spells.</p><p>The Shards also have the <strong>Magical Duplication</strong> special ability, which says once per turn during any movement phase you can either set up an additional Argent Shard (if only one is on the battlefield), or remove it from the battlefield and set it up again in another spot on the battlefield. Talk about keeping your enemies on their toes!</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Disciples and Lumineth - Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p><br>To wrap it all up, I think these are two strong releases for <em>Warhammer AOS</em>, though I do have to admit I’m more drawn to the Disciples. Maybe it’s just the flavor of raging chaos vs. stately order, but I feel like the lore, new rules, and new models for Tzeentch are just stronger than the Lumineth.</p><p>Are you going to be updating your Lumineth or Tzeentch armies with these new releases?

            <title><![CDATA[IEM Krakow Semifinals Represent a Clash of Titans in the Tauron Arena]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/iem-krakow-semifinals-titans-tauron/</link>
            <guid>1428859</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The stage is officially set for the penultimate stage at IEM Krakow this weekend. We’re about to see the final four teams battle for the lion’s share of the prize pool in Poland, welcoming scores of visitors to the Tauron Arena in Krakow, as many as <strong>22,000</strong>.</p>



<p>MOUZ enters the weekend riving an immense wave of momentum after totally dismantling G2, Team Vitality steps into the ring after a solid group stage, Team Spirit has batted down all comers, and FURIA has spent the last few weeks doing what FURIA does best, securing a clean high-tier finish.</p>



<p>But what are the most accurate IEM Krakow predictions looking like?</p>







<h2 id="h-which-team-will-win-at-iem-krakow">Which Team Will Win at IEM Krakow?</h2>



<p>If you’re a fan of Counter-Strike betting, you’ve almost certainly got a wager fluttering around on the outcome of IEM Krakow. If you’ve waited this long, hopefully you can get your slip in today, but if you’ve had a stake running this whole time, hopefully you’re still in play.</p>



<p>There’s a dense weekend of entertainment lined up at IEM Krakow. Here’s what the schedule looks like:</p>



<p><strong>February 7</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Team Spirit v. FURIA</li>



<li>Team Vitality v. MOUZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>February 8</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>TBC v. TBC (third-place match)</li>



<li>TBC v. TBC (grand final)</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s a whopping $400,000 prize on the line for the first-place team in Krakow, but at this point, every organization walks away with a sizeable chunk of cash in their pocket.</p>



<p>The four teams left represent a real test. MOUZ has come into the semifinals with some stellar momentum after tearing through G2, but the team has to contend with Vitality, an inherently challenging prospect. In 2025, Vitality scooped <strong>nine </strong>trophies across the Counter-Strike space, and it’s going to be a tough hill for MOUZ to climb.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you’ve got FURIA v. Team Spirit, and that promises a different kind of battle. FURIA just wiped Aurora from the running with a monstrous performance (shout out KSCERATO), but Team Spirit has shown a resilient streak to get this far.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that Vitality remains the statistical favorite, but MOUZ could serve up a slight underdog edge to snatch the trophy. The safe money will be on Vitality, but there are only four teams to choose from at this point, so it’s not a huge pool if you’re making a Counter-Strike wager.</p>







<p>Which team do you think has the IEM Krakow trophy in the bag? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Star Addresses Whether The TV Show is ‘Fallout 5’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-star-addresses-tv-show-fallout-5/</link>
            <guid>1428856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Fallout television series, backed by Amazon’s Prime Video, is one of the most beloved live-action adaptations ever made. It’s an award-winning show that boasts an original story fused with elements pulled straight from the post-apocalyptic game franchise, and it just wrapped its second season and is moving onto the third with immense gusto.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, one of the series’s most iconic stars addressed a fan theory. He recognizes that people are curious whether the Fallout TV show ‘is’ or perhaps is setting up for <strong>Fallout 5</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-fallout-tv-show-leading-to-fallout-5">Is The Fallout TV Show Leading to Fallout 5?</h2>



<p>We could have <strong>ten years </strong>of the Fallout TV show, including the two that we’ve already had. There’s an abundance of world-building for the showrunners to pull from, and production on the third season is already underway.</p>



<p>In December, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-todd-howard-confirmed-fallout-5-details/">made a bold statement</a> about <strong>both </strong>the future of the television show and Fallout 5, showing how they’ll intertwine:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a recent supersized interview breakdown with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/FalloutOralHistory-PartIII" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, Walton Goggins, who plays Cooper ‘The Ghoul’ Howard in the television show, echoed that sentiment, saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;In some ways, people have said, “Is it Fallout 5?” That’s way above my paygrade.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not clear what he’s referring to, but it’s <strong>most likely </strong>a nod to those who believe that the television show’s original content, which is set further in the future than anything ever created in the Fallout universe, is building up to Fallout 5’s story.</p>



<p>That original production was also addressed by Goggins:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They did their homework, and it was built into the DNA of the story that they created, and this isn’t like Fallout 1, Fallout 2, or Fallout 3… it’s its own thing. It’s original content within the Fallout world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Whatever happens, it could be at least another four or five years before we see <strong>anything </strong>to do with Fallout 5. Bethesda still needs to wrap development on Starfield’s second expansion (and whatever comes next), <strong>and </strong>deliver The Elder Scrolls 6. There’s a lengthy wait in store, but fans might be able to tide themselves over with upcoming releases like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fallout-3-remastered-out-now-shadowdrop-rumors-explained/">Fallout 3 Remastered</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bend Studio’s Cancelled Live Service Shooter Surfaces Online Again]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-cancelled-shooter-surfaces-online/</link>
            <guid>1428850</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bend Studio was forced to shut down the ongoing development of an unannounced live-service shooter last year amid restructuring and layoffs that led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-lays-off-around-30-of-staff-following-live-service-game-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30% of the company</a> disappearing. The game that was cancelled would have been a third-person, military-themed shooter, but we know little more than that about the abandoned title.</p>



<p>Recently, fresh files surfaced online from the project, taken from a former Bend Studio animator responsible for designing turrets, character gait, and some minor animations, such as throwing knives and deploying drones.</p>







<h2 id="h-mirror-pond-animations-appear-online">‘Mirror Pond’ Animations Appear Online</h2>



<p>It’s not a huge leap into uncovering Mirror Pond, which was the project name for Bend Studio’s cancelled third-person shooter, but it’s <strong>something</strong>. In the files pulled from a former animator’s portfolio, we can see a third-person perspective (which we already knew about) explored from a more technical standpoint.</p>



<p>What’s assumed to be a player character model walks across the screen, brandishing long firearms and traipsing with a traditional military movement pattern. In another clip, we see the same character throwing what looks like knives, before shooting something from a forearm-mounted device, and deploying a small drone mounted on their back.</p>



<p>There’s also a shot of a turret activating and firing at an unseen target.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>These files were uncovered by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-bend-studio-cancelled-live-service-title-mirror-pond-animations-surfaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">M</a>P1st, but no source was given.</p>



<p>It all points to Mirror Pond having been planned as a near-future third-person shooter of sorts, perhaps aligning with the bygone days of Syphon Filter. That’s one of the franchises that allowed Bend Studio to cut its teeth in the gaming world, and it featured spycraft, a third-person perspective, and techy gadgets.</p>



<p>In September 2025, Bend Studio opened up and started hiring again for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-hiring-for-a-new-multiplayer-game/">new, unannounced multiplayer title</a>. What that is remains to be seen, but it could be an attempt to recover the fragments of the cancelled live-service ‘Mirror Pond’.</p>



<p>Fans have long hoped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">a new Days Gone project</a> would surface, but as we all know, that’s very unlikely.</p>







<p>What do you think Mirror Pond would have looked like? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Pokémon is celebrating 30 years this year, and as part of this, trainers around the globe can expect all sorts of exciting (and surprising) announcements.</p>
<p>Ahead of the annual event Pokémon Day, taking place later this month on 27th February 2026, Stern Pinball has announced it will be stepping into the battle arena with its very own themed pinball cabinet. And yes, we're referring to an <em>actual</em> pinball cabinet here (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_pinball">not a video game</a>).</p>
<p>The price of admission? Well, according to the <a href="https://pokemon.sternpinball.com/landing-page/pokemon">official landing page</a>, it'll be <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">available in three varieties</a> and is "coming soon". The Pro model starts at <strong>$6,999</strong>, the premium model is <strong>$9,699</strong> and the "highly collectible Limited Edition model" is going for <strong>$12,999</strong>. This particular model is also <strong>limited to 750 units</strong> "globally".</p>

<p>If you want <a href="https://pokemon.sternpinball.com/landing-page/pokemon">future updates about this cabinet</a> and when exactly it drops, you can sign up for email updates on the official website. And if you're ready to purchase or happen to be a business owner (or just want to enquire about one), you can also fill out a form for that.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the prices for this Pokémon cabinet are in line with the current offerings on Stern's website, which include cabinets based on series such as Star Wars, X-Men, and Jurassic Park.</p>

<p>Here's what the critics had to say</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="d245c705831a7"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Wonder Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d245c705831a7/super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's an action-packed week on the Nintendo front, and on top of the Partner Direct, we also shared a bunch of previews earlier this week.</p>
<p>If you haven't already seen our preview for Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park we're not so sure about it so far. Here's what staff writer Ollie Reynolds had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ultimately, I’m struggling to find much of a reason to splash out on the £16.99 / $19.99 Upgrade Pack for Mario Wonder so far. I did take note of just how sharp, clean, and vibrant the visuals were in the Switch 2 Edition, so that <em>might</em> be just enough to convince me to make a leap. But if the multiplayer modes were meant to tempt me into a purchase, I’m afraid they’ve largely failed in their task."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196663 @ 1770469435 -->
<p>So, what did other critics have to say? Here's the round up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/02/03/amusing-attractions-in-an-attractive-amusement-park">Game Informer</a>: "Meetup in Bellabel Park is about what I expected based on the trailers, and that's a good thing. I had a great time in Attraction Central, and knowing there are so many more stages in each minigame has me looking forward to playing the full release with some family on my couch."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-dlc-meetup-bellabel-park-preview/">Polygon</a>: "<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, <em>Jamboree TV</em>, and <em>Meetup in Bellabel Park</em> all serve similar purposes: They show what kind of play is possible with Switch 2 and leave you excited to see what Nintendo can do in a full Mario Party or WarioWare game. The novelty factor that currently makes add-ons like this fun to toy around with is bound to wear off before the console’s one-year anniversary. If mouse controls are going to be more than a bonus gimmick, we’re going to need some more substantial games that make use of the feature soon."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/preview-super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-meetup-in-bellabel-park/">DualShockers</a>: "If you have a friend group you can line up to play together with on a game night, or perhaps some gamer kiddos on hand in your household, Super Mario Bros. Wonder for the Switch 2 is absolutely going to be a winner that you can break out time and time again."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-already-tired-of-nintendo-switch-2-editions-and-even-new-mario-wonder-content-cant-change-that">IGN</a>: "Each game certainly had some fun to offer, but afterwards I couldn’t help but feel like this concept is awkwardly straddling the line: if I wanted multiplayer mayhem with Mario characters, there are so many other, better options like Mario Kart, Party, or 3D World, just to name a few. And, if I wanted 2D Mario, I’d much rather play the traditional Super Mario Bros. Wonder campaign, which I adore. To be completely fair, there is more traditional content on the way in Wonder’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition in the form of Wonder Effect boss fights against the returning Koopalings and extra challenges that take place in pre-existing levels, but I didn’t get to try any of that at this preview event. Even so, none of this Edition’s additions currently feel as exciting as a couple of extra brand-new worlds likely would have."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-wonder-turns-into-mario-party-with-the-bellabel-park-expansion/1100-6537843/">GameSpot</a>: "None of these minigames would be worth the price of admission on their own, but altogether, the package looks to be substantial. We only got a taste of a handful of the minigames during our multiplayer session, and each one we tried had multiple difficulty levels with different stages to try. I also got the sense that there was more to be discovered, possibly through the collection of those special coins that were so tricky to get during the cooperative stages."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/57278-hands-on-with-switch-2-s-early-2026-lineup-mario-tennis-fever-meetup-in-bellabel">GoNintendo</a>: "Your interest in this add-on will likely be dependent on how often you’re able to get a group of friends together to play. If you’ve got a core gaming group, and you’re the type who likes a silly collection of multiplayer games in the vein of Nintendo Land or Mario Party, Bellabel Park should fit the bill."</p>

<p>It's available at select Best Buy, GameStop, Target and Walmart Stores in the US. And in Canada, you can take to the court at Best Buy and Walmart.</p>
<p>Nintendo's in-store Switch 2 kiosks have also offered demos for games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. Unfortunately, there's no mention of this latest first-party demo being made available on the eShop (<em>at least yet</em>), but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Although we didn't share a full preview of this title, Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds recently went hands on with the new entry, and thinks Mario Tennis fans will be "absolutely thrilled" with the new title. We've also done a previews round up if you would like to find out more about this new game.</p>

<p>In some related news, earlier this week, Nintendo announced it would be <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/retail-locations/san-francisco/serve-up-fun-mario-tennis-fever-feb-12-nintendo-san-francisco/">hosting special launch events</a> for Mario Tennis Fever at its stores in New York and San Francisco. These events will feature the game demo, photo ops, a gift alongside the purchase of the title and more.</p>

<p>Here's what's on the way</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="a41c3ac65d5b9"><a title="Console Archives" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a41c3ac65d5b9/console-archives.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Hamster Corporation</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's Partner Direct was loaded with all sorts of surprises, and one of the biggest announcements for retro fans was Hamster Corporation's reveal of its new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hamsters-console-archives-is-the-closest-well-get-to-virtual-console-in-2026">Console Archives series</a> for Switch 2 (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/the-arcade-only-rave-racer-drifts-onto-ps5-this-month-console-archives-also-coming-soon">and PlayStation 5</a>).</p>
<p>This will revive classic games, originally released on home consoles, on modern hardware. Two titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-ninja-gaiden-ii-the-dark-sword-of-chaos">Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</a> and the PlayStation title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders">Cool Boarders</a> are already available on the Switch 2 eShop, so what else is on the way?</p>
<p>Hamster has now provided details about what else is on the way in its <a href="https://youtu.be/eaIlTJyYR30">latest Japanese broadcast</a>. It features many of the games showcased in the initial announcement. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-doraemon">Doraemon</a> by Hudson has been dated for July, but the rest of these games don't have a release date just yet.</p>
<p>For now, here's what's on the way in the near future (via Gematsu):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <strong>Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</strong> (Tecmo 8-bit) – <strong>Out now</strong> for Switch 2<br>
- <strong>Cool Boarders</strong> (UEP Systems, 32-bit) – <strong>Out now</strong> for Switch 2<br>
- <strong>Doraemon</strong> (Hudson, 8-bit) – <strong>30th July 2026</strong><br>
- <strong>Nobunaga’s Ambition</strong> (KOEI, 8-bit)<br>
- <strong>MagMax</strong> (Nichibutsu, 8-bit)<br>
- <strong>Sonic Wings Special</strong> (Video System, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Dezaemon Plus</strong> (Atena, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure</strong> (Nippon Ichi Software, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Master of Monsters: Disciples of Gaia</strong> (Toshiba-EMI, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Monster Rancher Hop A Bout</strong> (Tecmo, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>UFO: A day in the life</strong> (ASCII, 32-bit)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the Arcade Archives series, Hamster's Console Archives series is "packed with convenient features". This includes customisable button layouts and screen settings, as well as the ability to save and load at any point.</p>
<p>Apart from its reveal of Console Archives, Hamster also announced it would be adding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer">Rave Racer</a> to its Arcade Archives collection on 26th February 2026.</p>

<p>The demo went live on Switch 2 this week</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom has finally released its demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> on the Switch 2 and some side-by-side comparisons to the other versions of the game have now been shared online.</p>
<p>If you are wondering this version holds up, according to <a href="https://youtu.be/64-XoEHbp-o">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, the Switch 2 will run at a lower resolution than the Xbox Series S version, but upscaling is supposedly better on Nintendo's console. This is also said to apply to the Switch 2's filtering and shadow quality, which shows "better results".</p>
<p>As for the game's frame rate, all consoles target 60fps, but the Switch 2 release apparently struggles to maintain this frame rate during more heated moments.</p>

<p>Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pragmata-might-wind-up-being-the-biggest-surprise-of-2026">recently previewed Pragmata</a> and had the following things to say about the game's performance and resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It felt pretty stable and consistent during my time with it. There are a few visual downgrades compared to the likes of PS5 with some muddy textures and a slightly fuzzy resolution, but it’s a handsome game nonetheless with impressive lighting and a strong art style."</p>
</blockquote>

            <guid>1428775</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ftl-like-void-war-dmcad-allegedly-by-games-workshop-0" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c0fe5dc8-146f-4c11-b6a8-2b5f2365e5bd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">two weeks ago when we reported </a>that <em>Void War</em> had been DMCA'd by a party claiming to be Games Workshop. Now, we can confirm that it was indeed Games Workshop that filed the <em>Void War</em> DMCA as Tundra Interactive has told us more about this story, and how <em>Void War</em> is back up on Steam now.</p><p>After failing to communicate with Tundra Interactive for a week, Games Workshop finally replied, and confirmed that the <em>Void War</em> DMCA was on their behalf. That means that Games Workshop does employ a lawyer named Mal Reynolds, despite how unlikely that seemed, and it is a deeply ironic name given the <em>Firefly</em> character with the same name. Tundra Interactive explains what issue Games Workshop had with <em>Void War</em>:</p><blockquote><p>They said their concern was limited to a specific shot from one of the trailers on the store page, arguing that certain elements could create the mistaken impression that Void War is associated with Games Workshop, specifically what they described as “the oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim.”</p></blockquote><p>Tundra Interactive emphasizes that all the artwork in the trailer for <em>Void War</em> was original work created by their artists. Despite that, in the goal of a fast resolution, they have removed the story trailer that had the offending image. With that done, they were able to get the game back up on Steam. Tundra Interactive stated, "We may re-upload an updated version later after we find time to adjust that shot, but for now our priority is shipping content and finishing multi-language font support so we can finally deliver proper translations." saying that new versions of the trailer may come.</p><p>It is possible to view the trailer via a <a href="https://video.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/257147370/movie_max.mp4" rel="nofollow">link from SteamDB</a> which has an image at 34 seconds which match the description given by Games Workshop, as well as confirmed by Tundra Interactive that it is the offending image.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Games Workshop has a history of being... very protective of its IP, dating back to actions like trying to trademark the term <a href="https://gizmodo.com/games-workshop-is-still-claiming-to-own-the-trademark-t-5982201" rel="nofollow">Space Marine</a>, to the contentious relationship with fans over things like fan animations that they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games-workshop-is-trying-to-shut-down-fan-animations/" rel="nofollow">took steps to ban</a>.</p><p>We previously reached out to Games Workshop, but they did not reply regarding whether they had filed the DMCA against Tundra Interactive.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully, all's well that ends well and Tundra Interactive can get back to making their game without further legal hurdles. <em>Void War </em>is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2853590/Void_War/" rel="nofollow">available on Steam </a>and also <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war" rel="nofollow">on Itch.Io</a>, which will also provide a Steam key.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1428742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I bought a Riffmaster Wireless Guitar this weekend because they were $50 off (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/RIFFMASTER-Controller-Xbox-Rechargeable-Officially-Microsoft/dp/B0CWN15TRF?th=1">and still are, I believe</a>). I have been hunting for a full Rock Band 4 set at a reasonable price for a few years, and it has been a futile exercise. But the Riffmaster guitar, plus Fortnite Festival, has gotten me close to the nostalgic Rock Band/Guitar Hero experience I have been pining for. I was initially underwhelmed by the song selection. It had some music I liked, but it was limited, and there is no simple option to outright buy songs that have been available to play in the past. I know this is the standard Fortnite operating procedure – arbitrary limitations on digital goods in order to exploit the player base (which I remind you is mostly children) into making purchases because they won't be available soon. Everything sucks and I hate it.</p><p>But, moving on from that ongoing frustration with modern video games, I was surprised to learn the song selection gets swapped out often. Daily, it seems. Which means logging in every day provides new songs. And today, in particular, the selection lined up much more with my taste. Chappell Roan songs (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PINzY8ErwGo">not surprising considering she was recently added to the game</a> [but no "Pink Pony Club" which <em>is</em> surprising]), the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocXEwsJGOQ">Hatsune Miku and Anamanguchi mash-up</a>, Fall Out Boy music from their first album (I never listened to any of the other ones), and "Welcome Home" from Coheed &amp; Cambria. I played a bunch of great songs and I will see what's new tomorrow. They've hooked me in, the jerks. Also, sometimes my character just isn't holding a guitar. See Ms. Roan above. I am not sure why.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/02/06/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-february-6]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Finally, a AAA game that'll run on most gaming PCs</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> is just a couple of weeks away, and while the first few trailers definitely made it look like a <em>beautiful</em> game, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> trailer that debuted earlier this week, well, didn't. But, the way I see it, that's <em>excellent </em>news, especially for anyone on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-budget-gaming-pc">budget gaming PC</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since the RE Engine came to prominence starting with Resident Evil: Biohazard, Capcom has been impressing me with just how good it can make games look, without making them too demanding. Now, obviously, I haven't had the chance to test Resident Evil: Requiem performance yet myself, but just looking at both the system requirements and the Switch 2 trailer, it seems like Capcom is continuing this trend. </p><div><div><p>Resident Evil: Requiem Minimum PC Requirements</p></div><div><div><p>Processor</p><p>intel Core i5-8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</p></div><div><p>GPU</p><p>Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT</p></div></div></div><div><div><p>Resident Evil: Requiem Recommended PC System requirements</p></div><div><div><p>Processor</p><p>Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500</p></div><div><p>GPU</p><p>Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super / AMD Radeon RX 6600</p></div></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom hasn't revealed what resolution and settings either of these spec sheets are targeting, but even if that recommended build is just for 1080p Ultra at 60 fps, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/02/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-super-review-and-benchmarks">Nvidia RTX 2060 Super</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review">Radeon RX 6600</a> are very attainable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-graphics-card">graphics cards.</a> That's not to mention only requiring a Core i7-8700 or Ryzen 5 5500 and 16GB of RAM, which is a very low bar to clear. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">What Kind of Performance Can I Expect?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, because Capcom hasn't revealed any specific settings that the system requirements are targeting, I can't say for sure, but from my time testing <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/resident-evil-village-pc-performance-the-almost-perfect-pc-port-we-all-needed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resident Evil Village for TechRadar</a> when it came out, I was able to get nearly 60 fps at 4K with an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evga-rtx-3060-xc-black-review">RTX 3060</a> – and the 3060 is very much not a 4K graphics card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, it's important to note that the requirements for Requiem are a bit heavier than they were for Village. The biggest difference is that instead of asking for a Radeon RX 5700 or a GTX 1070 for Village, Requiem is asking for an RTX 2060 Super or a Radeon RX 6600. And while the performance gap between these graphics cards isn't huge on its own, the key difference is that Requiem is recommending a ray tracing-capable GPU – Village didn't. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">That makes a lot of sense, given the visual quality of some of the trailers that have come out for the game, but it may leave some folks with older GPUs out in the cold. It's very likely that with an older non-RT GPU, the game will look a lot like the Nintendo Switch 2 footage. The bright side here, though, is that the GTX 1660 and Radeon RX 5500 XT sneak in the minimum specs, so you'll still be able to <em>play</em> the game, it just might not look too great. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Nintendo Switch 2 Equivalent</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's important to highlight that the Nintendo Switch 2 is able to run Resident Evil: Requiem, even if it wouldn't <em>quite</em> meet the system requirements if it were a PC. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-analysis-is-4k-actually-realistic-updated">The Tegra T239 SoC in the handheld is roughly the equivalent of a mobile RTX 3050</a> – which is weaker than the desktop-class GTX 1660 Capcom is requiring. I wouldn't get too caught up in this detail, though. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Primarily, that's because the Nintendo Switch 2 is a console and every single unit will be running the exact same hardware. That means when Capcom was porting Resident Evil: Requiem over to the Switch 2, it was able to fine-tune the build to the exact hardware, likely finding optimizations that wouldn't be there for the PC version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, just going by the Switch 2 trailer earlier this week, it does seem like Capcom just barely managed to squeeze the game onto the handheld. But even if it is rough, I'm looking forward to seeing just how well it runs on the Nintendo console. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Isabela Merced is slated to star in a movie adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega’s </a>House of the Dead franchise.</p>



<p>It seems like video game franchises are being adapted for film and TV at a rapid pace. Not only are video game stalwarts like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog starring in brand-new movies, but more recent video games such as The Last of God and Uncharted are being adapted for TV series.</p>



<p>As first reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Isabela Merced, known for her work in the aforementioned The Last of Us TV series, will be in a leading role in a new film about the House of the Dead. Paul W.S. Anderson will write and direct the project. He previously adapted the Resident Evil franchise for the big screen over 20 years ago.</p>



<p>He also adapted the Monster Hunter series for a 2020 film, but it was not nearly as well-received as the Resident Evil movies.</p>



<p>In 2003 and 2006, two House of the Dead films were released, but they were critically panned.</p>



<h2 id="h-history-of-the-house-of-the-dead">History of the House of the Dead</h2>



<p>How’s the dead began life in 1997. It was originally a light gun arcade game. Games were regularly released up until House of the Dead 4 in 2005. An arcade release in 2018 was titled “Scarlet Dawn.”</p>



<p>There were also spin-offs, such as 1999’s The Typing of the Dead, designed to improve typing; it was later re-released for the Sega Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. 1999 also saw the arcade release of Revenge, a beat-’em-up take on the franchise.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming will keep you up to date with all the latest news regarding the House of the Dead movie.</p>

<h2>Bad news for Valve in particular?</h2>
<p>On the surface, it might seem like every company making gaming hardware would be similarly affected by increasing component costs. In practice, though, analysts suggested that Valve might be in a uniquely bad position to absorb this ongoing market disruption.</p>
<p>Large console makers like Sony and Microsoft “can commit to tens of millions of orders, and have strong negotiating power,” Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad pointed out. The Steam Machine, on the other hand, is “a niche product that cannot benefit in the same way when it comes to procurement,” meaning Valve has to shoulder higher component cost increases.</p>
<p>F-Squared’s Futter echoed that Valve is “not an enormous player in the hardware space, even with the Steam Deck’s success. So they likely don’t have the same kind of priority as a Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft when it comes to suppliers.”</p>

<p>The size of the Steam Machine price adjustment also might depend on when Valve made its supply chain commitments. “It’s not clear when or if Valve locked in supply contracts for the Steam Machine, or if supply can be diverted from the Steam Deck for the new product,” Tech Insights analyst James Sanders noted. On the other hand, “Sony and Microsoft likely will have locked in more favorable component pricing before the current spike,” Van Dreunen said.</p>
<p>That said, some other aspects of the Steam Machine design could give Valve some greater pricing flexibility. Sanders noted that the Steam Machine’s smaller physical size could mean smaller packaging and reduced shipping costs for Valve. And selling the system primarily through direct sales via the web and Steam itself eliminates the usual retailer markups console makers have to take into account, he added.</p>
<p>“I think Valve was hoping for a much lower price and that the component issue would be short-term,” Cole said. “Obviously it is looking more like a long-term issue.”</p>

              <p><span>The Analogue 3D, a premium gaming console that’s fully compatible with Nintendo 64 games, just got</span> <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/3d-prototype"><span>a new line</span></a><span> of translucent colorways replicating five colors that were prototyped for the N64 but never released. The new Analogue 3D: Prototype Editions follow the limited release of Analogue’s Funtastic line, which replicated the N64’s Funtastic colorful translucent shells last December and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogueInc/comments/1pj8cgh/analogue_3d_limited_editions_what_sold_out_first/"><span>sold out</span></a><span> in less than two hours.</span></p> <p><span>The new limited edition line comes in five colors: Ghost, in sea glass (and the star of the show, in my opinion); Glacier, in milky white; Atomic Purple, in deep plum; Extreme Green, in, you guessed it, neon green; and Ocean, in cobalt.</span></p>   <p><span>“Five colors were officially prototyped for the original Nintendo 64,” the company writes. “Unreleased. Until now. They were real. They were manufactured. They were never released.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The company continues, “Analogue 3D: Prototype Editions finally release these lost colors as limited editions. History, finished. Decades later.”</span></p> <p><span>The unreleased N64 colors were </span><a href="https://consolevariations.com/blog/5-rumored-n64-prototypes-finally-discovered"><span>discovered</span></a><span> in 2019 by Console Variations, after a former Nintendo of Europe employee contacted the site. This little piece of lost video game history will be restored for the lucky customers who manage to get their hands on the new line before it sells out.</span></p> <p><span>The “highly limited” Analogue 3D: Prototype Edition consoles will be available for purchase on Monday, February 9 at 8 a.m. PST, and will ship within 48 hours. They will retail at $299.99.</span></p>

 <p><span>In partnership with Analogue, 8BitDo is releasing a series of matching controllers for the new Prototype console line. The controllers will also be available for preorder on February 9 at 8am PST, though they won’t ship out until April. The controllers will be sold (separately) for $44.99.</span></p>

 <p><span>In addition to the Analogue 3D, the console maker also sells the Analogue Pocket, a handheld compatible with games for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance (though it’s currently out of stock).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The Analogue 3D is available in standard Black and White for $269.99, with matching 8BitDo controllers sold separately for $39.99.</span></p>

<p>Another short trailer for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/" id="3170">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a> just dropped, and Yoshi again takes center stage, taking out one of Bowser’s most well-known minions in the most Yoshi way possible.</p>



<p>The new trailer, with the tagline “Level Up,” features previously seen clips of Bowser Jr., Mario, and Luigi. However, there are also new images of Princess Peach with Toad in a cyberpunk-looking environment, and at one point, they appear to enter a bar, with several low-level enemies from Mario video games giving them a dirty look.</p>



<p>Yoshi is also shown riding a motorcycle, similar to what Mario and Luigi did in a previous trailer. He also confronts Kamek, swallows him whole, lays an egg with Kamek’s glasses on it, and then pilots the vehicle Kamek had been piloting. Princess Rosalina is also seen in a brief action shot towards the end.</p>

<h2 id="h-this-movie-takes-inspiration-from-several-generations-of-super-mario-video-games">This Movie Takes Inspiration From Several Generations of Super Mario Video Games</h2>



<p>This movie is named after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/super-mario-galaxy/" id="2961">Super Mario Galaxy</a> video game, which was released on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-wii/" id="1031">Nintendo Wii</a>. but takes inspiration from many Mario games that came before and after the classic game from 2007.</p>



<p>A previous trailer showcased Birdo and Mouser from Super Mario Bros. 2. Baby Mario and Baby Luigi were also on display, being carried by Yoshi as they ran away from the realistic dinosaur featured in Super Mario Odyssey.</p>



<p>There has been no sign yet of Donkey Kong or any of the Kongs that were featured in the first Super Mario movie.</p>







<p>The movie is slated for release on April 1. It was previously noted that the movie was in post-production after animation was completed.</p>
