<p>What a combo</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a long-time reader, then you know we love a bit of Jupiter's Picross series. And we're in for a treat on 27th November 2025, as we're getting two brand new Picross games on Switch.</p>
<p>Jupiter has announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/picross_s_capcom_classics_edition">Picross S Capcom Classics Edition</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/picross_s_snk_classics_neogeo_edition">Picross S SNK Classics &amp; NEOGEO Edition</a>, with both games featuring tons of pixel art puzzles for you to solve from various Capcom and SNK properties. Both titles will cost <strong>$17.99 / €17.99 / £16.19</strong> each.</p>
<p>For Capcom, you've got some familiar favourites such as <strong>Street Fighter</strong>, <strong>Mega Man</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ghosts_n_goblins">Ghouls 'n Goblins</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/breath_of_fire">Breath of Fire</a>, <strong>Final Fight</strong>, and other classic Capcom franchises.</p>
<p>SNK's own Picross entry pulls from <strong>Metal Slug</strong>, <strong>Fatal Fury</strong>, <strong>King of Fighters</strong>, and many other titles from its illustrious fighting game history and NEOGEO catalogue.</p>

<p>Both games will include Picross, Mega Picross, Color Picross, Clip Picross, and Extra modes, as well as art galleries and grid guidelines. On Switch 2, both will be compatible with Mouse Mode too!</p>
<p>We've seen Picross team up with Mario, Zelda, Pokémon, Doraemon, Sanrio, Story of Seasons, and many more IPs. We'd love to see even more like Capcom and SNK, too. Spoil us!</p>

		<p>Coming from the creator of Turbo Overkill, the survival horror Total Chaos is no longer “coming soon”, it’s out now! Total Chaos is available for PS4, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it’s a day one game for Xbox Game Pass as well. Steam VR support is expected to arrive in Q2 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total Chaos | Available Now on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3oMPaRnaiig?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s an impressive trailer for the game, with some deeply unsettling visuals and perspectives, playing out as a first person horror and lookin to blend both classic and modern horror sensibilities together. </p>
<p>Across the 9 chapters journey through to the heart of Fort Oasis, along the way you’ll be able to lean on both melee and ranged weapons, building new weapons from scrap and scavenging as you go. </p>
<p>Your journey will also be accompanied by a soundtrack that features a new original theme from Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka, and an ambient soundtrack from composers Jason Dagenet &amp; William Braddell, and Apogee’s Tim Stoney, Chipper Hammond, and Mathieu Hallouin.</p>

<p>Total Chaos has its roots in a modern Doom II total conversion. First conceptualised by Sam in 2008 and then developed from 2012 through 2018, Total Chaos has now been completely rebuilt as a fully standalone experience, and expanded from six chapters to nine.</p>

		<p>Eclipse Glow Games shared a big long look at their upcoming action-adventure game, a spectacular visual feast of a boss battle that’s inspired by Arthurian Legend. The game is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, though there’s no date set just yet. </p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Annihilation | &quot;Break the Mirror&quot; Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGOsH1Gp8SE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Players will step into the role of Gwendolyn, with this boss battle seeing her face off against the witch Tyronoe through multiple realms. This is a Dual Frontline battle, where you battle through a mirrored, folded realm as both Gwendolyn and the knight Sir Lamorak.</p>
<p>There’s a lot going on throughout, from shattering the divide between worlds, to fighting on a lake and within its reflective surface, and to a big fiery ball that you need to blow up before it’s too late. </p>
<p>It really is quite special as a visual showcase, built within Unreal Engine 5.</p>

<p>I also find that it’s quite a satisfying turnabout for the usual game creation tale of Western developers looking to Asian mythology and history for inspiration. Eclipse Glow Games is a Chinese studio that’s borrowed from British myths instead, setting Tides of Annihilation in a devastated and distorted version of London, following an Outworld invasion, and crossing over to the mythical realm of Avalon. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/erosion-open-world-roguelite-spaghetti-western-shooter-deaths-advance-time/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/erosion-is-an-open-world-roguelite-spaghetti-western-shooter-where-your-deaths-advance-time-and-bring-consequences.1359937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Polish indie developer Plot Twist has unveiled its new open world roguelite game, Erosion, at the Xbox Partner Preview, and it was certainly among the most interesting titles there.</p>



<p>In Erosion, players find themselves in a distant future where a mysterious, sentient rock formation known as the Pillar is consuming civilization, bit by bit. They must descend into the Pillar and battle through chaotic, fully destructible dungeons to get one step closer to saving the protagonist’s daughter or losing her to time itself forever. Every decision alters the course of the story, and every death reduces the time available.</p>



<p>The game can be roughly split into two parts: </p>



<ul>
<li>Dungeon runs, where the focus is on fast-paced, twin-stick roguelite combat in procedural dungeons.</li>



<li>The Overworld, a handcrafted, open world, spaghetti western environment dedicated to exploration, quests, and meta-progression.</li>
</ul>



<p>Erosion was built with a “low voxel” aesthetic, enabling full physics-driven environmental destructibility. Players will encounter a diverse range of biomes, both above ground (deserts, swamps, ancient cities) and below ground in dungeons, each presenting unique atmospheric and enemy challenges. The game features an extensive arsenal of weapons, active/passive skills, and "orbitals" that the player can equip to deal with enemies. Boss design draws inspiration from classic arcade games (Snake, DDR, Pong, Tetris), sometimes blending bullet hell and puzzle elements. Erosion even features side activities such as poker, racing, sand fishing, and hunting.</p>



<p>The game's defining feature, however, is undoubtedly the time jump mechanic. Dying advances time, irreversibly altering relationships and quest outcomes, with branching consequences. Decisions like which factions to help, quests to complete, or bosses to fight have persistent effects; some villages might be taken over by factions or descend into anarchy depending on player actions. Eventually, players can unlock the ability to travel backward in time, undo previous choices, and try alternative timelines, letting them explore different outcomes and ultimately fix eroding timelines.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Plot Twist is planning to kick off early access in Spring 2026 for PC (Steam, Xbox on PC, and Game Pass), with console versions to follow. The developer said the early access period is expected to be short but will include rolling content updates, such as new biomes, skills, and timelines. The devs also plan to explore two-person cooperative gameplay and robust post-launch content inspired by successful roguelites like Dead Cells.</p>

			<p>The Golden Joystick Awards are consistently the awards show to kick off awards season for the video game industry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-leads-the-golden-joystick-awards-2025-nominations/">not just with how early the nominees are revealed</a>, but with how early the show is. It's not even December, and the popular annual awards show has named its Game of the Year winner, and winner of many more awards. This year, though, several of those awards, along with the Ultimate Game of the Year winner, all have the same recipient: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>



<p>Sandfall Interactive's debut title took home seven wins, including Sandfall being named the Studio of the Year, and Clair Obscur swept the performance-based awards as both Ben Starr and Jennifer English won for their performances of Verso and Maelle, respectively. It also won Best Storytelling, Best Visual Design, and Best Soundtrack, and was the only game to take home more than two awards, and it won in every category it was nominated for.</p>



<p>Though much of the night was focused on Clair Obscur, it wasn't the only game with a big win in the night. Ghost of Yotei took home two awards, including Console Game of the Year, while Hollow Knight Silksong took home PC Game of the Year and Best Indie Game (Self-Published).</p>

            <p>Biff! Smash! Spear to the groin! Asteroid to the jaw! It must be a new gameplay video for Tides Of Annihilation, the Arthurian fantasy action game from Eclipse Glow Games that's out to steal either <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>'s lunch - do me a favour and pick one, because I can't decide. I can't stop comparing this game to things. I think there's something wrong with me. Help.</p>
<p>The hoity-toity Englishness of it all is somewhat Bayonetta (minus the humour), but the ally-summoning mechanics remind me more of FF16, while lead character Gwendolyn is from the same school of improbably clean-cut beauty as Stellar Blade's Eve. She's perhaps a bit more grizzled than Eve, possibly because she keeps letting witches hit her in the face with small planets.</p>

<p>The video shows us a boss battle against one of those witches, Tyronoe. It appears unedited, so we can get a sense of the ebb and flow of the game's fancier throwdowns. The boss alternates between human-scale punching, valkyrie bombardments from the other side of energy barriers, and a tricksy little moment where she warps through a frozen lake's mirrored surface and starts battering you from inside the reflection. Fortunately, Gwendolyn teams up mid-fight with a Knight of the Roundtable, Lamorak, whose twisty javelin proves super-effective against the hag.</p>
<p>A barrage of background trivia from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tides-of-annihilation-brings-devil-may-crys-speed-and-god-of-wars-scale-to-post-apocalyptic-arthurian-london">the announcement post</a>: based in China, Eclipse Glow number 100 developers and have people who've previously worked on Yakuza, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>, Assassin's Creed, Persona, and Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>Tides Of Annihilation will be 30 hours long, and will have around 30 bosses. Some of the enemies are big enough to be levels, a la Fumito Ueda. Yes, that <em>is</em> Jennifer English of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> fame voicing Gwendolyn. The game is set across post-apocalyptic London and mythical Avalon, and they may have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-tides-of-annihilation-trailer-is-a-buttery-montage-of-bossfights">got the bus routes wrong</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-philips-hue-3-bulb-pack-hits-a-new-record-low-amazon-goes-nuts-on-black-fridays-first-day-2000645817</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-philips-hue-3-bulb-pack-hits-a-new-record-low-amazon-goes-nuts-on-black-friday%E2%80%99s-first-day.1359922/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Traditional light switches offer exactly two settings: on and off, which leaves you stuck with whatever harsh overhead lighting the previous homeowner installed. The Philips Hue 3-pack <em>White and Color Ambiance</em> bulbs <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5759/">just dropped to a record low of $69 for Black Friday on Amazon, down from the usual $109 price</a>.</p>
<p>Philips maintains strict pricing on Hue products throughout the year which makes Black Friday the only time these smart bulbs receive meaningful discounts. <strong>Smart lighting completely changes room ambiance</strong> by letting you tune color temperature, brightness and even hue to match your activity or mood rather than accepting whatever your builder-grade fixtures emit.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Millions of Colors</h2>
<p>The <em>White and Color Ambiance</em> range reproduces millions of distinct colors alongside the full spectrum of white light, <strong>from 2000K warm amber to 6500K cool daylight</strong>. You can bathe your living room in deep blue for movie nights, shift to energizing daylight white for morning routines or create warm orange tones for dinner ambiance. The color accuracy spans the entire visible spectrum, giving you precise control over the exact shade you want rather than cycling through preset options. Each bulb can display different colors simultaneously, so you might have blue accent lighting in one lamp while maintaining warm white in overhead fixtures. The 60W-<strong>equivalent brightness delivers 800 lumens at full power,</strong> and provides enough light for reading or detailed work rather than just mood lighting.</p>



<p>The<strong> bulbs connect directly to your home Wi-Fi network without needing a separate hub</strong>, but with the addition of a Hue Bridge come more advanced features: remote control from anywhere and more stable connections that don’t tax your router. Matter compatibility integrates Hue bulbs with other smart home devices across manufacturers, creating unified automation regardless of which ecosystem you’ve invested in. You can trigger lights based on motion sensors, door contacts, or time schedules without maintaining separate apps for each device brand. Secure connection protocols block unauthorized access to your lighting system while maintaining responsive control.</p>
<p><strong>Preset scenes</strong> offer one-touch lighting setups for frequent activities and times of day. The 24-hour natural light scene automatically adjusts color temperature throughout the day to simulate sunlight, gradually changing from warm tones at sunrise to bright daylight in the afternoon and back to amber hues at sunset. Such circadian lighting supports your body’s natural rhythm and could give you better sleep quality by reducing blue light exposure before going to bed.</p>



<p><strong>Voice control via Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit</strong> means you won’t have to reach for your phone every time you want to issue basic lighting commands. The voice commands work with individual bulbs, rooms or zones that group multiple lights together. This is pretty handy when you’ve got messy hands from cooking, are settling into bed, or trying to get through the door while carrying groceries.</p>
<p>The <strong>standard A19 form factor fits any fixture</strong> designed for traditional bulbs, from table lamps to ceiling fixtures to bathroom vanities. The bulb screws into E26 sockets designed for standard medium-base bulbs, requiring no special adapters or modifications. LED technology remains cool to the touch and uses a mere 9 watts while delivering <strong>brightness equivalent to 60-watt incandescent bulbs</strong>, and reduces electricity costs while lasting 25,000 hours or roughly 22 years at three hours daily use.</p>
<p>At $69 for three bulbs, this Black Friday deal brings the per-bulb cost down to $23, which undercuts Philips’s regular single-bulb pricing of $49. You’re getting full-color smart bulbs from the industry leader in smart lighting for less than many color-changing bulbs from unknown brands.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreen-dumps-its-65w-usb-c-wall-charger-with-4-ports-now-going-for-pocket-change-2000645791</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ugreen-dumps-its-65w-usb-c-wall-charger-with-4-ports-now-going-for-pocket-change.1359919/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wall outlets disappear fast when every device needs its own charging brick cluttering power strips and blocking adjacent sockets. The <strong>Ugreen</strong> <em>Nexode</em> 65W GaN charger <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/">just hit a record low of $24 for Black Friday on Amazon, down from its usual $39 price</a>. This four-port charger consolidates multiple charging bricks into a single compact unit that occupies one outlet while powering your laptop, phone, tablet, and wireless earbuds simultaneously. When traveling, carrying four separate chargers involves dedicating a lot of valuable bag space to power adapters, whereas this single charger handles everything. GaN technology keeps the charger cool and efficient while intelligently outputting a total 65W across three USB-C ports and one USB-A port.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W Powers Your MacBook at Full Speed</h2>
<p>The<strong> 65W maximum output is enough to fast-charge a MacBook Air at its full charging rate,</strong> and reach 51% battery in just 30 minutes. This matches the charging speed you’d get from Apple’s own 61W charger, so you’re not settling with the Ugreen as some kind of compromise. Power delivery is via USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 protocol that negotiates optimal charging rates with compatible devices automatically.</p>



<p>The <strong>four-port configuration includes three USB-C ports and one USB-A port</strong> that can cover modern devices alongside legacy gadgets. That three-USB-C setup means you can charge your laptop, phone, and tablet simultaneously using the same type of cable without hunting for different connectors. This design leaves the USB-A port for older devices, wireless earbuds, smartwatches, and accessories that haven’t transitioned to USB-C yet. Dynamic distribution of the total 65W output by intelligent power distribution allows for the <strong>charger to adjust the output based on what devices you plug in</strong> and their power requirements.</p>
<p>Gallium nitride technology replaces traditional silicon components found in the charger with more efficient materials that conduct electricity much better while generating less heat. This efficiency enables Ugreen to pack 65W of charging power<strong> into a charger that is significantly smaller than older silicon-based 65W adapters</strong>.</p>



<p>At compact dimensions,<strong> it measures just 2.64 by 1.65 by 1.5 inches</strong> and this charger is smaller than Apple’s single-port 67W adapter despite offering four ports and comparable power. This reduction in size matters enormously for travel: the charger easily fits into laptop bags, toiletry pouches, or jacket pockets without consuming excessive space. The foldable prongs collapse flat against the charger body and prevents them from snagging on bag contents or poking holes in pouches.</p>
<p>Universal compatibility includes MacBook Pro and Air series, iPhone 17/16/… series, Samsung Galaxy S25/S24/…, Pixel 10/9/…, iPad Pro, Steam Deck, and quite basically everything that charges via USB. It’s compatible across manufacturers and platforms without the need for brand-specific adapters or configurations. Charge Apple devices from USB-C ports and charge Android devices from the same ports without any compatibility issues.</p>
<p>At $24, this Ugreen 65W charger is 39% off retail while bringing features and performance that are in line with chargers costing upwards of $60 from premium brands.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nuketowns-most-popular-easter-egg-isnt-working-in-black-ops-7/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s preseason content brings Nuketown. The camo grind really begins now, but there’s a distinct lack of Easter Eggs in Nuketown, including the legendary mannequin heads.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is about to really get going. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> is getting ready to get underway, and this will signal the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-black-ops-7-warzone-coming-out-black-ops-7-warzone-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 &amp; Warzone Integration</a>. Before this, the preseason has started, which includes the debut (again) of Nuketown. This is the latest incarnation of the decade-old map.</p>



<p>But it’s missing one big thing at launch.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-nuketown-mannequins-can-t-be-shot">Black Ops 7 Nuketown Mannequins Can’t Be Shot</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a waiting game. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The mannequin heads can’t be shot in Black Ops 7’s Nuketown right now. The map is live, it has its own playlist option, but the mannequin heads are very resolute, meaning no Nuketown Easter Egg.</p>







<p>Ordinarily, you can shoot the mannequin heads, and if you pop all of them off, a humorous Easter Egg plays out. It varies from game to game, but there’s no such thing in Black Ops 7 right now.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’ve encountered this, don’t worry, it’s probably not permanent. This has happened before, and the mannequin Easter Egg—as well as any others—is usually activated once Season 1 begins.</p>



<p>No one knows why this is the case, but it’s usually what happens. So, be patient, and the time will come for you to furiously dislodge plastic heads from idle mannequin bodies.</p>



<p>Have you encountered any other weird occurrences in Black Ops 7? Bring it to everyone’s attention in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

The game received wide acclaim at launch: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dave-the-diver-review">we gave it a 9/10</a>, saying it's "wholesome, wonderfully complex, and delightfully hard to put down."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the trailer, we also got a brief tease of some upcoming previously-announced DLC, called In the Jungle, which will feature the addition of freshwater fish and some amount of new story.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Xbox Partner Showcase opened with a brand new game reveal I certainly didn't see coming: it's called Armatus, and it's seemingly being made by the developers of Godfall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Armatus is a new third-person roguelite shooter set in a fictionalized version of Paris that's looking...pretty messed up. An event called The Vanishing has effectively caused the end of the world, and you're some sort of masked warrior roaming around and fighting demons. That's really all we know for now: the trailer gave us a look at a lot of combat and some pretty cool monster designs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/armatus-xbox-partner-preview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire post</a>, we learned a little more: after the end of the world, four members of something called the Armatus meet and summon the player to fight on their behalf and get them sent to heaven. You're searching for something called The Sunless Gate along The Scoured Path, which is a constantly changing road through a broken Paris, with procedurally-spawned rooms, enemy compositions, and rewards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've forgotten everything about Counterplay's last game, Godfall, here's a refresh: Godfall was an action RPG that came out in 2020, initially just for PlayStation and PC but later for Xbox as well. It was described at the time as a "looter-slasher", heavily focused on finding and collecting better and better gear, and that admittedly had an awful lot of cool-looking weapons to collect. Unfortunately it received pretty mixed reviews, including from us, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/godfall-review">getting an IGN 6/10</a>. As our reviewer put it then: "Godfall can be an enjoyable and lovely gear-based action game while it lasts, but the repetition of its missions wears thin before the end of its campaign, and even thinner in the endgame afterward." Hopefully Armatus fairs better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Armatus is coming out in 2026 for Xbox Series consoles, PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2.

These arrive alongside visual polish and stability updates for a “smoother” experience on Kairos, Gearbox said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Digging into the detail, Class Mods have been adjusted to drop more for your current character, which is a welcome change for those on the hunt for ever-improving builds. The loot feed is now updated to display total current currency after spending or receiving money, and the likelihood of unintended movements or knockbacks while reviving a teammate is reduced. And it's worth noting that the patch adds a new Legendary Loot Indicator to the combat radar for easier identification of high-rarity drops. given how busy with loot Borderlands 4 can get, this is also welcome.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In the <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a>, below, Gearbox said it was wrapping up work on Photo Mode, while other updates like support for multiple active Big Encore Machines and more options for scaling difficulty are coming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further into the future, Gearbox said it’s looking at ways to improve shared character progression, add additional endgame-focused activities (Takedown), launch cross-save support, and more.

                <p dir="ltr">Vampire Survivors developer Poncle just announced a new game, Vampire Crawlers, and it emerged after the studio tinkered around with multiple different ideas.</p><p dir="ltr">Poncle's Luca Galante told GameSpot that making Vampire Crawlers, a deckbuilding game, was not the team's first choice for a follow-up to Vampire Survivors. "We actually started off with a set of five different projects. We worked with several indie teams, experimenting a little bit, and what happened is simply that Vampire Crawlers was the game that immediately jumped out at us," he explained.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"From the initial prototype, the team just nailed it. It was great immediately. They immediately understood the idea, the concept, and so that's the one that progressed. It wasn't some kind of strategic decision; it's just the one that naturally, organically went faster than any other."</p><p dir="ltr">Poncle had numerous other ideas, too. The ideas were "literally all over the place," Galante said. "Definitely not a soccer game or something like that, but I'm a big fan of RPGs, so there were actually, a couple actually different RPGs in the works," he explained.</p><p dir="ltr">He went on to say that people who have played Vampire Survivors may see clues to some of the ideas that Poncle was thinking about. "If you think you've seen a reference [to] a particular game in Vampire Survivors, there's a pretty good chance that I'm working on a spin-off of the genre of that game," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Galante went on to say that a metroidvania game would be a "perfect fit" for the studio, adding that this would "make so much sense" or even "too much sense."</p><p dir="ltr">"If we were to do something like that--which I would love to do something like that, by the way--but if I were to do it, I would just go to Konami and ask for permission to use Castlevania at that stage. It just makes too much sense," he said. "That or, honestly, if I were to do a metroidvania, I would probably do one with the Legacy of the Moonspell characters and setting. Or Tides of the Foscari. I would try to move a little bit away from Vampire Survivors."</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/im-making-this-for-me-not-to-make-everyone-happy-vampire-survivors-creator-on-his-next-game/1100-6536362/" data-ref-id="1100-6536362">GameSpot's full interview with Galante</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-crawlers-is-ready-to-become-your-next-obsession/1100-6536363/" data-ref-id="1100-6536363">hands-on preview of Vampire Crawlers.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Vampire Crawlers is set to release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile in 2026.

                <p>Each <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> map has a few intriguing puzzles to figure out, and they'll usually provide you with some nice loot for solving them. For instance, if you've come across the Ancient Fort POI on the Blue Gate map, you may have noticed a cellar door and some electrical boxes scattered around. This puzzle is easy to complete in theory, but the random battery locations add a sense of randomness to the equation. Luckily, we're here to fill you in on where to look for them.</p><p>Once you solve the puzzle and get the cellar door open, you'll gain access to a room filled with loot. Not every run will net you excellent stuff down here, but it's always worth checking out if you're in the area. So, with that said, here's how to complete the Ancient Fort puzzle and open the cellar door.</p><h2>How to open the cellar door at the Ancient Fort</h2><p>If you visit the Ancient Fort and poke around a bit, you'll notice a cellar door on an outside wall. It's likely to be closed when you arrive, but note the three lights above it, as they're a key to how you can pop this sucker open. You guessed it--you need to power up some electrical boxes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4607826-share_20251119_1052431.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4607826" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4607826-share_20251119_1052431.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4607826"></a><figcaption>Ancient Fort cellar door</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4607826-share_20251119_1052431.jpeg"></figure><p>There are three electrical boxes located around the fort.

<section><p>Vampire Survivors creator Luca Galante discusses new game Vampire Crawlers, leaving his solo-dev days behind, and his not-so-secret desire to make a Castlevania game.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Much like Vampire Survivors' titular vampire, the game's creator, Luca Galante, is often nowhere to be found. When Vampire Survivors won a BAFTA for Game of the Year back in 2023, it was a handful of Galante's colleagues at Poncle who took to the stage to accept it. At convention panels, Galante is known for using screens and decoys rather than addressing the audience himself. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQVdR8mJrds">NoClip documentary</a> chronicling the success of Vampire Survivors, Galante opted to have a Muppets-esque puppet resembling the game's iconic vampire mascot made so he wouldn't have to appear on camera himself. And it is a <em>very</em> cool puppet.</p><p dir="ltr">Even after I arrived in the small, walled city of Lucca, Italy to preview Poncle's new game, Vampire Crawlers, the myth-making of Luca Galante continued. Several Poncle devs I spoke to recounted, with sheer amusement, how they loved playing up Galante's mysterious persona. When fans asked if Galante was around, they'd sometimes remark, "He could be. He could be me." Matteo Sapio, the chief strategy officer at Poncle, laughed as he told me, "It's all very funny because honestly, yes, he is brilliant, but he's also a very kind and normal guy. He just really values his privacy."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Vampire Crawlers - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Imagine my delight then, when an hour after meeting Luca, I found myself sitting beside him on an old couch, both of us chatting animatedly about our love of Final Fantasy while playing Vampire Survivors together on a hulking CRT TV.</p><p dir="ltr">Contrary to how he presents himself, Luca Galante is an eager conversationalist. Though he speaks calmly and thoughtfully, it is not without immense passion for his work, the community it has fostered, and video games as a whole. After playing around 30 minutes of Poncle's new game, Vampire Crawlers, I proceeded to spend nearly an hour talking to Galante about his work on the game, what it's been like leaving his solo-dev days behind, and, most importantly, when we'll be able to play Vampire Crawlers from the comfort of our homes.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: So, what inspired the decision to set Crawlers in the same universe?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Luca Galante:</strong> That was something that we decided very early to do because the success of Vampire Survivors was so big that, among other things, I saw an opportunity in the name Vampire Survivors. It was somewhat of a business decision, to just keep working on that IP and idea. If I wanted to make a game like this, and make a new IP to go with it, it's just going to be one among the other hundreds of deckbuilders out there. The Vampire Survivors name gives us the strength and the ability to tell people, "This is a Vampire Survivors deckbuilder. You will find elements that you're already familiar with in this game, and it will capture the feeling of the original."</p><p dir="ltr">There is something of deeper reason as well though, which is that I wanted to keep bringing the core principles, the core ideas of Vampire Survivors, to other genres. I started Vampire Survivors for fun. It was something I was just doing for myself. And to me, what makes Vampire Survivors what it is is the fact that it's easy to play, makes you feel good, and tries to avoid frustration. I wanted to transfer all of that into this game.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also a massive relief not to have to come up with new settings, new characters, and new everything to make a new game. Because I don't like to sit down and create new things on purpose. I prefer for things to be intuitive. I like the creative process to be something that comes naturally. For this game, what matters to me most is the game's mechanics. The fact that I can use existing settings and characters gives me the freedom to focus on that.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>When you first started working on Survivors, it was essentially just you making that game. What has it been like working with a team?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When I started Vampire Survivors, it was only for fun. It was only for myself. But already at that point, it wasn't only my own stuff that I was using. I had a Castlevania-themed asset pack, basically. Well, medieval gothic, really, but it was very obviously inspired by Castlevania. The music I was listening to was actually Castlevania music. And then when I commissioned musicians to do music, I was using that music to inspire me.</p><p dir="ltr">So even if, yeah, I developed the game as a solo developer, I always had the inputs of other people from the beginning. And now I need other people to be able to maintain Vampire Survivors. With so many platforms, it is actually very complex to handle releases and QA. Even just passing ideas with someone who knows the game just as well as me is very important. It's a process I really like.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a lot of details on the original characters and weapon icons--all sorts of stuff, that wasn't how I initially thought about it. I simply went to the pixel artist, Glauber Kotaki, who's incredible. I'm so happy working with Glauber; you have no idea. I would just give Glauber some ideas, and he would work on them and make them better; he'd add even more elements to it. We had this ping pong of ideas going back and forth, just trying to make something interesting, and do something that people will be able to appreciate.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a lot harder, of course, and it's a much slower process now. But it's a different kind of fun. And honestly, when I want to do something--especially over the weekends when I'm alone--I do not have to worry about actually running the companies or having meetings. I can still sit down with my machine, open the project, and do whatever I want. It's the best of both worlds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607281-vc_screenshot_19.png" data-ref-id="1300-4607281" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607281-vc_screenshot_19.png" data-ref-id="1300-4607281"></a><figcaption>A look at Vampire Crawlers's combat</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607281-vc_screenshot_19.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I'm glad that you brought up Glauber because it leads into my next question. I feel like there's always this natural urge to change so much of the original game with a sequel or spin-off to make it more "modern." But Crawlers still feels so quintessentially Vampire Survivors, especially visually. What was the reasoning for retaining that look?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The idea was practical and technical. I thought, "Let's use the exact same assets. Because if we change them, people are going to complain. If we change them, it is going to increase the cost of this project." And I'm not an entrepreneur. I'm not a risk-taker. I don't want to end up having crazy budgets for games and putting the company at risk.</p><p dir="ltr">Actually, the initial idea was to run the marketing campaign of the game on the fact that it is recycled. Yes, it's super cheap. Yes, we are milking these pixels like there's no tomorrow, or something like that. But then as we actually started to work on the game, you start to fall in love with what you're doing. You start to want to do more.</p><p dir="ltr">So long story short, we ended up repurposing the old assets in the 3D settings, but we also got new icons. We got new animations. The only thing I think we're going to keep exactly as it is right now [are] the characters because I think that makes most sense. There isn't a strong reason to change the characters. Everyone has their own idea of what they look like, so I really do not want to change them. Even when we have to do drawings or animation for certain characters, we try to let whoever is drawing them interpret them and do not have very strict rules to adhere to.</p><p dir="ltr">Because it was so much fun for me to work with these things in this world, I just want that anyone else who works on this game to have the same experience--to put their own spin on things.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, the idea of keeping the same UI, or at least keeping it very close to the original, is that there is no need to reinvent everything. I really want the fog to be on the gameplay in the end. Everything else should be familiar, but at the same time feel fresh.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>That makes sense. You don't need to reinvent something that clearly works.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I don't know if it works, honestly! Very often I ask myself if I was successful in spite of certain things being awful. I don't know. But the only thing I can do is just keep going with what I think is good, basically. And then I wait for the player's input, of course. If a lot of players tell me that the confirm button is in an awkward place, I'm going to reconsider the positioning of that button. But until I get that feedback, I'm just going with my gut.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Something I noticed when I first started playing Vampire Crawlers is that, to a certain extent, it's slower and more strategic. Which is interesting when we live in a time when I feel like everybody has a very short attention span--everything is compulsive, everyone just wants to tap on something. Are you nervous working on something a bit slower paced?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">As always, I use myself as a judge. When I was talking to the team, I told them that I'm making the game basically for me. I told them, "You're making this game for me. I am player number one. I have to love this game. This is the concept I really want to see executed." I always use myself as a way to decide if the game is going in the right direction or not. So I'm sure that there are other people, like me, that love Vampire Survivors and will love this game.</p><p dir="ltr">I have no idea if it's going to be as many players. Probably not. I don't care, honestly. Because if I start thinking about that, if I start thinking about what are players expecting or what will the majority of the players want or need, I just end up doing something average. Something that tries to make everyone happy. I'd rather try to be original and take a <em>little</em> bit of risk. But as long as I'm confident that the game works for me, I know I can push that idea.</p><p dir="ltr">So I'm not worried about that. I know that some people will not like it, some people will like it, and some people will love it. Some people will absolutely hate it at first, and then maybe try it later and go, "Hmm, maybe it's not that bad." That happens very often with Vampire Survivors. It's very easy to underestimate it because of the visuals, right?</p><p dir="ltr">But there is a bit of compulsion with the "Play All" button. It's very interesting because, often in these kinds of games, you end up being overpowered. And if you're overpowered and you get into a fight with, I don't know, five bats, you know you're going to kill them immediately but you still have to play cards. It gets a bit boring, because you already know the outcome. To fix that, I decided to try and put in a "Play All" button. If you press it, the game will just try and play all your cards immediately.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of that, the game accelerates. So you get this rush from completing the fight immediately and then it just moves very quickly after that, which I personally absolutely love. I find myself mashing the "Play All" button even after the fight has clearly finished.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I genuinely appreciate that you center what you enjoy when making games. I feel like you can't make art when you're self-conscious or when you're overly concerned with what everybody else thinks. You're going to make something that's average, because you're considering the average.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">After the game is out, I'm definitely going to take into account player feedback in the community. Vampire Survivors is the perfect example of a game that got released in early access because I wanted player feedback. Back then, it was mostly a way to get in touch, somehow, with other fans of Castlevania, joke together, and say, "Yeah, I see this reference" or something like that. But then it became something more.</p><p dir="ltr">Then I started to plan the complete version of Vampire Survivors. I would use the community feedback and player feedback to choose what would be the next part of the roadmap to add to the game. I knew the steps, but not the order. So I would let the community dictate what would come next for the early-access version of Vampire Survivors. For this game, it's going to be very different though; this time I want to release a game that is whole to begin with.</p><p dir="ltr">That makes this game a bit riskier from the get-go, but the plan is already that, once we release it, we'll listen to player feedback. Once again, we'll use that to decide what should come next for this game--what features people want added or if they want to see DLC, for instance. If they want collaborations, or spin-offs of this game instead.</p><p dir="ltr">There are many conversations around player entitlement these days. My perspective is that, to an extent, players are entitled to certain things. They have invested money and time into this game and our studio. They directly contribute to my success and my livelihood. I think that entitles them to polish and responsiveness. I think that entitles players to a good game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607282-vc_screenshot_20.png" data-ref-id="1300-4607282" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607282-vc_screenshot_20.png" data-ref-id="1300-4607282"></a><figcaption>A look at deckbuilding in Vampire Crawlers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607282-vc_screenshot_20.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Deckbuilders are obviously a popular genre right now, but what inspired the decision to say, "Okay, we're doing a deckbuilder next" when there were so many options for this spin-off?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Honestly, it was not our first choice. We actually started off with a set of five different projects. We worked with several indie teams, experimenting a little bit, and what happened is simply that Vampire Crawlers was the game that immediately jumped out at us. From the initial prototype, the team just nailed it. It was great immediately. They immediately understood the idea, the concept, and so that's the one that progressed. It wasn't some kind of strategic decision; it's just the one that naturally, organically went faster than any other.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What were some of the other ideas?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Oh, they were literally all over the place. Definitely not a soccer game or something like that, but I'm a big fan of RPGs, so there were actually, a couple actually different RPGs in the works. If you play Vampire Survivors, you can find a lot of references to all sorts of other games. So if you think you've seen a reference of a particular game in Vampire Survivor, there's a pretty good chance that I'm working on a spin-off of the genre of that game.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I was wondering, because I think the first thing that I went to was like, "Oh, this would work so well as a metroidvania."</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Exactly, that's just a perfect fit. I mean, it just makes so much sense. It makes <em>too</em> much sense. It would almost have to be called Castlevania, right? If we were to do something like that--which I would love to do something like that, by the way--but if I were to do it, I would just go to Konami and ask for permission to use Castlevania at that stage. It just makes too much sense.</p><p dir="ltr">That or, honestly, if I were to do a metroidvania, I would probably do one with the Legacy of the Moonspell characters and setting. Or Tides of the Foscari. I would try to move a little bit away from Vampire Survivors.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Another feature that really sets Crawlers apart from Survivors is the inclusion of this sort of hub. Are there plans to expand that more? Are there any other features you're excited for people to see?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">There are games that give you a little customizable village, but that, for me, is one step too far. If the core of the game is playing cards, and I also add a little strategy to the village, then I really start branching a bit too much. The village will most likely stay how it [is] right now, which is just this circle of buildings. However, it being a circle means that, once in a while, we can make a new building pop between others. So it is still expandable and any feature we come up with over time, we'll be able to fit it in there.</p><p dir="ltr">The combat system is the core experience. Everything else is an accessory; it's an excuse to justify the combat system. So I'm really curious to see how far we can push it and what people want to see from this.</p><p dir="ltr">However, I think Crawlers has a lot of potential because, even though the point of this game is not exploration, the fact that there is this exploration opens up a lot of doors. I'm really curious to see what people will think of the exploration. Will they want more? Will they want less? Will they want bigger dungeons?</p><p dir="ltr">There are also, of course, endless menus of unlocks and new stuff to try. I think we're putting together all these modular elements so that the game eventually could expand just as much as Vampire Survivors. We do need limits to ship the first version, so early on we said, "Okay, let's bring over X amount of characters." And then, per usual, we doubled that amount. That's a very common theme at Poncle. We start with a very low goal because we know what we're going to do twice as much anyway.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How many characters did you end up bringing over?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I think we are going to end up with 20 or 21 characters. And every character has a different passive ability, a different trigger ability, and a different starting deck. The characters here are a lot more complex than in Vampire Survivors. When Vampire Survivors first launched, characters were merely a way for players to choose their starting weapon. They weren't even supposed to have different stats. But once the game got released, it was a bit too flat, so I added a few bonuses to different characters.</p><p dir="ltr">And then the game got so big that it felt like it was cheap to make a new character just to offer a new starting weapon. Now every character has to bring something different to the game. But with Crawlers, from the very beginning we established that every character has to be different and viable. So 21 characters, 21 different starting decks. It's quite a lot.</p><p dir="ltr">That's not to mention that in the final version you can actually bring up to three characters with you, allowing you to mix and match their triggers and abilities. You might only play just one card, but because of all the triggers you have enabled, that one card will do 10 different things.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607284-vc_screenshot_2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4607284" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607284-vc_screenshot_2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4607284"></a><figcaption>Exploration in Vampire Crawlers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607284-vc_screenshot_2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are there plans to bring Vampire Crawlers to mobile?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yeah, this game I wanted to release globally on all platforms on the same day. It's super ambitious, it's a lot of stress for everyone, but I feel like we owe it to the community that has been so patient with Vampire Survivors. They've been so helpful and understanding that I feel like we have to try to put this game into everyone's hands immediately. Again, very difficult, but let's see if we can manage to do it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you have a release date planned for the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I actually wanted to release it this year, but there was a problem. The game was not exactly what I wanted. Originally, there was not as much of the deckbuilding element. There wasn't a lot of depth. I realized that once people started playing it, they were saying that they couldn't wait to see what's next and how they could customize their deck. But there wasn't that much of that on the roadmap.</p><p dir="ltr">I realized that there were expectations. When you're playing a card game, well, by now it's a genre that's so well-established that people have a lot of expectations. They immediately expect to have a deckbuilding element that has a lot of depth. And so that's the element I decided needed to be revamped--that needed to deliver from the get-go. It's something that should be at the core of the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Adding that big feature pushed our release date to next year. I'm not 100% sure when. I'm trying to avoid the Grand Theft Auto VI window. Not because the game is competing with GTA VI, but because the whole world is going to compete against GTA VI.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The above interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p>

<section><p>With Vampire Crawlers, Poncle Games is expanding the world of Vampire Survivors while also exploring a new genre: deckbuilders.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In the years since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-survivors/" data-ref-id="5000-544864">Vampire Survivors</a> first hit PC, Poncle Games has been busy. In addition to releasing numerous updates to its debut title, the company has expanded, entered into publishing, and paired up with other studios--including Vampire Survivors' biggest inspiration, Konami--to create a slew of fun collaborations. It's been an eventful few years for the BAFTA award-winning team and its simple-yet-utterly-engrossing "bullet heaven." And based on my time spent with Poncle a few weeks ago, that's just scratching the surface.</p><p dir="ltr">For the past year, Poncle Games has been hard at work on its next game, Vampire Crawlers. The dungeon-crawling deckbuilder is a notable departure from the simplistic gameplay of Vampire Survivors, and yet, after spending around half an hour playing the game, it's abundantly clear that it shares much of the same DNA and the same penchant for chaotic fun. Although Crawlers is, at least initially, slower-paced and less compulsive than its predecessor, it makes up for this with increased depth and strategy, all while incorporating elements that make the game delightfully unruly.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Vampire Crawlers - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">My first taste of Vampire Crawlers began with a fun cutscene--the same one seen in the game's announcement trailer--in which Vampire Survivors is transformed into a 2.5D experience. It's an exciting way to kick things off and conveys an important message: Vampire Crawlers, at its core, largely feels like a new way of playing Survivors. Though Luca Galante, the creative director behind Vampire Crawlers, said the team ultimately did go through and update most of Survivors' original assets for Crawlers, much of the series' visual identity remains intact. A cynic might call this lazy, sure, but I'd argue it comes across more as respect for Survivors' initial vision, and it ultimately works within the context of Crawlers. Furthermore, Galante said this was a very intentional choice that placed the company's stability ahead of a need to "create new things on purpose."</p><p dir="ltr">"The idea was practical and technical. I thought, 'Let's use the exact same assets. Because if we change them, people are going to complain. If we change them, it is going to increase the cost of this project,'" Galante explained. "And I'm not an entrepreneur. I'm not a risk-taker. I don't want to end up having crazy budgets for games and putting the company at risk."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607290-ff%286%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4607290" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607290-ff%286%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4607290"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607290-ff%286%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Following the cutscene, you are immediately thrust into familiar terrain: the Mad Forest. Crawlers seems to retain Survivors' fantastic soundtrack, and certainly leans into its predecessor's visuals, albeit with a slight '90s JRPG spin. Gameplay, however, is an entirely different story. Rather than using a mouse, joystick, or finger to traverse, automatically attacking as you do so, Crawlers implements arrow keys to navigate its environments with a first-person perspective. A map is displayed in the bottom-right corner, detailing the layout of the dungeon floor as well as where enemies lurk. You then decide if you want to take on every enemy, raking up experience as you do, or beeline straight to the map's elite enemy. This adds a bit of strategy in itself, as you must weigh if certain battles are worth the potential damage you'll take. Is it worth pushing your luck with a swarm of bats when a monstrous mantis lurks ahead?</p><p dir="ltr">More strategic are the battles themselves. Upon encountering an enemy, the game seamlessly enters into a turn-based combat mode, in which you use cards--all of which have set mana values--to take down monsters. Each of Crawlers' 20 or so characters, all of which are pulled directly from Survivors, comes with their very own deck of cards, making your character selection more important than ever. Just like Survivors, Crawlers sees you first play as the whip-wielding Antonio Belpaese. Antonio comes equipped with cards like a zero-mana-cost Whip and a one-mana-cost Spinach: both items that will be familiar to Survivors players but have slightly different effects in Crawlers.</p><p dir="ltr">You gain bonuses based on playing your cards in ascending mana-cost order, though sometimes that's not the most advantageous move. For example, playing a one-mana-cost Spinach, which boosts your attacks by 20%, <em>before</em> executing several zero-mana-cost attacks, is often the way to go. Additionally, there is also a "Play All" button, which allows you to play all your cards simultaneously for a healthy dose of chaotic fun. Galante explained this was partially added as a way to quickly get through battles you know you're going to win, which I appreciated.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607289-ff%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4607289" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607289-ff%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4607289"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607289-ff%285%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As you level up, you'll get the opportunity to add new cards to your deck. Additionally, you can use gems found in treasure chests to upgrade cards; these upgrades can upgrade the damage the cards deal, reduce mana cost, and more. This adds another layer of decision-making, as you must weigh which card would be best to socket your newly found gem into. The seemingly final layer is that, later on in the game, you can bring up to three Survivors with you on an expedition, allowing you to mix together decks and their various playstyles.</p><p dir="ltr">After completing the Mad Forest dungeon, I was able to visit one of the game's more charming areas: the village. Presented as a circle of buildings you can cycle between, the village is essentially your base of operations. Though I wasn't able to check out all of what it offered, the most notable inclusion was the tavern, which serves as a more immersive way to select your character by wrangling away them from their designated drinking spot. Although the village was built with the intention of being expandable, Galante noted that it is not intended to act as a major component of the game. While the base-building sicko in me was a bit disheartened to hear that, the reasoning behind the decision makes sense.</p><p dir="ltr">"There are games that give you a little customizable village, but that, for me, is one step too far. If the core of the game is playing cards, and I also add a little strategy to the village, then I really start branching a bit too much," Galante explained. "The village will most likely stay how it [is] right now, which is just this circle of buildings. However, it being a circle means that, once in a while, we can make a new building pop between others. So it is still expandable and any feature we come up with over time, we'll be able to fit it in there."</p><p dir="ltr">It's hard to say if Crawlers will sink its fangs into me to the same degree that Survivors did, but it's worth admitting that I felt the same when I first started Survivors. Since then, I've racked up a frankly embarrassing amount of time in that game. Thirty minutes felt too short to form a strong opinion on Crawlers, but I enjoyed what I played and have faith (and perhaps a deep fear) that it will steal just as many hours away from me as Survivors did. Beyond that, I also feel that Crawlers has plenty of potential to grow in accordance with what Poncle's community ultimately wants. Studio head Luca Galante expressed an eagerness to expand the game, be it by leaning into exploration, adding more depth to the village, or increasing the options for card modifications. Vampire Crawlers is currently slated to release early next year, with the ultimate goal of avoiding any overlap with Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>

Curious fans were treated to a four-minute gameplay trailer showing off a titanic boss fight that, frankly, looks awesome.&nbsp;</p><p>The adventure draws inspiration from Arthurian legend (as in the lore of King Arthur) and centers on an otherworldly invasion of a modernized London. This invasion has fractured the world into distorted mirror realities, and it’s up to protagonist Gwendolyn to travel between two worlds, London and the mythical Avalon, to save her family, the city, and existence itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s trailer shows off an impressively flashy boss battle against Tyronoe, one of the eight sisters of Morgan le Fay. The video, which developer Eclipse Glow Games confirms is captured in-engine, shows how Gwendolyn will enlist the aid of legendary knights, of which there are 10 in total, to augment her abilities and turn the tide (pun intended) of battle. Today's trailer shows her tag-teaming with former rival Sir Lamorak.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGOsH1Gp8SE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGOsH1Gp8SE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Tides of Annihilation is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but it does not have a release window.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2025/11/20/new-gameplay-trailer-for-arthurian-action-game-tides-of]]></content:encoded>

<p>He begins discussing remakes by mentioning platform limitations of the past.&nbsp;</p><p>"We were confined by a lot of elements when we developed those games," Horii tells me. "So seeing this new generation of creators [<strong>Editor's Note: </strong>Horii is seated beside Reimagined producer Takeshi Ichikawa during this interview], reimagining and remaking these titles, it is an interesting sight to see.</p><p>"One of the key differences between video games and other entertainment platforms or media – you can always revisit those old mangas, old movies, but for video games, it's getting more difficult to play older games. So to actually offer an opportunity for players around the world to actually play the older titles in a new way in this modern day and age and on the current generation of consoles and platforms, I think it's a really great thing."&nbsp;</p><p><em>Game Informer </em>video editor Alex Van Aken, who accompanied me on this Reimagined trip, followed up with Horii to ask about his thoughts on game preservation. He says it's a difficult topic.&nbsp;</p><p>"In a lot of ways, it's really something that can't be helped in this day and age," Horii says. "Back then, kids had limited forms of entertainment, or limited accessibility to entertainment. So they would spend tens and hundreds of hours in video games, but nowadays, it's a little bit different. The way people or kids interact and engage with video games is very different from when they did way back then, a few decades ago, since it's not just video games; there are so many different types and forms of entertainment. It's really hard to have a video game take [a piece of that] pie. So yeah, it's a difficult topic."</p><hr><p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting for its release, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet to access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/20/dragon-quest-creator-yuji-horii-on-remakes-and-game-preservation]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Fresh gameplay for Tides of Annihilation was shown at tonight's Xbox Partner Preview, showcasing its Dual Frontline Battle System in a dazzling boss fight.
</p>
<p>
To recap, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-action-game-tides-of-annihilation-fuses-modern-day-london-with-arthurian-legend">Tides of Annihilation was first announced back in February</a> at the PlayStation State of Play. From Chinese studio Eclipse Glow Games, it fuses modern day London with Arthurian Legend with big, splashy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>-esque combat. Players take on the role of Gwendolyn in search of the Holy Grail, able to command spectral forms of the Knights of the Round Table.
</p>
<p>
It's these knights that form the Dual Frontline Battle System. As explained by lead game producer Kun Fu for <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/tides-of-annihilation-xbox-partner-preview/">Xbox Wire</a>, this system is "one of the key unique features where players will utilise different attacks of each knight in combat, as well as customise their configuration and abilities."
</p>

<p>
Further, the knights aren't just a tool for combat but more like sidekicks to assist in Gwendolyn's quest. As the producer explained: "We first showed off this system in our announcement trailer that enabled players to set up two sets of spectral knight summons (four knights total at a time). Different knights can be summoned to enhance Gwendolyn's abilities and will be especially useful in executing combination chain attacks. Players can freely swap knights in the midst of battle - even mid-combo - to extend chains or adjust your tactics (e.g., time-stop, defensive shield, etc.).
</p><p>
"In this new trailer, the knight Sir Lamorak lends his power to Gwendolyn enabling the player to control both Gwendolyn and Lamorak simultaneously to fight inside and outside the mirror Folded Realm. The ability to summon, command and control spectral knights with the Dual Frontline Battle system is all about giving players the freedom to shape their own combat style."
</p>
<p>
This was all shown off in a new boss fight against Tyronoe, who transforms into a bird beast and creates a mirrored alternate dimension. Sir Lamorak assists from this other dimension and eventually is absorbed by Gwendolyn, ready to be summoned in battle. It's very, very extra.
</p>
<p>
The visual spectacle is particularly impressive, with Kun Fu stating the team has been inspired by iconic action scenes from films like Inception, The Matrix, and Dr. Strange. "Like those memorable movie scenes leading to a big confrontation, we wanted players to feel that same euphoria - a combination of excitement and dread - in the boss fights of Tides of Annihilation," the producer said.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet, but Tides of Annihilation is set for release on Xbox Series X/S, PC (Xbox, Epic, Steam), and PlayStation 5.
</p>
<p>
It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">one of many action games coming from China</a>, following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.

		<p>What next for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> developer Poncle? Well, more Vampire Survivors, kind of. Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard is a first person dungeon crawler with a streak of playing tons and tons of cards from your hand.</p>
<p>The game is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and it’ll be a day one game into Game Pass. It’s expected for release in 2026, but poncle just say it’ll be along when it’s good and ready.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire Crawlers coming day one with Xbox Game Pass in 2026 | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-b6dkZH6XSo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Speaking on Xbox Wire, Poncle founder Luca said, “This is just a spin-off of Vampire Survivors – hopefully the first in a series of spin-offs! The idea is to take some of the core pillars behind the development of VS and to apply them to existing genres. I’m talking about accessibility, immediacy, affordability, replayability, and sparkly stuff. Tons of sparkly stuff! With regards to a sequel to Vampire Survivors, we’re working on something, but we’re not talking about that just yet.”</p>

		<p>IO Interactive shared a little glimpse of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> during the Xbox Partner Preview stream today, showing off about the car in the game… the Aston Martin Valhalla.</p>
<p><iframe title="007 First Light - Aston Martin Valhalla Reveal | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0wLsLm8OlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Valhalla is stuffed with F1 technology and really slots into the supercar category in a way that probably feels a bit excessive for a spy, even of Bond’s stature. You’ll have to earn the number first, though.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s all a little bit of a let down when thinking this would be a bigger gameplay reveal.</p>
<p>007: First Light is coming out on 27th March 2026&nbsp;across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC. The game is an Xbox Play Anywhere title, meaning you can buy it once and play across both Xbox and PC through the Microsoft Store.</p>

<p>The game is IOI’s first outside the Hitman series for quite a while, and as a licensed IP of this scale, it’s a pretty big deal for the studio. The story sees James Bond as a relative newcomer to MI6, working as part of a team as they race to catch and foil the plans of 009, who’s gone just a little bit rogue.</p>
<p>Last time out we saw a mission to intercept 009 at a chess tournament, showcasing the game’s evolved stealth action gameplay, before leading into a high speed car chase and then deadly combat as Bond chases his target to a fleeing cargo plane. Would you believe that the plane doesn’t have a smooth take off and landing?</p>
<p>We had an early preview of the gameplay reveal back at Gamescom and had the opportunity to speak with Franchise Art Director Rasmus Poulsen. Here’s a little tidbit, as we discuss Bond’s visits to Q Lab and whether they’re more Desmond Llewelyn or Ben Wishaw. “We have quite a bit of humour everywhere, but it’s important to mention that it is, first and foremost, a reasonably dry British wit, because otherwise it doesn’t feel quite like it belongs. And, you know, you’ll get to a Q lab and you’ll get to understand how that relationship was formed in that surprising way, I would say, so look forward to that!”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/007-first-light-preview-how-io-are-crafting-a-new-kind-of-bond-game/">Head here for our wider 007: First Light preview</a>, with insights on how they settled on James Bond’s look, brought cars, vehicles and high speed chases in alongside action set pieces and, of course, the more open stealth action style inherited from the Hitman franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Mintrocket’s diving and sushi bar running sensation, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dave-the-diver">Dave The Diver,</a> is out now for Xbox Series X|S, arriving as an Xbox Play Anywhere title that also nets you the game on PC via Microsoft and Xbox Cloud. This means you can play it on the Xbox ROG Ally X and Xbox Series after buying it once, which is nice.</p>
<p>Then, coming in early 2026, is a new expansion for the game that will take Dave over to the jungle. It’s quite simply called Into The Jungle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dave the Diver - Launch Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PFbcVdZRKwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s been a couple years now since Dave the Diver arrived on PC. It was honoured with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/27/game-of-the-year-2023-best-pc-game-steam-deck/">Best PC Game award in our 2023 Game of the Year awards</a>, with Dom saying, <em>“With Dave the Diver you should prepare to be constantly surprised. On the surface, this is a game about diving with a portly man called Dave. You know he’s out of shape because everyone comments on it within the opening moments of the game, but it soon becomes clear that this is a man, and a game, with hidden depths.”</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-stunning-boss-fight-gameplay-showing-off-mirror-realm/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tides-of-annihilation-gets-new-stunning-boss-fight-gameplay-showing-off-the-game%E2%80%99s-mirror-realm.1359823/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After nearly a year of silence, Chinese developer Eclipse Glow Games has resurfaced during today's Xbox Partner Preview to showcase new gameplay of its upcoming action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tides of Annihilation</a>.</p>



<p>The trailer features the main character, Gwendolyn, fighting against a boss called Tyronoe the Ferryman, described as a powerful, shapeshifting witch. Gwendolyn is assisted by Sir Lamorak, a Knight of the Roundtable who wields a spear in combat. </p>



<p>Throughout Tides of Annihilation, Gwendolyn, the lone survivor of a cataclysmic 'Outworld invasion' of modern-day London, embarks on a high-stakes journey across two worlds: the devastated, fog-shrouded modern metropolis and the mythical realm of Avalon. Her goal is to save humanity and rescue her sister. As part of the journey, she'll encounter different stories and conflicts behind the Knights of the Roundtable and the evils behind this otherworldly invasion. In this mission, she's set to uncover the truth behind Sir Lamorak, whose suffering is caused by the witch Tyronoe. </p>



<p>One of the game's key unique features is the Knights System, which allows Gwendolyn to summon and command spectral Knights of the Roundtable during battles. The new footage reveals part of this system for the first time: the Dual Frontline Battle System, which lets the player control both Gwendolyn and Lamorak simultaneously, enabling them to attack Tyronoe and break down her magical barriers.</p>



<p>The boss fight against the witch also shows the Mirror Realm for the first time. The Folded Realm is a mysterious story element in Tides of Annihilation and Gwendolyn will encounter different types of<br>these otherworldly realms throughout the game. Tyronoe is among the few characters capable of traveling between the human world and the Mirror Folded Realm she creates, and can make use of powerful magic energies from this Mirror Realm.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As exciting as this new gameplay is, the press release does not include a release window for the game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When we spoke to the development team during Gamescom 2024</a>, they mentioned a tentative 2026 goal, but it was far from assured. Anyway, the game will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and today, Eclipse Glow Games also confirmed that it will support Xbox Play Anywhere, enabling cross-buy and cross-progression across PC and Xbox.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-off-trio-of-upcoming-action-games-running-at-up-to-500-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Tides of Annihilation will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation on PC to accelerate frame rate for GeForce RTX 50 Series owners.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/godfall-developer-counterplay-games-debuts-new-title-armatus-at-xbox-partner-preview.1359820/</guid>

			<p>Counterplay Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/godfall-ultimate-edition-pc-five-realms-worth-of-content/">the studio behind Godfall</a>, which you might recall was the first game confirmed to be launching on current-gen consoles before the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S were even on shelves, has just debuted its new title, Armatus, which kicked off the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox Partner Preview event today</a>. </p>



<p>Armatus looks like another dive down third-person action for Counterplay Games, but with an entirely different tone and vibe compared to what we saw in Godfall. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/armatus-xbox-partner-preview/">In an Xbox Wire post,</a> senior writer at Counterplay Games, Matt Cerami, describes the coming title as "<em>a product of our heart, soul, and fire-forged camaraderie; we've poured everything into this project, have harbored it through (seemingly) insurmountable challenges, and are thrilled to finally share it with the world</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ARMATUS - Reveal Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6q28rgDKA3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Armatus is set in a dystopian Paris, where reality is a mess and different planes of existence are colliding with each other. You are summoned by the four remaining members of the Armatus, an ancient religious order that was forsaken by God, and charged with being their champion to fight their battles on their path to heaven.</p>



<p>It's all an interesting concept and visually intriguing design for the game, the question, of course, is whether Counterplay Games will be able to deliver on the combat and the game's story. We'll see how it fares as we get closer to its launch, which is currently set for some time in 2026.</p>

Take the shot!</p> <p>On November 20, during Xbox’s Partner Preview showcase, IO Interactive announced that <a href="https://kotaku.com/todays-games-are-too-complicated-for-eminem-5416286">rapper Eminem</a> would be the next elusive target coming to <em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em> in a free update arriving next month on all platforms.</p> <p>Here’s the strange trailer, which shows <a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-games-grand-theft-auto-movie-eminem-gta-6-1849787466">Eminem</a> teaming up with Agent 47 to take out his alter ego, Slim Shady, who is hanging out in a strange medical facility in Japan.</p>  <p>You can read more about this odd event in<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/hitman-xbox-partner-preview/"> Xbox’s blog post about it</a>. You’ll have a limited time to take out Shady as the update goes live on December 1 and ends on December 31. Ring in the new year by headshotting Eminem’s past persona as a cloned super killer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now that we’re in the thick of the holiday season, there is much gift shopping to be done. While it makes sense to hold out until Black Friday and Cyber Monday to see what sorts of deals all the major retailers are showcasing, you can actually get ahead of things and find some excellent savings opportunities right now. Perhaps it’s time to help your parents finally update their home Wi-Fi. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5757/">Amazon has its Eero 7 dual-band mesh Wi-Fi routers on sale right now for about 20% off.</a> For a limited time, you can save $35 on the one router which brings the price down from $170 to just $135.</p>
<p>Now the real value of a mesh Wi-Fi router can be attained with only one of them. You want to create a mesh Wi-Fi network by having multiple units working together. Luckily, Amazon has the Eero 7 dual-band mesh Wi-Fi routers available in bundles of two and three. The 2-pack normally goes for $280, but has been discounted down to $220 — saving you $60. then we have the 3-pack which is usually sitting at $350 now going for just $280 — saving you $70. So at its best value, you can secure yourself three of these mesh Wi-Fi routers for as little as $93 per router.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5757/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Total Coverage of Your Home</h2>
<p data-start="0" data-end="655">Unreliable internet can be one of the most annoying things to deal with at home. Few things are more frustrating than web pages that won’t load or devices constantly dropping their connection. A Wi-Fi 7 mesh system can make a huge difference. The Eero 7 mesh network is designed to deliver stable, high-speed coverage throughout your home. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5757/">Each Eero 7 node can cover up to 2,000 square feet and handle more than 120 connected devices.</a> With a three-pack, you can blanket up to 6,000 square feet and connect over 360 devices at once. And if your home needs even more range, you can easily expand your network later by adding additional nodes.</p>


<p data-start="657" data-end="1188">Between the three router units, you’ll get six Ethernet ports in total, giving you plenty of wired connection options. The Eero 7 can deliver speeds of up to 2.5Gbps (that’s 2,500Mbps), so streaming 4K video from anywhere in your house is no problem. Even cloud gaming becomes smooth and consistent, especially with the growing number of devices that support the Xbox app, such as Fire TV sticks and Samsung smart TVs. You can play games with minimal lag — even without owning a console — thanks to the strong, fast Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<p data-start="1190" data-end="1393" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Setup is also a breeze. The Eero app walks you through every step, making it quick and easy to get your mesh network running smoothly so you can finally say goodbye to dead zones and dropped connections.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surprise-vampire-survivors-sequel-turns-it-into-an-awesome-looking-dungeon-crawler.1359802/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, during Xbox’s latest digital showcase event, Poncle announced <em>Vampire Crawlers</em>, a <em>Vampire Survivors</em> follow-up coming to Xbox and PC in 2026. But instead of being a top-down idle shooter or “reverse bullet hell” game like <a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-roguelike-vampire-survivors-steam-itch-io-1848402308">2021’s <em>Vampire Survivors,</em></a> this newly revealed game is a dungeon crawler with roguelike elements and cards.</p> <p>On November 20, during Xbox’s Partner Preview event, Poncle revealed the first look at<em> Vampire Crawlers.</em>&nbsp;Here’s the trailer, which is filled with a lot of the same enemies, jokes, and chaos you’d expect from <em>Vampire Survivors.&nbsp;</em></p>

  <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-xbox-partner-preview/">In an Xbox interview with Poncle founder &amp; CEO Luca,</a> the creator behind <em>Vampire Survivors</em> explains that they have been working on this sequel/spin-off for roughly four years, starting work on it shortly after the OG game exploded on Steam. It is one of many possible spin-offs and experiments the team is working on. This just happened to be the first one to “hit its goal,” hence why it’s getting released first in 2026.</p>

 <p>When asked what kind of game <em>Vampire Crawlers</em> is, Luca joked that it’s a totally new genre called “Action TurboTurn™ Game (Turbo Turn System).”</p> <p>“Jokes aside, this game is just a dungeon crawler you play with cards,” admitted Luca. “It’s about mowing down hordes of enemies using cards, while you explore dungeons, playing as slowly or as fast as you prefer. You can take your time and be tactical, or play cards as fast as you humanly can, because the game is built to always provide accurate logical outcomes, regardless of the visual chaos that your abilities might cause.”</p>

 <p>Interestingly, Luca tells Xbox that <em>Vampire Crawlers</em> will launch as a full game, and not in early access, though Poncle does have plans to update it after launch if players like <em>Crawlers</em> and want more content and features.</p> <p>“Just like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, we’ve built the game so that it could eventually be expanded,” said Luca. “We’ll leave it to the community to tell us if they want even more, and what they actually want from it going forward.”</p> <p><em>Vampire Crawlers</em> launches sometime in 2026 on Xbox, Game Pass, and PC. It will be available day one on Game Pass and will support Xbox Play Anywhere.</p>
