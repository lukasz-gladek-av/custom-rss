<p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkl5T0pMFb4">interview</a> in which Cockle tries to remember his most iconic lines, the voice of Geralt of Rivia confirmed that Geralt will be "part of the [next] game", but the storyline will "not be about him this time".</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will host another Marvel-focused season, this time centering on Doctor Doom, accompanied by yet more superhero faces for Epic Games' evergreen battle royale.
</p>
<p>
Details of Fortnite's next season, named Fortnite x Marvel: Absolute Doom, were announced this morning during Disney's D23 fan event, and livestreamed in Fortnite itself. 
</p>
<p>
Marvel boss Kevin Feige was joined on stage by Star Wars legend Dave Filoni and Pixar head honcho Pete Doctor, who additionally detailed a treasure trove of Disney franchises also set to get crossovers in Fortnite over the coming months, as Epic Games' integration with the Mouse House deepens.

<p>
Fortnite x Marvel: Absolute Doom will kick off this Friday, 16th August, and include Marvel heroes Gwenpool, War Machine, Emma Frost, Mysterio, Shuri and Doctor Doom in its battle pass. Two Fortnite favourites with new Marvel looks are also included: Captain Jonesy, who wears a version of Cap's suit and wields his shield, plus Peelverine, the latest version of Fortnite's favourite banana, now dressed as Logan.
</p>
<p>
A trailer for the new season also featured a furrier look for Fortnite's much-loved muscley cat Meowscles, apparently inspired by Marvel's Sabretooth, while fans at the event report being told that a Fishstick variant of Deadpool, named Fishpool, is also being worked on. Meanwhile, an Epic blog post states the Fantastic Four are also set to be added. All of these skins will likely be sold separately to the battle pass - either via the game's Item Shop or Crew subscription.

The past 24 hours have been busy for Fortnite, which is currently wrapping up its Mad Max-inspired wasteland season. In a mini live event held in-game last night, around a million players were in-game as this season's villain Megalo Don got his comeuppance, when his pipeline of powerful Nitro fuel detonated in spectacular style. The suggestion was that Doctor Doom interfered to cause the explosion, while the aftermath also saw the return of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-begins-teasing-ancient-greek-season">Pandora's Box</a>, a menacing threat that has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-latest-live-event-kicks-off-countdown-to-mad-max-esque-new-season">plagued Fortnite's battle royale Island through the course of its current Chapter 5 storyline</a>.

<p>
More pertinent to all of the announcements last night, perhaps, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">Epic Games' real-life $1.5bn deal with Disney to integrate its Fortnite metaverse with the entertainment powerhouse</a>. I can't remember the last time Disney wheeled out such a senior trio of execs to announce more skins for a video game, but such is the importance - and oppurtunity - of Fortnite as a part of popular culture.
</p>
<p>Leaks suggest next season will add a permanent and separate Disney store to Fortnite, alongside its Item Shop, as a way to sell and track your purchased vault of Disney content. This, perhaps, may also be used to mark compatibility with a future Fortnite Disney mode.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>RUMOR: FIRST LOOK AT AN UPCOMING DISNEY ITEM SHOP 🔥</p><p>This image was sent to <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HYPEX</a> &amp; me earlier today.

<p>
As well as adding the many Marvel heroes above, Fortnite will swell its character roster to include IG-88 and Moff Gideon from Star Wars hit show The Mandalorian, as well as a new Grogu back bling, as soon as next week. 
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's first Pixar crossover is also on the way, appropriately with the animation studio's own superheroes, as Frozone, Mr Incredible and Elasticgirl from The Incredibles become available this autumn. Finally, classic Disney villains such as Cruella de Vil, Hook and Maleficient will also be available in the autumn.
</p>
<p>
The announcement of a Fortnite season focusing on Doctor Doom is well-timed with Marvel Studios' own announcement it will pivot to focusing on the character, played by Robert Downey Jr., in the next Avengers film. It's unclear how - if at all - this season will tie into that, or acknowledge <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-marvel-season-is-live-with-iron-man-and-dr-doom-playable">Doctor Doom was already part of Fortnite's storyline several years back</a>, when its first dedicated Marvel season ran. That season featured Thor, She-Hulk, Groot, Storm, Dr. Doom, Mystique, Iron Man and Wolverine, characters Epic Games has clearly steered away from repeating with new skins here, and memorably ended in a spectacular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-showstopping-marvel-finale-drops-a-huge-cliffhanger">major live event where the Marvel heroes teamed up to take down Galactus</a> - something that will take some beating.

<p>Fortnite has released a new trailer for their upcoming Absolute Doom season. Chapter 5, Season 4 starts on August 16 and will bring beloved Marvel characters back to the island.</p>

<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-s-narrative">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4’s Narrative</h2>



<p>The new Fortnite trailer features the season’s highlight, Dr. Doom, who seems to be up to no good. We see Jonesy wearing Captain America’s outfit, swinging around his shield to take down enemies. </p>



<p>The trailer showcases the upcoming season’s overarching plot, with Dr. Doom seemingly rescuing Mysterio from a maximum-security prison. The iron-fisted doctor has also erected a full-fledged castle in the middle of the island, which will probably be a new POI in the upcoming season.</p>



<p>To take Dr. Doom’s evil forces down, Jonesy and the other Fortnite characters join hands with the X-Men, as we see Cyclops, Colossus, Jubilee, and others join the fray. Players also glimpse Peely Wolverine (Peelverine) as he reenacts Logan’s iconic escape from the Weapon X facility.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-new-gameplay-features">New Gameplay Features</h2>



<p>Halfway through the trailer, we received a gameplay showcase, revealing all the new toys players can play with in the upcoming Fortnite season. First up was Captain America’s Shield, which players can swing to take down multiple enemies at a time or use to ram into other players and their builds. Next, we got to see Black Panther’s Claws, which seem to be a new melee weapon, perfect for close-ranged combat.</p>



<p>Then, Gwenpool shows up, wearing parts of Tony Stark’s Iron Suit, allowing her to zoom through the map and use the Unibeam to unleash devastating attacks. We also saw War Machine in action; his suit seems like an absolute tank. Last but not least was Dr. Doom, who unleashed a beam of devastating energy at other Marvel characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-battle-pass-details">Battle Pass Details </h2>



<p>Fortnite has revealed in the trailer description that players will receive new items such as Dual Micro SMGs, Captain America’s Shield, or War Machine’s Arsenal in the Absolute Doom Season. Also, next season’s Battle Pass will cost 950 V-Bucks and feature rewards such as Gwenpool, War MachinePeelverine, Emma Frost, Captain Jonesy, Mysterio, and Shuri. Fortnite will also feature Dr Doom’s skin through Battle Pass quests in September.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-future-battle-pass-items-may-no-longer-remain-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest announcement</a>, Fortnite’s battle pass items will no longer be exclusive.

<p>Recently, clips started surfacing online of content creators playing what <strong>looks like </strong>Modern Warfare 2 Remastered’s multiplayer offering – which never surfaced. It’s actually a full-fledged multiplayer mod for MW Remastered, which was released almost ten years ago. It’s called the H2M Mod, and it has been in development for quite a while.</p>



<p>At first blush, it’s the most faithful recreation of 2009’s Modern Warfare 2 that I’ve ever seen.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-me-back">Take Me Back</h2>



<p>For many Call of Duty fans, Modern Warfare 2 represents the pinnacle of the series. It boasted a flawless multiplayer platform that we still remember today, and it was a perfect expansion to the story mode that was kicked off in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. In 2016, Activision released Modern Warfare Remastered, which completely overhauled the original game, and in 2020, MW2’s <strong>campaign </strong>was remastered.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://h2m-mod.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a team of talented modders</a> has pulled Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer platform into 2016’s Modern Warfare Remastered. H2M features the full suite of maps, modes, weapons, and everything you fondly remember from the 2009 title, right down to elements of the UI and the sound palette.</p>



<p>It looks utterly phenomenal:</p>



<figure><figcaption> </figcaption></figure>



<p>Typically, Activision Blizzard comes down hard on these fan-made creations, issuing cease and desist notices or ordering that they be taken offline, but this <strong>shouldn’t </strong>be the case this time. To play H2M, you’ll need to own a copy of Modern Warfare Remastered on Steam (as it’s a PC-only mod), and the team behind the project has stressed they’re not accepting payments for the creation.</p>



<p>It’s truly the next generation of Modern Warfare 2. With redesigned levelling systems, menus, and an overhaul to the killstreak system, players can enjoy the game they know and love from fifteen years ago with a much more modern, up-to-date feel. When H2M is released on August 16, it’ll come with 50 maps, some of which are single-player missions converted into playable multiplayer maps.</p>



<p>It’s insane.</p>

The latest crossover starts next week with Mandalorian characters like Grogu set to show up on August 12. Then, Fortnite’s next season will usher in the age of Doctor Doom with Chapter 5 Season 4: Absolute Doom, bringing more Marvel-themed skins and items for players to toy with on August 16. You can see <a href="https://x.com/MarvelGames/status/1822489174240542897" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a trailer</a> for Absolute Doom below.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light">— Marvel Games (@MarvelGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelGames/status/1822489174240542897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Doctor Doom is the latest Marvel centerpiece to worm its way into Fortnite, but Victor Von Doom isn't the only superpowered character to show up in the trailer. X-Men like Cable, Cyclops, Rogue, Jubilee, and Colossus have cameos, too, as does Spider-Man villain Mysterio. Some cosmetics and weapons based on characters like Sabretooth, Captain America, Iron Man, and Black Panther can also be seen in the footage, making it clear that Marvel's relationship with Fortnite still has a lot of life left in it.</p><p>Disney took the opportunity at its latest D23 showcase to prove that it's all in on Fortnite in more ways than one. This fall, Fortnite fans can look forward to appearances from a selection of iconic Disney villains like Maleficent, Cruella de Vil, and Captain Hook. Pixar characters are on the way, too. Specifically, Disney’s superhero family, the Incredibles, will show up in-game, with players able to enjoy content based on heroes like Mr. and Mrs. Incredible and Frozone.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>These announcements follow the news that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-buys-15-billion-stake-in-epic-games-to-create-expansive-universe-within-fortnite">Disney aquired a $1.5 billion stake in Fortnite developer Epic Games</a> in March. At the time, the company stated a desire to bolster its relationship with the studio and make a more significant investment in the games space in general. A laundry list of Fortnite character additions is surely only the beginning of what the partnership will bring. While we wait to see how the two companies will grow together, be sure to read up on some of the other announcements from tonight's Disney Experiences Showcase, which include new attractions based on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-land-at-disneylands-disney-california-adventure-gets-new-attraction-concept-art-and-details-d23-2024">Avatar</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-downey-jr-to-become-tony-stark-again-for-a-new-disneyland-attraction-in-avengers-campus-d23-2024">The Avengers</a>.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p>We were promised some major <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> reveals at Disney's D23 event on Saturday--what else would warrant a livestream inside the game itself?--and major reveals is exactly what we got. The biggest was that Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4, which begins August 16, will be a new Marvel-focused season, dubbed Absolute Doom--with a battle pass filled with Marvel skins, such as a new Peely called Peelverine.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbTbvbZltW8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tbTbvbZltW8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>What we have here in this trailer is the full battle pass reveal, plus looks at some of the new gameplay goodies we're going to get to play with. The battle pass lineup will consist of Gwenpool (the instant unlock), War Machine, Emma Frost, Shuri, Mysterio, Peelverine and Captain Jonesy as the skins you'll unlock by leveling up, and Doctor Doom will be the mid-season unlock, a la Magneto this season.</p><p>We also got a glimpse at the new Marvel powers, which appear to include Shuri's claws, War Machine's weapon rig, Iron Man's energy blasts and flight, Captain America's Shield, and Doctor Doom's gauntlets. It's notable that we saw nothing at all of the Fantastic Four during this.</p><p>That's huge, of course, but the D23 presentation also included some other shockers--they had assembled the creative heads of Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel Studios. While each of them described these collaborations as extensions of their franchise storytelling, these announcements were all about new skins.</p><p>First revealed were several skins based on classic Disney animated villains--Cruella DeVille, Captain Hook, and Maleficent were shown, with the promise of a fall release, which could indicate they'll be part of Fortnitemares in October. Adding to that animated fun is the news that Fortnite will be receiving its first Pixar skins in the form of a collab with The Incredibles.</p><p>And while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ends-exclusivity-for-future-battle-passes/1100-6525606/" data-ref-id="1100-6525606">the change to battle pass exclusivity</a> won't help you get the old Mandalorian skin and Grogu back bling, on August 12, skins for IG-11 and Moff Gideon will be added to the item shop and there will also be a new Grogu back bling available for those who missed the previous one.</p>

The app is also available for iOS and iPadOS, where it’s a virtually identical experience, minus the 3D effect.</p><p>The first games I played after downloading VirtualFriend were those I owned as a kid: <em>Red Alarm, Wario Land</em>, and <em>Mario’s Tennis. </em>I’m pleased to say that apart from some minor audio glitches in <em>Red Alarm</em>, the games run well — it’s all just as I remember it. </p><div><figcaption><em>The preset “Game Boy” color scheme might be my favorite.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF: VirtualFriend</cite></p></div><p>VirtualFriend supports Bluetooth controllers and keyboard control on the Vision Pro, as well as touchscreen buttons if you’re playing on an iPhone or iPad. Visually, the games look as good as a Virtual Boy game can and have a little help from the app, which lets you customize the console’s two-tone color palette. VirtualFriend also has an eye adjustment slider that helps adjust the image if you find a particular game isn’t working for you. </p><p>The big missing features are controller mapping and the ability to save your game at any point using save states. (Developer Adam Gastineau acknowledged the latter in an <a href="https://github.com/agg23/virtualfriend/issues/7">open issue on the project’s GitHub page</a>.) </p><p>Still, VirtualFriend is easy to recommend if you’re at all curious about playing Virtual Boy games or, like me, you once owned and loved the console. It’s free with the option to tip the developer, doesn’t show ads, and according to its App Store listing, won’t collect your data. It’s just good, clean, mid-90s VR fun.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Popular esports team, Gen.G, who had been competing in Valorant Champions 2024, is officially out of the competition following a major loss against Sentinels early this afternoon (August 10, 2024).</p>



<p>While things had been going strong for the team since the beginning of the event (which began on August 1), it would seem like their run has finally come to an end.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-gen-g-out-of-valorant-champions-2024-after-loss-to-sentinels">Gen.G Out Of Valorant Champions 2024 After Loss To Sentinels</h2>



<p>Following their loss against Sentinels, Gen.G will officially be going home. The esports team had recently swept Sentinels during their Group Stage matches back on August 1, but it seems like Sentinels had prepared themselves for today’s matches.</p>



<p>Gen.G had lost 2-1 back on August 6 against Team Heretics, but their loss then was not enough to let them fall out of the event. Now, after their matches today against Sentinels, Gen.G will officially be going home.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h4 id="h-sentinels-vs-gen-g-score">Sentinels Vs. Gen.G Score:</h4>



<ul>
<li>2-0</li>
</ul>



<p>It would seem like Sentinels weren’t going to go down without a fight, as the team swept Gen.G, just like Gen.G had to them before. The first match took place on the Lotus map, where Sentinels won 13-9. The second match took place on the Icebox map, where Sentinels won 13-6.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-sentinels-move-on-to-playoffs">Sentinels Move On To Playoffs</h2>



<p>Sentinels have officially moved on to Playoffs following their win against Gen.G. While the official Playoffs schedule has not been released, as all matches are currently <strong>to be decided</strong>, we do know that games begin on August 16.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Today’s matches were Sentinels’ first win in the entire series. It will be interesting to see how they follow up on today’s victory and whether or not they will continue with their momentum.</p>



<p>Make sure to keep updated on the action by viewing the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-champions-2024-event-prizing-schedule-and-format/">Valorant Champions 2024 schedule</a>.</p>

            <p>It looks like PlayStation is introducing user reviews on the PS Store.</p>
<p>In a thread entitled "When did PlayStation start allowing written reviews?", an eagle-eyed PS5 owner noted on the PlayStation subreddit that the company was inviting user reviews for a select number of games.</p>
<p>Whilst fans have long been able to rate games from zero to five stars out of five, this is the first time players have been invited to leave a written review.</p>

<p>According to some respondents, PlayStation.com is emailing players and inviting them to share their thoughts on a handful of games, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Resident Evil 4, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="569"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1encjdy/when_did_playstation_start_allowing_written/">When did PlayStation start allowing written reviews? Seems to only be allowed for few games on their store pages for now.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cusman78/">u/cusman78</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/">playstation</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>As some commenters opine, the success of user reviews does vary, with many pointing out how useful Valve's listing of how many hours a player has played thus far, and also how much they'd played at the time they left a review.</p>
<p>Right now, the feature seems to be limited to a handful of games, you have to have a digital version of the game to participate, and reviews can only be submitted via the PlayStation.com site, too; as some players point out, this isn't necessarily a bad thing given it may be quite laborious to have to write out a full review using nowt but a controller.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-valve-is-introducing-a-new-review-system-to-filter-out-unhelpful-reviews">Valve also recently revealed it was shaking up reviews</a> by introducing a new filter system to help players sift out user reviews not deemed "helpful".</p>
<p>As spotted by a member of the Steam subreddit, Valve appears to have briefly activated a "helpfulness system" that essentially hid joke or silly reviews from view.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fallout: London continues to trend nicely in the post-apocalyptic gaming space, with thousands of users still exploring the game-sized mod that took years to develop. It was released a few weeks ago now, and following a period of instability, ‘Team FOLON’ has released a major patch to help fix some of the most troubling issues.</p>



<p>It’s a fair update that touches on the most common problems players have been experiencing, but it also offered a few adjustments to address inconsistencies in the overall British vibe of the mod.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-increasing-accuracy">Increasing Accuracy</h2>



<p>Fallout: London is a decent enough mod, but I couldn’t fall in love with it and didn’t have any kind of a spark when playing, so I only made it an hour or two before switching off. It’s not bad, it’s just not for me. The city of London is enormous and relatively faithfully recreated, but that’s not enough to warrant me pouring hours into it to complete everything on offer.</p>



<p>In the most recent update for the super-sized mod, Team FOLON introduced dozens of important changes and quality-of-life improvements. The squad also patched up some British inconsistencies, particularly those focused on terminology.</p>



<p>For instance:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lady<strong>bug </strong>has been renamed to Lady<strong>bird</strong></li>



<li>‘Cash Register’ has been renamed to ‘Till’</li>



<li>‘Wrenches’ have been renamed to ‘Spanner’</li>
</ul>



<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HF41oJi9ilzGjSWwo7nEz6tK0cOPXZLlGQm6mqcd1ao/edit">the full patch </a><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HF41oJi9ilzGjSWwo7nEz6tK0cOPXZLlGQm6mqcd1ao/edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">n</a><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HF41oJi9ilzGjSWwo7nEz6tK0cOPXZLlGQm6mqcd1ao/edit">otes</a> represent the breadth of changes made as part of the 1.01 update. It has brought about countless changes to quests and some minor bugs have also been addressed, such as the bizarre issue that saw Churchill, a burly bulldog, transform into Fallout 4’s Dogmeat when dismissed and recruited again by the player.</p>



<p>Have you played Fallout: London?</p>

            <p>Brace yourself, Call of Duty fans - it seems the cinematics from Black Ops 6's single-player campaign have leaked online.</p>
<p>Just like last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-images-leak-online-including-multiplayer-maps-and-menu-screens">when multiplayer images leaked</a>, the video was hit with copyright claims from Activision within hours, intimating that it's authentic.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-campaign-leaked/">InsiderGaming</a>, the cutscenes - which did not have audible sound - were "extracted from the beta build of Black Ops 6", after some players managed to access the beta ahead of its formal release via jailbroken PS4 consoles.</p>
<p>According to some familiar with the leaks, only cinematics have leaked - in-game rendered cutscenes have seemingly been spared for now.</p>

<p>If you’re an avid Escape From Tarkov fan, then this question starts to lurk around inside your head once every so often: ‘When is the next Tarkov wipe?’ It’s a monumental event – that game-wide refresh that rests everyone back to level pegging in an instant, and it often brings white-hot content updates pouring into the game.</p>



<p>When is the next Escape From Tarkov wipe, and what is it going to look like?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-wipe-in-tarkov">What Is a Wipe In Tarkov?</h2>



<p>When Escape From Tarkov ‘wipes’, every player is reset to level one, and their entire ‘stash’ – which is their collection weapons, equipment, money, and so on – is completely pushed back to the state it was when they first purchased the game. From there, players must once again climb the ladder, build their empire, complete early-game tasks, and rebuild their in-game hideout.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-is-escape-from-tarkov-single-player"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-escape-from-tarkov-single-player/">Is Escape From Tarkov Single-Player?</a></h6>



<p>It’s a balancing mechanic, as it ensures that all players will at one point be matched in terms of equipment and opportunities. It also ensures that the game is kept somewhat fresh, as there is a point when the most experienced Escape From Tarkov players will simply have nothing left to do in the game but play it. </p>



<p>When a wipe hits, it typically brings with it a major update. These updates change the face of the game, often introducing entirely new maps, modes, characters, weapons – even new movement mechanics and physics elements.</p>



<h3 id="h-does-tarkov-pve-wipe">Does Tarkov PvE Wipe?</h3>



<p>In 2024, Battlestate Games opened up Tarkov’s PvE offering much more universally, giving players worldwide the ability to take advantage of this ‘offline’ platform. It works differently compared to the ‘traditional’ game as it doesn’t wipe automatically. Players can trigger a manual wipe whenever they’d like, but otherwise, they’re free to keep playing on the same character for as long as they like.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-tarkov-wipe">When Is The Next Tarkov Wipe?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>It has been confirmed that the next Escape from Tarkov wipe will take place in August 2024. It’s expected that it’ll arrive in the third week of the month, starting from the 19th. It’ll be accompanied by an ambitious Twitch Drops campaign as usual.</p>

<p>Here’s some data about the last Escape From Tarkov wipes, such as how long they lasted and when they took place:</p>



<ul>
<li>December 27, 2023, Lasted 139 days</li>



<li>August 10, 2023, Lasted 225 days</li>



<li>December 28, 2022, Lasted 183 days</li>

<li>May 28, 2020, Lasted 214 days</li>



<li>October 27, 2019, Lasted 201 days</li>
</ul>



<p>The current wipe, which went live at the end of December 2023, is the <strong>longest Tarkov wipe ever</strong>. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-tell-when-tarkov-is-going-to-wipe">How To Tell When Tarkov Is Going To Wipe</h2>



<p>Traditionally, Battlestate Games, the developer of Escape From Tarkov, will start scheduling special events just before a wipe is due to hit. In the past, Escape From Tarkov’s wipe events have been:</p>



<ul>
<li>Maximum-value loot spawning in very specific locations on the map</li>



<li>All the game’s bosses spawn on the same map</li>



<li>Players spawning in poisoned and need to find a cure</li>



<li>Players spawning in with a ‘stim’ injector that could give them ‘super soldier abilities’</li>



<li>In-game traders offering their wares for just a few coins</li>



<li>Multiple loot airdrops falling in all at once</li>
</ul>



<p>If the Tarkov events start ramping up, then you know that the next Escape From Tarkov wipe is starting soon. </p>

<p>Fans of Dead Rising, the 2006 zombie apocalypse-fuelled title, are dismayed that they’ll no longer earn points in-game for snapping ‘erotic’ photos. Well, perhaps ‘dismayed’ is a little strong, but some tongue-in-cheek comments are being made about the ‘too PC’ removal of ‘Erotica’ points in the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster.</p>



<p>In a recent developer diary, covered first by Famitsu, Capcom revealed the decision to strip points for erotic photos clean out of the upcoming game, which is set to be released on September 19.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-keep-it-clean">Keep It Clean</h2>



<p>Admittedly, it was a <strong>little </strong>creepy in 2006. Let’s say you managed to snap a picture of a female zombie laying on their back, taking advantage of an angle that let you peek up their dress. This would earn you ‘erotica’ points, boosting the value of your photos. Everything from cleavage to suggestive elements earned you these points, but that won’t be the case going into the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202408/13749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Capcom has confirmed</a> that while photography remains a front-and-centre element of the game, getting points for lewd angles is no longer a thing.</p>



<p>There are high expectations for the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. It has been boosted with several quality-of-life improvements, such as auto-saving, and most of the game’s environment – which is set in and around a shopping mall – has been fully refreshed.</p>



<p>Are you excited about heading back to Willamette in the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster?</p>
