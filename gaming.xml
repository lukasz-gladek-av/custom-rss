<p>Things that make you go Vroom</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We reported a little while back on Switch 2 timed-exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/gear-club-unlimited-3">Gear.Club Unlimited 3</a>, and how it was delayed from an initial release date in 2025 to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/gear-club-unlimited-3-speeds-onto-switch-2-later-this-year">sometime in 2026</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Nacon and Eden Games have announced pre-orders for the delayed racer for Switch 2, with a release date of <strong>19th February</strong> next year. Hooray and/or VROOOOOM!</p>
<p>According to Nacon, "this new instalment promises a more immersive experience than ever before, powered by the new console and enhanced with two completely new regions."</p>
<div><p>It's also the first Japan-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gear_club_unlimited">Gear.Club</a>, with players invited to recruit the best local drivers, assemble teams and immerse themselves in the country's unique automotive culture. The Story mode, "will be punctuated by trips back and forth between France and Japan, highlighting the shared passion that unites car enthusiasts on both continents."</p><p>

This third entry also introduces a new Highway Mode, which promises "unprecedented thrills", like that one time this writer got on his bicycle and rode at speed with no trousers. Speaking of trousers, you'll need some, as Highway mode sees you challenged with perfecting furiously fast sections of urban raceway at speeds "over 300 km/h through the dense traffic of Japanese highways." (That's 186mph+, imperial folks.)</p><p>

The game is available in two flavours, standard and deluxe, with the latter giving three days early access, a “Performance Cars Pack” DLC, and there's also a “Career Starter Pack” and “Customization Pack” thrown in for this version. Pre-orders of either version will come with the Honda and BMW in the pic below:</p></div>
<figure data-uuid="c51139e9e5817"><a title="gear.club 3 pre-orders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c51139e9e5817/gear-club-3-pre-orders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: NACON</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's a little more detail and some pics from the press kit for all you motorheads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>True to its DNA, Gear.Club Unlimited 3 retains the elements that made the series so successful:</strong></p>
<p>Prestige: a selection of legendary vehicles under official licenses;</p>
<p>Customization: players can customize and upgrade their vehicles to their liking to impose their style on the roads;</p>
<p>Adrenaline: more than 50 tracks in France and Japan, with a local split-screen multiplayer mode for 2 players. Players can compete in races, sprints, or duels, but also cooperate in highway mode for an even more intense shared experience!</p>
</blockquote>


<p>All that said, try as we might, we can't find pre-orders live beyond the Standard Edition pages retailers have had for some time. It's <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gear-Club-Unlimited-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0G162MLJD?tag=nlife-21" rel="sponsored noopener">£44.99 on Amazon</a> at the moment, but there's no sign of the fancy-pants Deluxe version at the time of writing, nor word on the price, and nothing on the eShop. We'll update this when we find out more.</p>

<p><em>Looking forward to Gear.Club Unlimited 3? Let us know!</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-loses-14-billion-in-value-as-memory-shortage-fears-rise/</link>
            <guid>1378660</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Across the board, the tech industry is currently still rattled by issues surrounding memory chip shortages. Companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/memory-shortages-are-so-terrible-that-samsung-is-shifting-hbm-production-towards-ddr5/">Samsung are making major shifts in their production lines,</a> and other companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/framework-announces-laptop-memory-upgrade-price-hike-but-insists-it-wont-overcharge-customers/">Framework have opted to directly tell consumers that prices will rise due to shortages</a>. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow">Bloomberg</a> points to Nintendo losing $14 billion in share value as fears around memory shortages continue to rise.</p>



<p>Nintendo's shares have declined on almost every trading day in December so far, dropping to their lowest level since May 2025. According to the report (via <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/">TrendForce</a>), Nintendo now has to spend <strong>41% more</strong> on the 128GB RAM chips it uses to make Nintendo Switch 2 consoles. NAND storage prices also rose by <strong>8%</strong>, and with the drop in share value, the question quickly turns to 'when,' not 'if,' Nintendo will raise prices on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>And of course, it's not just the rising price of the console that's a concern. Pelham Smithers of Pelham Smithers Associates told Bloomberg that Nintendo has already passed on the rising costs of memory chips to consumers through the cost of express microSD cards. "<em>The rise of NAND prices is starting to really impact express SD card prices. A 256GB express SD card costs $89.99 on Amazon. This is effectively a cost that Nintendo has passed on to the gamer</em>," said Smithers.</p>



<p>Of course, you don't need to buy an express microSD card for your Switch 2; you can try to make do with the console's built-in storage, but with the increasing number of developers turning to Game Key Card versions of their games for Switch 2 and the current landscape of digital games increasing in the amount of storage they consume, even the Switch 2's increased amount of internal storage compared to the original Switch doesn't go as far as it could for most players. </p>



<p>It's also worth noting that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-players-trouble-finding-microsd-express-cards-microsd-shortages/">MicroSD Express Cards are simply getting more difficult to find</a> as these shortages continue, so while Smithers isn't wrong in pointing to the increase in their price as a total increase to the cost of buying a Switch 2, it may not factor in for some buyers simply because they can't find a MicroSD Express card to overpay on.</p>



<p>Smithers also claims that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-nintendo-switch-2-deals-save-on-console-accessories-and-games/">recent Black Friday sales for Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundles</a> were one of the seasonal sales "<em>surprises</em>," claiming, "<em>You wouldn't expect it [Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle] to be discounted this close to the holiday season</em>."</p>



<p>Sure, the Switch 2 was one of the best-selling consoles this Black Friday (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-battlefield-6-black-friday-eu-sales/">even though, at least in the EU, PS5 still claimed the top spot</a>), but there's concern it can keep up with its popularity, Black Friday discount or not, with its current stock and how much more expensive every single Switch 2 unit is to manufacture now.</p>



<p>Even with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa doing his best <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-remain-stable/">to reassure shareholders and consumers that the cost of the console will "<em>remain stable</em>" for the immediate future</a>, last month, that could quickly change in the new year, after the holiday season winds down.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
All these massive, multi-billion dollar acquisitions are getting a bit scary, aren't they? The one on everyone's minds at the moment is of course Netflix's proposed takeover of movie studio giant Warner Bros, offering up a cool $82.7 billion in exchange. This, of course, has an indescribably massive potential to ruin mainstream cinema, but we won't get into that right this second, because there's another concern: how much the streamer does not seem to care about the games side of Warner Bros.
</p>
<p>
When asked about Warner Bros' games arm in a recent Netflix <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">investors call</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-warner-bros-games-business-in-83bn-mega-deal/">Pocket Gamer</a>), and whether the Warner Bros "assets enhance or accelerate the success in the gaming side," co-CEO Gregory Peters said that it does, with a caveat. "While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn't attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things," Peters explained.
</p>
<p>
"Now we're super excited because some of those properties that they've built, Hogwarts is a great example of that, have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering. They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model."
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros haven't exactly been doing great broadly speaking with games in recent times. Earlier this year they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">outright closed Monolith</a>, developer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a> and Shadow of Mordor, cancelling the studio's Wonder Woman game in the process. Plus there were the flops that were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">Suicide Squad</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-and-dc-smash-em-up-multiversus-joins-the-pile-of-dead-live-service-games">MultiVersus</a>.
</p><p>
Netflix haven't exactly smashed it on the games side either, having recently sold Spirit Crossing studio Spry Fox <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox">back to its owners</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">laying staff off at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio earlier this year</a>. And there's been no obvious breakout hits that aren't based on previously existing series.
</p>
<p>
This leaves a lot of room for concern over how Netflix may handle all of these new properties. Will it be the games companies Warner Bros own that get hit with the inevitable layoffs that come from massive acquisitions? Will these developers be forced into making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a> and Squid Game adaptations, and whatever show trends next, ad infinitum?
</p>
<p>
These questions won't be answered for years yet, let's not forget how long Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard took, not to mention the anti-trust process it went through. Perhaps we should cross our fingers for the individual developers involved, come what may.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Would PS VR2 have sold better if the games looked and played more like PlayStation 2 classics? Will John Romero’s next game also get suddenly canceled? And can a <em>Cyberpunk</em> trading card game bring back those awesome <em>Netrunner</em> vibes? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. It’s Game Awards Eve and I’m celebrating by remembering the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-rA5LzFc9I">special kind of hell</a> that was Joel McHale co-hosting the 2013 VGX.</p> <h2><em>The Boys</em> is getting a VR game that looks like a PS2 game</h2> <p><em>The Boys</em> is coming to Meta Quest just in time for season 5. The licensed tie-in is called <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/the-boys/5661258417332116/?srsltid=AfmBOoo8okddGts-VWwafdidPQDXpRHiKIOe81sLpIEKTA65ljxAbGVV"><em>The Boys: Trigger Warning</em></a>, drops in spring 2026 for $24, and features Butcher and Mother’s Milk “guiding from the shadows” as game protagonist Lucas Costa “sets off on a no-mercy hunt” to kill “a washed-up but still lethal family of Vought Superheroes.”</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-boys-trigger-warning-vr-game-ps2-graphics/"><em>The Gamer</em> notes</a>, it somehow looks like something that would have come out in 2003. Despite weird, lifeless depictions of Karl Urban and Laz Alonso, the VR spin-off by Arvore Immersive Games, which is inexplicably published by Sony Pictures Virtual Reality, promises “brutal boss fights” and “partial nudity.”</p>

 <h2>Minecraft has a big new content drop</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/mounts-of-mayhem-official-release-date"><em>Mounts of Mayhem</em></a> arrived December 9 and added new creatures for players to ride and a new weapon. Spears are finally in the game, too. They bring a new lunge capability to mounts. Fans are already fantasizing about recreating the<span dir="auto" role="text"> “Charge of the Rohirrim” in <em>Minecraft</em>.</span></p>  <p>The developer was speaking at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-cancelled-shooter-has-been-saved-with-fresh-redesign-inspired-by-elden-ring"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>) when he confirmed that Romero Games is working on a new project that “incorporates a lot of the elements” from a game that was cancelled earlier this year when Microsoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/romero-games-xbox-layoffs-shut-down-canceled-game-1851785765">suddenly pulled funding</a>. “We’re not starting at ground zero,” he said. “We can take pieces out of and put into a brand new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design.”</p>

 <h2>Switch Online is getting two more N64 adventures</h2>  <p><em>Rayman 2: The Great Escape</em> and <em>Tonic Trouble</em> are getting added to the Expansion Pack on December 17. It’s the first time the Ubisoft classics will be available on a modern console, which may help get fans primed for the eventual new<em> Rayman</em> game Ubisoft is reportedly working on.</p>

 <h2>Microsoft is reportedly working on getting legacy Xbox games running on PC gaming handhelds</h2> <p>That’s according to industry leaker NateTheHate. “There exists a hope to make legacy Xbox (OG and Xbox 360) games [backwards compatible] on ROG and Windows. Whether they succeed is the unknown; but there is an effort being made,” he wrote on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-ronald-on-25th-anniversary-we-want-to-celebrate-the-legacy-of-xbox-as-well-as-define-the-future-of-where-the-xbox-ecosystem-is-going.1376665/#post-148633819">gaming forum ResetEra</a>. “The other unknown would be how extensive will the initiative be in offerings. Will it be what we currently have on Series or will BC expand to add more titles across the Xbox ecosystem.”</p>

 <h2><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is getting turned into a trading card game</h2>  <p>The<em> Cyberpunk TCG</em> is a collaboration between CD Projekt Red and TCG newcomers WeirdCo. Characters like Johnny and Panam will make the cut for the starting set, as will<em> Edgerunners</em> characters like Lucy. It’s still not entirely clear what the mechanics of the game will be, but it looks like it will revolve around cybernetic enhancements, as you’d expect. The game will be crowdfunded through Kickstarter.</p> <h2>Warner Bros. is reportedly sticking with the Netflix deal</h2> <p>Despite Paramount’s 11th-hour bid of over $100 million, which included financing from Saudi Arabia and Jared Kushner, <a href="https://x.com/Lucas_Shaw/status/1998550897232880032"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Lucas Shaw</a> says Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t interested. The company is expected to stick with Netflix’s bid after the streaming platform shored up support among its board. Maybe it’ll bring back <em>Succession</em> for a bonus season to celebrate.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-theft-card-store-phantasmal-flames-2000651666"><em>Pokémon</em> card thieves went on a $100,000 burglary spree</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-game-awards-statue-theory-2000651769">The Game Awards hell statue is probably for a new Larian Studios RPG</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> isn’t shy about being a Switch 2 sugar rush: our review</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>Basic computing needs haven’t changed much over the years, and most people don’t need gaming rigs to handle their daily digital lives. Email, web browsing, video streaming, and video calls represent the bulk of what typical users do with their laptops, and the <strong>Lenovo V15 G2</strong> handles these tasks without breaking a sweat or your budget.</p>
<p>This 15.6-inch machine packs enough power (8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB PCIe SSD, WiFi 6) for anyone who needs a reliable Windows 11 laptop for everyday productivity and entertainment. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6337/">Amazon has just slashed the price to a record low of $299, down from the typical $1,199 asking price</a>, while Lenovo’s official website maintains full pricing without similar discounts available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6337/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real-World Computing Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>Intel Celeron N4500 dual-core processor</strong> runs at base speeds that can go up to 2.8GHz when applications need more processing power and it is enough power for most people’s everyday computing tasks. This chip won’t beat high-end processors in benchmarks, but it starts Chrome quickly, can handle a lot of browser tabs without slowing down too much, and runs Microsoft Office apps smoothly. The built-in Intel UHD Graphics handle video encoding without any stuttering or lag that would interrupt conversations, so video calls through Zoom or Teams work well.</p>



<p>The 8GB DDR4 RAM gives you enough room to comfortably multitask with normal application loads: You can keep your email open while you work on a word processor, a spreadsheet, and several browser tabs without having to close applications all the time to keep performance up. This 8GB setup leaves enough free memory for your actual work, but power users who often work with dozens of tabs or apps that use a lot of memory may eventually run into problems.</p>
<p>A <strong>PCIe SSD gives you 256GB of storage space and fast boot times and instant application launches</strong> that make modern computers feel responsive: You can keep a good number of documents, photos, and media files on your computer, but people with a lot of videos or games will need to be more careful about how they use their storage or buy external drives. The PCIe interface makes it possible to quickly back up files or move large folders instead of taking a long time and the lack of moving parts means that the device will run quietly and be more durable when it is moved.</p>
<p>The <strong>Full HD display is 15.6 inches wide and has a resolution of 1920×1080</strong> which makes text easy to read without straining your eyes and gives you enough space to work comfortably. Anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections from windows and overhead lights, so you can see clearly no matter what kind of lighting you have at home, at work, or at a coffee shop. The laptop’s thin bezels around the screen give it a modern look while making the most of the display area. The Dolby Audio speakers make the sound clearer than the cheap laptops’ tinny sound which makes the laptop more fun to use for streaming shows, listening to music, or video calls where you need to hear everyone clearly.</p>
<p>The 720p webcam has a <strong>physical privacy shutter that blocks the camera lens</strong> when you’re not using it which solves security issues without needing tape or third-party covers that leave residue. The video quality is good enough for casual video calls and meetings, but content creators who want high-quality streaming will need to use external cameras. What’s more, WiFi 6 support gives you faster wireless speeds and better performance in busy network areas than older WiFi 5 standards.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to connect<strong>, including USB-A ports for older devices, USB-C ports for newer accessories</strong> and data transfer, HDMI output for external monitors or presentations, and an Ethernet jack for when wired networking is more reliable than WiFi. The keyboard has a full-size numeric keypad that is useful for anyone who works with spreadsheets or enters data. The layout of the keyboard follows standard spacing, so there is no need to get used to it.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Home comes with a familiar interface for Windows users: It gives you access to the Microsoft Store, built-in productivity apps, and works with the huge library of Windows software. This hardware runs the operating system smoothly, without the lag that comes with underpowered machines. It stays responsive during normal daily use.</p>
<p>When entry-level Windows laptops from big-box stores often cost more and have similar or worse parts, spending $299 on a laptop with these specs is a great deal. Lenovo usually charges $1,199 for Celeron-based hardware, which seems high. However, even when compared to realistic market rates, this 75% discount gives you a complete, working laptop for a price that is only slightly higher than a basic Chromebook.</p>

                <p>At the end of October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">Rockstar fired over 30 employees</a> at Rockstar North in the United Kingdom and contended that they were let go over "gross misconduct." The Grand Theft Auto developer has since been accused of union busting, since many of the fired devs were either members of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain or organizing for it. Now, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Keir Starmer, and a member of Parliament, are keeping up the pressure on Rockstar.</p><p>"It's a deeply concerning case," said Starmer. "Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Our ministers will look into the particular case the member raises and will keep him updated."</p><p>The case was brought up by Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP, Chris Murray, who met with Rockstar on behalf of the workers. Murray noted that Rockstar initially refused to meet with him unless an NDA was signed, but the company relented following his refusal. Murray also stated that he was unconvinced by Rockstar's account of the firings.</p><p>"Rockstar fired 31 employees without providing evidence or union representation," said Murray. "The IWGB alleges union busting. Having met Rockstar, they failed to reassure me they are following law and I share concerns about union busting ... The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members. I was not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal."</p><p>A subsequent report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-fired-rockstar-devs-and-the-messages-they-shared/1100-6536482/" data-ref-id="1100-6536482">Rockstar fired the devs over messages on Discord</a> about the company's revised internal Slack policies. Over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-200-rockstar-devs-sign-letter-demanding-fired-staff-be-reinstated/1100-6536181/" data-ref-id="1100-6536181">200 Rockstar employees have demanded</a> that the fired devs be reinstated, and there have been multiple protests at Rockstar offices in support of the workers. For now, the issue remains unresolved. </p>

                <p>An absolute classic is one of two Nintendo 64 games set to join the Nintendo Classics library this month. Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Tonic Trouble, both from Ubisoft, will be available to play for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers starting December 17.</p><p>Rayman 2 was originally released in 1999 for Nintendo 64 and PC, with ports on Dreamcast, PlayStation, and other platforms following in subsequent years. It was the first 3D outing for Ubisoft's mascot and received acclaim from critics, rivaling Crash Bandicoot, Banjo-Kazooie, and even Super Mario 64.</p><p>Tonic Trouble is also an Ubisoft original, though decidedly with a lesser reputation compared to Rayman 2. Designed by Rayman creator Michel Ancel, the action-adventure game depicts a mutated Earth with a ton of colorful and quirky character designs.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAVh2BgUkxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uAVh2BgUkxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rayman-2-the-great-escape-review/1900-2545068/" data-ref-id="1900-2545068">Rayman 2: The Great Escape review</a> from 2000 rewarded the title a 9.3 score, citing its "wonderfully humorous story, excellent game mechanics, and perfection in almost all other categories." Meanwhile, Tonic Trouble <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tonic-trouble-review/1900-2543716/" data-ref-id="1900-2543716">received a 3/10 review</a> from GameSpot in 1999, with the reviewer lamenting that it will be remembered as "the game that's not Rayman 2."</p><p>If these Ubisoft additions aren't doing it for you, at least the addition of Rayman 2 bodes well for a couple of first-party Nintendo games making it onto the service. Back in July, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/internet-sleuths-think-super-smash-bros-donkey-kong-64-and-more-are-headed-to-nintendo-switch-online/1100-6532987/" data-ref-id="1100-6532987">online sleuths looked at blurry cover-art images</a> from a Nintendo video and deduced that five then-unannounced additions to Nintendo Classics were coming to the service.</p><p>Two of those five titles, one being Rayman 2 and the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/classic-sci-fi-shooter-forsaken-64-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online/1100-6534439/" data-ref-id="1100-6534439"> other being Forsaken 64</a>, have made it to Nintendo Switch Online since then, with the remaining games being Glover, Donkey Kong 64, and the original Super Smash Bros. The latter two have been glaring omissions, so Rayman 2's NSO debut should give hope to those waiting for some certified bangers on the service.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> is the brickified and much more family friendly reimagining of Aloy's first outing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>. "It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>.</p><p>We were more enthusiastic about Assassin's Creed Mirage. "I have frequently looked at Assassin's games as historical adventures with a bit of wonky sci-fi glamour, and Mirage's late-game certainly conforms to the formula in this regard. But what Mirage, and Mirage's Baghdad in particular, have reminded me is that the historical stuff is where the real care is found," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-review">Eurogamer's four star Assassin's Creed Mirage review</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, meanwhile, we awarded five stars, with reviewer Alexis Ong showering the surreal demonic skateboarding sim in praise. "Can't sleep? Moon too bright? Want to eat it? It's a simple goal for a demon in the underworld, as you'll find in this gorgeous, extraordinary narrative adventure that just so happens to require skateboarding," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-story-review">Eurogamer's review</a>.</p>

		<p>ININ Games has announced R-Type Dimensions III with the studio aiming to release the game in May 2026. The side scrolling shooter will feature completely rebuilt assets of R-Type III: The Third Lightning with players able to choose between 2D and 3D views of the action. ININ Games has also announced a Special Edition and Collectors Edition of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="R-Type Dimensions III Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bXOKxxPsUvs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The main features of R-Type Dimensions III includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fully remastered experience with completely reconstructed assets</li>
<li>Local co-op, enhanced with new scoring and survival mechanics</li>
<li>Advanced mode accessible from the start</li>
<li>Customizable controls and quality-of-life features in the settings</li>
<li>3D Camera settings (normal and crazy)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to get the Special Edition it will set you back approximately £54, and that will net you the game, a special edition box, the original soundtrack and an artbook. There is also the R-Type III Dimensions Collector’s Edition, which is priced at a much higher price of nearly £180. That features an exclusive case cover and manual, the artbook, a two disc soundtrack, posters, stickers, bosscards, replica boxes, and 15cm resin statue of Dobkeratops facing off against the R-90. Oh, you will also get a numbered certificate of authenticity.</p>

<p>R-Type Dimensions III is going to be released for PC, PS5, Switch, and Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ring-battery-video-doorbell-priced-like-basic-doorbell-amazon-plays-zero-profit-on-own-brand-2000652158</link>
            <guid>1378597</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ring belongs to Amazon, which gives the retail giant complete freedom to price these video doorbells however aggressively it wants without worrying about profit margins on individual units. Amazon’s strategy focuses on getting Ring devices installed in as many homes as possible and knows that subscription revenue and ecosystem lock-in will pay off long-term even if the hardware sells at cost or below.</p>
<p>The newest<strong> battery doorbell model delivers head-to-toe video coverage with 66% more vertical view</strong> than the previous generation, and captures packages on the ground and tall visitors’ faces in a single frame. This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/"> latest version currently sells for $49 on Amazon instead of the usual $99</a>&nbsp;which marks a record low price that makes smart doorbell technology accessible to practically anyone with a front door and a WiFi connection.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6333/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Video Coverage That Shows What Really Matters</h2>
<p>The <strong>bigger vertical field of view is a big improvement over older Ring doorbells</strong> which often cut off the tops of tall people’s heads or packages on the ground below the camera’s frame. This full-body coverage gets rid of the annoyance of having to watch footage again and again only to find that important details are missing because they were out of the camera’s view: You can clearly see the faces of delivery drivers while also making sure they really left your package instead of just pretending to deliver it. You can also see people who look suspiciously like they’re casing your property while they think they’re outside the camera’s range.</p>



<p>The<strong> built-in rechargeable battery</strong> means you don’t have to connect the doorbell to your home’s electrical system so renters or anyone who doesn’t want to deal with electrical work can install it. You probably already have cables that work with the USB-C charging port because it uses modern connector standards that are the same as those used by most new phones and tablets. When the battery gets low, just take the doorbell off its mount, plug it into any USB-C charger, and put it back in place after a few hours.</p>
<p>With the <em>Live View</em> feature, <strong>you can use the Ring app on your phone to see what’s going on at your door</strong> at any time, even if no one has pressed the doorbell button or motion detection has been triggered. This is helpful if you’re waiting for a delivery and want to see the driver, if you want to make sure your kids got home from school, or if you just want to see what’s going on outside without having to walk to the door.</p>



<p>When there is movement near your door, <strong>motion detection sends real-time alerts to your phone</strong>. However, the basic notifications only let you know that motion was detected and don’t say what caused it. Ring’s subscription service offers Smart Alerts, which use AI to tell the difference between people, packages, and other moving things like cars or animals. This way, you get more useful notifications that help you decide if something needs your immediate attention.</p>
<p>With Alexa integration, you can stream doorbell video to Echo Show devices all over your house, use Alexa speakers to announce visitors, or use voice commands to control Ring functions. You can ask Alexa to show you the front door, and within seconds, the video feed will appear on compatible Echo displays which lets you check who’s there without having to pull out your phone.</p>
<p>When you consider that smart doorbells from well-known brands usually cost between $150 and $250, spending $49 on a Ring video doorbell with its build quality and features is a great deal. Amazon’s usual price of $99 already made this a good deal compared to other options, but the 50% discount makes it so cheap that it is almost as cheap as regular doorbells from home improvement stores.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[John Romero’s Canceled Game Has Been Saved…Sort Of]]></title>

            <guid>1378591</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>John Romero’s upcoming game, which was seemingly canceled back when Microsoft ended its publishing agreement with Romero Games and pulled funding, has been saved. Well, sort of.</p>



<p>During an appearance at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid&nbsp;(Madrid Video Game Show), the creator of DOOM revealed that work on the game was continuing. He then went into some more detail on the game’s state, and what’s been happening since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/romero-games-denies-its-closed-after-game-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news broke in July</a>.</p>







<p>Romero revealed that the game has been “completely redesigned” and incorporates elements from the original version while still being a different game. That said, he wanted to make it clear that they weren’t “starting at ground zero” with the project.</p>



<p><strong>“We can take pieces out of and put into a brand-new indie game,”</strong> he said.<strong> “We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design.”</strong></p>



<p>He continued to say that the building the game is “more fun” than it was while also being a “much smaller game” overall. </p>



<p><strong>“It’s more fun for us because the people working on it were all directors of different departments, and they didn’t actually get to code or design or whatever,” </strong>he said. <strong>“[Now] we get to actually do that, do the thing that we’re really good at ourselves.”</strong></p>







<p>As far as the game’s features, Romero didn’t go into many specifics during his on-stage talk. That said, he spoke about Elden Ring being an inspiration for the game because it was a “really new experience”. His game, he says, is something that he’s never even played before, and making it something like that for players is the main idea behind the project.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overwatch 2’s December Patch Overhauls Competitive Like Never Before]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-patch-december-overhauls-competitive/</link>
            <guid>1378588</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Overwatch 2, despite a few ups and downs, remains one of the most popular hero shooters on the market. Since being released in October 2022 and going free-to-play, Overwatch 2 has remained a staple of the esports space, even with some drastic changes taking place to alter the face of the game’s core competitive leagues.</p>



<p>In the most recent update, the super-sized patch released on December 9, Blizzard made stacks of amendments to Overwatch 2, focusing quite heavily on the game’s competitive ecosystem. It was an overhaul, the likes of which haven’t been seen since the game launched.</p>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-2-s-competitive-revolution">Overwatch 2’s Competitive Revolution</h2>



<p>Blizzard’s latest Overwatch 2 update isn’t just about festivities; it’s a landmark moment for the game’s competitive platform. On December 9, the Winter Wonderland event was ushered in alongside a new patch, but the core of the update addressed the game’s ranked foundations.</p>



<p>The headline change is the ‘Challenger Tier’, a complete replacement for the long-standing Top 500 system that players have known and understood for years. The new framework transforms leaderboards into a season-long battle of skill.</p>



<p>It boasts an all-new scoring system that allows players to earn points based on their MMR, and certain bonuses can be unlocked for consistent performance streaks.</p>



<p>To get into the leaderboard, you’ll need to have a 4000 to 5000 Challenger Score, depending on the playlist you prefer to enjoy.</p>



<p>What’s exciting for the more pro players out there is that social integration is now a thing with this latest Overwatch 2 patch. Those players who are lucky enough to be verified can integrate their streaming and social profiles directly to their entry on the in-game leaderboard, and active competitors are highlighted, prompting fans to spectate their matches from within the client.</p>



<p>The new Wuxing University map is a competitive dream. Cassidy has been completely reforged to emphasize better survivability and versatility, and the competitive meta has been tweaked to no end. It really is the biggest update to the game’s core ‘esports systems’ since it was released over three years ago.</p>



<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re impressed with the latest Overwatch 2 patch.</p>

                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 celebrates its fifth anniversary today, December 10, as the RPG originally launched back on December 10, 2020. It's been a busy, tumultuous five years for the game, and now one of the game's designers, Pawel Sasko, has weighed in with a <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1998772126317220142" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">heartfelt message</a> to mark the milestone.</p><p>"I feel nothing but gratitude towards each one of you," he said. "I feel so thankful to be part of this community. I love all the pictures, videos; all the cosplay and mods that you have done for Cyberpunk 2077. It has been an incredible adventure."</p><p>He added: "I hope you have enjoyed the stories we have told about the characters we have built. I feel so blessed to be part of this community. I feel so thankful to be able to work on this game and to add something valuable to your lives."</p><p>Another developer, Bartek Pyrko, <a href="https://x.com/BartPyrko/status/1998737046739857431" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "I'm deeply proud to have been part of the team that shaped Night City. The project changed me--as a designer and as a person--and being my first project at CDPR, it became a defining and unforgettable chapter of my career."</p><p>When Cyberpunk 2077 launched in December 2020, it was in such a rough state, technically, that it was removed from sale from the PlayStation Store. Thousands of people got refunds.</p><p>CD Projekt pledged to update, fix, and improve Cyberpunk 2077 following its troubled launch, and the Polish developer did just that. The game later got into much better shape, culminating with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-rebuilds-its-gameplay-to-make-a-fantastic-rpg/1100-6517704/" data-ref-id="1100-6517704">Cyberpunk 2077's 2.0 update in 2023</a> that re-worked a number of gameplay systems, alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phantom-liberty-rewrites-cyberpunk-2077s-dna/1100-6515050/" data-ref-id="1100-6515050">Phantom Liberty expansion.</a></p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 has gone on to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-hits-35-million-sales-and-did-so-faster-than-witcher-3/1100-6536532/" data-ref-id="1100-6536532">more than 35 million copies</a>, reaching that sales milestone faster than The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The game expanded to a new platform, Switch 2, earlier this year. Unsurprisingly, a sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a>, is now in the works.</p><p>Beyond that, CD Projekt just recently announced an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-is-getting-an-official-physical-trading-card-game-in-collaboration-with-cd-projekt-red/1100-6536818/" data-ref-id="1100-6536818">official Cyberpunk Trading Card Game</a>. It features characters from Cyberpunk 2077 and the Netflix series Edgerunners, with a Kickstarter campaign for it coming in 2026.</p>

<p>With physical versions and everything!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>ININ Games has just announced that a new entry in the iconic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_r-type">R-Type</a> series is on its way to Switch consoles in May 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/r-type-dimensions-iii">R-Type Dimensions III</a> sees players return to the franchise's signature side-scrolling bullet hell warfare against, well, a whole bunch of weird s**t, sir. It's coming right at us!</p>
<p>Sorry about that. Flashbacks, innit. Working closely with Tozai and Irem (so that's the original creators and licence holders onboard), ININ describes this one as "one of the most ambitious and significant undertakings in ININ’s history." So stick that in your pulsating xenomorph skull and smoke it.</p>
<p>Building on the legacy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/r-type_dimensions_ex">R-Type Dimensions EX</a>, this new game apparently completely re-envisions the core action with cutting-edge visuals, sounds and more in the way of gameplay modes.</p>
<p>Here's some more details from ININ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>R-Type Dimensions III</em> brings the intensity, precision, and creative enemy design of the arcade originals to a new generation. Every stage, boss, and projectile pattern has been rebuilt with high-end 3D graphics, enhanced animations, and richly detailed environments, whilst preserving the instantly recognizable atmosphere that defined R-Type’s identity.</p>
<p>The same applies to the original music and sound effects. With an enormous effort, everything has been rebuilt so that Players can switch seamlessly between the original and the new R-Type III at any time, offering both nostalgic authenticity and a striking modern reinterpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Key features include:</strong></p>
<p>A fully remastered experience with completely reconstructed assets</p>
<p>Local co-op, enhanced with new scoring and survival mechanics</p>
<p>Advanced mode is accessible from the start</p>
<p>Customizable controls and quality-of-life features in the settings</p>
<p>3D Camera settings (normal and crazy)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we mentioned, there are also physical editions to get hold of here, with a special and collector's version as detailed below!</p>
<blockquote>

			<p>Despite the current questionable management of the brand, there's no denying that Xbox did some things right in the past. Chief among them is the backward compatibility program that makes select legacy games playable on current generation system, allowing more users to enjoy them without having to track old systems and copies of these games. In the future, Xbox backward compatibility could become even better, potentially expanding to Windows PCs and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/"><strong>ROG Xbox Ally</strong></a>, if a rumored effort bears fruit.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-ronald-on-25th-anniversary-we-want-to-celebrate-the-legacy-of-xbox-as-well-as-define-the-future-of-where-the-xbox-ecosystem-is-going.1376665/post-148633819">Over on the ResetERA forums</a></strong>, reliable insider Nate the Hate, who consistently provides correct insider information, commented on the future of the Xbox ecosystem, suggesting that there's a chance backward compatibility could be expanded to more platforms.</p>



<p><em>"There exists a hope to make legacy Xbox (OG and Xbox 360) games BC on ROG and Windows. Whether they succeed is the unknown; but there is an effort being made," </em>the insider wrote. <em>"The other unknown would be how extensive will the initiative be in offerings. Will it be what we currently have on Series or will BC expand to add more titles across the Xbox ecosystem."</em></p>



<p>This isn't the first time we heard that legacy Xbox games could be coming to PC, but even if the effort is ongoing, there are many hurdles to overcome to accomplish this. One of the biggest issues that would prevent a larger library from being available on PC and the ROG Xbox Ally would be licensing issues, as reportedly, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-cost-double-playstation-6/">publishers are not willing to allow an Xbox game license to be converted into a PC game license.</a></strong></p>



<p>What seems almost certain at this point is that the next-generation Xbox, <span>rumored to be powered by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-power-both-console-xbox-pcs/"><strong>AMD Magnus APU</strong></a>, will be&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/" target="_blank"><strong>backward compatible with previous-generation games.</strong></a>&nbsp;T</span>he above licensing issues wouldn't apply in this case, allowing legacy games to remain playable on a current gaming system.</p>



<p>Regardless of what Xbox has planned, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=266&amp;v=6Wl8G4k6FoQ&amp;feature=youtu.be"><strong>news about the ecosystem will be shared in 2026</strong></a>, which will mark the 25th anniversary of the brand. As such, we may not have to wait much longer to learn if this ongoing effort will bear fruit, and legacy games will indeed become available on PC.</p>

            <guid>1378552</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a> may be the most significant game to come out of Embark Studios so far, but that doesn't mean the team has forgotten about its first-person, free-to-play shooter from 2023, The Finals. Today, Embark <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/900">is kicking off the game's third year</a> after <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-the-game-awards-shadow-drop/">it was shadow-dropped at The Game Awards 2023</a>, with Season 9: Dragon Rising, an update that Embark says is "<em>focused on growth, accessibility and renewed competitive momentum</em>."</p>



<p>With that focus, on top of Season 9 introducing a new megacity map called Fangwai City, a new battle pass, and several new quality of life and balance improvements - all things you might expect from a seasonal update - it's also introducing a new 8v8 gameplay mode, Point Break, and key updates to its ranked system.</p>



<p>Point Break is the clear highlight in Season 9, though not just because it's a new, bigger mode compared to other modes offered in The Finals. You may recall that <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-ea-dice-exec-starts-embark/">Embark Studios was initially founded by former Battlefield developers</a> who wanted to return to a shooter that emphasized destructability in its matches, and to hear Embark describe the new mode in today's Season 9 reveal sounds like the team is getting back to their Battlefield roots in a way that makes sense for The Finals.</p>



<p>Point Break puts players as either attackers or defenders, with the lines of the battlefield constantly shifting, with attackers looking to destroy objectives that the defenders are charged with protecting. It's a large-scale game mode (well, large-scale for The Finals) that Embark describes as "<em>a mode where you always know where the action is headed, and what your team needs from you</em>," which could work just as well as a description for some game modes in Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SEASON 9 REVEAL PANEL | THE FINALS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwQlThIa4f8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Point Break, the new Fangwei City map, the extra optimization work done by Embark, and all of the other quality of life improvements Embark discusses in the video above really do hammer home the point that Embark is trying to inject some life back into The Finals. "<em>Season 9 isn't just new content, it's a stronger, more flexible version of The Finals, from top to bottom</em>," Embark says in its Season 9 reveal video.</p>



<p>And it couldn't have come at a better time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/">with all eyes back on Embark thanks to ARC Raiders</a>. While SteamDB numbers are never the full picture, it still doesn't exactly look great to see that The Finals <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2073850/charts/#max">hasn't had more than 50K concurrent players on Steam since January 2024</a>. While it's impressive that The Finals has been able to stick around long enough to reach its third year, which is more than can be said for <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-producer-leaves-ubisoft-and-game-industry-after-xdefiant-servers-shut-down/">some other recent free-to-play multiplayer first-person shooters</a>, it can't exactly continue to survive if its numbers don't start improving.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We'll see if Season 9: Dragon Rising is the adrenaline shot that the game needed, or if it's another whiff, bringing the game closer to its demise.</p>

            <p>Rockstar Games' firing of more than 30 workers just over a month ago has once again been brought up by UK politicians, with prime minister Keir Starmer calling it a "deeply concerning case" which will be looked into by government ministers. Rockstar have been accused of union busting by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain over the firings, with the union having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">filed legal claims</a> against the company.</p>
<p>The dismissals <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">reportedly followed a discussion</a> on a union-focused Discord server in which staff cited emails from Rockstar about changes to the company's internal Slack policies.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to a session in the House of Commons today, December 10th. Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP Chris Murray raised the issue of the firings, saying: "Having met Rockstar [about the firings], they failed to reassure me they are following employment law and I share concerns about union busting." He then asked Starmer if the big cheese agrees that every company has to follow employment law and that workers have the right to unionise.</p>
<p>"It's a deeply concerning case," replied the prime minister. "Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers' rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Ministers will look into the particular case the member raises and will keep him updated."</p>

</span></p><p>We'll have to see if anything comes of that looking into things, but it is noteworthy that Murray said he'd come out of meeting with the publisher with reservations as to whether Rockstar's firings were justified. Murray has shared more detail about his meeting with Rockstar in a statement sent to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-prime-minister-sir-keir-starmer-says-rockstar-firing-31-gta-6-developers-over-alleged-union-busting-is-deeply-concerning-and-pledges-that-ministers-will-now-investigate">IGN</a>. "The meeting began with us as MPs refused entry unless an NDA [non-disclosure agreement] was signed, a request they eventually withdrew after it being made clear this would not be signed," he said.</p><p>"The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members," the MP continued. "I was not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal."</p>
<p>While the IWGB have accused them of union busting, Rockstar have stuck to their line that the staff were let go for "distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum".</p>
<p>I've reached out to Rockstar for comment.</p>
<p>Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine has also previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">raised the issue of the firings in the House of Commons</a>, revealing that she'd written to Rockstar asking for information about the issue and requesting a meeting with a relevant minister.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-rogue-reaction-vanguard-release-date-tank-2000652174</link>
            <guid>1378543</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Rogue has always been one of my favorite X-Men thanks to the </span><i><span>X-Men Evolution </span></i><span>animated series and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>the Fox movies</span></a><span> I grew up with (justice for Anna Paquin!), and I was curious how </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a> <span>would balance a hero with unlimited possibilities for a competitive game. Now that we’ve finally seen her in action, it’s clear NetEase just made her a comic-accurate powerhouse, and fans are terrified of the power-siphoning hero’s abilities.</span></p>  <p><span>For those not steeped in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-disney-plus-premiere-impressions-1851356830"><i><span>X-Men</span></i></a> <span>knowledge, Rogue is a mutant with the ability to absorb people’s memories, personality, and powers at the slightest touch. Typically, this exchange causes a great deal of pain for the affected person, and Rogue can even kill someone through skin-to-skin contact if she hangs on long enough. </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>is implementing this into her kit, as she is able to absorb an ability from nearly every other character in the game. This lets her change her playstyle on the fly; she might take Doctor Strange’s shield to raise team-wide defenses, for instance, or copy Invisible Woman’s crowd-controlling bubbles to move enemies around.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Anyone playing Rogue has to be adaptable, as she can only copy abilities from enemies on the field, rather than just pulling from the roster at her whim. She’s not too dissimilar to Echo from </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>, whose ultimate lets her copy an enemy or ally’s form and kit, but Rogue still maintains her own cooldowns and abilities when she siphons an ability. Even without taking an ability from one of her foes, Rogue is a powerhouse of a tank. Her primary attacks are pretty straightforward, as she punches, kicks, and tosses around enemies like they’re nothing. She also has a block move that minimizes damage as she absorbs all that energy for a more powerful punch.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Rogue looks great for leading the front line and controlling a crowd, and that all comes together in her Ultimate, which creates an area-of-effect that siphons health, ult charge, and some other properties from heroes in her proximity. This gives her a ton of survivability and drains resources from enemies, some of which seems to be based on what enemy classes are in your field. Early footage shows her absorbing what looks to be base health from other Vanguards. The ult charge absorb is the real boon here, as that can undermine some of your opponents’ plays before they even get a chance to fire off their game-changing abilities. As you can expect, fans are both excited to play as this powerhouse and also scared to see her coming out of the enemy spawn.</span></p>         <p><span>All that said, some fans </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1pircv5/rogue_cant_steal_abilities_from_punisher/"><span>think she might have a weakness</span></a><span> when she drops on December 12. Based on the footage we’ve seen of her thus far, it seems like heroes that don’t technically have superpowers may be safe from her ability siphon. Punisher fights with firearms, and doesn’t seem to have the icon that shows Rogue can steal a power from him. So maybe Rogue’s counter is actually just regular guys who shoot at superheroes, like Hawkeye and Black Widow. We’ll know for sure when she launches on Friday.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/genies-avatar-sdk-lets-you-build-customizable-avatars-and-drop-them-straight-into-your-unity-game-2000651849</link>
            <guid>1378540</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game characters have come a long way in the last few years, but Genies — the company best known for its ultra-stylized digital avatars — is kicking that evolution into high gear. After announcing a partnership with Unity this summer, the company has begun rolling out its first set of tools to developers: the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6338/">Genies Avatar SDK, now available on the Unity Asset Store</a>.</p>
<p>The process is exceptionally easy: Drop this package into your project, and suddenly your game can support high-fidelity, fully customizable player avatars that persist across any game built using the Unity dev engine and that plugs into the same system. The avatars are then available across Unity-based games. The Genies Avatar SDK gives players something games have tried (and often failed) to nail for years — a digital identity that’s entirely theirs, not one feels like a generic character creator pulled from a dropdown menu.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6338/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Genies</a></p>

<h2>Change On the Fly</h2>
<p>The Genies editor lets players tweak body features, facial details, outfits, hairstyles, and accessories with a surprising amount of nuance. There’s a built-in “Closet” with starter clothing, and new outfits will roll out regularly, with developers able to also toss their own designs into the mix. Thanks to the company’s auto-rigging pipeline, custom wearables snap onto any avatar without breaking animations, clipping through bodies, or tanking visual fidelity.</p>
<p>Developers get a flexible avatar framework baked directly into the SDK. It comes with a ready-to-use character controller and can plug into existing animation systems if you already have one. NPCs can be created through the same editor — meaning every character in a world, not just players, can share the same expressive stylization. More importantly, everything persists. If a player unlocks or buys a wearable in one experience, it lives in their inventory everywhere the Genies system is supported.</p>



<h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>
<p data-start="2161" data-end="2490">The Genies SDK also includes a streamlined login flow. Instead of making players juggle passwords or account portals, Genies uses a one-time email code system that carries a user’s avatar and items from game to game. For any developer building a social space, UGC world, or multiplayer hub, that’s the holy grail.</p>
<p data-start="2492" data-end="3028">But Genies is already teasing what comes next — and this is where things get&nbsp;<em>really</em> interesting. The company is developing an AIGC SDK that can generate game-ready 3D assets in minutes, a Smart Avatar SDK that turns NPCs into AI-driven characters capable of learning and adapting to players, and a Genies Party SDK that bundles all of this into a platform for IP-driven experiences. Their stated goal is to turn some of the most tedious parts of development — asset creation, rigging, optimization — into fast, automated workflows.</p>
<p data-start="3030" data-end="3308">Whether this becomes the next big shift in game development or just a very fancy avatar creator remains to be seen. But if you’re curious, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6338/">the Avatar SDK is already live on the Unity Asset Store</a> — and Genies says it’s only the first step in a much cooler, more ambitious plan.</p>

            <guid>1378534</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Anniversary Edition</em> was shadowdropped</a> onto the Nintendo Switch 2. Bethesda promised this port of the classic 2011 open-world RPG was an improvement on the Switch 1 version. And in some ways, that’s true. But players are disappointed by how it runs and feels, and by all the space it takes up.</p> <p>The original <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch felt like a big deal at the time in 2017. Bethesda getting its ambitious RPG running on Nintendo’s portable hybrid console was wild to see, and it became a solid way to experience <em>Skyrim</em> while on the go. So, when <em>Skyrim</em> made the leap to Switch 2 yesterday, fans were excited to see Bethesda’s aging RPG get a big shot in the arm on the more powerful hardware. And visually, this new version of <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 does look nicer, with many of the enhancements to models and textures found in the other Anniversary Edition ports. So that’s nice!</p>

  <p>However, for some reason, this 2011 game, which runs at 60FPS or more on almost every other platform, remains stuck at 30FPS on Switch 2, as if it were 2017 all over again. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1piid4c/skyrim_swith_2_is_absolutely_terrible/">Across Reddit and social media</a>, fans feel that this 30FPS cap is one of the biggest problems with this new port. As many point out, games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-2077-switch-2-mouse-mode-greyed-out-turn-on-1851785724"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> run at 40FPS on Switch 2, yet <em>Skyrim</em> is still stuck at 30? Another annoying issue is that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1piegpl/input_delay_on_skyrim_switch_2_edition_is_terrible/"><em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 seems to have horrendous input lag.</a> Some players are calling it borderline unplayable in handheld mode, and coupled with the 30FPS cap, it adds up to <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 feeling like shit.</p>

 <p>And what’s baffling is that this version of Skyrim takes up 53 GB of space on <em>Switch 2.</em> In comparison, the Special Edition version of <em>Skyrim</em> on PC is 12GB. Add the <em>Anniversary Edition</em> DLC upgrade, and it requires approximately 25 GB of space. Meanwhile, on Xbox Series X/S, <em>Skyrim Anniversary Edition</em> has a digital footprint of 32GB. Why the Switch 2 version is this big is unknown, though some speculate it’s a mistake. Others wonder if it has to do with the Switch 2 hardware itself and how Bethesda’s old tech runs on it. Either way, it’s wild to think that <em>Cyberpunk</em> on Switch 2 is only 10GB bigger, at around 60GB, and looks 10 times better and runs at a higher framerate. Something seems off here.</p> <p>Hopefully, Bethesda does the other thing it’s famous for:<a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-fix-bethesda-new-patch-xbox-1851469635"> patching its broken games</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4s-10th-anniversary-update-is-a-complete-shit-show-that-nobody-wanted-2000642938">terrible updates</a> to make things more playable. But until then, you might want to hold off on buying <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2.</p>
