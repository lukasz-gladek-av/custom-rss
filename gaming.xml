Modiphius Entertainment has announced special box sets to help lower the bar to entry for the newest edition of its licensed Star Trek TTRPG, letting players live out their Starfleet fantasies.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Star Trek Adventures Second Edition</em> starter sets contain everything players need to begin their journey in the sci-fi universe created by Gene Roddenberry.</p>

These missions are designed to challenge a crew of 3-7 player characters. Those missions may involve sending aid to colonies in need, navigating complex issues on the borders of galactic powers, or exploring strange new worlds.</p>

<p>A single S<em>tar Trek Adventures Second Edition</em> starter set contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>A 48-page rules booklet providing an overview of Modiphius' 2d20 system.</li>
	<li>A 60-page campaign booklet containing the adventure "Infinite Combinations"</li>
	<li>A stat sheet for the Constitution-class U.S.S. Challenger and seven player character sheets. Each one has rules references on the back</li>
	<li>Four double-sided rules reference sheets.</li>
	<li>Five uniquely colored d20s.</li>
	<li>A series of tokens. 36 Momenum tokens, 36 Threat tokens, and 9 Determination tokens</li>
</ul><p><em>Star Trek Adventures Second Edition</em> was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-trek-adventures-second-edition-sets-course-for-strange-new-worlds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in February</a>. Alongside streamlined rules, the latest edition will include rules and resources for Klingon and Romulan player characters, expanding potential stories beyond Starfleet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“One of our key goals for second edition was to make the game accessible to new players, not just of <em>Star Trek Adventures</em> but of RPGs in general. I challenged the Starter Set campaign writers to think about what new gamemasters and new players might need to know as they play the game, and we wrote as much of that advice as possible into the campaign booklet. I hope you’ll be able to pick up the box, open it up, hand out characters, and then jump right into the first adventure and cooperatively tell a fun, evocative Star Trek story together. This one’s got it all–a dramatic rescue of citizens in peril, alien life-forms to investigate, and a science-fiction mystery to dig into and solve."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The starter sets are available for pre-order right now on Modiphius' store page. Pre-ordered sets are expected to ship in December. The sets will appear at retail stories in January.</p>

Second, because of all this light being output, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> absolutely destroys my phone’s battery life. A five-minute match ticks multiple percentage points off my meter.

Card trading for one, a feature that is missing but listed as coming soon. Also emotes, or any other way of communicating with opponents during matches. How else can I troll people when they make a mistake or their turn-one Misty immediately flips a tails? But more than any of those things, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>needs a dark mode. I let my premium pass free trial lapse today. If it came with a dark mode, I can promise you I would have re-upped. My family’s uninterrupted sleep and my corneas depend on it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I’m as much of a sucker for a physical collector’s edition of my favorite video games as anyone else, and you can bet I have my eye on the Stalker 2 Ultimate Edition. It’s expensive, though. It’s a little too expensive for my blood, and I’m pretty sure my wife would have something to say about one showing up in the mail, too. In any case, it’s still nice to dream and live vicariously through others. So, here’s what’s inside the Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl Ultimate Edition!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/activision-cracking-down-on-call-of-duty-vpn-users/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision’s Team RICOCHET has published changes on Black Ops 6 and Warzone to combat account boosting and VPN users. For the longest time, gamers worldwide have accused streamers of abusing ‘VPN lobbies’ to get better clips while playing in regions with a less talented pool of players.</p>



<p>In the latest round of changes, RICOCHET has confirmed how it’s tackling that practice, and while it’s not eradicating the use of VPNs, it’s ‘cutting down’ VPN abuse.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-wherever-you-will-go">Wherever You Will Go</h2>



<p>Using a VPN in Call of Duty has been a thing for several years. Typically, players will use a VPN to get away from highly competitive regions like the United Kingdom, North America, and some European countries. It reached a point where some VPN providers were marketing their products directly at Call of Duty players trying to circumvent ‘tougher lobbies’.</p>



<p>In a recent update, it was confirmed that Team RICOCHET (and Treyarch) has deployed two new changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced AFK detections to battle against account boosting</li>



<li>Adjusting ping thresholds to require players to play matches in their region to cut down on VPN abuse</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’ve got awful internet, then the latter change might impact you regardless of whether you have a VPN active or not. One thing that users insist Activision needs to address is the number of players taking part in the practice of ‘2 boxing’.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is yet to have a serious issue with cheaters, so something is being done right at Team RICOCHET. In the latter months of its lifecycle, Modern Warfare III was plagued by cheaters, particularly the Ranked Play platform. In the coming days, Ranked Play will hit Black Ops 6, so it could just be a matter of time before this game also suffers.</p>

            <p>
Warcraft, you might have noticed, is 30 this year (this <em>week</em> in fact, if you want to be more specific), and Blizzard is celebrating the occasion with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efhAa3zYZLw">bit of a news splurge</a> covering its various games set in the Warcraft universe. And that, of course, includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, with today bringing word the long-running MMO will soon see customisable cars, the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft-classic">World of Warcraft Classic</a> <em>Classic</em>, plus player houses sometime next year.
</p>
<p>
On the World of Warcraft Classic front, Blizzard has announced it'll be launching <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria">Mists of Pandaria</a> Classic in 2025, with a <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24148499/catch-up-on-the-future-of-warcraft-with-the-warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct">roadmap accompanying the news</a> pointing to a pre-patch drop early next summer, before the full release a little later on. Additionally, it's confirmed the impending arrival of World of Warcraft Classic Classic (not <em>strictly</em> an official title), which introduces new fresh realms as part of a <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24156594/relive-your-adventure-with-the-wow-classic-20th-anniversary-edition">WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition</a> launching on 21st November this year. These will be available in PvP, PvE, and Hardcore flavours, all progressing through to Burning Crusade Classic (Classic?) next year.
</p>
<p>
Over in World of Warcraft regular, meanwhile, patch 11.0.7 is on the horizon, introducing the Siren Isle as this year's The War Within expansion continues to unfold. That's alongside a revamped Winter Veil event for the festive season, and the previously announced return of WoW's battle royale-style Plunderstorm mode, which is making a comeback next year.

<p>
And as for what's next, that'll be WoW's 11.1 update, officially known as Undermined, releasing this winter. Undermined takes players to the capital city of the goblin's trade empire - called, yes, Undermine - where they'll learn more about goblin culture as The War Within's story continues, aligning themselves with one of the four warring goblins cartels: Steamwheedle, Blackwater, Bilgewater, and the Venture Company.
</p><p>
There's a lot going on in update 11.1, including a new dungeon, Operation: Floodgate, which'll see players racing to stop a group of goblins from blowing up a dam that would bring ruin to the Ringing Deeps. This'll be immediately available as part of Season 2's dungeon pool, alongside four other launch dungeons and three returning legacy dungeons - including Motherlode from Battle for Azeroth. There's also a new arena PvP map set in the heart of the city, plus an eight-boss raid zone - The Liberation of Undermine - taking players through the city's streets and into the colourful but deadly Gallagio, where its owner, Gallywix, awaits.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
Undermined's most notable addition, however, is the introduction of cars, which players will earn early on in their quest, enabling them to barrel through Undermine's streets "much, much faster" than a regular ground mount would allow. Better yet, car characteristics - grip, drift, acceleration, top speed, and so on - can all be customised to suit players' tastes.
</p>
<p>
Blizzard has plenty more planned for World of Warcraft in 2025, of course, with its roadmap outlining various new content drops as the year continues. That includes the MMO's next expansion, World of Warcraft: Midnight, which continues the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcrafts-the-war-within-expansion-kickstarts-worldsoul-saga-next-year">Worldsoul Saga</a> started in The War Within. And while Blizzard is mostly keeping tightlipped about Midnight for now, it <em>has</em> teased - via its favoured medium of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4">cinematic reveal trailer</a> - the introduction of player houses. It'll likely be some time, however, before it's ready to share more.
</p><p>
In other Warcraft news, Blizzard has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-warcraft-1-2-remasters-are-official-and-out-now-on-pc">announced remasters of Warcraft 1 and 2</a>, which real-time strategy fans can purchase via - either on their own or as part of a new $39.99 USD Battle Chest bundle containing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warcraft-iii-reforged">Warcraft 3: Reforged</a> - starting today.

<p>In a rather surprising turn of events, in celebration of Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, Blizzard unveiled and surprise launched remasters of Warcraft 1 and Warcraft 2, which are available on Battle.net at this very moment. If you want to purchase the entire collection, you can score Warcraft Remastered, Warcraft 2 Remastered, and Warcraft 3 Reforged for $39.99 in a unique Battle Chest. Oh, and if you buy now, you’ll also receive Warcraft Orcs &amp; Humans, Warcraft 3 Reforged multiplayer hero skins, and the World of Warcraft Meat Wagon mount, akin to a siege weapon with massive, bloody spikes on its front, rear, and wheels.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The surprise shadow drop of both Warcraft remasters occurs alongside the announcement that, after two decades, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-20-years-world-of-warcraft-is-getting-player-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft is finally getting player housing</a> in its upcoming expansion, Midnight. However, it’s still a year or two away from launch. But for now, if you pick up the Warcraft Battle Chest, you’ll find yourself with plenty of real-time strategy goodness to sift through before then.</p>



<p>For now, let’s focus on Warcraft Remastered and Warcraft 2 Remastered. For starters, Brad Chan, senior manager of Warcraft RTS, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These remasters have brand new hand drawn visuals that capture the original art style from each game, and you’ll be able to swap between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The remasters feature UI and UX improvements, making both real-time strategy games more accessible to modern audiences. Alongside the remasters, Warcraft 3: Reforged Patch 2.0 is on its way, featuring an environment and lighting overhaul, and improvements to the user interface. Oh, and there are uprezzed HD assets.</p>



<p>Is Warcraft a little too old for your tastes? Let us know if you’re hopping into the remastered RTS trilogy this week with the Battle Chest by visiting us on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>



<hr>



<p>It wasn’t long ago that Blizzard took the stage at BlizzCon 2023 to announce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-worldsoul-saga-warcraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 more years of World of Warcraft with the Worldsoul Saga</a>!</p>

Games featured in the program will come with a number of perks. GOG says that when you buy a game from the program, you can:</p><div><ul><li>“expect it to work on current and&nbsp;future&nbsp;popular PC configurations”</li><li>“be sure that this version is the best and most complete available anywhere, including compatibility, manuals, and other bonus content, but also DLCs and even features that are missing in other editions”</li><li>“access GOG’s Tech Support if you encounter technical issues with running the game”</li><li>“as with all titles in our catalog, always keep access to their offline installers, granting you the power to safeguard them how you want”</li></ul></div><p>GOG says that its goal is to acquire “all games no longer updated or maintained by their original publisher,” no matter their age. A recent study from the Video Game History Foundation found that 87 percent of games released before 2010 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/14/23792586/classic-game-preservation-video-game-history-foundation-esa">are no longer able to played</a>.

They must stay accessible, playable, and alive.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

By the time I was pushing payloads and getting Play of the Game with a well-placed Tactical Visor, a lot of the old hero kits and team compositions that were infamous when the hero shooter launched in 2016 were more like cautionary tales for relative newbies.

Some of the problems I have with the game would have been less damning if I’d jumped in when it was an exciting, brand-new thing that was fresh and hadn’t yet been sanded down by patches and ruleset changes. There’s something endearing about how unpolished <em>Overwatch Classic </em>feels. I imagine that back in 2016, it felt like there was so much potential for this universe and these heroes. If I’d been playing the game since launch, I think that feeling of potential is what I’d feel more nostalgic for, rather than the actual nuts and bolts of how <em>Overwatch </em>used to play.</p><p>The first match I played was against a team of three Roadhogs. I didn’t realize the “No Limits” setting that lets you and your team all pick the same character was in effect, meaning you could have teams made up of bulky tanks that would basically be immovable bullet sponges. These days, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>has limits that require you to play as different heroes, and in some modes your composition has to include an allotted number of characters per role. But it was the wild west in 2016 and people could create teams of all one hero if they wanted. And reader, that’s what my friends and I were up against. I thought I was gonna bust a blood vessel when I, as Soldier: 76, ran up the hill of the Hollywood map only to be greeted by a team of six Meis.</p><p>Mei, for those unfamiliar with her original kit, was able to freeze an enemy in their tracks with her primary fire. Her icy beam starts with a slowing effect that keeps you in place until the frozen status takes hold, giving the hero an easy opening to pop a headshot. That’s manageable when you’re facing one of her, but when it’s six? I effectively wasn’t playing for swaths of the match thanks to their icy assault, and even as we slowly but surely made progress on the objective, the opposing team didn’t change things up. It was just a constant barrage of ice keeping all of us in place.</p><p>I’m sure this was a funny bit for the opposing team, but I can’t imagine putting in the 1000+ hours I have in the game now if that’s what the game was like. What drew me to <em>Overwatch </em>in the first place was how heroes synergize, and facing opponents who have free reign to make a team of unkillable, self-healing tanks or the <em>Overwatch </em>equivalent of an Elsa snowstorm is the kind of thing that would have killed my enthusiasm for the game early on.</p><p>I’ve seen comments from the <em>Overwatch </em>community joking that the <em>Overwatch Classic </em>event is just reverse psychology to make people realize how good we’ve got it with <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and after playing the throwback mode for a night, I think I could be convinced of that. So much of <em>Overwatch </em>discourse is “make it like it used to be,” whether that be bringing back loot boxes instead of the battle pass it uses now, reverting to the 6v6 format instead of the current-day 5v5 structure, or going back to a previous rework for a character who doesn’t play like they once did. The original <em>Overwatch </em>was slower-paced, and playing it again after years of <em>Overwatch 2 </em>making the game feel more frantic is like suddenly getting caught in a fly trap. It’s a fun gimmick that’s brought back lapsed fans jonesing for the old days. But by and large, it’s been a reminder that sometimes parts of a game do get mechanically better over time and that maybe we’re not nostalgic for the game as it was, but the feeling we had when playing it.</p><p>I played a night of <em>Overwatch Classic </em>and I think I’ve had my fill. I missed all the characters I main that have been added since 2016 and all the balance and ruleset tweaks that have made matches feel less like chaotic shitposts. I don’t have much opinion on whether or not 6v6 should come back, but I do know that I’m more intrigued by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-6v6-test-season-14-open-role-queue-date-1851680742&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-6v6-test-season-14-open-role-queue-date-1851680742">the plans Blizzard has laid out</a></span> for reintegrating that original ruleset than the free-for-all we once had. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, the presentation ended with one big tease that’s farther out – a major feature coming to World of Warcraft’s next expansion that players have been asking about for years: player housing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The presentation didn’t offer any real details about exactly how player housing would work or what it would entail. All we learned is that the feature is in the works, and that we’ll finally see it in World of Warcraft: Midnight, the game’s next expansion planned for a full reveal in late summer of 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of player housing has been toyed around with in expansions going as far back as the Warlords of Draenor. At the time, the “Garrison” feature was floated as WoW’s answer to player housing, but ultimately fell short of the customizability and more permanent nature of player housing in other MMORPGs, such as Final Fantasy 14.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Garrisons were ultimately abandoned at the end of Warlords of Draenor, serving no real lasting purpose for most players, and Blizzard hasn’t revisited the idea of player housing since. Notably, Guild Wars 2 just implemented player housing earlier this year as well, suggesting the feature is a popular one for MMO players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, we don’t know much else about what World of Warcraft’s next expansion, Midnight, will entail. We did see a content roadmap during the presentation that suggests the expansion will be officially unveiled in late summer of 2025. Midnight will be the second part of what Blizzard is calling “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-three-expansions-in-world-of-warcraft-the-worldsoul-saga-blizzcon-2023">The Worldsoul Saga</a>”, which also encompasses The War Within and the expansion following Midnight, entitled The Last Titan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-everything-announced">everything announced from today’s Warcraft Direct right here</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-1-and-2-remasters-shadow-dropped-with-improved-graphics-quality-of-life-improvements-and-other-new-features">remasters of Warcraft I and II</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-next-major-patch-will-finally-visit-the-legendary-goblin-capital-undermine">next patch for The War Within</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-classic-heads-to-mists-of-pandaria-next-year">next update for World of Warcraft: Classic</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

They’ll receive a new customizable ground mount specifically built for use in Undermine (it’s a fancy car) that goes really, <em>really </em>fast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As usual for a new major patch, Undermine(d) will bring with it numerous new activities. There’s a new arena map, and a new dungeon, Operation Floodgate, which will join the remaining four The War Within launch dungeons in the Mythic pool. There will also be two new delves, some new variations on existing delves, and new story and updates for delve companion Brann Bronzebeard. Finally, there’s a new eight-boss raid, The Liberation of Undermine, which will take teams through the city itself and into the decadent heart of the goblin empire, where players will finally fight goblin faction leader Gallywix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undermine is a significant location in the Warcraft universe, though this is the first time players will visit it. In Warcraft’s history, Undermine was the underground site beneath the isle of Kezan that goblins claimed for their capital after rebelling against the Zandalari trolls. However, during the Cataclysm, the volcano the city was situated beneath erupted. The goblins evacuated the surface of Kezan, and Undermine was thought to have been destroyed. However, there have been hints ever since then that Undermine is still operational, and the new patch will allow us to see the city for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft patch 11.1 “Undermine(d)” is planned for release early next year, with a patch 11.2 coming in the summer.

Though Halloween was last month, the presentation kept the scares going with a full reveal of Ghostface from Scream, along with an interesting twist: The character is actually <em>three</em> Ghostfaces in one, and two of them are from the Mortal Kombat universe.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kombat Kast started with the gameplay trailer for the new fighter, which showed off multiple moves and combos, a fourth-wall-breaking Fatality, and a tease at his Animality where he morphs into a buzzard. After the trailer, it was explained that the original Ghostface--the one transported to the Mortal Kombat timeline--is the main fighter, but he can call other Ghostfaces into battle for him.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mortal Kombat 1 - Official Ghostface DLC Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Those other Ghostfaces--per NetherRealm lead QA analyst Stephanie Brownback--are "not anonymous," but instead are known characters from the Mortal Kombat canon. The only clues given during the stream were that both were recruited from Kano's Black Dragon clan, and that the male Ghostface is called "Black Dragon Enforcer" and the female is "Black Dragon Assassin." Each of the Black Dragon Ghostfaces have "clues" and "Easter eggs" that present while they're on-screen, and it will be up to the players to figure out who is who.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kombat Kast also revealed new features and adjustments to the roster, including new moves and abilities for Ashrah, Smoke, and Sub-Zero, among others. A replay takeover was also highlighted, where players can rewatch a recent online match and "take over" for a brief period of time, in order to analyze the situation and strategize for future matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat 1 is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Ghostface will officially join the roster on November 26, while those with early access through the Premium or Kollector's Edition will be able to play as the Scream killer one week sooner on November 19.</p>

(We’re doing a sale about it, which you can <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-first-birthday-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn more about here</a>.) Like most one-year-olds, the site still has some growing to do; while it does not whine, wear diapers, or throw up on itself, it is prone to irritating login issues and business-related woes that – like an infant’s shrieks – <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep Riley up at night</a>. Despite these known issues and the many character flaws of the people who own it, Aftermath is nonetheless loved by a great many people, some of them important – and all of them important in our hearts.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of our one-year anniversary celebration, here’s what they had to say:</p><blockquote><p>Chris Person’s blogs about some hobby he’s gone incredibly deep down the rabbit hole into are my favorite part of the site, full-stop. He got me into the <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-to-make-movie-theater-popcorn-flavacol-secret-ingredient" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flavacol + whirly pop meta</a>, and I am very thankful. I love how this site never feels constrained by the conventional boundaries of the games/media industry. It's the spontaneous blogs like ‘<a href="https://aftermath.site/learning-new-stuff-as-an-adult-rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I learned a new skill/hobby</a>’ or ‘isn’t that thing neat’ that keep me coming back.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Drew, Aftermath community member</p><blockquote><p>I really appreciate Aftermath's mixture of piercing moral clarity and insanely specific deep dives into, like, how to build your own <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-need-an-open-source-mouse-so-i-never-have-to-look-at-razer-synapse-again" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gamer mouse</a> out of bits of metal you buy on hobbyist websites. Chris Person's list of <a href="https://aftermath.site/best-active-forums-internet-today" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still-thriving online forums</a> was one of the best blog posts I read this year. Very happy to support one of the last corners of the internet where a human heart still beats. Aftermath forever!</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Adam Conover, creator of <em>The G Word</em>, <em>Adam Ruins Everything</em>, and <em>Factually</em>&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Very happy to support one of the last corners of the internet where a human heart still beats.</p></blockquote></figure><blockquote><p>This Discord is the best Discord channel I follow. Supportive in many ways while also confronting in ways to make everyone their better selves.</p><p>As for the actual news coverage: This is an outlet I wish existed during my troubled times working in the game industry. I'd likely would have opened up sooner to Aftermath as I would have felt seen and appreciated for being a part of the labor workforce of video games. Obviously many things were different over a decade ago, but my initial choice to be a subscriber is the hope you can be the voice I didn't have for others who need it now.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– John “Seg” Seggerson, developer and <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Discord</a> regular</p><blockquote><p>For me Aftermath is more about what they don’t cover than what they do; so many sites push whatever is trending, Web3, crypto, AI, [and] even when they aren’t pushing it, they are covering it and legitimizing it.&nbsp; Whereas on Aftermath I always see conversations around games that you would have with your friends, your smart friends, the one smarter than you, so when they say something, you just nod your head and agree but [are] secretly writing it down in your head to post it later as your own thoughts.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Chet Faliszek, CEO at Stray Bombay and former lead and writer at Valve</p><blockquote><p>I love Riley's (often self-described) role as the curmudgeon. Also appreciate keeping up on the actual journalism industry. Reporting layoffs and critiques and stuff about other game sites. Basically none of the corporate owned ones are going to do that, so having people who are actually caring about the hardships and stuff that this industry (this this industry, not that this industry... though you guys do also highlight that) is going through is great.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Cind, Aftermath community member</p><blockquote><p>I read Aftermath because, frankly, I’m glad something like this exists. Gaming news is easy enough to get from other places, but what’s been harder to find is gaming perspective. I appreciate that the writing here comes from a point of view, because regardless of [whether] I agree 100% of the time, it’s interesting to see the ‘why’ behind a piece, and not just read the ‘what.’</p><p>Also, as someone who wrapped a lovely interview about our studio’s first game with Game Informer three days before <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Informer</a> was effectively <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deleted from the internet</a>, it really drove home how important having independent voices in the space can be.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Mike Laidlaw, CCO at Yellow Brick Games and former creative director on <em>Dragon Age</em> and lead writer on <em>Jade Empire</em></p><blockquote><p>I learned about this site and the writers behind it via <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-16-nathan-grayson-riley-macleod-just-launched/id1570901546?i=1000634033743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Games Press podcast</a> and was initially won over by that interview to support Aftermath. I've been bowled over ever since. This community is wonderful and I'm treated to insightful podcasts and fascinating blogs each month. I've also got a sick ass mug out of it.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Jak, Aftermath community member</p><figure><blockquote><p>This community is wonderful and I'm treated to insightful podcasts and fascinating blogs each month. I've also got a sick ass mug out of it.</p></blockquote></figure><blockquote><p>At the <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-lan-party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book launch event for <em>LAN Party</em> with the Aftermath crew</a> we split a case of Bawls Guarana and became so caffeinated that we invented the sequel to LAN parties. They're called LANG parties and they're like LAN parties except you play the discography of Canadian singer-songwriter k.d. lang while you're doing <em>Quake II</em> deathmatches. You're welcome.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Merritt K, writer, author, and game developer</p><blockquote><p>I love that Aftermath isn't just obsessed with covering New Big Game That Everyone Is Talking About. There's a million games coming out right now, but there's also a BILLION games that never got the attention they deserved. And I want to read about <a href="https://aftermath.site/harpoon-97-micrporose-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90s naval strategy games</a>, dammit!</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Dayten Rose, Aftermath community member</p><blockquote><p>I'm a big fan of Aftermath's clickbait. Seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>Some video game websites run <a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headlines</a> that withhold key information in order to bait you to click. They dangle headlines such as&nbsp; ‘Beloved EA Game Gets Sequel’ or ‘Hideo Kojima Names His Second Least Favorite <em>Metal Gear</em>’ or ‘Nintendo Racing Franchise That Includes A Princess, An Ape and A Plumber Is Somehow Nominated For The Booker Prize.’ You read these headlines and can feel the manipulative tug. Must click. Must find out just what they are talking about.</p><p>Aftermath? They do that, too, but in a fun way.&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath tells me: <a href="https://aftermath.site/facebook-reels-beans-oh-no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bean Influencers Got Me</a>.

Get a bunch of good writers together who are allowed to actually write what they want instead of being endlessly stymied by financial ghouls, and the results speak for themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>“That being said, my least favorite thing was Nathan's line in <a href="https://aftermath.site/new-york-times-wordle-connections-puzzmo-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article</a> about the Washington Post being both behind the times and behind the Times, which I still don't think I've forgiven him for.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Darth Sunshine, Aftermath community member</p><blockquote><p>I’ve described my dear friend and Aftermath writer Chris Person as ‘a man comprised entirely of special interests,’ and I love him for that reason (and more); but thinking on it, I love Aftermath because it’s a <em>website </em>comprised entirely of special interests. Whenever I load it up I’m treated to whatever the staff really felt like writing about that day, whether it’s games, streaming, industry chatter, or <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-best-gaming-chair-is-a-used-office-chair-from-craigslist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something Chris found on Facebook Marketplace</a>. It’s all your most passionate friends at one party, only you don’t need to pretend to need to pee when one of them corners you and starts talking about, fuckin’, <em>Valorant </em>or the immortal science of Marxism-Leninism or something.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Stella Sacco, narrative designer and karaoke superstar</p><figure><blockquote><p>I love Aftermath because it’s a&nbsp;<em>website&nbsp;</em>comprised entirely of special interests.</p></blockquote></figure><blockquote><p>Everyone who writes for Aftermath is unabashedly, and fearlessly, THEMSELVES. The lack of corporate politics and agendas isn't just a breath of fresh air, it's a fucking hurricane of fresh air. Every word written for every article comes from the heart of the author, not from being forced to meet a quota or to jump on the latest trends. I love this website.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Smi1ey, Aftermath community member</p><blockquote><p>You're worker owned and funded by the people who read what you write. It's not just a cool thing to do, but also allows you to really dig into what companies are really doing instead of worrying about whether you're going to lose a potential revenue stream.</p><p>You're not only aware of labor issues in the games industry, but you can also speak well to what we face and also who is ultimately responsible for it being the way it is. I trust that if a worker talks to you about what's going on in their workplace, they will be treated with care rather than as a means to an end for a story that will be popular.</p><p>And lastly, I love the in-depth blogs about stuff you all personally enjoy. It's fun reading about things I know nothing about when the person writing it is clearly interested in the topic.</p><p>You all are doing a good thing and I'm really happy to see you thrive.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Austin Kelmore, co-founder of the <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IWGB Game Workers Union</a></p><blockquote><p>Do you also miss gaming sites? Do you click on a video game news story on your phone and get bummed out by a wall of pop-ups while you try to scroll and not accidentally touch any ads like it’s Operation? Thank God for Aftermath. Every time I visit the site it’s a sweet wave of relief: ‘Oh, a clean and pure gaming site can still exist in 2024.’ If you want to keep this anomaly going, you need to support it. Congratulations on your first anniversary, Aftermath!</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Ben Hanson, founder of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/minnmax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MinnMax</a></p><blockquote><p>When I was laid off from my job as the head of a video game section in September 2022, I thought I would bounce back quickly. A lot of my games journalism peers reached out offering freelance work or told me full-time roles were about to open up, so I was hopeful I could get something. But that was just the setup for an awful punchline. Over the next few months, most of those people would also be laid off. I didn't do the math, but I'm confident that as of now, over two years later, the remainder have lost their jobs. I even know people who were laid off during this period, pivoted to game dev, and then lost those jobs. It was, and still is, extremely dire.</p><p>I remember the one question people kept asking in the aftermath (oh hey) of all those initial 2022/2023 games journalism layoffs: Where's the <a href="https://defector.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector</a> of video games? Defector sprung up in the wake of an explosive journalism moment, so why couldn't it happen here? I kept posting through it, many of us did, dreaming of starting an independent media outlet or supporting all of our struggling friends. This was something I wanted to work on, but I didn't have the money nor the social clout to do so. Most of us didn't.</p><p>That's why it was so, so nice to see people who did have those things go for it. Aftermath is arguably the ‘Defector of video games’ since it literally runs on the same platform and is, you know, mostly about video games, but there's also <a href="https://www.rascal.news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rascal</a> for tabletop games, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SecondWindGroup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Second Wind</a> for a post-Escapist world, <a href="https://remapradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remap Radio</a> to fill the gap Waypoint left behind, and others I'm definitely forgetting. I wouldn't go so far as to say the ‘independent games journalism’ revolution is here, but as more and more sites lay us off or will only hire us for literal pennies, it's the one piece of hope we have.</p><p>Same goes for the rest of journalism. I subscribe to <a href="https://www.404media.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">404 Media</a> for explosive and deep technology coverage and <a href="https://flaminghydra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flaming Hydra</a> for insightful essays. I look at <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/the-onion-sold-global-tetrahedron-1235982383/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Onion's comeback</a> as an independent outlet actually run by a person actually in media (can you imagine?) with pride and endless cackling. The more independent outlets set up successful Kickstarters or publish one-of-a-kind work, the better I feel.</p><p>However, the vibes in games journalism right now are, frankly, bad. They're ‘take off for the rest of the afternoon because you're too depressed to function’ kind of bad or ‘black out on edibles’ bad. Just rancid. Everybody's competing for the one job that pops up every six months and for a tiny slice of any meager freelance budget that still exists. We all have Discords, we talk about this probably once a week. When I can make it out to conventions, every conversation is just... so sad. Not even hours of drunk karaoke or some great games on display can lift the mood.</p><p>I've had a few temporary and freelance opportunities since my layoff, but I'm still unemployed. After two years, I've finally had to accept that I'm done. I'm applying to jobs in other industries, but it's all tinged with a bit of sadness. And with Trump coming back into power and bringing every power-hungry billionaire with him, I don't think I can get a job in any industry, let alone one I might be a bit qualified for. Do you think media can survive yet another Trump presidency? Another day of Musk, Zuck, Bezos, Altman, or whoever's in charge at Google today hollowing out this institution?</p><p>Aftermath and independent media isn't going to be the thing that solves games and culture journalism's systemic problems. Or maybe it will! I don't know, I'm not a scientist. But the people need video games journalism beyond the same SEO crap, the guides, and the regurgitation of press releases. I know people want it too. They might not do anything about it, but they want something different. They just don't know where to go to get it.</p><p>But it's doing something. It's giving people work, producing excellent articles that I read every day, and is creating a space to move forward. And hey, that's something that can give us hope, the inspiration to do our own thing, or just not spiral further into despair. We're all going to spiral, so we should at least have some cool stuff to read as we go.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Carli Velocci, very good games journalist (hire her, jfc)</p><figure><blockquote><p>Aftermath and independent media isn't going to be the thing that solves games and culture journalism's systemic problems. Or maybe it will! I don't know, I'm not a scientist.</p></blockquote></figure><blockquote><p>There are lots of things worth celebrating about Aftermath on its one-year anniversary. There's reading a video game site in 2024 that doesn't have a giant car insurance ad in the middle of the page hijacking your web browser. There's the daily mix of scoops, no-bullshit criticism, and honest to god blogs. And there's a bunch of people terrible with numbers who decided to run a business with math in the name. Most of all there's the fact that it's succeeding, not despite all of these things, but because of them. But my personal favorite thing about Aftermath is how it's always logging me out of the site every time I close the tab. It's not the roguelike I wanted but it's the one games journalism needed.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Ethan Gach, senior reporter at Kotaku</p><blockquote><p>I love Aftermath. I wrote about video games for years. I think it's great to have a platform disconnected from the tropes of games journalism with a willingness to speak as a gamer.&nbsp;</p><p>On one night where I felt lonely and sad, where a karaoke party had fallen apart, Nathan Grayson refused to quit. He would simply not let me sit and be sad and lonely, and found a coterie of karaoke gargoyles. For hours we sat blasting the dumbest shit imaginable. It was a wonderful night, and I'm glad I left the house. Nathan would simply not accept the concept that my night was done, that I had nothing else to do, or that I was not worth the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On one night, where I felt self conscious, worried that nobody would want to talk to me, Chris Person walked over and told me about how he was in the process of working out how to use a certain kind of compound to create sugar free ice cream - the formula of which was yet to be finalized - and how it might work.&nbsp; He then listened to the minutiae of my day with the kind of intense focus usually reserved for counselors or mentors. Chris cares. Chris simply gives a fuck more than 99.9% of people.&nbsp;</p><p>In both of these cases, Grayson and Person showed a level of empathy that most do not, invigorated by their own passion. That's what you get from Aftermath. You empower and embolden personalities willing to be vulnerable, to dig into random shit, to take joy in the impossible or irrelevant, to disconnect from what might be expected or demanded, and talk about what matters, which might be beyond esoteric or niche, but matter so deeply to them that it disarms you and makes you consider a world beyond algorithms, beyond the norm, and beyond what you may think you want, and you will be surprised, and ultimately you will be better from having heard it. You will be richer for it.&nbsp;</p><p>I cannot tell you how media empires are made. Most of my success has come from brute forcing creative ideas empowered by a perpetual sense of having to work out the rest of my life. What I can tell you is that both Nathan and Chris have been loving, caring people in my life, despite me, in my opinion, never providing much more than being a guy who says ‘hey.’ They deliberately and cavernously love the things they love, and have such unplumbed depths of creativity that they are yet to explore.&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath allows them to. Back them. I have done so since the moment they allowed me to give them my credit card.&nbsp;</p><p>In a world increasingly focused on selfishness over love and product over passion, Aftermath operates as a beacon of what's beyond the norm, and beyond the unrelenting slop of genericism and emptiness.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Ed Zitron, CEO at <a href="https://www.ezpr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EZPR</a>, writer of <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Where’s Your Ed At</a>, and host of <a href="https://linktr.ee/betteroffline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Better Offline</a></p><figure><blockquote><p>He would simply not let me sit and be sad and lonely, and found a coterie of karaoke gargoyles.</p></blockquote></figure><blockquote><p>Happy first birthday Aftermath! They say the first anniversary is the paper one, so I hope you stack big in 2025. I want to shout out Chris Person’s blog about how <a href="https://aftermath.site/challengers-soundtrack-reznor-ross-playstation-wipeout-2097-ape-escape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Challengers</em> score sounds like a PS1 game</a>. I've listened to and thought about that album a lot this year and basically nobody else put it into this context, and I totally agree with it and think it and he and you guys rock. Please do more chess blogs next year, or else.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Patrick Redford, staff writer at Defector</p><blockquote><p>Amazing blogs, but have you guys considered sticking to Games?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Ari Notis, guides editor at Polygon</p><blockquote><p>I'm Gita.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Emanuel Maiberg, co-founder at <a href="https://www.404media.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">404 Media</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Both games also have “updated quality of life features for modern day gaming,” according to the Battle.net store page for the collection. While the third game is supported on Macs, the first two are PC-only.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</p><div><figcaption>Warcraft II: Remastered.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Blizzard</cite></p></div></div><p><em>Warcraft III: Reforged </em>2.0<em> </em>looks like the company’s attempt to make up for the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/warcraft-iii-reforged/">widely-panned</a> 2020 remaster, <em>Warcraft III: Reforged,</em> a game that was so hated that the company started offering a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/blizzard-is-offering-refunds-upon-request-for-warcraft-3-reforged/">no-questions-asked automated refund policy</a><em>. </em>Blizzard says it has updated environments and “fully customizable visuals,” as well as an option to play with the game’s original graphics at a higher resolution. </p><div><p>If you don’t want all three, you can get them individually. Blizzard charges $9.99 for <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/warcraft-1-remastered?p=1849794"><em>Warcraft I: Remastered</em></a><em>, </em>$14.99 for <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/warcraft-2-remastered?p=1849795"><em>Warcraft II: Remastered</em></a>, and $29.99 for <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/warcraft-3-reforged?p=44414"><em>Warcraft III: Reforged</em></a><em>.</em></p></div><p>In addition to the remasters, Blizzard also announced a January 2025 Hearthstone / StarCraft crossover called “Heroes of StarCraft”<em> </em>centered around <em>StarCraft. </em>(It’s no new <em>StarCraft </em>game, but at least Blizzard mentioned the series, I suppose). Blizzard is also updating <em>World Of Warcraft</em>, adding things like a new dungeon to the modern version, and a version of Mists of Pandaria for <em>WoW</em> Classic that resembles the expansion as it was in 2012. And <em>Warcraft Rumble</em> will launch in beta on PC on December 10th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
