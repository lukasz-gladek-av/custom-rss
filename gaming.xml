		<p>Star Wars Zero Company has been revealed by EA, which is a brand new single player turn based tactics game being developed by BitReactor and Respawn. There is not much detail yet as EA has stated that the full reveal will be coming on April 19th during Star Wars Celebration. The game has been rumoured for a while, with leaks suggesting Star Wars Zero Company will play like X-Com games.</p>



<p>Going by the artwork this looks like Clone Wars era Star Wars with Zero Company being a mix of characters including a Jedi, bounty hunter, clone trooper, droid, and rogue. What we don’t know yet is if the timeline of Zero Company will explore the entirety of the era from up to the conclusion of Order 66, or whether it will stop short of that defining event.</p>
<p>We will have to wait until April 19th to get a proper look at Star Wars Zero Company, and learn more about the actual story of the game.</p>

HBO’s approach to <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s story has stripped away a lot of the mystery and tension present in the game, but I do want to give some props to the team behind the show for faithfully recreating one of the best moments in Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic drama, even if it showed up much earlier than fans were probably expecting.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Future Days,” the first episode of season two, takes place almost entirely in the Jackson settlement that Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) have been living in for the past five years. The two have found places in the community of survivors protected from the infected horde, though Ellie is clearly jaded toward the notion of working with others for a larger purpose. To her, all these town walls do is keep her from reaching her true potential as someone who can fight against the infected, and she cares little for most of the civilians in this town. The one person she does seem to care about is Dina, played by Isabela Merced in the show. The two girls are best friends, and it’s clear that Ellie harbors some feelings for Dina, and every now and then, she gets a sense that it might not be one-sided.</p><p>Years of romantic tension between the two bubbles over at a dance in Jackson. Ellie is a wallflower, while Dina is the life of the party, dancing to Crooked Still’s “Little Sadie” and putting on a show. Then things start to slow down as the folk group’s melancholy, religious ballad “Ecstasy” begins to play. Dina drags a hesitant Ellie to the dance floor, and they begin to slow dance.</p><p>I wasn’t expecting to see this scene recreated in the show this early, as this moment originally appears as a flashback in the final hours of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. But before the game launched in 2020, the dance was one of the first scenes we ever saw, being featured at an E3 presentation way back in 2018. Even before I met Dina when I finally played the game two years later, I was already captivated by her effect on Ellie. This was an older version of the girl we’d met in the original game, and it was clear that everything she’d been through had left her more world-weary, perhaps aging her as much as the passage of time itself. Dina, meanwhile, was downright chipper, comparatively. She is playful where Ellie is always on guard, and she brings out those sparks of passion and excitement in Ellie that seemed to have been drained from her.</p><p>This moment on the dance floor is one of the best snapshots of the two’s dynamic, and I was frankly terrified that it would fall victim to the show’s inferior writing style. As I’ve laid out in my review of season two and recap of the first episode, I can’t stand the show’s tendency to overexplain and justify every action and thought these characters have. It gets downright painful for me to watch in some episodes, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the show kept this exchange almost exactly as it was in the PlayStation 4 game.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Ellie: Every guy in this room is staring at you right now.</p><p>Dina: Maybe they’re staring at you.</p><p>Ellie: They’re not.</p><p>Dina: Maybe they’re jealous of you?</p><p>Ellie: No reason to be. I’m not a threat.</p><p>Dina: Oh, Ellie. I think they should be terrified of you.</p></blockquote><p>Then Dina kisses Ellie in the middle of the dance floor. Sure, I might not like the way the show’s actors deliver these lines as much I love the way they’re said in the game, but even so, the back and forth does such an excellent job of illustrating Ellie’s beaten-down self-esteem. She doesn’t think Dina could ever view her this way, even though they are leaving no room for Jesus as they sway back and forth together. Dina, meanwhile, tells Ellie that she is so much more than she realizes, even though she doesn’t see it. If words aren’t enough to convince her, maybe actions will be.</p><p>Ellie will chalk the flirtation and the kiss up to drunken shenanigans on Dina’s part for a bit, further showing how deep her insecurity goes; even when she’s liplocked with a girl, she still doesn’t believe she can have this. But, then, Ellie has had nearly everything she’s ever wanted taken from her, so why would she believe this situation with Dina could be any different? How she handles that is a thread we’ll unravel as the season (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">or multiple seasons, rather</a></span>) continues, but at this moment, she gets what she wants, and she can start to believe that someone in this town sees her as something more than the angry girl who lives with Joel.</p><figure id="" data-id="59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-recommend-id="image://59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-recommend-id="image://59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The moment is cut short, however, as the town bigot Seth (Robert John Burke) interrupts the moment of ecstasy with judgemental scolding and a slur for good measure. Joel intervenes and shoves him to the ground, which leads Ellie to lash out in embarrassment. The two clearly have some baggage to unpack, but that’s a conversation for another episode.</p><p>Most of <em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season just made me appreciate the original game all the more for its stellar performances and understated writing. The dance scene had a similar effect, but it was also a nice break from all the overexplaining and monologuing that plague the show. Sometimes, the script you started with is perfect and doesn’t need any additional notes. Though they are few and far between, I’m glad that <em>The Last of Us </em>has at least a few moments where it recognizes that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-devs-address-fast-time-to-kill-concerns-on-verdansk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;time-to-kill&nbsp;in&nbsp;Call of Duty&nbsp;refers to the time it takes for a weapon to kill an opponent. Some fans have argued that TTK speeds are too fast on Verdansk, and Raven Software addressed those concerns. </p>



<p>To give you a good idea of how fast TTK speeds are in Warzone Season 3, The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cr-56-amax-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CR-56 AMAX</a> is arguably the best long-range meta weapon and has a 570-millisecond TTK, meaning you can consistently take down enemies in three to four shots up to around 25 meters. </p>



<p>For close-range engagements, players discovered that the 12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath Ammunition broke the MX Guardian and gave it a 280 ms TTK up to 10 meters, which is significantly faster than ever other weapon. The devs took notice and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-warzone-black-ops-6-april-11-update-patch-notes-dragon-breath-shotguns-removed-shattered-veil-boss-adjustments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed the attachment</a>, but there are still concerns about weapons eliminating enemies too fast. Raven Software cleared the air on that subject. </p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-devs-explain-why-the-ttk-is-fast-on-verdansk">Warzone Devs Explain Why The TTK is Fast on Verdansk</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Weapons aren’t the only danger in Verdansk in Warzone. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><span><strong>In an interview with&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>IGN</strong></a><strong>, Raven Software’s Warzone game director, Pete Actipis,</strong>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>admitted that TTK speeds are faster on Urzikstan and that the design choice was intentional</span>.</strong> </p>



<p>“Comparatively to last year, the Urzikstan year, it is a faster TTK,” <span>Actipis</span> said. It’s pretty equivalent – I don’t know the exact numbers offhand – but the original experience and what we wanted to go back for now was make it more of a casual, friendly kind of, ‘if I’m not good at hitting straight shots, I have an opportunity, I’m not going to get destroyed every gun battle.’ There’s also a lot more excitement, like, ‘Oh, I have an opportunity to get a kill.”</p>



<p>Making the Warzone TTK speed fast comes at the expense of higher-skilled players because even if the enemy misses shots or isn’t as accurate as them, needing fewer shots to kill covers up that inaccuracy. So, in many cases, winning and losing a gunfight comes down to being in a better position and seeing the enemy first rather than pure gun skill. </p>



<p>And Raven Software currently doesn’t have any plans to change that formula. </p>



<p>“We like right now where the TTK sits,” <span>Actipis</span> argued. “We will evaluate as the game progresses and see what our fans think.” “But right now, it seems like people are enjoying it.” </p>

<p>In the interview with IGN, Raven Software also provided an update on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-devs-provide-update-on-how-long-verdansk-will-stay-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future of Verdansk</a> and said that this map is the ‘starting point’ for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-devs-warzone-starting-point-verdansk-revival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone revival</a>. </p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When you love horror games as I do, you scour places like Steam for hidden gems. I've come to find a lot of those hidden gems come from DreadXP, the offshoot publishing label of longtime horror outlet Dread Central. But even in the brand's already-strange catalog, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/white-knuckle/" data-ref-id="5000-648478">White Knuckle</a> stands out. Its scares, so far anyway, don't come in the form of monsters or malicious beings like a usual horror game would feature. Instead, the scares are induced one step at a time in a massive silo where one wrong move means falling to your death.</p><p dir="ltr">White Knuckle is a first-person wall-climbing horror game that sees you trying to stay ahead of some kind of murky sludge slowly creeping up an enormously tall silo that was built for reasons I couldn't ascertain in my preview of the game. The context of the place is clearly meant to be part of White Knuckle's allure, and players are surely already trying to piece together that story.</p><p dir="ltr">I thought I would persevere through the game's challenging platforming to see more of the story for myself, especially since, early on, the controls were hard to understand, and I wondered if they'd be an obstacle. When a game is so dependent on its controls, it's often the case that the best examples feel natural and fluid right away. White Knuckle is odd in that it feels off at first but doesn't take much longer before it comes together. It's merely the difference of minutes versus seconds.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPSF1_SnPBI" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QPSF1_SnPBI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Swinging hand to hand, hammering in pitons, throwing rebar from a distance to give myself a clutch handhold just as the sludge beneath me begins bubbling up into my room, it all eventually clicked. Every once in a while, I'd climb high enough that the silo would close off a section beneath me, acting like a temporary checkpoint--I could fall onto it rather than plummet back to the very beginning, provided the sludge hadn't risen to blanket the floor yet.</p><p dir="ltr">With a limited inventory, I was quickly making strategic decisions. Do I take the nondescript tin can, which contains some kind of fluid that recharges my stamina--thus reinvigorating my fatigued hands some hundreds of meters above ground--or do I take the additional piton, giving myself a chance to make a risky reach a much safer one somewhere along my path?</p><p dir="ltr">Though my constrained pockets were certainly a hallmark of horror games, I was consciously searching for other classic horror elements. Its audio and setting are certainly creepy, but without a more traditional horror scenario in front of me, I was wondering just how frightening the game might be. Is it merely a horror game because the setting is vaguely unsettling?</p><p dir="ltr">But the farther I climbed, the more I realized that I needn't have searched for or expected any monsters. The act of climbing these structures had seeped into my mind as the game's horror, after all. It was an epiphany I had mid-climb during my hands-on time. Wait a minute, I thought to myself while dangling hundreds of meters above the ground, <em>this</em> is terrifying. The threat of failing a jump, of exhausting my hands and slipping to my death, or of stumbling so repeatedly that the murky goo caught up to me--it was exhilarating. The climb was the monster. It felt like Mirror's Edge by way of unending night terrors.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4475929-white_knuckle_a0p3vm6gyd.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475929" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4475929-white_knuckle_a0p3vm6gyd.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475929"></a><figcaption>Speedrunners will have a field day with White Knuckle, though I'll just be glad not to miss a handhold at times.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4475929-white_knuckle_a0p3vm6gyd.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This epiphany brought the whole experience together. At that point, I was more determined than ever to understand its world, reading its strange signage and listening for its disembodied voice announcing workplace goings-on that always felt like a fraction of a clue as to what the hell this silo was for in the first place. With the stakes real and my character's vulnerability obvious, I felt each step in my stomach. I wanted to learn more of its world and I'd come to understand--if not yet master--its controls, and I finally <em>got</em> the gameplay loop. I felt I was ready to press on when the Steam Early Access game arrives later this week on April 17.</p><p dir="ltr">White Knuckle isn't much like anything else DreadXP has published before, and for a label as oddball as this one, that's really saying something. It won't be easy, and it definitely won't be for anyone who fears heights, but if you can endure its wall-climbing horrors, maybe we'll meet each other at the finish line and help each other make sense of White Knuckle's lo-fi, high-tension unreality.</p>

			<p>The action survival game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forever-skies-apocalyptic-adventure/">Forever Skies</a> from Polish developer Far From Home has launched in 1.0 and is out of early access today, April 14, 2025. It's currently available to download on both PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>Forever Skies originally launched on PC in early access on June 22, 2023, and developer Far From Home has spent the last nearly two years updating and, at times, overhauling it to prepare for today's 1.0 launch.</p>

<p>Speaking of new content, today's 1.0 launch includes a bunch of new content, including the addition of biomes, new locations, and new colossal lifeforms, advancements to airship building with new designs for players to dig into, new tools and technologies for players to use, some balance tweaks, performance optimizations, and, of course, the final chapter of the story.</p>
<p>"<em>We’re extremely proud to be launching Forever Skies 1.0 officially today,</em>" chief executive officer of Far From Home Andrzej Blumenfeld said in a <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/bastion-uk/pressreleases/we-have-lift-off-soar-into-the-skies-as-forever-skies-1-dot-0-officially-launches-today-on-pc-and-playstation-r-5-3381096">press release</a> about the launch.</p>
<p>"<em>We spent 21+ months in Early Access, working really closely with our community who helped us to shape the game every step of the way. So to them and everyone who got behind us, we want to say a massive thank you!</em>"</p>
<p>We reviewed Forever Skies in its early access state a few months ahead of this 1.0 launch, and at the time, even in early access, it was already a very impressive title.</p>
<p>"<em>Forever Skies has a great, relaxing core gameplay</em> <em>loop</em>," we wrote in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forever-skies-apocalyptic-adventure/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>"The atmospheres are vibrant, but still provide the feeling of desolation and complete loneliness. It's very easy to dive into, once you get past the laggy and broken cutscene at the beginning of the game. Overall, Forever Skies is a great experience, and significantly less overwhelming than other games in this genre."</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Has Bungie Already Done Everything Wrong with Marathon?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/has-bungie-already-done-everything-wrong-with-marathon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/has-bungie-already-done-everything-wrong-with-marathon.1164135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/has-bungie-already-done-everything-wrong-with-marathon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bungie has officially revealed Marathon, uncovering the core gameplay loop, operating model, and narrative concept. It’s a somewhat traditional extraction shooter that’s going to try to disrupt the genre by introducing unique social mechanics and an original art style that has started turning heads in the gaming space.</p>



<p>However, many have already written off Marathon, pointing out glaring flaws in the game’s reveal and the news and rumours that followed. It’s bold enough to try breaking into the extraction genre, but to do it with so many risky choices sitting front-and-centre is downright ballsy – or foolish.</p>



<p>Has Bungie already done everything wrong with Marathon?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-marathon">What’s Wrong with Marathon?</h2>



<p>As a <strong>game</strong>, Marathon looks just fine. The combat mechanics look entertaining, the impressions built off preview sessions are strong, and it’s backed by Bungie, a big-name, big-budget studio. But that’s the tip of the iceberg, and when you start digging deeper, the flaws surface quite rapidly.</p>



<p>Firstly, extraction shooters <strong>rarely survive</strong> in the open market. Escape from Tarkov is the only extraction game to have remained consistent over the years, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-will-compete-with-other-extraction-shooters-by-not-competing-interview/">Russian shooter’s market cap</a> is nothing short of overwhelming for newcomers.</p>



<p>It can also be argued that Bungie is late to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-explains-why-marathon-is-an-extraction-shooter/">the extraction shooter boom</a> with Marathon, but other developers are still <strong>trying </strong>to crack that nut. It’s battle royale games all over again, but more of <strong>those </strong>have survived their uptick than the smattering of extraction shooters that appeared in recent years.</p>



<p>It was revealed that Marathon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-marathon-be-free-to-play-pricing-explained/">will be a premium title</a> with a moderate price tag, which many have suggested is the wrong foot forward for Bungie. It has been said that ‘a game like this’ should be free-to-play with microtransaction support, and I’m inclined to agree. It’s hard to land sales for a game like this, given that it’s a niche genre and a never-before-seen IP (if we ignore the original game that debuted in 1994).</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvJIQoWIQP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>On the subject of release, Marathon is contending with another big-budget first-person shooter, releasing on <strong>the same day as Borderlands 4</strong>. That game already has millions of fans around the world, and Borderlands is nothing if not loaded with quirks and a similarly unique art style, which could mean it’ll already outpace Marathon with ease.</p>



<p>The cacophony of mechanics and features wrapped up in Marathon are great, but it’s an overly complex way to present the extraction shooter genre, which at heart, is quite simple. You load up, you run a map, and you leave again – that’s it. Despite claiming to be super accessible, Marathon might be doing the opposite by putting up a convoluted learning curve.</p>



<p>With <strong>that </strong>being said, it’s too much of an arcade game for the hardcore extraction fans, and it’s likely too challenging for arcade shooter fans, so what exactly is Marathon’s target market? </p>



<p>I’m all game to give it a try, and I’ll go in with an open mind, but I’m worried about Marathon. It has been years in development at Bungie, and I just don’t want the team to fall flat with the project when it hits the market.</p>



<p>We’ll know more soon – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-access-marathon-alpha-closed-guide/">the closed alpha is on the way</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cod-devs-warzone-starting-point-verdansk-revival/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Verdansk has been turning heads since it returned to Call of Duty: Warzone almost two weeks ago. It saw player counts and viewership figures skyrocket to highs that hadn’t been seen for years, and it became the talk of the town far and wide. It was playing heavily into the nostalgia stakes, but that’s just what Warzone needed.</p>



<p>In a follow-up interview after the release of Verdansk (which hasn’t been seen since 2021), Activision’s developers spoke about the future of the battle royale platform. They’re insistent that Verdansk’s immediate success is ‘the starting point’ for a revival (or evolution) of Warzone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-inevitable-evolution">Inevitable Evolution</h2>



<p>Warzone was in a sticky spot before Verdansk came along. The game was tired, plagued by cheaters, and relatively unstable, but the sheer nostalgia value alone of Verdansk was enough to bring millions of players back. Activision went <strong>hard </strong>on the marketing campaign to make sure everyone knew the iconic map was coming back, and it has been a smash hit return thus far.</p>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, Pete Actipis, Raven Software’s game director working on Warzone, explained how this is the kick-off point for a grand evolution:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It has been pretty successful, and I think you can tell in the experience, right?</p>



<p>Like Etienne (Pouliot) said, we recreated Verdansk to be the best experience possible. But then we didn’t stop there.</p>



<p><strong>This is the starting point</strong>. It is not an anomaly for where Warzone is going.</p>



<p>We were very careful with crafting this experience this season, and the data is showing us that <strong>it’s been really successful and we just hope to keep that momentum going </strong>into the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also spoke about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battle-royale-multiplayer-casual-mode-where/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale Casual</a>, a new mode added alongside Verdansk that gives players a much lighter experience in Warzone. It’s not just here to stay but to <strong>grow </strong>as a mode:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The nice thing about this is, this is the first (revision) of it. It just went live and we’re going to look at the data, we’re going to evolve it over time to make sure it retains the design principles and spirit that we wanted it to have.</p>



<p>It’s still pretty new right now. I think it’s still giving players what they need in it right now, and we’ll just keep monitoring and evolving it. It’s a fun mode.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There was talk in the interview about the future of Verdansk’s narratives, which some eagle-eyed players have started picking up clues about in recent days. There is plenty of lore surrounding Verdansk, which unravelled across a couple of iterations a few years ago.</p>



<p>Have you found your way back into Verdansk yet? Let me know what you think in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

"Bow repair" is self-explanatory in that it'll repair a bow, of course, though "equipment repair" is a little more vague. Link's other, non-bow equipment in both games includes shields and breakable weapons, but there's no indication yet as to which category that repair might apply to.</p><div tabindex="0"

                <p>GoldenEye 007 is one of the most iconic and beloved games ever, but it's never gotten a proper remaster. That's not for a lack of trying, though. Stephen Kick, the head of Nightdive Studios, said in an interview that the company tried to make it happen--but Nintendo apparently shut it down.</p><p>Nightdive is known for bring back old games for modern consoles, with some of the titles under its belt including Turok, Doom 64, and Quake II, among many others.</p><p>Kick told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/we-never-give-up-remaster-kings-nightdive-on-saving-gamings-past/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> that it was "a real heartbreak" for the GoldenEye remaster to fail to come together. Kick said Nightdive put "a lot of effort" into pitching the game and assembling a "dream team" to make it happen. He said the MGM/Eon side of the equation was on board, but things fell apart when it came to Nintendo.</p><p>After getting MGM/Eon to agree, "Then it was: 'OK, we're ready to go.' 'Well, did you guys get the rights from Nintendo?' 'Wait a minute, we thought you had that.' And then Nintendo was like, 'Yeah, no third party's ever going to touch any Nintendo stuff, ever,'" Kick said.</p><p>Nightdive's Larry Kuperman added that the company has a history of working with Nintendo, as Nightdive was the first company to bring an N64 game to Switch with Turok. "So that got their attention right away," Kuperman said. "But it didn't really lead to a partnership or anything," he added.</p><p>Kuperman went on to say that Nintendo has a "very successful business philosophy that's worked well for them," so he understands why Nintendo didn't want to let Nightdive make a remaster.</p><p>"It's very hard for [Nintendo] to make an exception. And I don't know whether they knew that it was going to--how should I put this politically correctly--that it was going to leave something to be desired in there. What they put out was kind of minimal," he said. "And I'm trying to be fair about it, but I don't think that they could say, 'Well, we're going to make an exception.'"</p><p>In 2023, GoldenEye 007 came to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/goldeneye-007-controls-on-switch-are-wildly-unintuitive/1100-6510933/" data-ref-id="1100-6510933">Nintendo Switch and Xbox.</a> It's currently available for Xbox Game Pass. On Xbox, the game includes support for 4K resolution, with smoother frame rates. Years before this, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/goldeneye-remaster-gameplay-leaks-but-well-never-play-it/1100-6486936/" data-ref-id="1100-6486936">new version of GoldenEye 007 for Xbox 360 leaked online</a>. It was reportedly canceled due to rights and licensing issues. The situation may be even more complicated now that Amazon MGM Studios owns the rights to James Bond, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shocking-james-bond-changes-announced-could-influence-future-games/1100-6529615/" data-ref-id="1100-6529615">original producing partners Barbara Broccoli and Michael G.

The aptly named <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Spotlight event will showcase both the competitive spirit of the iconic card game with the enduring legacy of the beloved RPG series.</p>



<p>In an official press release, Wizards of the Coast provided details on the upcoming <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> <em>Final Fantasy</em> Spotlight event.

Each participant will receive a Japanese borderless promo card from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy</em> set</a>. The top 128 players will receive traditional foil copies of that promo card. As for the top players, they will win their share of a $50,000 prize pool.</p>

<p>All competitive <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> players who placed in the top 8 of the Pro Tour Edge of Eternities tournament at MagicCon Atlanta will be receiving invitations to the <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Spotlight event.</p>

<p>The event is free to all who wish to enter, but is subject to a maximum capacity of the venue. For those who wish to compete for the prize, a ticket will need to be purchased when registration opens. The registration site will go live April 16. This means if you can make the travel plans and haven't been spoiled by <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/magic-gathering-final-fantasy-leak-tells-us-plenty-about-set" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent leaks</a>, you can get a glimpse of this crossover set for yourself.</p>

<p>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Spotlight is the first time the event has been hosted in Japan. This is no doubt due to the cultural pull of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series, an imaginative franchise that has been around for almost thirty years. A series packed with iconic characters, locations, and creatures waiting to be represented in Wizards of the Coast's enduring fantasy card game.</p>

Fighting thousands of grunts at once is fun in and of itself, but soaking up loads of skill points and experience points to unlock consistently stronger abilities makes the game hard to put down. That said, while <em>Origins </em>isn’t necessarily complex, its leveling system is idiosyncratic enough that I had to use the word idiosyncratic to describe it. This was always how I imagined I’d use my English degree.</p><p>To be clear, <strong><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>doesn’t necessitate any kind of level grinding to succeed</strong>. Even on the “Hero” hard mode, I didn’t feel like I ever lacked for power in most battles (especially since it’s easy to lower the difficulty if you encounter a battle that’s giving you trouble). Having said that, leveling up and becoming stronger is a core part of the <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>experience. Trust me, you’re going to need that power if you aim for 100% completion. So to help you on your journey as the Guardian of Peace, here are five tips that will help you accrue strength as fast as possible. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3489b67d886d08b9bf825955655b4ed7" data-recommend-id="image://3489b67d886d08b9bf825955655b4ed7" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the equipment screen from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The protagonist has wheel weapons equipped" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>The fundamental rule of <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>’ leveling system is that your weapon types—not your protagonist—gains experience</strong>. The more you level up all your available weapon types, the more stat increases and skill boards you’ll unlock. </p><p>Weapons <em>can </em>still earn a modicum of passive experience if you don’t use them. However, to best maximize your power, <strong>you should use your weapons as evenly as you can</strong>. You’ll inevitably feel more comfortable with some weapon types over others, so I recommend saving your best weapons for major story battles while you use the armaments you’re least confident with during side missions or less eventful stages. Weapons require exponentially more experience points to level up as they grow in rank, so don’t let your growth plateau just because you only want to use swords. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8758eedd641c4a0c2d79ba3c0e4fbbac" data-recommend-id="image://8758eedd641c4a0c2d79ba3c0e4fbbac" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the map screen in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

Like, of course you’ll get stronger if you complete optional missions, welcome to virtually every video game ever made. That said, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>doesn’t always make its side objectives obvious—and you’ll want to complete <em>all </em>of them if you’re looking for total completion and a shiny platinum trophy. Even bond events can lead to optional challenges you can complete for an infusion of skill points, and most of these are easy to accomplish in the background while you play the main story.</p><p>To make sure you don’t miss anything, I recommend opening up your map screen after major story battles to see if anything new has popped up. Also make sure to keep checking back at the inn to see if you’ve gotten more mail, since that can lead to more optional content as well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="55ae1cc107e16daad02c516314291ab6" data-recommend-id="image://55ae1cc107e16daad02c516314291ab6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

Sure, just gunning for the immediate objectives to complete a mission will get you to victory faster. However, if you take the time to make a dent in a dense mob of small fry, you’ll rack up rewards way faster.</p><p>With that in mind, if you do decide to grind via skirmishes, <strong>aim for battles that involve a large force</strong> to optimize your KO count. Battle Arts that inflict wide area-of-effect damage around you will help out a lot here, especially if you can use attacks that inflict huge damage on enemy commanders while you simultaneously clear the field. You don’t necessarily need to go wild on every pack of commander-less enemies you see on the battlefield. However, at least making a quick dent on packs of foes as you see them will net you a modest chunk of EXP.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2a0ae0787e6600784ad472b4feea24fc" data-recommend-id="image://2a0ae0787e6600784ad472b4feea24fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

These are the <strong>Amulet of Fortune</strong>, <strong>Amulet of Means</strong>, and the <strong>Amulet of Merit</strong>. On the surface, these items can be very helpful. After all, who would say no to bonus money, skill points, and/or weapon drops?</p><p>However, <strong>the amulets are so risky to use that I only recommend using them if you’re playing missions you know you can easily steamroll</strong>. That increased damage adds up more than you might expect, and if you need to retry missions or retreat to chase down meat buns, you’re not really speeding up your gains. And that’s without considering that every accessory slot used on an amulet is an accessory slot that <em>isn’t </em>used to improve your battle prowess.</p><p>Similarly, <strong>the training weapons which increase your proficiency gains are also kind of a trap</strong>. The logic is the same as above; even if you’re dying for the increased experience points, training weapons are so much weaker than your other available armaments that the benefits are kind of negated. After all, if using the weapons makes every enemy take longer to defeat, is it really speeding up your grind? You do need to purchase all of them if you’re gunning for 100% completion, and they can be useful if you’re replaying super easy missions, so they’re not a waste to purchase. However, if you’re in this boat, you’d be better off if you…  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="60654b150c5dbdb7cf281abc34f77e77" data-recommend-id="image://60654b150c5dbdb7cf281abc34f77e77" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

Video games should be fun, first and foremost. Gaming the settings to maximize your gains should be a secondary objective.</p><p>Having said that, once you’re in a level grind mindset (because you want to get stronger or you’re progressing through postgame), the difficulty settings become an invaluable tool for your progression. Hero mode—the standard hard mode— awards a small amount of extra rewards if you select it, so it’s a no-brainer to select if you can handle a little extra intensity. I found most of the game to be perfectly surmountable with the difficulty turned up on a first playthrough, albeit with some exceptions (my first time in Chibi was <em>not </em>fun).</p><p>Once you’re in postgame, however, your priorities will change. <strong>Ultimate Warrior is the postgame-exclusive difficulty option, and it dishes out substantially greater rewards per battle than even Hero mode with a slew of amulets and training weapons equipped</strong>. It is a huge jump in level requirement, so you might not be able to jump into it right away after one playthrough. However, once you feel you can comfortably handle it (It starts getting pretty feasible after level 60), Ultimate Warrior is easily the best way to increase your power. You’ll need to play through the story multiple times to get all the endings anyway, so don’t sweat it too much if you can’t quite handle the optional challenges that Ultimate Warrior unlocks.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you want to take things easy, there’s nothing wrong with tuning the difficulty down to the easy Historian difficulty to blast through certain challenges. Sure, you sacrifice certain rewards.

<p>Verdansk returning to Warzone is a massive success story, but there is always the fear that the map will be removed or replaced in the rotation. Raven Software alleviated those concerns. </p>



<p>Caldera replaced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-prison-safe-locations-in-warzone-verdansk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> as the primary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/corsair-warzone-range-single-keycap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> map in December 2021 after a remarkable run that almost lasted two years. Since then, battle royale maps have typically been replaced after two years. For example, Caldera and Urzikstan survived two years before being shut down. </p>



<p>Al Mazrah was a rare exception and only made it one year. Verdansk is an interesting case, as the map launched in April, which is deep into the Black Ops 6 life cycle.<span> So, since&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-black-ops-7-details-have-been-leaked-by-a-playtester/" target="_blank">Black Ops 7</a>&nbsp;is coming soon, fans don’t know what that me</span>ans for Verdansk’s future. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-verdansk-be-replaced-in-warzone">When Will Verdansk be Replaced in Warzone?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Verdansk is here to stay. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Raven Software’s Warzone game director, Pete Actipis, confirmed that Verdansk will remain in Warzone throughout 2025. </strong></p>



<p>“We brought Verdansk back for a reason. It wasn’t just to bring it back for a season and kind of say goodbye to it again,” Actipis said. “A lot of effort went into it. So for the time being, Verdansk is sticking around, and this is just the beginning of the Verdansk 2025 journey, and then we’ll see how things go from there.”</p>



<p>This will be reassuring news to fans who have enjoyed Verdansk so far, and the success is undeniable. Verdansk’s return sparked a staggering&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-verdansk-return-call-of-dutys-player-count-jumps-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200% increase</a>&nbsp;in player count.&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-player-count-off-charts-as-verdansk-exceeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision</a>&nbsp;reportedly took notice and is pleased with the positive results from the update, and Raven Software expressed similar optimism. </p>



<hr>



<p>The devs plan to continue supporting Verdansk this year, and fans will not have to wait much longer for the next major update. Check out our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-3-reloaded-release-date-expected-start-time-verdansk-ranked-play-new-multiplayer-maps-smg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 Reloaded guide</a> for a full preview of the new content in the mid-season update. </p>

href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-coming-in-2025-according-to-leaks-3179371/" rel="nofollow ">reported by Dexerto</a>, new Call of Duty leaks came from a Reddit post by someone named Bigbyy, who claimed they were part of a study group assembled by Activision to see what the average player might be excited about for the next Call of Duty game. The Redditor claimed the story is set in 2035 and will be a follow up to the Black Ops 2 campaign, bringing back the characters Woods and Mason. The campaign is reported to have "up to four player co-op" and an open world map.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the Call of Duty 2025 leaks provided by Bigbyy do align with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">original leaks from Insider Gaming</a>, and it also offers new details that suggest exciting news for Zombies fans.</p><p dir="ltr">The leaker claimed Zombies mode will have the "largest round-based map ever created," a remake of the Tranzit map from Black Ops 2, and feature a difficulty slider. As for the story details, the leaks suggest a focus on the original Zombies crew and "an exploration of the old timelines." Treyarch added Richtofen back into the Zombies storyline for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, but it's been several years since Dempsey, Nikolai, or Takeo were featured.</p><p dir="ltr">The multiplayer maps Bigbyy said were shown to the study group included many older maps from the Black Ops series, but they were ported into a new futuristic Japanese setting.</p><p dir="ltr">The post also reported that Call of Duty 2025 will continue to feature Treyarch's omnimovement in all game modes, in addition to a new wall-running mechanic. Call of Duty's "Carry Forward" program is rumored to return, which would transfer the weapons and operators from Black Ops 6 into Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">The original post from Bigbyy has since been deleted, and with this being leaked from an alleged study group, it's possible that any of this information could change prior to launch. We're probably a long way away from an official announcement from Activision, but until then, we have highlighted all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">rumors and details about Call of Duty 2025</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, Call of Duty recently added the stoner duo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legendary-stoners-jay-silent-bob-are-now-in-call-of-duty-with-these-wacky-items/1100-6530786/">Jay and Silent Bob as playable operators in Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>. Season 3 just brought back the OG Verdansk map, and it's been<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-just-hit-a-2025-record-on-steam-following-verdansks-return-to-warzone/1100-6530610/"> successful in driving players back to Warzone</a>.</p>

If the option for Rest is greyed out, along with a somewhat vague “cannot use at current mission progression status” text, you’ll have some troubleshooting to do. The most likely culprit is that you’re partway through chapter five. This chapter is all about the weather in each region going crazy and has the environments locked to specific states. Yes, as weird as it seems, you’re introduced to this feature for only a few quests before having it temporarily locked away. Either way, <strong>reaching the final quest in chapter five will restore the Rest option.</strong></p><p>That should fix the problem for good, although you might see this restriction again even after completing chapter five. One possible reason is that you’re in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-co-op-lobby-link-party-id-1851771071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-co-op-lobby-link-party-id-1851771071">Link Party</a></span> with someone who hasn’t progressed as far as you have. Leaving the party and resetting the game should do the trick. Another solution that’s reportedly helped some is talking to a Support Desk Palico at one of the base camps. Claiming any leftover content or completing your Limited Bounties could set things right again. Otherwise, your best bet is to reset the game or try to play in offline mode.</p><hr><p>Whether you’re on the hunt for specific endemic life or vying for another go at an area’s Apex, rest is a great shortcut. Just try not to use up all your guild points doing it!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/survive-the-fall-the-first-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Hands-on with the first few hours of this promising post-apocalyptic action RPG.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Long before Bethesda took the reins of the series and Walton Goggins smeared on the ghoul make-up for his spellbinding turn in its adapted TV show, Fallout was an isometric action RPG viewed from a bird’s eye perspective. It’s that classic style of wasteland-wandering that the upcoming Survive the Fall appears to be using as its reference point, at least if the first few hours of the game I got my hands on are anything to go by. This deadly post-apocalyptic tale of survival builds on the original Fallout’s template – quite literally in the case of its robust camp development system – and its squad-based combat and scavenging help it craft an experience that feels fresh, even if the somewhat static story presentation prevents its personality from totally shining through.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike so many other post-apocalypses, Survive the Fall’s ruined world wasn’t caused by man’s own nuclear negligence. Instead, it seems that humanity got a dose of the sort of disaster that made the dinosaurs drop dead, when a comet collided with the earth and wiped out a significant slice of the world’s population. It also left a smoldering crater that leaks a toxic mist called Stasis, and those who survived either avoid it like the interplanetary plague it is or embrace it, absorbing its otherworldly power to mutate into stronger forms at the expense of their own humanity. Throughout Survive the Fall, your growing squad of scavengers must build bonds with the various factions found scattered around its three biomes in order to survive and thrive, from the Stasis-huffing Shroomers to the mysterious cult known only as the Sighted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I undertook each new task from Survive the Fall’s countless quest-givers, I took an instant liking to its squad-based setup. As you steer your party of up to three survivors around the sprawling national park area that serves as the setting for the beginning of the story, you can either manually search through abandoned chests for chemical compounds or chop down trees for lumber, or you can just tap a button to delegate the gruntwork to one of your cohorts allowing you to divert your attention elsewhere. It just feels more natural to divide each task up rather than forcing you to be hands-on with everything yourself while your AI companions stand around like bored children, and it speeds up the process of ransacking each settlement you come across. The only downside is that my view did become a little cluttered with button prompts anytime there were a number of interactive elements bunched together too closely in the environment, but thankfully those occasions were rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is also team-based. I tended to approach each encounter with the various marauders and ghouls with stealth as my priority, given that rifle and shotgun ammunition seemed so scarce at least in this early part of Survive the Fall’s story. Thus I treated each infiltration of an enemy camp not unlike a careful stalk through the recent Commandos: Origins – hiding in long grass, throwing stones to create distractions, crouch-walking around the clearly marked enemy vision cones and finally slitting their throats before ordering one of my post-apocalyptic pals to hide the body for me. There are also some satisfying environmental hazards to take advantage of, from obligatory explosive barrels to dangling cargo pallets that can be dropped onto a patrolling guard with a well-timed rifle shot.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Survive the Fall - Preview Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It felt good to carefully clear out each cluster of cultists, but during the instances that my cover was blown things did get a little bit fiddly once the firearms were drawn. I suspect there would have been a bit more precision offered with mouse and keyboard, but with a controller I found it overly fussy to get a bead on an enemy’s bonce using the lasersight, and more often than not resorted to hammering the melee attack and dodge move to chip away at their health bars in close quarters. Thankfully I was at least able to make good use of the ability to pause the action and direct my squadmates to focus on certain targets – reminiscent of similar systems in Wasteland or Mutant Year Zero – relying on them to wear down the beefier cult leaders while I mopped up the flamethrower-toting support crew. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a hard day’s mutant-murdering and loot-harvesting out in its deadly badlands, Survive the Fall shifts gears into a base-building management sim back at your camp. Documents recovered out in the world can be researched in order to earn knowledge points, which can then be invested in a sizable technology tree to unlock the ability to craft everything from bunk beds and kitchen areas to water filtration systems or even an armoury. Resources like timber can be crafted into planks which are then assembled into frames for new structures like plant boxes or gates to block nighttime raiders, while foraged herbs or meat salvaged from wolves and deer can be prepared into meals and stuffed into the backpacks of whichever group of adventurers you choose to send out on your next expedition. There seems to be quite a lot of depth here, and I can definitely see myself spending a considerable amount of time transforming my settlement from rusty rubble to cozy bubble in the finished game.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of my own base I found a number of intriguing areas to explore. From a crashed passenger plane that had been converted into an enemy fort to a farmstead that was crawling with Stasis-infected ghouls, Survive the Fall seemed to reward me with distinct locales in any direction I pointed my compass in. The impressive level of detail in some of these areas was also to its detriment, however, such as the swamplands of Mycorrhiza which dazzled with luminescent mushroom clusters but also dragged with a framerate that was more volatile than any of the toxic substances oozing from the earth. It was also plagued by the occasional game-breaking bug, and on a handful of occasions during my play session I was forced to quit and reload my save after getting stuck in an inventory screen or building menu. Thankfully there’s still another month or so before Survive the Fall’s release for developer Angry Bulls Studio to optimise the performance further.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Survive the Fall seemed to reward me with distinct locales in any direction I pointed my compass in.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s probably not quite enough time to draft in actors to record lines of dialogue, though, and that’s a slight shame because interacting with your squad or the various NPCs you meet along the way feels a little flat when it’s done exclusively via onscreen text. Although I did get a few laughs out of the odd character here and there – particularly from a quirky character named Blooper who referred to the Stasis smog as “fart wind” – much of my conversations just served to cue up the next fetch quest rather than really give me any lasting impressions of each faction member I met.      </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the bonds will deepen over the course of the full journey, and we won’t have to wait long to find out. Survive the Fall is due for release on PC this May and it’s full of post-apocalyptic potential. Assuming that the existing rough edges found on its controls and performance can be polished up by then this could well be a survival-based action RPG worthy of your hard-earned bottlecaps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a senior video editor based in IGN's Sydney office.
