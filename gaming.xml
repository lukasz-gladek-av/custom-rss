			<p>Even when it was released in 2017, the Nintendo Switch was never a powerhouse hardware, but with some overclocking, the system is capable of achieving impressive scores in some benchmark tests and even running the Dolphin GameCube emulator reasonably well.</p>
<p>In a new video shared on YouTube a few days ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naga</a> conducted another extreme overclocking test on L4T Ubuntu, effectively putting the Tegra X1 chip on steroids. This made the system achieve some impressive scores in tests such as Membench, Cuda95, and Geekbench 6. The fully overclocked system also runs the Dolphin GameCube/Wii emulator surprisingly well, achieving more than playable framerates at 1080p resolution in Mario Kart Wii.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch Extreme OC Benchmark on L4T Ubuntu - (Geekbench/glmark2/Dolphin)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRogKHSt5ro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the past few months, we got a glimpse of what the Nintendo Switch is capable of doing with overclocking, thanks to a few other tests. One of them proved how an overclocked system modded with<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-8-gb-pro-model-modded/"> 8GB of RAM</a> is capable of running<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-extreme-overclocking-zelda-above-60-fps/"> Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at above 60 FPS at native resolution and even at 30 FPS at 1440p</a>. If the rumors circulating online are correct, the console's successor shouldn't have much trouble running current games with good performance and great image quality, at least in its first few years of availability, thanks to 12 GB of LPDDR5X RAM, which should allow developers to deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12-gb-lpddr5x-ram-better-xbox-series-s/">better texture quality than the Xbox Series S</a>, and NVIDIA DLSS support.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-for-december-soulframe-preludes-pre-alpha-access-more.1021176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-soulframe-pre-alpha/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Digital Extremes treated the audience to a <a href="https://www.warframe.com/news/devstream-182-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double Devstream</a> for Warframe and Soulframe, and those interested heard a lot of big news about the titles. The streams provided a lot of information about the franchise and started with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-demo-out-now-on-all-platforms/">huge reveal</a> of Warframe: 1999, being released in December. A 1999 prequel webcomic will be released in November to get fans excited for the upcoming release. Additionally, Xaku Prime Access will begin on November 13.</p>
<p>Xaku is an amalgamation of three forgotten Warframes and is now converging once again. They previously acted as beneficiaries of the Entrati family and were lost to the void. Now they are emerging as Xaku Prime, and two new Prime weapons will also be released alongside them. A Syandana and Operator suit will also be released along with Xaku on November 13.</p>
<p>The comic has been produced in partnership with community artist Karu, and explores the founding of the Hex Syndicate. Additionally, there will be a playable mini-game in the Hollvanian Mall hub, where you can experience a "90s era run n' gun side-scroller," which was developed with Sumo Digital. You'll also be able to customize the Atomicycle with multiple color schemes and 11 upcoming premium skins to make your mode of transport flashy and exciting on the streets of Hollvania.</p>
<p>Trinity and Nyx will be receiving light reworks to make their gameplay experience more enjoyable, with Trinity's passive ability being replaced with other buffs to her other abilities to help make her meta-viable. This comes ahead of their Protoframe appearance in Warframe: 1999.</p>
<p>The team behind Soulframe provided an update, stating that the Preludes testing access will open up widely in 2025, which will give players a look into the pre-Alpha state of the game. The Devstream also provided new insight into the game, stating that the Preludes invites are continuing to be sent out, with the team continuing to provide access to players. Each player that gets invited to the playtest will get four additional codes that they can share with friends and family so that they don't have to experience the game on their own.</p>
<p>Additionally, additional changes to the combat system was mentioned, as well as the ability to acquire skills via weapon usage, changes to player progression, crafting and visual upgrades to the environments that players will get to explore.</p>
<p>During this devstream, they also honored one of the most prominent figures in the Warframe development team, Mike 'Mynki' Brennan. He was the first Art Director for Warframe, and helped provide great designs to the franchise and made Warframe the iconic IP that it is today. You can read his <a href="https://www.digitalextremes.com/news/remembering-mike-mynki-brennan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full obituary</a> on the Digital Extremes website, where they dedicate Warframe: 1999 to him.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-quickscoping-sniper-loadout-in-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Quickscoping is an incredibly popular playstyle in Call of Duty, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a> players are already testing out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snipers</a> to see which gun provides the fast ADS speeds and one-shot capabilities. </p>



<p>If you’re looking for the best quickscoping Sniper loadout in Black Ops 6, look no further, as we have all the attachments, Perks, and Equipment you’ll need to build an accurate and fast one-shot class setup.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-quickscoping-sniper-in-black-ops-6">Best quickscoping Sniper in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-lw3a1-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LW3A1 Frostline</a> is the best Sniper for quickscoping in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> due to its fast mobility and handling. It’s a bolt-action Sniper  Rifle, so it requires an accurate shot, which is extremely satisfying when it hits. It will one-shot enemies to the head, upper chest, and upper arms, so you’ll need to retain accuracy while quickscoping in order to drop enemies quickly.</p>



<p>The SVD may have better handling and mobility, however, it’s a semi-auto rifle, which means it lacks one-shot capabilities, making it a worse option.</p>



<h3 id="h-is-the-lw3a1-frostline-better-than-the-lr-7-62">Is the LW3A1 Frostline better than the LR 7.62?</h3>



<p>The LW3A1 is better for quickscoping, but the LR 7.62 is the best Sniper in terms of damage and one-shot kill consistency. </p>



<p>The LR 7.62 will drop an enemy in one bullet so long as you hit the arms, chest, or head. The Frostline is less forgiving, as you need to hit the upper chest and arms to secure a one-shot kill. That said, the LR 7.62 is slower and has worse handling, so as far as quickscoping goes, I prefer the fast and weightless feel of the LW3A1.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-attachments-for-quickscoping-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments for quickscoping in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Short Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Comb: </strong>Commando Riser</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Combat Stock</li>



<li><strong>Laser: </strong>Target Laser</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong> 7.62 Nato FMJ</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Short Barrel </strong>provides a boost to the jumping aim down sight and sprint to fire speeds, which I found incredibly useful with Ominimovement in Black Ops 6, as you’ll often find yourself jumping around to avoid bullets and hit shots.</p>



<p>To increase aim down sight and sprint to fire speeds, the <strong>Commando Riser </strong>Comb is a great choice, while the <strong>Combat Stock</strong> provides some flinch resistance and aim walking movement speed.</p>



<p>Arguably the most important attachment for quickscoping in Black Ops 6 is the <strong>Target Laser</strong>, which drastically reduces aiming idle sway and improves your aim walking steadiness. This means that when you aim in, your aim will be more accurate to where your crosshairs were before aiming down sight, leading to more accurate quickscopes.</p>



<p>Lastly, to add some flair to your shots, the <strong>7.62 Nato FMJ </strong>Fire Mod will allow you to hit wallbangs with an improvement to penetration damage.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-perks-for-quickscoping">Best Perks for quickscoping</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong> Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong> Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3: </strong>Cold Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong> Overkill</li>
</ul>



<p>For the best quickscoping loadout in Black Ops 6, you’ll want <strong>Ghost</strong> to keep you off the enemy radar, <strong>Forward Intel </strong>for more information on the enemy team’s position, and <strong>Cold Blooded</strong> to avoid enemy scorestreaks. These combine to give you the <strong>Recon Combat Specialty</strong> too, which will reveal enemies through walls when you spawn, giving you a good idea of where to set up.</p>



<p>As for the Wildcard, <strong>Overkill</strong> is the best option, as you can then run an SMG like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-c9-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C9</a> or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ksv-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KSV</a> as your Secondary to cover those close-range engagements. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-equipment-to-use-with-sniper">Best Equipment to use with Sniper</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tactical:</strong> Concussion</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong> Combat Axe</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong> Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>The Concussion is perfect for breaching rooms and stopping enemies from pushing you while you have a Sniper out. It also gives you the time you need to quickscope an enemy while they’re hunting you down, stunning them in their tracks. The Combat Axe is a classic and it should be on every Sniper loadout just for style points. It’s not the easiest to hit, but once you master the COmbat Axe, it can be very useful tool for close-range engagements.</p>



<p>When it comes to the Field Upgrade, whenever you’re set up in a nice spot on any of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps</a>, you’ll want to cover yourself to prevent any flanker from shooting you in the back, so the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> is a great pick.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk.1021143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It isn't a surprise that people would be excited for the new Call of Duty game, as the franchise has been a mainstay in the gaming industry for years. To celebrate the launch, Activision has put a lot of work into the marketing for the game, and it's claimed by the UK network EE and BT that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has drawn the largest traffic ever for a game launch in the country. If this is true, this is a huge milestone for the franchise and for Activision, but it also doesn't come as much of a surprise, considering how much Activision spent on marketing for this game.</p>
<p>What does come as a surprise is the peak for the number of players flocking to their PC and Consoles wasn't on the day of launch for the game; instead, it was October 21, which is when everyone who pre-ordered it would be able to pre-load the game ahead of its release.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is also a huge game, as it's the first game to be available on Xbox Game Pass as a day-one release. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Warzone are also available to those who have Game Pass Ultimate. <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2024/10/black-ops-6-drives-biggest-ever-uk-gaming-traffic-on-ee-and-bt-network.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to ISPreview</a>, EE / BT saw a 144% increase in Xbox Live traffic on the broadband network compared to the week before. This is quite a monumental amount of traffic, but it isn't too surprising, as Call of Duty games are known for having huge download sizes. While there were reports that the game would be a whopping 300 GB, it isn't that big, thankfully. However, the game does still come in at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-load-details-revealed-102-gb-ssd-needed/">sizable 102 GB</a> for pre-load,&nbsp; which, for a lot of people, will take a lot of time to install. Because of this, it makes perfect sense that the traffic for the game would increase so heavily on the pre-load day, as no one wants to be waiting around on release day trying to install a game at a snail's pace.</p>
<p>At the moment, there haven't been any official figures released on how Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been performing since release, but it has only been a couple of days thus far. It will be interesting to see the metrics for the number of players who come from Game Pass, as it is a significantly cheaper way to access the game than paying for the title outright, something that isn't an option for many gamers.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-simplifies-fortnite-progression-with-unified-battle-pass-xp.1021137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced changes to the way&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s battle pass progression will work, and if you like to play different&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>experiences outside of the standard battle royale mode, you'll like this one.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a news post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>website, Epic says that by December 1st, all battle passes in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will progress simultaneously, and you won't need to earn different kinds of XP to make progress along their tracks.</p>

<p>Right now, for instance, to make progress in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>'s battle pass, you'd have to earn Festival Points, while to move along&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s battle pass, you'd need Studs. Starting from December, however, that will no longer be the case.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-fortnite-battle-pass-xp-epic.jpg?itok=n-vlRSaC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-fortnite-battle-pass-xp-epic.jpg?itok=PpwkTkaE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Soon, all of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s battle passes will use the same XP to progress.</figcaption></figure><p>This change also means that whenever you earn XP in any of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s experiences, whether that's the main battle royale mode,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>, or any number of others, you'll gain XP for all battle passes.</p>

<p>Of course, you will still need to purchase the battle passes in question; Epic hasn't lost its mind, after all. Still, it's nice to know that you can be playing any&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>mode and not miss out on valuable XP elsewhere.</p>

<p>The first pass to get this treatment will be the Music Pass, which will be released as part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>'s sixth season on November 2nd. After that, on December 1st, the "Brick or Treat"&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>pass will adopt the new system, and all passes from that point on will use the new method.</p>

<p>Additionally, as part of this change, passes in&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Festival&nbsp;</em>will change to a single track with free and premium rewards, which is the same way the battle royale pass currently works.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-festival-battle-pass-xp.jpg?itok=3mUA-Lqt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-festival-battle-pass-xp.jpg?itok=zbEJF1Iw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival&nbsp;</em>will use Epic's new battle pass progression system.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in the world of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, the game is currently being used by none other than <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kamala-harris-is-courting-gamers-using-fortnite-in-the-last-week-of-the-us-presidential-campaign" rel="noopener" target="_blank">US presidential hopeful Kamala Harris</a> in order to drum up support for the upcoming election.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hasbro-board-games-fortnite-clue">board games of Hasbro</a> are also making their way to&nbsp;Epic's game<em>&nbsp;</em>in the form of custom maps. The first one's based around <em>Clue</em>-slash-<em>Cluedo</em>, and others will follow in the coming weeks.</p>

However, the game’s handling of trans identity goes beyond just options you can choose in the character creator that may support your own personal headcanon. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, BioWare has given you the option to actively declare in-game that your hero is transgender, in a way that’s reflected in dialogue throughout the game. Historically this has been the kind of thing that players have had to just apply to a game’s hero through their own imaginations, so I was happy to see BioWare went the extra step to codify it for those who want to play a trans Rook.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Rather, it comes a few hours into the game when you unlock Rook’s quarters in the Lighthouse base. This isn’t something you can miss, so if you’ve started your own playthrough and haven’t seen it yet, don’t worry, you just haven’t gotten to this point in the game. When you’re setting up Rook’s room, one of the items you’ll put down is a handheld mirror. This gives Rook a moment of self reflection and you the opportunity to add some backstory to your character based on things you included in the character creator. Personally, I chose to talk about my tattoos and speak a little lore for my hero into the universe. But there’s one option that allows you to touch on Rook’s gender identity, specifically stating that your character is transgender. This isn’t tied to anything specific in the character creator, so no matter what options you choose while making them, you can still have a trans Rook in your story.</p><figure id="" data-id="953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-recommend-id="image://953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-recommend-id="image://953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The three options include “I’m getting there,” “I love who I am,” and “Feels good to see the real me,” so you can designate your trans identity and also color in where you think they are in their personal journey. This will unlock some dialogue options throughout <em>The Veilguard</em> that allow you to discuss this aspect of your identity with other characters, so it’s not just a thing you have to internalize. However, as far as I can tell after finishing the game, if you don’t pick this option when you’re setting up Rook’s room, it doesn’t come up again later. So be sure to go down this dialogue path when you’re examining the mirror if you want to play as a trans Rook and have it be recognized in dialogue. It just might give you a point of common connection with some characters that will enrich your story throughout.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/all-passes-in-fortnite-to-progress-simultaneously-by-earning-xp-coming-december-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fortnite has taken off on a massive scale, and they are constantly adding new content to the game to keep it fresh and appealing for new and returning players. This includes adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-talks-about-disneys-persistent-universe-in-fortnite/">new experiences</a> to the Fortnite universe, such as LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing, Fortnite Festival, and a ton of User-Created Content (including Kamala Harris' new Fortnite experience.) This makes the game more accessible and easier to grind. All passes in Fortnite will progress simultaneously by earning XP from playing any experience. This <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive change</a> will be coming on December 1.</p>
<p>Currently, only the Battle Royale Battle Pass levels up from XP gained in any experience. However, the team will be rolling out the update to include the upcoming Music Pass, which was previously known as the Festival Pass. The Music Pass will be able to level up this way as of November 2, with the change affecting remaining passes and future passes as of December 1.</p>
<p>Much like the current Battle Pass, the Music and LEGO passes released after December 1 will instead change to having just one track, which includes both free and premium rewards. This helps simplify the battle passes significantly. Additionally, to further simplify the process, they are also retiring Festival Points on November 2, which will be followed by Battle Stars and Studs on December 1. This is to simplify the process of earning your passes, and the rewards will instead just be unlocked via earning XP.</p>
<p>Of course, if you want to access the rewards in the Battle Pass, Music Pass, or LEGO Pass, you'll have to purchase them separately to get the premium rewards. However, you will still be able to access the free rewards with no issue.</p>
<p>Fortnite has gained a lot of popularity over the years, but it's now taking off in a somewhat peculiar way, too. In the final week before the U.S. 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris has been trying to pitch her campaign to gamers. To do this, they launched their Fortnite map, Freedom Town, USA. Exploring the city will show you some of Harris' campaign pledges to try and inspire young people to go out and vote. Those who want to see what has been created can check out the map using this code: 733155366547. It isn't all too surprising that Harris has decided to do this, as we've seen them join Twitch in recent days to talk about politics while playing games, with Tim Walz streaming with AOC and playing the Dreamcast version of Crazy Taxi.</p>
<p>Make sure to keep an eye on your Battle Pass progress so that you aren't missing out on any rewards you may get as they slowly swap over to an XP progress system for all Battle Passes in Fortnite.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steins-gate-re-boot-will-revive-a-classic-visual-novel-next-year.1021101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steins-gate-reboot-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Visual novel developer Mages has announced&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot</em>, which appears to be either a remake or enhanced remaster of the original 2009 visual novel.</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steinsgate-reboot-to-bring-the-original-time-travel-adventure-to-modern-platforms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, details about the game are scarce at the moment; all we've got is a title, previews of some of the character artwork, and a rough release window of 2025.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/22274" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Famitsu article</a>&nbsp;(for which we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will feature additional story content, and it'll also have new character design from Huke, the artist who worked on the original game. It looks as though the character art has been redrawn as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steins-gate-reboot-2025-okabe.jpg?itok=ukgVQGlA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steins-gate-reboot-2025-okabe.jpg?itok=JXb1V5Qw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will seemingly feature redrawn character designs by original artist Huke.</figcaption></figure><p>The Famitsu article also says that&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>is based on the original&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate</em>, so it won't be a new game entirely. You'll have to wait for the tentatively-titled&nbsp;<em>Steins;???&nbsp;</em>if you want to see how the&nbsp;<em>Science Adventure&nbsp;</em>series continues.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated,&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>is a 2009 visual novel that serves as the second entry in Mages'&nbsp;<em>Science Adventure&nbsp;</em>series, which began with 2008's&nbsp;<em>Chaos;Head&nbsp;</em>(later released in enhanced form as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chaoshead-noah-steam-release-goes-ahead-after-all"><em>Chaos;Head Noah</em></a>).</p>

<p>The game revolves around eccentric scientist Okabe Rintaro, otherwise known as Okarin, who, along with a group of his fellow students, learns that he has developed a time machine that can send text messages into the past.</p>

<p>What follows is a typically Mages-esque twisty-turny mystery that incorporates the likes of CERN (yes, that CERN), as well as old-school technology and much more. It's perhaps best to play the game if you want to know just how bonkers it gets.</p>




<p>We don't yet know exactly when&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will arrive, nor do we know what platforms it will be released for. I'd say PC and PlayStation are safe bets, though, along with the Switch and whatever its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">much-vaunted successor turns out to be</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, though,&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>is available to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/412830/STEINSGATE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right now on PC</a> if you want to check it out. An enhanced version,&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Elite</em>, is also available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/819030/STEINSGATE_ELITE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4774-CUSA13222_00-STEINSGATEELITE4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/steins-gate-elite-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24281631/dragon-age-the-veilguard-early-review-ps5-xbox-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I expected to get emotional playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24220559/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-trailer-gamescom"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a><em>,</em> but I didn’t think it’d happen as early as it did. It’s been nearly 10 years since <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, and the time since has been difficult for BioWare, with the studio beset by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843096/bioware-layoffs-dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect">layoffs,</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567676/bioware-mass-effect-mac-walters-dragon-age-dreadwolf">high-profile departures</a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">poorly</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-is-the-worst-reviewed-game-in-the-franchise/">performing games</a>. This led to speculation, if not outright fear, that <em>Veilguard</em> would be the latest in a string of disappointing releases. I shared those fears. <em>Dragon Age</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-saved-my-life-1845717274">is a special franchise for me</a>, so naturally, I hoped<em> Veilguard</em> would live up to such expectations.</p><p>After 40 hours, I can’t say right now if it has. <em>Inquisition</em> became one of my most beloved games over months of digestion, new playthroughs, different choices, multiple romances, and discussions with internet acquaintances who, because of our shared love of <em>Dragon Age</em>, have become my dearest friends. <em>Veilguard</em> deserves similar consideration. But while I can’t definitively say if <em>Veilguard </em>is the RPG that I hoped it would be, I can say that within minutes of starting the game, I experienced a jolt, a spark, an unnamable <em>thing</em> that let me know that <em>Veilguard</em> has the potential to be the same kind of special <em>Inquisition</em> was. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176102/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-summer-game-fest-bioware">It all started with the character creator</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Spoilers for Dragon Age: The Veilguard below.</strong></em></p><p>My avatars in previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games never looked like they did in my imagination. <em>Dragon Age </em>has always been a franchise where your choices inform the world around you. But as a Black player, the choices I could make for my appearance have always been limited, constrained by what the game’s technology could allow or simple developer oversight. But one of <em>Veilguard</em>’s biggest improvements over its predecessors is its enhanced character creator. There’s a wealth of skin colors, hairstyles, body types, facial features, blemishes, birthmarks, tattoos, and even top-surgery scars. I enjoyed picking my way through the choices, crafting a Rook to suit my tastes.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>This is the first time in a</em> Dragon Age<em> game where I can make a character that actually looks like me. I’m astounded.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: BioWare</cite></p></div><p>In <em>Veilguard</em>, Rook isn’t your name but your title, given when you were recruited to track down Solas, a companion from the previous game who was an elven god in disguise. Rook must thwart his plans of tearing down the magical barrier that separates the material world from the magical one. But when Rook and their team do manage to stop him, they unleash worse monsters. Now, Rook and Solas must work together to stop a pair of corrupted gods and their plans to destroy the world.</p><p>None of the <em>Dragon Age</em> games are direct sequels to one another. Each game only vaguely alludes to the events of the previous one, and sometimes major characters return as minor cameos. Both<em> Inquisition</em> and <em>Veilguard</em> use returning protagonists as a way to establish connection and to add drama for longtime fans. Like <em>Inquisition</em>, <em>Veilguard</em>&nbsp;offers the opportunity to customize a second character who you won’t control but will have an impact on the story — the Inquisitor, the main character from the previous game — and creating her knocked the breath out of me. I felt the same spark of recognition one gets from seeing an old friend after a long absence. Even though this person doesn’t exist, I knew this woman. She was the character who got me through some of my darkest days. It sounds so silly, but it meant so much to see my Inquisitor as I always envisioned her, to finally have reality match my imagination.</p><p>The leap in technology from <em>Inquisition</em> to <em>Veilguard</em> is noticeable beyond the character creator. Companions and environments are arresting in their design such that I couldn’t stop gawking. Lace Harding, one of your companions, is so dang pretty, a goodly portion of my screencaps are just of her — and I was tickled to see the game reward my obsession. The first big choice in <em>Veilguard</em> is who to take with you on a dangerous mission to stop a magical ritual. Because I chose Harding, she became grievously injured, with her face covered in bruises. But later, as I continuously visited her as a part of my “squeeze every bit of fun dialogue out of my companions” routine, I noticed that her bruises progressively got better. I could see not only a neat visual representation of the passage of time — something I’ve never seen in a <em>Dragon Age</em> before — but also the progression of our relationship. It felt like I was really checking up on her like I would a real friend. As her bruises healed, our relationship deepened.&nbsp;</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</p><div><figcaption><em>Harding’s bruises heal over time, and also she’s just indescribably beautiful.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: BioWare</cite></p></div></div><p>Locations are richly designed such that they feel like characters in their own right. Arlathan Forest, the game’s first big quest zone, is distractingly gorgeous. Someone on the environment team is very obviously a fan of Alex Garland’s <em>Annihilation</em> because the forest literally shimmers with colorful films of magic and is dotted with the bodies of tree people frozen in time. Because Treviso is under occupation by one of Veilguard’s enemy forces, its citizens are destitute, and the streets are littered with beggar bowls that I always drop a few coins in no matter what.</p><p>With the help of my companions, I really got to know those areas. Neve, my detective companion, took me on a tour of Dock Town, introducing me to her contacts and friends. Lucanis, my assassin companion, did the same for his hometown of Treviso. The game artfully made those places as dear to me as my companions were, to devastating effect.&nbsp;</p><p>I won’t spoil what happens directly, but just know that when the decision wheel popped, I groaned and giggled at the same time. Making impossible choices that have disastrous consequences is what <em>Dragon Age</em> is all about. It’s why I play. I won’t tell you what I chose, only that it hurt to decide, and it felt so good, so ironically comforting that, once again, a choice in a BioWare game caused me pain.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Your roster of companions features quite a few more mages than in previous games.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>In previous <em>Dragon Age</em> games, these decisions usually only resulted in personal consequences that weren’t all that substantial — damaged reputation here or a different type of enemy there. <em>Veilguard</em> is the first time my choice felt consequential to my character, to the world around her, and to me as a player.</p><p>At the start of my time with <em>Veilguard</em>, I was so worried that I wasn’t going to feel what I felt playing <em>Inquisition</em>. I was dazzled by all the pretty, and happy to get to explore all the new locations. But it took getting to that second big decision before the game really clicked.&nbsp;</p><p>These first 40 hours with <em>Veilguard</em> were a slow burn, and I liked the change of pace. Unlike the other games with big, explosive beginnings — literally, in <em>Inquisition</em>’s case — <em>Veilguard</em> took the time to build a world around me before shattering it just as I was getting comfortable. Now, the game <em>really</em> starts.</p><p><small>Dragon Age: The Veilguard <em>launches on October 31st on Xbox, PS5, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, one genre that you might not immediately think of as a hotbed of good scares is role-playing games. You’d be wrong, though. RPGs of all types have some of the best horror stories in the medium, thanks to the focus on expansive worlds and player freedom that can easily be twisted into a scary situation of your own making. If you’re a fan of thrills as well as lengthy games you can really sink your teeth into, then these seven terrifying RPGs are the perfect treat for Halloween.</p></div><div><p>We all saw this coming. The 2004 vampire RPG basically has the market cornered on horror RPGs even two decades after its release. But there’s good reason for that! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wit-and-charm-are-powerful-weapons-in-vampire-the-masq-1835701842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wit-and-charm-are-powerful-weapons-in-vampire-the-masq-1835701842"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em></a></span> drops you into an incredibly realized world of vampire politics that you get to involve yourself in and change through a slew of wonderful combat and dialogue systems. It’s a great RPG but it’s also deeply rooted in the compelling vampire world it’s set in, so you really can’t do better than this.</p></div><div><p>While <em>The Witcher 3</em> is already a gritty and dark fairytale RPG full of monsters, its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-the-kotaku-review-1779646150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-the-kotaku-review-1779646150"><em>Blood and Wine</em></a></span> expansion might be an even better pick for Halloween. Sure, the brown and gray color palette gets a Technicolor update, but that’s just to make all the blood look even more vibrant. <em>Blood and Wine</em> is a vampire story that builds on the solid systems and characters of the base game. You don’t even have to play <em>The Witcher 3</em> first, as you can start <em>Blood and Wine</em> right from the menu.</p></div><div><p>The best parts of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928"><em>Pathologic 2</em></a></span> only show themselves once you die. The horror RPG is all about managing your resources to stay alive. You need to eat, drink, rest, and heal constantly, on top of managing your reputation across the game’s many towns. But once you do die, a weird meta encounter informs you that the world has gotten worse and so have you. What was already a strange and dangerous world becomes exponentially so through debuffs like less health or more unconventional things such as losing the ability to hug characters. The more you die, the more things change, and there is always a little bit of a pull on your curiosity to find out how bad things can really get.</p></div><div><p>Square Enix’s cult classic answer to <em>Resident Evil </em>will always deserve more attention than it gets. As you’d expect from the makers of <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/parasite-eve-had-more-in-common-with-final-fantasy-than-1788134625&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/parasite-eve-had-more-in-common-with-final-fantasy-than-1788134625"><em>Parasite Eve</em></a></span> added RPG elements to the survival horror genre to great success. You play as Aya Brea, a rookie NYPD cop who, over the course of a lonely week in late December, works to save the city from a mitochondrial outbreak that threatens to destroy the world. It’s pulpy, it’s scary, it’s fun, and it’s worth playing if only for seeing the jaw-dropping opening cinematic.</p></div><div><p>For my money, no game has done gothic horror better than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854"><em>Bloodborne</em></a></span>. The city of Yharnam, with its constant sense of dread that bears down on you as you explore its cobblestone streets and gothic structures, has one of the most imposing atmospheres in any game ever. Sure, there’s still the tough-as-nails combat and constant retreading of territory we know from the <em>Souls </em>games—this is still FromSoftware—but rather than dark fantasy, <em>Bloodborne </em>evokes true horror. That happens both in the grotesque monster designs you encounter during its difficult fights but also in its story of cosmic dread and humanity’s overambition.</p></div><div><p>Cosmic horror will—for better and worse—always be synonymous with H.P. Lovecraft. One of the author’s most famous creations, Cthulhu, has even spawned a fantastic tabletop RPG, on which the video game <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> is based.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> brings the iconic FPS franchise back to the forefront, offering players a brand new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-mission-list-every-campaign-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Campaign</a>, Multiplayer, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a> mode to enjoy.</p>



<p>Treyarch has focused on bringing Call of Duty back to its roots, which has enticed both veteran and new players. With a traditional <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-system-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige system</a>, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/">arsenal of weapons</a> to unlock, and a variety of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps and modes</a> to enjoy, players have been flocking to Multiplayer. Those who love the round-based format of Zombies have been satisfied too, while story enjoyers are getting their fix through the Campaign.</p>



<p>That said, how many are actually paying Black Ops 6 and what does the player count look like? Here’s everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-players-are-in-black-ops-6">How many players are in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there are <strong>no official stats for the Black Ops 6 player count</strong>, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, there are <strong>143,030 current Steam OC players on Call of Duty </strong>as of October 28, 2024. </p>



<p>The 24 hour peak sits at <strong>306,460</strong> players, but keep in mind this is only the player count for Steam on PC, so if you take console into account too, the figure is likely much higher than this. Call of Duty is extremely popular on Xbox and PlayStation, and so those platforms likely make up a large portion of the player count which isn’t available to the public.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to SteamDB.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Call of Duty HQ app also includes players on COD games such as MW3, MW2, and Warzone. It even takes those playing the Campaign and Zombies into account, so it’s not an accurate number for those playing the Multiplayer.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is also the first Call of Duty title to release on the Game Pass for both PC and Xbox consoles. Because of this, there a likely a lot of PC players enjoying BO6 via the Game Pass, and the SteamDB numbers don’t track that platform. Thanks to the Game Pass release, successful beta period, and hype prior to release, we expect Black Ops 6’s number to be very healthy, pointing to a successful launch.</p>



<p>There also haven’t been many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-black-ops-6-servers-down-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">server issues</a> or major bugs, so players have been able to grind. Once we know official numbers we’l be sure to update this piece with all the information. However, Call of Duty haven’t released official player count stats for some time now, so it’s unclear whether we will get any insight.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review.1021077/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">As I excitedly slashed, blasted, wooed, looted, and delved my way through the stunning and enthralling world of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, I kept having one thought: "Wait, <em>BioWare</em> made this? 2024 BioWare?” With this game coming in the wake of the debacle that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">Anthem</a>, itself preceded by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>, which were both merely alright in hindsight, I wasn't sure these former masters of the roleplaying game craft could make a game like this anymore. But putting together my team of interesting and endearing companions to save the world felt like getting the old band back together, in more ways than one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The scope of this adventure is the whole North of Thedas, sending you from the coasts of Rivain to the blighted wilds of the Anderfels as you attempt to prevent the rise of an ancient and menacing evil. It was thrilling as a long-time fan of the series to finally see so many of the places I'd only read about in a journal entry way back in 2009. And the way BioWare has us go about that exploration is very focused and deliberate.</p><div id="how-do-you-rank-dragon-ages-companion-characters" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">How Do You Rank Dragon Age's Companion Characters?</h3><h3>How Do You Rank Dragon Age's Companion Characters?</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Veilguard’s level design was one of the first things that jumped out at me, reminding me of the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/07/15/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-review-2">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> more than anything. The slick, looping corridors with just enough little nooks to discover are cleverly interconnected in a way that proves how a BioWare-style RPG gains a lot and loses almost nothing by ditching the idea of a fully open world. (The exceptions to that are a couple of the more vertical sections of the city of Minrathous, which can be a pain in the ass to navigate.) Across the board, the environment art is really jaw-dropping, from the desolate peaks of Kal-Sharok to the surreal, floating elven ruins in Arlathan Forest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was very pleased with the character designs, too. The armor and outfits are fabulous. I spent more than an hour in the character creator, like I usually do, and came out with a version of our protagonist, Rook, who delighted me every time she was in frame. This might be some of the best-looking hair I've ever seen in a video game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Veilguard's combat is a refinement of what we saw in Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with all of that visual splendor I was able to get a stable 60 fps at 4k on my RTX 4070 Super with DLSS set to maximum performance, which usually didn't affect the visual quality in very noticeable ways. The one exception to this was in the late game, when there could be so many spell effects going off at once that I’d not only lose frames, it's also difficult to even see what's actually going on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through the crackle and sparks, though, Veilguard's combat is definitely a refinement of what we saw in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/08/dragon-age-ii-review">Dragon Age 2</a> and Inquisition. I’ve always preferred the more tactical style of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/11/04/dragon-age-origins-review">Dragon Age: Origins</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, but that ship sailed so long ago for this studio, not even the Evanuris remember what it looked like. And so, judging this very action-focused combat system for what it is, it's pretty good! BioWare has committed fully to the fast-paced style and refined it to a point that I enjoy it quite a bit. And the ability to pause to issue party members orders, just like in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review-part-1-mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, still gives some opportunity for more tactical players like myself to look around the battlefield and consider our next move. It definitely feels better on a controller than mouse and keyboard, though. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was somewhat disappointed that party members are more like extensions of your own character in combat at this point rather than their own entities. They don't even have health bars, for instance. They can't be knocked out in combat, whereas you instantly lose an encounter if Rook goes down. They do have equipment slots and skill trees, though less than what Rook gets. But overall, the amount of customization available for the whole squad through piles and piles of interesting, upgradeable loot was more than enough to satisfy my RPG appetites, if not fulfill my wildest fantasies of intricate battle management.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my 100-hour near-100 percent, almost obsessively completionist playthrough, I styled Rook as a Spellblade – a mid-ranged melee hybrid mage – and really enjoyed the play style once I'd unlocked all of my core tools. Dancing with a dagger through a lightning storm I summoned, darting out of danger and then back in for a lethal blow, is just a really good time that rewards precise timing and wise target prioritization. This isn't the tactical Dragon Age of my youth, but it is a Dragon Age I can vibe with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the highlights of combat are definitely the boss fights, which offer a really satisfying challenge even on the default difficulty. While standard mob fights with Darkspawn or Venatori cultists eventually got a little repetitive after 90-plus hours, going up against a High Dragon never failed to get my blood pumping as I had to carefully study attack patterns and think on my feet.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Your whole squad is made up of complex, memorable, and likable companions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In the sense that a BioWare RPG is really about your companions, also known as the friends we made along the way, this might be the most BioWare game of all time. Not only is the whole squad made up of complex, memorable, likable, distinct personalities from across Thedas, but they're all treated as the stars of their own story. Veilguard is light on that classic kind of side quest that’s like, "Help Bingo Bongo find some nug grease," and I don’t miss those much because they’ve been replaced by full-length heroic arcs for each companion, with twists, turns, a personal nemesis, major character developments, and a moment of triumph fit for a protagonist rather than a sidekick. It's like the writers took the loyalty missions from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review-mass-effect-2-review">Mass Effect 2</a> and blew them up into seven miniature games of their own. Almost every side mission ties into one of these, which obliterates the sense that you’re doing busywork.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking a favorite of the seven Veilguard members to talk about genuinely feels like an impossible task. I really want to say all of them are my favorite. But I had a rewarding romance with the stoic Grey Warden, Davrin, and became the mother to his fledgeling griffon pal, Assan, so he’s got to be my pick for this playthrough. Seriously, if anything ever happens to that little guy, I will wash Thedas away in a tide of fire. The Vincent Price-inspired gentleman necromancer Emmerich is also a delightful twist on the usual edgy goth death mage tropes. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And while we've been asked by the devs not to spoil specifically who I'm talking about here, as a non-binary person myself, Veilguard includes some of the most authentic representation of coming to terms with gender stuff – and having to navigate your family's reaction to it – I've seen yet in a game. It doesn't feel like an after school special or like I'm being pandered to. It's quite well-handled, and finding out that the writer for this character is non-binary themselves did not surprise me at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The larger plot that’s threatening the world in the background as we’re doing all of these more personal quests is nothing particularly outstanding in its overall structure. We need to unite some factions to fight some evil gods who are trying to do bad things with tentacles. The major wrinkle that makes that interesting, however, is Solas – also known as the Dread Wolf, elven god of lies and rebellion – waiting in the wings, keeping me guessing about whether he was a friend or foe.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This story feels like both a send-off and a soft reboot, in a way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As a continuation of the Dragon Age series, Veilguard does feel a little disconnected from where we left off a decade ago. If you were expecting decisions from previous games in the series to carry over, I’m sorry to say they've never mattered less. You only get to import three choices, one of which only comes up in the context of a single letter you may or may not find and read. You do get to recreate your Inquisitor from Dragon Age: Inquisition, the same way Inquisition let you recreate your Hawke if you played Dragon Age 2. And the Inquisitor ends up being a fairly important character, which was cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But things like who you chose to make head of the Chantry at the end of Inquisition never come up. There's no sign of the Warden from Origins, even though you visit the stronghold of their order. Hawke gets only a passing mention. There are some other cameos from both Origins and Dragon Age 2, but those characters conspicuously don't reference any important choices you may have made in their presence. This story feels like both a send-off and a soft reboot, in a way, which was paradoxically a bit refreshing and disappointing at the same time.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 CRPGs</h3><p>The best CRPGs to play in 2024</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The pacing early on is kind of weird, too, and I felt like I could practically smell the rewrites. For example, it’s hilarious that no one ever says the word "Veilguard" out loud across the 100 hours I played of this dialogue-packed campaign, exposing a last-minute marketing pivot for what it was. But it doesn’t take too long for things to get on a good track, story-wise, and when they do, they stay on it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The sacrifices I had to make in the closing hours hurt. The wise decisions I made paid off. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from one huge choice you'll make early on, the most interesting bits of narrative design don't come until the very end of Veilguard’s story. And again, it's hard to dig into this too much without spoiling something, but the finale is also very much in the spirit of Mass Effect 2, which has an ending that, up until now, may have been the best series of complex consequential choices ever featured in an RPG. The sacrifices I had to make in the closing hours hurt. The wise decisions I made paid off. And I even got the chance to dramatically flick an ace out of my sleeve at the last moment, specifically because I took a very thorough and careful approach to everything leading up to it. That felt like the ultimate reward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout all of that, the cinematic flair is off the charts, proving that BioWare is unmatched in the RPG world in that discipline. So much of the best stuff I can't even tell you about, but parts of it felt like watching a big-budget fantasy movie in the best ways. A triumphant and effective – if not quite iconic – score elevates these moments further.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-to-let-animal-crossing-pocket-camp-players-keep-playing-after-servers-shut-off-for-a-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A more expensive camp site.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-is-shutting-down-its-animal-crossing-mobile-game-but-its-working-on-a-paid-offline-version-to-replace-it">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is shutting down</a>, as Nintendo announced back in August. But this weekend, it revealed the paid offline version that will be replacing it. It's called Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete, it's basically the same as Pocket Camp without the microtransactions, and it will set players back either $10 or $20 depending on when they purchase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBwJdX8fnfQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a video</a>, Nintendo outlined how Animal Crossing Pocket Camp Complete data transfer and features will work compared to the original Pocket Camp. Transferring data from one game to another is fairly easy, and just requires linking your Nintendo Account with Pocket Camp and then linking that same account with Pocket Camp Complete.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Pocket_camp (@Pocket_Camp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pocket_Camp/status/1850704831616635292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Doing this will move almost all important player data from one game to the other, including level, Bells, friendship levels, inventory and warehouse items, layouts of the campsite, cabin, and camper, and current and saved outfits. Keep in mind that this will only work until Pocket Camp shuts down on November 29 - after that, you can't link accounts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that Pocket Camp Complete largely is just Pocket Camp without the microtransactions. It's missing features tied to payment, like Leaf Tickets and the Pocket Camp Club, but those are being replaced with baked-in versions of the same thing. Pocket Camp Club's features are largely just a part of the game now, and Leaf Tickets are being replaced with Leaf Tokens obtained from completing goals or exchanging Bells that can be used to buy furniture or shorten craft time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Pocket Camp Complete is not an online game, the online friend features will also be disappearing, but they're being replaced with a QR code sharing system that will allow you to invite friends to a new area called Whistle Pass, where you can receive gifts from them and enjoy a daily K.K. Slider concert together. You'll also be able to transfer all your old friends from Pocket Camp with the rest of your data, provided those friends also log into the game before it shuts down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, regular seasonal events will continue to happen as before, with some new ones added for Pocket Camp Complete. This means the game will have new items in it all the way until September of 2025, and there will be paths to collect missed seasonal items and complete collections without waiting for that specific event to roll around again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That all sounds pretty great: it's basically Pocket Camp without the online features and the microtransactions, taking some of the sting out of the game's shuttering. The one downside is the up-front cost. Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete costs $9.99 as a one-and-done charge to own the game, which isn't too bad on its own. But if you wait until January 31, 2025 or later to join the game, that price doubles to $19.99. So if you're thinking of starting Pocket Camp for the first time or transferring your data, better do it soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete launches for iOS and Android on December 3, 2024, just a few days after Pocket Camp shuts down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p dir="ltr">Once linked, Nintendo stated in a press release that purchasing the new app will let people "retain access to a majority of the items and events that have been a part of the game for the past seven years." The special $10 introductory price will be doubled after January 30, 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">In August, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-ending-support-for-animal-crossing-pocket-camp-will-release-offline-only-version/1100-6526041/" data-ref-id="1100-6526041">Nintendo announced support for Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp would end</a> on November 28. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-animal-crossing-game-is-out-now-earlier-th/1100-6455122/" data-ref-id="1100-6455122">The mobile game launched in November 2017</a> and required an internet connection to play. While free to play, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-now-has-a-subscription/1100-6471662/" data-ref-id="1100-6471662">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp introduced monthly subscriptions</a> in 2019 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-animal-crossing-pocket-camp-subscription-increases-monthly-cost-to-12-for-all-access/1100-6500033/" data-ref-id="1100-6500033">even increased one tier to $12 each month in 2022</a>. None of those will be a part of the new app.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, one new addition for Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete is Whistle Pass. This location is where players can meet up to catch musical performances. Another feature exclusive to the new app is Camper Cards: tradeable via QR codes and containing info like a player's favorite neighbor.</p><p dir="ltr">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete sees players becoming a campground manager. Like the mainline series, the app has people befriending animal buddies, fishing, and hunting bugs. The game will be available for Android and Apple iOS devices.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-love-these-oddly-specific-cleaning-products.1021044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/industrial-cleaning-kimwipes-tergazyme-fast-orange-thymol-lens-pen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to cleaning, I don’t like to overpay for watered-down chemicals. That’s why I tend to prefer cleaning products that I can buy in as concentrated a form as possible, preferably in bulk. Often, these products are aimed squarely at professionals, who tend not to tolerate the weak stuff. So, as the “product guy” for Aftermath, I have compiled a list of hyper-niche cleaning products that, if not useful, are at least interesting.</p><p>Note: I am not a chemist, I am just a guy with a lot of hobbies who loves researching and reading forums. If you decide to buy any of these products, please follow the manufacturer’s instructions and guidelines. Aftermath does not endorse the misuse of any of these products.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Zinc Ricinoleate/DeoConcentrate/Trader Joe’s Natural Deodorant – The Odor Destroyer</strong></p><figure><figcaption>This stuff is so good. Making Cosmetics also sells a bunch of supplies if you wanna formulate skincare products yourself.  Credit: Making Cosmetics.</figcaption></figure><p>A few decades ago I started getting contact dermatitis while using deodorants and was forced into the world of “natural” alternatives. This was a mixed blessing. On the one hand, antiperspirants are awful for your clothing,&nbsp; oftentimes leaving horrible yellow stains and reducing the life of your garments. The flip side is that most natural deodorants at the time sucked, were wildly overpriced, and were based on baking soda.&nbsp;</p><p>Baking soda is not a good ingredient to use in deodorant. It can mess with the pH of your skin, cause a lot of irritation, and generally doesn’t do a great job at suppressing body odor. Eventually, many of the good natural deodorant brands moved over to using magnesium hydroxide, which is also the active ingredient of the laxative milk of magnesia. It works pretty well, doesn’t mess with your skin, and you can buy a kilo of it for about 20 bucks online if you decide to get into making DIY deodorant. Making your own deodorant is much cheaper than paying 10 dollars a stick, and you can buy empty containers in bulk online. This is what I ended up doing.&nbsp;</p><p>This line of research led me to one <a href="https://aftermath.site/best-active-forums-internet-today" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cosmetic chemistry forum</a> and a substance called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_ricinoleate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zinc ricinoleate</a>. It’s a fatty acid that comes from castor oil and will demolish any foul odor like magic, although it isn’t as widely used in deodorant as magnesium hydroxide. Zinc ricinoleate is pretty benign according to its <a href="https://www.makingcosmetics.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-makingcosmetics-master/default/dwc2c8dfbe/msds/sds-zinc-ricinoleate.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SDS sheet</a>, seemingly well-tolerated and is usually sold in the form of little yellow pellets that melt together with other fats if you are making a stick deodorant. As with anything involving hygiene products, always be cautious about how your skin reacts.</p><p>MakingCosmetics also sells a liquified variant of it called DeoConcentrate that is a viscous yellow fluid. It’s concentrated and can be used as an ingredient in a DIY room spray that will exorcize any foul odor like a demon. It’s very handy if you want to make a Febreze alternative that does not smell awful (although the actual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-Cyclodextrin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemical in Febreze is fascinating unto itself</a>). MakingCosmetics also has recipes for <a href="https://www.makingcosmetics.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-makingcosmetics-master/default/dw373d30b4/sample-recipes/recipe-zinc-ricinoleate.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solid</a> and <a href="https://www.makingcosmetics.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-makingcosmetics-master/default/dw1b54f973/sample-recipes/recipe-zinc-ricinoleate-sodium-lauroyl-sarcosinate.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roll-on deodorants</a> as well as <a href="https://www.makingcosmetics.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-makingcosmetics-master/default/dw07ef4970/sample-recipes/recipe-zinc-ricinoleate-household.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">room sprays</a> on their site. It should be noted that zinc ricinoleate is not a sanitizer, so I would not rely on it as a cleaner, and it should be mixed with some kind of preservative.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>This is the only affordable, scentless, deodorant that works outside of making your own. Credit: Trader Joes.</figcaption></figure><p>After I figured all this out I discovered that Trader Joe’s of all places sells a comparatively inexpensive, unscented magnesium hydroxide and <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/unscented-deodorant-075508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zinc ricinoleate-based natural deodorant that kicks ass</a>. It’s like 5 bucks and comes in a green paper tube that uses less plastic than other brands. It’s the exact thing I was looking for. My long nightmare is over, though if they ever discontinue it I am going to get so mad.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tergazyme and other enzyme cleaners – don’t fear the zyme.</strong></p><figure><figcaption>This is the stuff they use to clean blood out of glass in labs. Probably overkill for home use, but I can tell you for a fact that it works. Credit: Alconox Inc.</figcaption></figure><p>Enzyme-based cleaners are fantastic for breaking down biological material. There are a bunch available for home use – for example I’ve used <a href="https://summitbrands.com/product/zout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zout</a> before for spot cleaning stains, and I hear that <a href="https://psdetailproducts.com/products/terminator-spot-and-stain-remover-doubleblack-collection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">P&amp;S Terminator</a> is solid. <a href="https://biokleenhome.com/bac-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Biokleen Bac-Out</a> is well loved for cleaning up animal messes, as is <a href="https://www.naturesmiracle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature’s Miracle</a>. Amazon sells its own band of bulk enzymatic cleaners as well.&nbsp;</p><p>In a professional setting, Tergazyme is a concentrated enzymatic medical detergent that is primarily used in hospitals, tattoo shops and lab settings. This stuff is the best if you need to clean soil, tissue, blood or bodily fluids from metals, plastic, ceramic, rubber, fiberglass or porcelain. You can get 1.8 kilos of it for 40 dollars. It requires 10 grams per liter of solution, which means it lasts most people a very long time. While it is technically not meant to be used on clothing, I have used it on synthetics, cleaning the surface of a pair of nylon boots to the point where they looked brand new.</p><p>I read one review that praised it for its cleaning power when removing smoke damage from a chandelier, and have seen multiple reports of it destroying cat pee. In general, I would stick to what the manufacturer Alconox recommends. It is apparently extra useful when combined with an ultrasonic cleaner. It should also be noted that Tergazyme contains phosphates, which is an ecological concern for its <a href="https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-dead-zones-and-harmful-algal-blooms#:~:text=Excess%20nitrogen%20and%20phosphorus%20cause,in%20the%20water%20is%20consumed." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact on algae blooms</a>. If you do use it, be mindful of that. Alternatively, the manufacturer Alconox <a href="https://technotes.alconox.com/detergents/liquinox/eliminating-potential-phosphates-rinse-water-contributing-water-based-algae-toxins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sells phosphate-free alternatives</a> for that reason.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Star San, PBW – That stuff I used to use for homebrewing</strong></p><figure><figcaption>The stuff I used to use when I brewed. Don't have a reason to use it, but it was fun at the time. Credit: Five Star Chemicals.</figcaption></figure><p>Back in the late 2000s to early 2010s I did a lot of all-.grain beer brewing, as was the style at the time. This involved a lot of work, bulky equipment and obscene amounts of cleaning. Generally speaking, brewing was not cheaper than buying beer once I factored in the crap I had to buy and store in my living space, as well as the general cost and danger of having a kegerator in the living room of an apartment I shared with two other guys. That said, brewing is one of those hobbies like growing weed where you end up learning about a lot of things tangentially related to it. This is how I learned about <a href="https://fivestarchemicals.com/star-san" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star San</a> by the company Five Star Chemicals.&nbsp;</p><p>Star San is an acid-based contact sanitizer used for brewing equipment. It comes in a bottle with a measuring chamber built into it. Star San is tremendously concentrated and foams a whole lot. The excessive foam serves a purpose, as it helps sanitize hard to reach places in your equipment. In a homebrewing context, it is often used to sanitize a carboy, which is a big five gallon glass jug you put your unfermented beer (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wort</a>) into.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="SANITIZING HOMEBREW EQUIPMENT" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2EAodH5Qj40?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>An additional quality that makes Star San a go-to for brewers is that the foam is no-rinse, meaning you can just dump your wort directly on to the foam and it’ll be fine and is in fact good for the yeast. This led to the idiom “don’t fear the foam” in homebrewing circles. For people who are paranoid about putting their meticulously crafted beer on what appears to be soap foam (these people are cowards) BTF Iodophor Is also used by breweries for similar reasons. Five Star Chemicals also makes S<a href="https://fivestarchemicals.com/saniclean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aniclean</a> if you want a product with less foam for whatever reason. Both products contain phosphoric acid, which is less of an issue if you are pouring your young beer directly on to it for the yeast to eat. Five Star also makes PBW, which I remember liking, although I hear people often just use OxiClean now instead. I haven’t used Star San in over a decade and would probably not use it for anything except brewing, but I remember its sudsy, giant foam bubbles fondly, as it always radically simplified homebrewing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Atsko Sports Wash – Detergent from a hunting company&nbsp;</strong></p><figure><figcaption>This stuff is concentrated and not too pricey so I just use it for practically everything now. Credit: Atsko, Inc.</figcaption></figure><p>I have an unconditional love of any product that looks like it was designed by an eccentric uncle. Dr. Bronner’s has made an empire on its label. <a href="https://www.odoban.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Odoban</a>, the odor eliminator that they sell in gallon concentrates by the checkout at Home Depot,&nbsp; also specializes in <a href="https://lethalproducts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hunting equipment chemicals</a>. (That brand, Lethal Products, also has a YouTube channel which is now where they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lethalproducts/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just upload hunting videos</a>). <a href="https://www.atsko.com/sport-wash-laundry-detergent-2-quart-64-wash-loads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atsko Sports Wash</a> is a similar product from a similar company. It is a scentless detergent without optical brighteners or fragrances that is concentrated and less expensive than similar technical washes. Its lack of brighteners and scents is because Atsko makes a lot of hunting-related gear, and so additives are a going concern (they have a section of their website dedicated to <a href="https://www.atsko.com/deer-see-uv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deer seeing UV</a>). I don’t hunt but the actual wash itself is so good I have switched over to it entirely for <a href="https://www.atsko.com/care-of-performance-fabrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cleaning synthetics and performance fabrics</a>, which I have a whole lot of.

Credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Thymolum_by_Danny_S._-_001.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Danny S. via Wikimedia Commons</a>, Benefect</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this year a pipe burst upstairs and mold started growing in the wall. This led to a massive dip in the quality of my air and life as I tried to get my landlord to fix it for several months. The months of mold exposure also lead to a general descent into stress-based internet research. Exposure to mold can really mess your life up for a while but worrying about mold can sometimes make matters way worse.&nbsp;</p><p>This is part of the reason why there are two different subreddits on the topic of mold: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r/mold</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicMoldExposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r/toxicmoldexposure</a>. The former does not allow the topic of health outcomes to be discussed there, while the latter frequently descends into paranoia like Julianne Moore in the movie <em>Safe</em>. If you want strangers to recommend you throw out every couch, rug and porous object you own after having mold, go here. While my mold issue is now mostly fixed, I did end up doing extensive research into what mold remediation companies use in cleanup. A lot of them are nasty chemicals like <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media_file/2020-08/Peroxyacetic-Acid.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peroxyacetic Acid</a>. Do not use this chemical. It works like hydrogen peroxide on steroids, and can be super dangerous. A guy I met who cultivated yeast strains for pharmaceutical companies told me it can destroy your sense of smell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The most interesting one is Thymol. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thymol</a> is a constituent of oil of thyme which is claimed to be <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/reregistration/fs_PC-080402_1-Sep-93.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fungicide, pesticide and disinfectant</a>. Unlike bleach or nasty contact cleaners, <a href="https://benefect.com/ca/products/decon-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thymol-based</a> ones claim to have a safe profile. <a href="https://scientificbeekeeping.com/thymol-a-new-application-method-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beekeepers use thymol</a> as a miticide for controlling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varroa_destructor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">varroa mites</a>. The most common thymol-based solution I found fungus remediators using is called Decon 30, but if you look at the ingredients you’re mainly looking at a tiny amount of thymol as the active ingredient, <a href="https://benefect.com/pdf/decon-30-product-sheet-usa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mainly derived from essential oils</a>. Benefect, the company that makes it, claims it is less dangerous than vinegar. They also sell big containers of thymol crystals online, although I ultimately did not do that, I just bought thyme essential oil and added it to surface sprays. I have not done a scientific analysis of its fungicidal or virucidal properties, but I find the herbal smell delightful and that’s enough for me.</p><p><strong>Cafiza and Dezcal– The stuff I use to clean my espresso machine</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Clean Equipment Makes Better Tasting Coffee!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hq8ZXv4wirA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>If you <a href="https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">own an espresso machine</a> or a Zojirushi hot water boiler, you might have spent money on a descaling solution to get all the built-up mineral deposits out of the machine. A lot of times these are overpriced. In the coffee world, <a href="https://urnex.com/cafiza-powder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cafiza </a>and <a href="https://urnex.com/dezcal-descaling-powder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dezcal </a>by the company Urnex are often the go-to for cleaning and descaling coffee equipment respectively. Cafiza is a backflush detergent and is great for getting the oil and gunk out of a portafilter. Dezcal is for descaling most commercial machines (although some home coffee makers are apparently different). People also seem to like Cafiza for cleaning wine glasses out.

For the purpose of defeating limescale, I have used <a href="https://www.durgol.com/global_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Durgol</a> which is also well liked.

Having a bunch of OxiClean (generic or not), vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, and citric acid in your house for cleaning is handy. All of these are so tremendously cheap and obvious that they don’t break the bank. Isopropyl alcohol is also handy to have around, but your mileage may vary there and I'm trying to avoid recommending readers to order flammable liquids in bulk here. Bar Keepers Friend (oxalic acid) is invaluable for cleaning metal; I have also used it to <a href="https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/stainless-passivation.500621/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passivate stainless steel</a> during my brewing days. In addition to this, I also keep a gallon container of Dr Bronner’s in my house and a heavy duty but fairly green cleaner/degreaser like Simple Green, although I hear Purple Power does the job too.</p><p><strong>WHOOSH! – the glass cleaner that the Apple Store (supposedly) uses</strong></p><figure><figcaption>Tim Cook, I know your secret.

As with most things involving device screens, follow the instructions and never spray it directly onto your screen. I learned that the hard way with a laptop when I was in college.</p><p><strong>Kimwipes – very delicate wipers that are used in labs</strong></p><figure><figcaption>The favored product of lab techs everywhere.

Kimwipes are lint-free antistatic wipes that are as delicate as you can possibly get.

I have a few kicking around because I own about 30 or so vintage film cameras. If you have a big fingerprint on your lens, a lens pen will erase it in about 10 seconds without damaging the lens surface. It also comes with a tiny, soft bristle brush on the other end for brushing away dirt. Cleaning lenses sucks a whole lot, and this simplifies the entire process by a whole lot.

			<p>Too many video games based on popular children’s properties boil down to nothing more than cynical cash-ins, seeking to rob kids of their enthusiasm for their favourite toys and parents of their hard-earned cash. Hot Wheels Monster Trucks: Stunt Mayhem is not that type of kid’s game. Instead, this is an impeccably crafted release, one that will bring immense joy to the thousands of Hot Wheels Monster Truck’s mini fans out there.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hot Wheels Monster Trucks: Stunt Mayhem™ - Launch Trailer (PEGI)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1d-2yLOWAQo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Imagine Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater but with Monster Trucks, and you’ve pretty much envisaged Stunt Mayhem. Your truck – or let’s be honest, your 8-year-old’s truck – races around an enclosed arena performing over-the-top stunts in pursuit of points. Gathering high enough scores will see you accumulate a vast fan-base, which will in turn unlock new stages, new challenges and, perhaps most excitingly of all, new Hot Wheels Monster Trucks to smash and crash with. Unlike the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/monster-jam-showdown-review/">Monster Jam</a> video game series, there’s no races to be had here, instead it’s all about nailing outlandish stunts within a strict time-limit.</p>


<p>Environments are small but brightly coloured, endearingly cartoony, and cram-packed with detail and depth. Each is based on various landscapes you’ll find within the extended Hot Wheels toy universe. Trust me, you won’t have heard of any of them, but your kid will squeal with delight when they discover they can zoom around Camp Crush. Every arena is littered with things to leap off and obstacles to drive through, ensuring that the three-minutes spent in them is filled with chaotic destruction and engaging activity.</p>


<p>The handling for the Trucks themselves is straight-forward and incredibly accessible. They are also unbelievably manoeuvrable, capable of performing limitless spins, barrel-rolls and front-flips, providing that ramp they just leapt off gives them enough air. In short, regardless of video game experience, any kid will be able to give Stunt Mayhem a go and perform some visually spectacular and fist-pumpingly thrilling Monster Truck manoeuvres.</p>
<p>But don’t let the welcome accessibility fool you; Stunt Mayhem can still offer a decent challenge, requiring the player to return several times to each stage to complete more optional extra missions and make progress through the game. These tasks are simple enough to grasp – objectives like destroy 65% of the obstacles or pop all of the balloons are commonplace – but they encourage and reward exploration and experimentation. There are lots of, “If I leap off that ramp, hit that walkway, and flip off that caravan, can I reach that platform covered in Crush Cars?” moments to be enjoyed here. Overall, the ramping up of the difficulty level is expertly configured for younger gamers, ensuring a gradual rising curve of a challenge is offered, rather than off-putting game-quitting difficulty spikes.</p>

<p>Most importantly for Hot Wheels fans, all the top Monster Trucks are included and can be rabidly unlocked. There’s Mega-Wrex and Big Foot available from the outset, but they’ll soon be joined by Gunkster, 5-Alarm, Race Ace, and the rest. New skins can be unlocked, including glow-in-the-dark chassis, which, I have been informed by my son, are very exciting indeed.</p>
<p>Considering the overall quality of the game on offer, it’s disappointing that the player can’t drive around the epic stunts on each course. These are basically the really expensive and really big Hot Wheels toy sets – think scorpions, gorillas, and volcanoes – each covered in loop-de-loops and twisty turny tracks. They look awesome and are undoubtedly the most exciting feature of each arena, but if you drive into one, you’re just stuck with watching a cut-scene, your controller hanging limply until you are allowed to play again. A missed opportunity perhaps. Boss fights are rather dull too, offering no excitement as they are little more than a treasure hunt with more of those cut-scene stunts to watch.</p>

					<p>It would be the euphemism of the year to say that for BioWare, a lot is riding on Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The once revered maker of roleplaying games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age has stumbled severely with its last two games, Mass Effect Andromeda and Anthem.</p>
<p>The latest installment in the sci-fi franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mass-effect-andromeda-pathfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn't bad</a>, but it wasn't great, either, and it didn't sell as well as BioWare's parent company, Electronic Arts, wanted. The real catastrophe was Anthem, though. The new intellectual property was designed as a live service game that would be updated for ten years post-launch, but it ended up getting only a couple of patches before the overwhelmingly negative reception from critics and fans alike essentially halted that content roadmap. For a while, BioWare attempted to concoct a major overhaul (dubbed Anthem Next) that could resurrect Anthem, but EA ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-next-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose to abandon the project</a> and let the studio focus on its core franchises: Dragon Age and Mass Effect.</p>
<p>Anthem also had a big influence on the fourth Dragon Age game. At some point, the idea was to make another live service game with coop, and reporter Jason Schreier even <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-anthem-tech-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the developers internally referred to it as 'Anthem with dragons.' Luckily, the magnitude of Anthem's failure, combined with the success of Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, proved to Electronic Arts that single player games could still be financially successful, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-will-be-a-single-player-only-rpg-multiplayer-has-been-dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convincing</a> the publisher to allow BioWare to focus solely on the campaign and drop multiplayer altogether.</p>
<p>By mere syllogism, one could say that Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has effectively saved the beloved Canadian studio. Many fans feared a third unsuccessful game could persuade Electronic Arts to either sell BioWare or shut it down altogether, and with 2024 proving a terrible year for layoffs and studio closures, this was a concrete possibility. Of course, what Respawn's game actually did was give BioWare a chance, which they could still have squandered. I'm happy to share, though, that they did not. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a great ride that any fan of the studio's games will be able to enjoy.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rook-and-Assan-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The key part is that the developers successfully invested in their own strengths rather than trying to follow the latest trends even if they were out of their expertise. I'm referring specifically to the decision to abandon the open world-like zones of Dragon Age: Inquisition (and Mass Effect Andromeda) in favor of a more old-school approach, reminiscent of the earlier installments in those franchises. Nowadays, it's getting harder and harder to find games that do not offer open world design. Even indie developers, thanks to game-making tools like Epic's Unreal Engine, can do it relatively easily, and many publishers think of it as a definite plus for any upcoming game.</p>
<p>It must have taken BioWare a considerable amount of convincing to get EA to approve the idea, but they did it, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard is definitely better off like this. I have to admit I was skeptical at first, as I am a big advocate of open-world games in general; however, this game proved to me that there's a place for mission-based Western RPGs going forward. For one thing, it goes a long way toward ensuring the game does not overstay its welcome, as everything is more or less connected to the story and the characters.</p>
<p>It was not so in Inquisition, and content bloat is indeed an issue in many open world games save for the very best ones (and even those do have some side content that is just not on the same level as the rest, which developers are forced to add just to populate all the world). That is not to say Dragon Age: The Veilguard doesn't have relatively straightforward quests, but they are still grounded in the same narrative tissue, making them feel like part of one cohesive story.</p>
<p>Following the few initial missions, the player navigates Thedas by accessing the world map and traveling with the Eluvians, the magical mirrors made by ancient elves that allow long-distance travel. Access to the Eluvians may come and go depending on progress (you'll have to unlock some) and story (in some cases, you must head to a specific area just for one mission, and the game will unlock the Eluvian for you). Still, some options remain available for most of the game, allowing players to revisit the same zone multiple times.</p>
<p>It's a good thing, too, because there's actually a fair amount of exploration in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Make no mistake, this is no Elder Scrolls, and you won't find NPCs going on about their lives as in an open world game that simulates real life. Rather, BioWare chose the old-school approach first popularized by the Metroidvania genre: there's a ton of loot and secrets hidden behind puzzles and companion abilities, so you will have plenty of reason to return to exploration regions like the Arlathan Forest, Minrathous, Rivain, the Necropolis Halls, Treviso, the Hossberg Wetlands, and the Crossroads beyond just quests. If you want to make the most out of that exploration feeling, it might be a good idea to remove the mini-map, which is one of several tweaks allowed within the accessibility options.</p>
<p>Would I have preferred more expansive zones? Sure, but they may have come at the cost of something else. Given the quality of the final game, I'm happy with the tradeoff. By the way, prepare yourselves to open countless chests and collect innumerable resources lying around, even in the most linear missions, up to the very final one. And remember: break any box or vase you see in the environments, because they will yield resources that can be used or sold to vendors. Those elements may be a bit trite, but there's a reason they have worked for decades: they make the player feel good, and that's still true to this day. Pretty much the same happens in some of the most acclaimed games of the recent past, such as Sony Santa Monica's God of War Norse saga.</p>
<p>Overall, I finished all the missions in the game (save for two particularly challenging puzzles) in 78 and a half hours, not far at all from the 80-hour mark BioWare promised in the review guide. I would say it's almost perfect for a mission-based RPG: quite meaty but about half as long as the gargantuan Baldur's Gate 3, which perhaps will make it more replayable. Granted, if you wish to complete it quicker, you can absolutely do it - the main path is said to be around 35 to 40 hours.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DA_EA_AbilityWheel2_08b_RGB_WM-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>One of the main areas of innovation for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is in its combat system. Whereas the previous titles featured a larger party of four companions and allowed players to take direct control of the companions, this one sticks to a party of three and only lets you move around as the player character, just like in the Mass Effect series. Moreover, players have to choose three active abilities and an ultimate for their character plus three abilities per companion, whereas Inquisition featured way more selectable abilities in combat. This caused concerns among fans that the franchise's trademark tactical element would be lost or diminished.</p>
<p>However, that's not the case at all. First and foremost, as the developers had already disclosed prior to launch, several abilities have been baked into the core moveset of each class (Warrior, Mage, and Rogue) and do not count toward that same pool of abilities. For example, the Mage can side-step attacks or Fade-step for a longer dodge by double tapping the same button; they can perform a sprint attack or a jump attack with both light and heavy attack buttons; they can charge light attacks, heavy attacks, and ranged attacks by holding the respective buttons.</p>
<p>There are also different mechanics based on the weapon you're using, which can be switched at all times in combat: while the staff lets you create a defensive shield that is maintained as long as you have mana, the dagger and orb are more geared toward a melee type of character who must parry at the right time to be effective. Dagger and orb also have unique mechanics called Arcane Marks, which are applied to the enemy with light attacks; once you get to three hits, you apply an Arcane Bomb, which can be triggered with a heavy attack for heavy damage.</p>
<p>This is just the very basics. Most of these attacks and moves can be augmented through gear and talents; for example, the Greater Passive downfall turns every jump attack on knocked-down foes into a critical hit. The Trait Fade Strike lets you perform a powerful follow-up attack after Fade-stepping; Imbued Defense provides the Shocking Weapons buff (+25% weapon damage) after performing a Perfect Defense, while Return Fire lets you perform a quick counterattack after the aforementioned Perfect Defense. And this is just for the core moveset; there are as many traits and passives that work on the active abilities and other aspects of your build.</p>
<p>On that note, did I say there are also Runes? You can equip three of those at a time (though activating one sets off a shared cooldown) and they can be extremely useful depending on the situation. Examples include freezing or knocking down all nearby enemies, losing all mana to get a big heal, instantly refreshing your or your companion's ability cooldowns, greatly enhancing the efficacy of your next ability, and more. I unlocked twenty-four runes during my time with the game, and each comes with a passive and an active effect to trigger at the right time.</p>
<p>As someone whose favorite genre is RPGs (and MMORPGs), I can safely state that Dragon Age: The Veilguard offers an impressive amount of depth in its build creation. Best of all, skill points can be refunded for free whenever outside of combat, allowing users free reign to tinker around and create their favorite build synergies with a great many options at their disposal. That includes companions, by the way, who are still very important - far more than in any Mass Effect game, I'd say, when it comes to combat. While their skill trees are not as extensive, they still offer several options that players would be wise to carefully evaluate depending on their play style.&nbsp;There are so many buffs and debuffs to consider, not to mention each enemy's vulnerability and resistances, which you can check at any time in combat by pausing the action and bringing up the ability wheel. That's where you can tell each companion what to do against which target, largely preserving the core tactical element of Dragon Age.</p>
<p>It may be different on the lower difficulties, but when playing on Underdog (the second-toughest difficulty after Nightmare, which, however, locks you into that difficulty when beginning a playthrough), pausing the action to think about what to do and properly order the companions around was instrumental to say the least, especially to set up the detonation combos, which work by applying and then triggering an effect like Weakened, Sundered, or Overwhelmed on a target. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is no Dark Souls, but its encounter design is excellent and it offers a worthy challenge even to experienced action and RPG players. There are some fantastic boss fights in the game, both in terms of spectacle and mechanics, forcing you to grow your character and perhaps change your build a bit, as well as learn how to counter the boss's moves as in any great action game.</p>
<p>There is a bit of a catch in that companions do not actually take damage - they are effectively invulnerable in combat. That said, enemies do attack them from time to time, and two of them offer specific taunt abilities to get the attention off you (there's also a Rune that diverts enemies to the rest of the party for a short while). This may irk those who yearn for realistic fights, but in practice, it did not bother me at all. The game was clearly designed around this limitation (probably because they wanted to avoid the issue where they died all the time and forced the player to revive them over and over again) and I did not feel it negatively impacted Veilguard.</p>
<p>In fact, the changes made compared to Inquisition's middling combat are almost entirely for the better. Dragon Age: The Veilguard has an outstanding combat system that finds the perfect balance between action and tactics, giving it a unique identity in the RPG genre.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-solas-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>BioWare's games have always been narrative-driven, and this one is no exception. The game follows directly on the events seen in Inquisition and its Trespasser DLC with a ten-year gap (just like in real life), and it can be considered the culmination of storylines that have been in motion for a long time in the series. Dragon Age lore aficionados will find several earth-shattering revelations that answer some long-standing questions. Effectively, this game closes one chapter of the overarching world narrative, and the next installment will inevitably have to be centered around different themes and characters.</p>
<p>For this reason, those who played previous installments and know about the lore will get the most enjoyment, although it is not a barrier to newcomers. While creating the player character (the character creator is very robust, although not the most complex I've seen in a game), the game also lets you create the Inquisitor, the protagonist of the previous game, and choose how a few key events from Inquisition unfolded.</p>
<p>Having choices and consequences reverberate throughout their games has also characterized the studio's previous work, especially in Mass Effect and Dragon Age. Again, Veilguard does not disappoint in this area, either. Early on, there will be a major decision to make: the villains are attacking two cities at once, and you cannot be there for both. Each city is tied to one of the companions, and the 'forgotten' city and companion will be transformed in a way. The companion will become ineligible for some time as they deal with the fallout, and when they come back, they will be 'hardened', empowering their damage abilities while closing down their healing ones as they are now hellbent on vengeance.</p>
<p>This is an interesting system, both narratively and mechanically, so it's a shame that it does not seem to apply to the other companions as well. Other than that, you will guide the companions in their personal quests through harrowing times of acceptance and personal struggles, with companion quests ranging from relaxed hangouts to sprawling missions that lead to complex boss fights. Seeing a companion through the entire personal quest is not only fulfilling from a storyline perspective, it will also allow you to maximize the bond with them, level them up, and elevate them to Hero of the Veilguard, a status that empowers their abilities and makes them more likely to survive the final fight.</p>
<p>That's really where most of the choices and efforts made throughout the whole game come to fruition. Allowing each of the companions to solve their conflicts and each of the factions to be as strong as possible is a big factor in attaining the best possible ending, although there are some choices to make even in the final fight, such as sending the right companion to accomplish a certain task.</p>
<p>Overall, the writing in Dragon Age: The Veilguard is great, and the voiceover and tech improvements (mainly facial animations, eyes, and the amazing hair) also help a great deal with the presentation. Just do not expect to act as a villain or even just drive away companions. While in some instances a certain dialogue option led to a companion disapproving, those were so far and few between to not actually matter. This is not that kind of RPG - you're supposed to be a hero.</p>
<p>Companions can be befriended and romanced, as in most previous BioWare titles. In my experience, the romance was a slow but steady buildup, though that may depend on the character, and it's fine by itself since it felt good when it finally happened. There's practically no nudity to speak of, anyway, so if you were hoping for steamy sex scenes like in Baldur's Gate 3, you're out of luck.</p>
<p>Also, a minor criticism regarding cutscenes is that most of the time, companions do not intervene when talking to other NPCs, even when it would be entirely appropriate for them to do so (for instance, when talking with the leaders of the resistance of their city of provenance). Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield, on the other hand, featured a lot of instances where companions interjected, making conversations feel more lively and realistic. Granted, there's still a lot of great banter between companions themselves, and you won't miss on any of that just because you've suddenly entered combat - they are now smart enough to resume that talk once things have settled down.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DA_6-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs on the Frostbite engine, just like the last three games made by the studio. Much has been written on the hardships encountered by the BioWare developers as they attempted to tame an engine originally made for shooter games.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the release, the developers mentioned that they had finally learned how to best use Frostbite. That may be the case, but the performance is honestly underwhelming. I played on a PC with nearly the best combination of CPU and GPU one money can buy (an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090), and yet I had to deal with considerable stuttering throughout it all. That's even with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode (upscaling from 1080p to 4K) and DLSS Frame Generation enabled, not to mention the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-game-ready-driver-is-optimized-for-dragon-age-the-veilguard-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimized Game Ready driver installed</a>. The only way to reduce those stutters was to essentially remove ray tracing, or rather, switch to the 'RT Selective' option, which only applies ray traced reflections and ambient occlusion to specific areas of the game that best showcase the respective effects. Even so, they were not eliminated and occurred regularly.</p>
<p>Those were not shader stutters, by the way. The game compiles shaders the first time you launch it, recompiles them if you change drivers, and verifies them anyway each time before loading the menu. They had to be traversal stutters, as we're used to seeing with Unreal Engine games. However, while Dragon Age: The Veilguard looks good, it doesn't compare to the latest triple-A Unreal Engine releases. Honestly, it might be worth it for EA to allow BioWare to use Unreal Engine, just like Respawn, going forward. I also had to contend with a bug for my whole playthrough: when launching the game with HDR enabled and DLSS Frame Generation enabled, there were flickering skies until I turned off and then on again DLSS FG. On the upside, HDR was well implemented, which is unfortunately rare.</p>
<p>From a visual standpoint, the game succeeds in providing many different biomes to explore as the party treks across Northern Thedas, fulfilling BioWare's promise to bring players to more locations than ever before. The environments generally look great, while the characters are a bit more of a hit-and-miss in that some are almost photorealistic and others look more stylized. In that regard, more uniformity would have been ideal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard Review - Homecoming]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-age-veilguard-review-homecoming</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review-homecoming.1021026/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-age-veilguard-review-homecoming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After thinking about it for a while, <em>Dragon Age</em> skipping out on an entry for so long might have been the best decision EA could have made. It’s not unlike all these '90s movie sequels we're seeing coming back around after several decades – although less extreme in the case of this particular series as it’s only been ten years since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-review-age-of-dragons-has-arrived"><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em></a>.</p>

<p>I bring up this comparison because, at its core, Bioware as a developer had somewhat tapered off, and <em>Dragon Age</em> was dormant for some time following three successive releases starting in 2009. Instead of hashing out whatever they could after the third game, the team took their time in preparing something for the current generation.</p>

<p>The result is now here with <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, a fully featured single-player continuation of the <em>Dragon Age</em> world. After ten years of waiting, is it all worth it? Can Bioware restore some of the faith that waned away from fans of the studio?</p>

<p>After playing through <em>The Veilguard</em>, I’ve never been more sure that the answer to that question is a resounding “yes”.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragonageveilguard20241017221749_1.jpg?itok=WX48BQPD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragonageveilguard20241017221749_1.jpg?itok=l538cvUD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> pulls on the tried and true Bioware formula by putting you in the shoes of a character known as Rook – and as such, everything that character does over the course of the story matters.</p>

<p>From dialogue, to quests, and character interactions – it’s all woven into the ultimate outcome of the story. So much so, that I was almost taken aback by how quickly the game gets you right into the thick of it.</p>

<p><em>The Veilguard</em> kicks off by putting Rook into immediate action (quite literally after the character creator), by way of having to confront a man known as Solas, the Dread Wolf. Solas has one goal: to tear down the Veil that separates the world, Thedas, from the realm of demons. It’s a grand scheme he wants to enact in order to restore his people. Surely it can’t go wrong… until it does.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rook and associates, Solas’ ritual is disrupted, releasing two ancient and powerful gods, Elgar’naan and Ghilan’nain, and imminent destruction upon the world. With everything thrown into chaos, it’ll be up to Rook and their companions to put a stop to them in a world that is fraught with plenty of established strife and conflict.</p>

<p><em>The Veilguard</em>’s story is one that weaves through both the over-arching narrative, and one that relies so much on interactions with different companions, locations, and factions. All of these elements are important as they eventually lead to the story’s conclusion.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragonage20241018153703_1.jpg?itok=YpCeMCVW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragonage20241018153703_1.jpg?itok=8JaxUONN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For the most part, I found it largely enjoyable. There’s a lot of love in getting to know the different companions that Rook recruits. There’s also a feeling similar to the recent <em>Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em> movie that inspires a lot of whimsy, but not without variety in their backgrounds.</p>

<p>There’s also a lot of depth in the lore, and in each of the different locations Rook explores and the different people they meet. The writers of <em>The Veilguard</em> did well to make everything feel well-worn within the world, and a lot of that is pieced together in both side quests and companion quests.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that a lot of the optional quests are worth doing in that respect, and you will miss a lot by just rushing through the main story. When Bioware said that everything you do circles back to the finale, they weren’t kidding. That said, I did think the way <em>The Veilguard</em> wraps up is a little anti-climactic. There’s a lot of big things that go on within the story, what with the elder gods and the impending doom upon the world, but the way all of it comes together leaves a little to be desired when so much of it is framed with high stakes and appropriate drama before that point.</p>

<p>Mileage may vary of course, but the journey along the way was something I felt was the strongest part, as well as all the choices you make while doing so through dialogue and other decisions. There are some choices that have immense consequences beyond the immediate action, so those are worth taking into consideration because they will have long-lasting impacts in some cases.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragonage20241019194700_1.jpg?itok=-Qwtht3b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragonage20241019194700_1.jpg?itok=yUuFeRsn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>All of this circles back to Rook and their companions. Rook, the player-created character is a fully fleshed-out and voiced protagonist – one whose appearance, lineage, and class can be completely customized at the start of the game.</p>

<p>They can be an elf, a qunari, human, or dwarf. From there, it’s a selection of their faction and accompanying backstory. For example, I went with the Antivan Crows, who are both assassins and protectors.</p>

<p>Classes in <em>The Veiguard</em> are split into three choices, each of which carries two different weapons. These are Warrior, Mage, and Rogue, which are all self-explanatory. During my playthrough, I went with Mage for the range abilities with spellcasting, but also because I was able to then specialize through the Skills with a blade as a secondary weapon for close combat.</p>

<p><em>The Veilguard</em> lets you re-spec whenever you want too, so there’s a lot of freedom in playstyle throughout.</p>

<p>Your class will largely influence how you approach combat in <em>The Veilguard</em>, but at its core, each one will include a light attack, heavy attack, along with jumping and dodging – all of which can be strung together in action gameplay mapped to the face buttons on a controller.</p>

<p>There’s also an Ability Wheel, which pauses the action so you can pick out both your own individual actions and targets, as well as your companions. It’s an intuitive system that lets you swap in and out of real-time combat seamlessly while giving you more control. I found myself using it a lot when it came to parsing out some of the more challenging enemies, such as the boss encounters. That said, I would have liked to see a bit more variety in the enemies overall. It's one of the few areas of <em>The Veilguard</em> I found somewhat lacking.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragonage20241017214945_1.jpg?itok=7uBHGDat 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragonage20241017214945_1.jpg?itok=2Bh5OySY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Further combat customization can be found in the Skill tree, in which Rook can tool their playstyle to one specialization. Skill Points are earned throughout <em>The Veilguard</em> through quests, as well as through normal combat. It’s a basic setup, but being able to re-spec whenever you want helps keep gameplay fresh.</p>

<p>Rook’s companions can also earn Skill Points, and this is important because there’s a lot of time that can be dedicated to increasing their bonds, as well as catering them to different combat whims as they all come equipped with different abilities.</p>

<p>For example, there’s Lace Harding, who is handy with a bow and the ability to stagger enemies. There’s also Darvin, a strong attacker who uses his griffon companion as backup. Another interesting character is Lucanis Dellamorte, an assassin who makes use of dual daggers, but someone who can also put buffs on the party.</p>

<p>Each of the seven companions are unique, and their individual stories make them worth spending time with - you can even influence romantic options with them, in true Bioware tradition. Of course, you can choose to ignore them entirely, but you may not like the eventual consequences.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragonage20241027170112_1.jpg?itok=qsSqqEkK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragonage20241027170112_1.jpg?itok=riDiFIvf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>All of this is wrapped up together in what is no doubt a stunning presentation. <em>The Veilguard</em> looks gorgeous throughout with plenty of visual flair, a dense world, and unique art direction accompanied by an electric soundtrack.</p>

<p>There’s something to be said about the amount of visual variety and fidelity in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and it really helps to tell a world-spanning story.</p>

<p>That said, I did encounter some performance issues in several locations. Quite randomly, there were framerate drops without much of anything going on, so hopefully that’s something that can be fixed in a patch later down the line. I also encountered some bugged out enemies, but it was nothing that was game-breaking.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is no doubt an achievement. And again, the ten-year wait has been a blessing because it allowed the folks at Bioware to come back with something strong, satisfying, and fully polished.</p>

<p>Because that’s what<em> The Veilguard</em> is – a polished game, one with a compelling story and characters with much of the design decisions not dissimilar to that of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/mass-effect-legendary-edition-notable-flaw"><em>Mass Effect 2</em></a>. It's a polished game that, I think most importantly, doesn't require any previous knowledge of the series, but if you are a fan, it doesn't shy away from catering to you too.</p>

The complete version will cost $9.99 in the US at first, but once January 30th at 10PM PT rolls around it will cost twice as much at $19.99.</p><p>Existing <em>Pocket Camp</em> players who want to port their game data over will have until June 1st, 2025 to do so, via a linked Nintendo account. The original app’s service will cease on November 28th at 7AM PT, so it seems anyone on the fence needs to have their save data linked and <a href="https://faq.complete.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/29555650212761-Preparing-to-Transfer-Save-Data">prepped for transfer</a> before that. Nintendo has spelled out some of these details in a 12-minute video explainer, which also goes over the existing features that are transferring over and what’s not making the <em>Complete</em> cut.</p><p>What’s new for <em>Pocket Camp Complete</em> is the ability to play without a constant internet connection. Players will still be able to visit and trade with friends online, but the new version can be a fully offline experience if desired. Instead of the premium currency of the original game, Leaf Tickets, the complete version will have Leaf Tokens — earned by exchanging Bells or completing goals. Leaf Tokens will be used for buying furniture or speeding up crafting times, so it sounds like the replacement for in-game purchases may be more grinding. And for those that have a stockpile of the old Leaf Tickets, know that they will not be transferred (best to get spending before that Thanksgiving cutoff).</p><p>The other big new features for <em>Pocket Camp Complete</em> are in-game Camper Cards that players can customize with their avatars and favorite in-game animals. You can create and trade cards with other players in real life via QR codes. Collecting friends via Camper Cards adds their character to a new mountain location called Whistle Pass, where they may occasionally gift you items and enjoy daily musical performances from K.K. Slider at 7PM. Other members of your friends list who made the transfer to <em>Complete </em>may also appear at Whistle Pass. I assume the others will be quietly raptured and never spoken of again.</p><p><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete</em> can be preordered / pre-registered on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-c/id6547834967">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zasa">Android</a> now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
