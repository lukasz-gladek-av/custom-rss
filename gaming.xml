		<p>If there is a mode that players love in Call of Duty, it is Zombies. It has been a staple since Call of Duty: World At War. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 continues the zombie tradition and there is now a trailer showing some gameplay from the upcoming release, backed with AC/DC’s Highway to Hell. There has also been confirmation that those who pre-order Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will get to play Zombies Survival in the beta.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Zombies Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/07SF99EeZ1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Black Ops 7 story is continuing the narrative threads set up within Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6. There’s also The Guild, a new high tech military force that doesn’t necessarily mesh with classic morality and the scale of good vs. evil. Black Ops 7 can be played solo, or with up to four players – the Black Ops 3 connection returns! – and there’s plenty of twisted dream-like versions of locations found within the trailer, such as Nicaragua with giant knives, LA with motorways twisting up into the sky, and so much more. These locations will be tied together with Avalon. There’s also the return of Dead Ops Arcade for some top-down action, and an endgame PvE social experience where you fight overwhelming odds and play through a roguelike structure in Avalon.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14th for PC, Xbox Series XS, and PS5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It has felt like a long time coming, but we are finally on the home stretch of the run-up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have been popping up at a handful of public events over the last month or so to give us all a taste of what the next entry has in store, but we recently got the opportunity to play... more of it.</p>
<p>The lovely Alex-from-Nintendo-Life-here was lucky enough to go <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pokemon-legends-z-as-combat-shines-brightly-but-its-visuals-are-still-dull">hands-on</a> with the game for the best part of an hour at a Paris press event, and his thoughts are somewhat mixed. While Mr Olney had a great time getting to grips with the new real-time combat, his optimism was sullied by the rather bland presentation.</p>
<p>You can watch his full thoughts in the video above, but here's a snippet from the written version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It really is baffling and overwhelmingly disappointing that Pokémon games continue to fall short in the looks department, especially when you consider that historically (on handheld devices) they were graphical showcases many moons prior.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:188256 @ 1758727803 -->
<p>And yet, we were not the only ones to go hands-on with the game, oh no. Other outlets have also shared their preview thoughts after attending a similar session, so let's try to get an idea of the consensus, shall we?</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-one-hour-with-pokemon-legends-z-a-highlights-big-changes-to-the-series/">VGC</a>. The outlet seemed pretty hot on the game, praising the returning catching mechanics and bold battle swings — even if the latter may be initially difficult for long-time fans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The speed with which Pokémon can be caught is as satisfying as it was in the first Legends game, and is as close as the series has come to the idea of being a bug catcher sneaking up on a rare creature, the inspiration for the series as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-essentially-an-action-game-but-might-not-be-a-particularly-great-one">Eurogamer</a> seemed slightly cooler on the new battle system, noting its potential for chaos and frustration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is Pokémon going full real-time action, ultimately, with your character frequently dodge-rolling around the Wild Zone or crouching behind cars in the Z-A Royales, as Pokémon attacks fly. I've nothing against that in principle, much as I love Pokémon's classic, highly tactical turn-based battle system. The only concern is the implementation: this feels, at first pass, like a system retro-fitted onto a series that already has all kinds of baggage, as opposed to proper ground-up reimagining of how Pokémon-on-Pokémon combat might work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the flip side, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/ive-been-playing-pokemon-for-17-years-but-pokemon-legends-z-a-makes-me-feel-like-im-relearning-everything-i-knew-about-battles-in-the-best-way-possible/">GamesRadar</a> had much more fun with these new battle mechanics, believing that Z-A "has what it takes to rejuvenate Game Freak's tried and tested RPG formula":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like I have so much to learn about its new combat mechanics, as the experience so far feels like relearning so much of what I knew – <em>especially</em> after seeing just how different certain moves can behave compared to the turn-based games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-the-final-preview">IGN</a> kept the good vibes coming, even if it was in a slightly more sceptical way. The outlet's preview praised the game's Wild Zones and potential depth of battle mechanics, but worried things may become a little repetitive in the long run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Legends: Z-A’s gameplay loop is unique, and I’m looking forward to experimenting with and mastering the new, real-time battle system. I appreciate the risks Pokémon is taking here - I just hope they fully pay off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preview-battles/">Polygon</a> was all about the battle system, praising Z-A's depth and "thrilling" gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a lot of familiarity in sitting down to play <em>Z-A</em> — it’s Pokémon through and through — with just enough of a twist on the traditional formula to feel innovative and original.</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/quake-2-brazilian-drug-dealer-3-favela-steam-review-fps-boomer-shooter-weird-2000628167</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-new-3-boomer-shooter-is-an-incredible-fever-dream-you-should-play.1307160/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sometimes I discover a new game by looking at what’s trending on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3191050/">SteamDB</a>. That’s how I first learned about<em> BRAZILIAN DRUG DEALER 3: I OPENED A PORTAL TO HELL IN THE FAVELA TRYING TO REVIVE MIT AIA I NEED TO CLOSE IT,</em> a game which I will now only refer to as <em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> or <em>BDD3</em> to save us all a lot of time. Of course, the long and wild name caught my eye, but it also has a very high Steam review rating. So I paid $2 and checked it out, and folks, it’s a wild but oddly charming experience.</p> <p><em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> is best described as <a href="https://kotaku.com/more-tips-than-you-probably-need-for-the-quake-remaster-1847616427">a heavily modded and twisted version of <em>Quake</em>.</a> It uses that classic shooter’s engine as its foundation, as well as reskinned enemies and weapons from Id’s fantastic FPS. But while it plays a lot like that classic shooter, this definitely ain’t <em>Quake</em> anymore. At least, I don’t remember <em>Quake</em> containing so many hellish favela levels and evil soccer players.</p>  <p><em>BDD3 </em>plays, looks, and sounds like a retro fever dream, complete with loud, ear-piercing music, random sound effects, bizarre textures everywhere you look, and oddly shaped levels based on real-life locations, like a grocery store and a soccer stadium. Filling these levels are reskinned <em>Quake</em> enemies, now replaced with demonic soccer fans armed with assault rifles and grenade launchers. Oh, there are also demons and other monsters, too. I’m not sure if they like soccer. To rip through these enemies, you’ll use gold-plated handguns, assault rifles, dual shotguns, a simple sandal, a staff that shoots electrical beams, and other strange stuff I won’t spoil here. Every gun is very loud and feels like it would kill an elephant. And because this is the OG <em>Quake</em> engine, you move fast and hit hard, and it all runs perfectly on a modern, powerful PC. In other words, I had a blast playing <em>BDD3.</em></p>

 <p>As the game’s very long name suggests, <em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> (loosely) tells the story of a person who, in trying to revive their favorite musician, accidentally opened a portal to hell and is now desperately fighting back against the demonic invaders while trying to close it and save the world. You know, that ol’ chestnut. Trying to follow the story is tricky, and&nbsp; I’m not even sure the game’s main developer is aiming to provide a coherent narrative. But whatever, the real appeal of <em>BDD3</em> is its fast-paced action and fever dream vibes. It’s the kind of game in which I was excited to play the next level just to see what nightmarish music or mess of textures awaited me.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628184"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628184">©Joeveno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>However, to <em>BDD3</em>‘s credit, while it might look like a giant mess of nonsense, there’s actually a well-made shooter under all that chaos. Levels are perfectly paced, providing you with a mixture of big fights and smaller encounters that tend to flow really well together. Though it may look slapdash, I think that aspect was carefully cultivated, and that a lot more thought than you might expect went into crafting every level.&nbsp; For example, each one is filled with strategically placed (and very odd-looking) quick save machines,&nbsp; so even less-experienced FPS players will have no trouble at all progressing.</p>

 <p>The other reason I’ve really enjoyed playing<em> Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> is that it’s quite a charming experience. It’s clear that the game’s lead developer, <a href="https://x.com/JoevenoYT">Joeveno</a>, is channeling his experience as a Brazilian gamer and developer to create something that, from the outside, might seem weird for weird’s sake. And to be sure, <a href="https://x.com/get_glizzy/status/1965638844910633266">if you listen to the dev talk about the game</a>, some of what’s in <em>BDD3</em> is just meant to be odd and make you laugh. But it’s also recreating the kind of bizarre <em>Quake</em> and <em>Doom</em> mods that used to be all over the internet back in the early 2000s, as well as the various foreign bootlegs of popular shooters that were passed around via forums or floppy disks long ago.</p> <p>On<em> Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em>‘s Steam page, Joeveno calls the trippy game a “Tribute to the Brazilian mods” and “bootleg games” from that era, and while I might not be as familiar with the source material as the dev is, I can still feel the passion and care that was put into nailing a very specific and chaotic vibe. <em>BDD3</em> won’t be for everyone, but for players looking for something different that is also well-made and fun, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3191050/BRAZILIAN_DRUG_DEALER_3_I_OPENED_A_PORTAL_TO_HELL_IN_THE_FAVELA_TRYING_TO_REVIVE_MIT_AIA_I_NEED_TO_CLOSE_IT/">I’d recommend spending $3 to check it out.</a> (The game’s price will jump to $5 on October 1.) And hey, at the very least, in the future, if someone says they own a game on Steam with a long name, you can make a bet with them that you know you’ll likely win.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Problem With Switch 2 Game Key Cards Isn’t Going Away]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-game-key-card-yakuza-3-cast-nioh-3-silen-hill-f-mod-2000628163</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-problem-with-switch-2-game-key-cards-isn%E2%80%99t-going-away.1307157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Did Sega just completely change the spirit of <em>Yakuza 3</em> by recasting its lead in the remake? Does <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a> really look prettier without fog? And when will Nintendo finally support smaller SD express card sizes and ditch those dreaded game key cards? It’s another edition of <em>Morning Checkpoint</em>, <em>Kotaku’</em>s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Fed chair Jerome Powell <a href="https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1970606369578590451">says tariffs aren’t driving up inflation just yet</a> as companies eat the cost of the new taxes. I guess he’s not trying to buy a new game console!</p> <h2>Game devs aren’t happy about Switch 2 game key cards either, apparently</h2> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2025-09-24/T2T62TGP493K00?srnd=cojp-v2"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> some backroom grumblings ahead of Tokyo Game Show 2025 this week regarding the health of game development in Japan and also, interestingly enough, anecdotal frustration with Nintendo’s game key cards for the Switch 2. It also confirms that Nintendo currently only offers 64GB sizes for all games, which increases the cost and appears to be the primary reason so many third-party publishers are opting for the plastic DRM keys instead.</p> <p>It’s clear, however, that paying the higher cost of going physical on Switch 2 can pay dividends for some games. <em>Bloomberg</em> points to the recent example of <em>Daemon Ex Machina: Titanic Scion</em>. “In the UK, it was released as a standard physical cartridge, ready to play straight out of the box. According to Nielsen IQ, 72% of physical sales in the UK were for the Switch 2,” it reports. “In Japan, however, it was sold as a key card, and the results were reversed. According to<em> Famitsu,</em> only 40% of sales were for the Switch 2.”</p>

 <p>Nintendo recently surveyed fans about their feelings on game key cards, and at least some publishers say requiring downloads helps with performance for more taxing games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-game-key-card-2000623413"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>.</p> <h2>A <em>Yakuza 3</em> remake and more are on the way</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm watching the Kiwami 3 Summit but seeing the new Rikiya is pissin me off <a href="https://t.co/qDZE7covQn">pic.twitter.com/qDZE7covQn</a></p> <p>— Jtastic (@JtasticVA) <a href="https://twitter.com/JtasticVA/status/1970696209749746121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Announced during the Ryu Ga Gotoku Summit livestream, <em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em> will bring the last PS3-era entry in the series to modern platforms on February 12. It recasts a key character, Rikiya Shimabukuro, with the guy from <em>Tokyo Vice</em> (Sho Kasamatsu), however, and fans are not happy.</p>

 <p>It’ll come bundled with a new spin-off called <em>Yakuza 3 Gaiden: Dark Ties</em> that follows main villain Yoshitaka Mine. <em>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut</em> and remakes of the first two games are also getting upgraded ports for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

 <h2>PlayStation will now make you work to unlock special merch</h2> <p>Sony unveiled <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-photo-mode-features-detailed-tips-guide/">Franchise Rewards</a> this week, a new program through which popping certain trophies in games will qualify you to pay the company money for select swag. It’s kicking off with a pin and T-shirt for <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> that cost a combined $55.</p>

 <p>This will be familiar to <em>Destiny 2</em> fans since Bungie has been running this exact type of program, offering special swag to day-one raid players, for some time. The reason it works <em>there</em> is that it’s a limited-time group achievement. I’m confused as to why Sony seems to be having so much trouble figuring out cool rewards initiatives.</p>

 <h2><em>Silent Hill f</em> players are already nuking the fog</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone already removed fog in Silent Hill F lol <a href="https://t.co/K6daHORlZ7">pic.twitter.com/K6daHORlZ7</a></p> <p>— Besk (@BeskInfinity) <a href="https://twitter.com/BeskInfinity/status/1970526109851648178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Konami’s latest survival horror game isn’t technically even out yet and it’s already getting the mod treatment. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-modders-add-ray-tracing-cheats-and-remove-the-hud-and-the-series-signature-fog-a-day-after-advanced-access-went-live-on-steam"><em>IGN</em> notes</a>, fans are already adding cheats and ray-tracing while erasing the HUD and any other immersion-breaking elements. Now if only they could mod in a proper PS5 Pro mode for the console version.</p> <h2><em>Nioh 3</em> gets a release date</h2> <p>Team Ninja’s upcoming Soulslike is coming soon, according to a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026">leaked store page</a> on Amazon Japan. The PS5 console exclusive arrives February 6 (on PC too). In addition to its samurai combat, the sequel is adding a new ninja playstyle. Who’s ready for some “Soulsgaiden?”</p> <h2>Here are some <em>Mega Man</em> RPGs you probably never knew existed</h2>  <p>Was I alone in never having heard of the <em>Mega Man Star Force</em> trilogy before? They were spiritual successors to <em>Mega Man Battle Network</em> that came to the Nintendo DS in the second half of the aughts and were mostly panned by reviewers at the time for failing to change up the formula much. Capcom is clearly still riding the high of the <em>Battle Network</em> collection selling over 1 million copies, and I applaud the effort to bring lost niche games to modern platforms. I’m morbidly intrigued.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">The Switch 2 port of <em>Borderlands 4</em> was delayed at the last minute with no real explanation</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">DHS goons are using Ash Ketchum’s <em>Pokémon</em> anthem to promote fascism</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-physint-od-trailer-showcase-2000627889">Hideo Kojima announced a bunch of things yesterday include a new credit card</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Capcom [2,618 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> has released a new trailer and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Onimusha: Way of the Sword [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/onimusha-way-of-the-sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a></em> introducing the XXX. <span id="more-994851"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details, via Capcom:</p><blockquote><p>Today’s  Capcom Tokyo Game Show 2025 Online Special Program debuted a new story trailer for <em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em> revealing the supernatural events that set the dark fantasy adventure into motion. The sneak peek also introduces new characters who play key roles in the swordplay action game’s narrative. </p><p>After protagonist Miyamoto Musashi’s arrival in Kyoto, the samurai is ambushed by the demonic Genma. On the verge of death, Musashi is “gifted” an Oni Gauntlet granting him the power to stand against these monstrosities from the underworld. However, as a warrior who wishes to carve a path by his own hand, he seeks to sever his link with this mystical artifact.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_994865"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>During Musashi’s journey, he encounters Izumo no Okuni and Ono no Takamura, newfound friends who are also based on real figures from Japanese history. Guided by the voice of the mysterious Oni woman within his gauntlet, Musashi is led to Takamura, a venerable swordsman with a gauntlet of his own. He also crosses paths with Okuni, a famous performer known for her iconic Kabuki dance, who has departed the stage in search of a way to defeat the Genma. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The latest footage also contains flashes of gameplay where Musashi faces enemies in the streets of Kyoto, including Togemaru, a serpentine Genma with spikes running down its spine that whirls into the fray with great speed to eviscerate its unfortunate targets. Though Musashi is reluctant to embrace his Oni Gauntlet, he must harness its power to slay such formidable foes. </p></blockquote><p><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,435 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,955 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,326 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2638890/Onimusha_Way_of_the_Sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> in 2026.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Since Nintendo launched Switch 2 in June, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> have emerged as the system's early flagship titles. Both games were also given updates this week, although Mario Kart World fans will notice more differences and improvements to the game.</p><p>Mario Kart World patch <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/kw/mario%20kart%20world" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ver. 1.3.0</a> makes a number of welcome changes to Free Roam, including the ability to play that mode with a second player if the game is full while trying to join a race against friends. It's also going to be easier to encounter UFOs and find collectibles in Free Roam, especially now that the game will let you know which items you've already found on the map.</p><p>The patch tackled a few annoying bugs like losing your ranking if you went out of bounds by the finish line, or getting stuck in the Bowser's Castle walls when using Bullet Bill. Most of the bug fixes would be best described as quality-of-life changes rather than game-breaking issues.</p><p>Surprisingly, Donkey Kong Bananza <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68614/kw/donkey%20kong%20bananza" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ver. 2.0.1</a> only tackles a few issues with this patch. Pauline's shout voices will now align with the player's chosen language. Prior to the update, there was a known issue where her shout voices wouldn't be played when English was chosen as the language for the system. The update also addressed a bug that kept players from claiming a disc as their reward for finding all of the balloons in Bananza Rehearsal.</p><p>A recent video demonstrated that Mario Kart World NPCs aren't above <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-characters-are-stealing-cars-gta-style-sort-of/1100-6534813/" data-ref-id="1100-6534813">a little GTA-style auto theft</a>. It's a funny touch, especially since the former drivers of the vehicles don't appear to react to the loss of their cars. As for Donkey Kong Bananza, the game recently received a roguelite mode DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-roguelike-mode-dlc-will-let-you-smash-stuff-forever/1100-6534690/" data-ref-id="1100-6534690">Emerald Rush</a>, which will let you keep smashing forever.</p><p>The complete patch notes for Mario Kart World Ver. 1.3.0 are below.</p><h3>General</h3><ul><li>You can now join friends playing "Knockout Tour" by selecting "Friends" from "Online Play" "1p."</li><li>Up to 2 players can now play "Free Roam" while waiting if the game was full when trying to join friends playing "Race," "Knockout Tour" or "Battle" in "Online Play."</li><li>The "Free Roam" map now displays the locations of P Switches you've run over and Peach Medallions you've obtained.</li><li>You can now select a P Switch from the map and move to a location near the P Switch.</li><li>In "Free Roam", you can now transform into the character pulled into the UFO.</li><li>If "Dash Food" in "Settings/Controller" is set to "Doesn’t transform" then you will not transform.</li><li>It is now easier to encounter UFOs in "Free Roam."</li><li>The conditions for the appearance of some Peach Medallions in "Free Roam" have been adjusted.</li><li>When spectating in "Knockout Tour" or "Balloon Battle" in "Online Play" or "Wireless Play", you can now choose who to watch, even if you are holding the Joy-Con 2 or Joy-Con horizontally.</li><li>Decreased the time between when an item box is taken by someone and the next time it is revived.</li><li>Increased the invincible time after spinning or crashing during a race.</li><li>Reduced the force of jumps when landing on a rival from above.</li><li>Decreased the amount of time between when you finish and when spectating begins in "Knockout Tour" or "Balloon Battle" in "Online Play" or "Wireless Play."</li><li>Decreased the amount of time between passing through the checkpoint and when the ranking is displayed in "Knockout Tour" in "Wireless Play" and "LAN Play."</li><li>Further increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in "VS Race" and wireless races.</li></ul><h3>Fixed Issues</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue in "Online Play" and "Wireless Play" where the ranking would sometimes become incorrect if a player went off course at the same time as reaching the finish line.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Grand Prix", "Knockout Tour", and "VS Race", where the CPU's ranking would sometimes drop after reaching the finish line.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Knockout Tour" in "Online Play" where other players' ratings would sometimes appear as "0" on the results screen.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a Spiny Shell would sometimes pass the first place player in "Wireless Play" or "Online Play."</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes be sent flying backwards a great distance when hit by a Spiny Shell.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the second item in an item slot would sometimes not disappear when hit by Lightning.</li><li>Fixed an issue where hitting the base of a pillar in mid-air would sometimes cause a large jump.</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused movement to become unstable when doing a wall ride on water.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes be swept away strongly after landing when doing a mini jump while going up a river.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes pass through the ground when hit by a car driving on the road.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Free Roam" where players would sometimes be unable to enter pipes correctly after exiting a trailer.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the results screen would sometimes become distorted after spectating "Balloon Battle" in "Online Play."</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game would sometimes not proceed to the course selection screen after exiting a pipe during "Free Roam" in "Online Play."</li><li>Fixed an issue where Bullet Bill would sometimes slip through walls when used in "Sky-High Sundae."</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes get stuck on a wall at the start of the race heading from "Airship Fortress" to "Shy Guy Bazaar."</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes get stuck in walls when using a Bullet Bill in "Bowser’s Castle."</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Cheep Cheep Falls" where item boxes were sometimes difficult to pick up when Smart Steering was turned on.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Knockout Tour" "Spiny Rally" where sometimes there was an item box buried in the ground.</li><li>Several other issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li></ul><p>The patch notes for Donkey Kong Bananza Ver. 2.0.1 are also included below.</p><h3>Fixed Issues</h3><ul><li>Fixed issue where the player could not get a disc as a reward for collecting all the balloons in Bananza Rehearsal.</li><li>If the above issue is occurring in the game in Ver. 2.0.0 or earlier, the player will be able to get the disc right after the stage starts by entering Bananza Rehearsal after downloading this update data.</li><li>Fixed issue where some of Pauline’s shout voices would not play when language setting of the Nintendo Switch 2 system is “English (UK/Australia)” and travel buddy’s voice (Pauline’s voice) in “Options” has its “voice language” set to “Same as system.”</li><li>Several other changes have been made and issues addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li></ul>

                <p>Treyarch senior director of production Yale Miller has revealed that the company rejected collaborations with unspecified "big brands" for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> skins.</p><p><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-7-devs-canceled-big-brand-collabs-after-backlash-3256095/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Miller told Dexerto</a> that Treyarch wants to have collab skins in Black Ops 7 that "make sense" for the game. This mandate led the company to apparently say no to possible deals.</p><p>"There are opportunities that we have had lined up that, after some of our conversations, we straight up turned down. Big, big brands, big things, and we're like, 'No, we're not gonna do that because it just doesn't fit,'" Miller said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4573998-screenshot2025-09-24at11.28.28%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573998" data-ratio="0.55418381344307" data-width="729" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4573998-screenshot2025-09-24at11.28.28%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573998"></a><figcaption>The Nuketown Block Party mannequin skins in Black Ops 6.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4573998-screenshot2025-09-24at11.28.28%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>Some part of the Call of Duty fanbase has spoken out against the franchise's series of wacky and over-the-top skins, while others have embraced and enjoyed them. Miller said the recent Nuketown Block Party skins that let you play as a mannequin from the map are examples of skins that aren't "grounded" per se but something that "feels right for the game."</p><p>"All intentions [are] to stick to stuff that we can hand on our heart, say, 'Yeah, that feels Black Ops,'" Miller said. "That's really our goal. And I think that's a good clarification versus 'grounded.'"</p><p>Most Black Ops 6 skins <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">will not carry forward to Black Ops 7</a>, but it remains to be seen what kinds of skins--licensed or original--show up in Black Ops 7. In August, Activision acknowledged that some fans believe the franchise has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/" data-ref-id="1100-6534279">"drifted" from its identity as a military shooter</a> with its wacky skins.</p><p>Activision made this key announcement against the backdrop of EA's stance on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> skins. Developers stressed that the game's cosmetics would feel "grounded." An EA developer even name-checked Nicki Minaj, which was no doubt a reference to Call of Duty's DLC that allows people to play as her.</p><p>Design director Shashank Uchil told <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DBLTAP</a> that, "It has to be grounded. That is what BF3 and BF4 was--it was all soldiers, on the ground. It's going to be like this." Uchil went on to say, "I don't think it needs Nicki Minaj." Instead, Uchil said the aim for Battlefield 6's skins is: "Let's keep it real, keep it grounded."</p><p>Call of Duty games over the years have featured all manner of outlandish skins, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-4-20-event-brings-cheech-and-chong-a-stoned-sloth-and-weed-themed-bundles/1100-6522208/" data-ref-id="1100-6522208">stoner sloths</a> and licensed skins from franchises like The Boys, TMNT, King of the Hill, Beavis and Butt-Head, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Many people enjoyed and embraced these skins, some of which included their own special modes, while others said they are a blight on the overall Call of Duty experience.</p><p>One thing is for sure, and that is that Call of Duty's in-game shop no doubt brings in a lot of money for Activision and the company will undoubtedly continue to sell skins and other DLC for Black Ops 7.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, but you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">play the game's multiplayer beta in October</a>. Just recently, Activision announced that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-also-includes-zombies/1100-6534980/" data-ref-id="1100-6534980">beta will include Zombies. </a></p>

            <p>The Pokémon Company has responded to a disturbing video from the US Department of Homeland Security posted on social media that used imagery and music from the Pokémon anime to promote the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-department-of-homeland-security-uses-pokemon-theme-song-and-images-in-disturbing-ice-promotion">Eurogamer reported yesterday</a>, the video (shared with the caption "Gotta Catch 'Em All") included footage of people being arrested alongside protagonist Ash Ketchum, as well as Pokémon card-style graphics of criminals.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has shared the following statement with Eurogamer in response: "We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand. Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property."</p>
<p>The video was responded to with calls for Nintendo to sue for copyright infringement. However, the company is yet to respond to Eurogamer's request for comment regarding what action it plans to take in response to the unlicensed use of its property.</p>

<p>There's a starman</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After being announced just over a week ago <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mega-man-star-force-legacy-collection-brings-ds-rpgs-to-switch-in-2026">during the Japanese Nintendo Direct broadcast</a>, Capcom has shared an updated trailer and a few new details about the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_star_force_legacy_collection">Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer was shown during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2rD0i4pOTk">Capcom's TGS 2025 Online Program</a> and, as you'd expect from this compilation of DS RPGs, the team has introduced a couple of new features to help modernise the experience and provide a package that loyal fans will love.</p>
<p>These include a toggleable high-resolution filter, an in-game gallery featuring over 1000 pieces of art, a music player — plus "new versions of favourite tracks" — and difficulty and assist settings, which look to include different screen settings, similar to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_dominus_collection">Castlevania Dominus Collection</a> from Konami and M2.</p>
<p>Plus, in another win for fans, cards that were exclusive to special events and toys will be available in-game. So this is the complete experience for the entire series.</p>

<p>The latest Mega Man collection is due to drop on Switch in 2026, so we'll bring you that release date as soon as we know!</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/783718/hades-ii-2-1-0-update-review-pc-nintendo-switch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-ii%E2%80%99s-big-1-0-update-has-me-obsessed-all-over-again.1307118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When <em>Hades II</em> first launched in early access, I had to force myself to stop playing after around 30 hours. I didn’t want to burn out on what was already an excellent, jam-packed <em>Hades</em> sequel before it hit 1.0, when the final polish and story would be in place. I made the right choice; the 1.0 milestone is now here, and after more than a week with it on my Steam Deck and Switch 2, I’m obsessed with <em>Hades II</em> once again.</p><p><em>Hades II</em> is a roguelike with flashy battles, hot and chatty Greek gods, and exquisitely paced progression that makes you feel like you’re getting better nearly every single run. (If you’ve played the first <em>Hades</em>, you know the drill.) Like a lot of Greek mythology, <em>Hades II</em> revolves around some <em>very</em> complex family drama: you play as Melinoë, the daughter of the Underworld god Hades and the younger sister of <em>Hades</em> protagonist Zagreus, and her goal is to kill Chronos, a Titan who is Hades’ dad (so technically her grandpa) and has attacked and taken over the Underworld.</p><p>Getting to Chronos involves descending into the Underworld. In each run, your goal is to clear out rooms of enemies, which typically takes a minute or two. When you do, you’ll get rewards like new “boons” (perks of some kind) from various gods you can use to build out a playstyle, or you can pick from upgrades like more health, more magic power, or improvements to your weapons. Eventually, you’ll reach a tough boss for a zone, and if you take them down, you’ll head to a new zone with new baddies. Rinse and repeat until you get to Chronos, and eventually, you’ll be able to take on a second, entirely separate route of zones with a new final boss.</p><p>Fights in <em>Hades II</em> are still action-packed skirmishes that usually pit you against a bunch of enemies at once. I tend to design builds that let me take on enemies at a distance, which pairs well with Melinoë’s witchy weapons, like a staff or torches that can toss fireballs, and her ability to cast a large, magical ring onto the battlefield. The new weapons and abilities feel a little different than the first <em>Hades</em>, but still cut from the same cloth.</p><p>If you’ve already poured time into <em>Hades II</em> during early access, I recommend starting a fresh file to experience everything with a clean slate. That’s what I did, and it’s been a blast to start from scratch, while also relying on what I already know about the game to overcome some things a bit more easily. I’ve been playing on my Switch 2 and Steam Deck, using cloud saves to easily bounce between the platforms (underrated feature!), and the game plays great on both.</p><p>All of the touches that made <em>Hades</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc">so gripping</a> are here in <em>Hades II</em>, including quippy conversations with fully voiced characters, gorgeous artwork, incredible music, and lots of little ways to upgrade your abilities and equipment between runs. The 1.0 version of <em>Hades II</em> seems huge, with two separate routes, a massive well of upgrades you can grind for, difficulty modifiers for runs, and, like the first game, many reasons to keep playing even after you get your first win. (I’m particularly surprised how much I want to move the main story forward.)</p><p>It all adds up to an experience that makes <em>Hades II</em> the most gripping roguelike I’ve played since the first <em>Hades</em>. Every time I jump in for one more run, I can’t wait to see what happens next.</p><p><sub>Hades II <em>launches on September 25th on Nintendo Switch and PC.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/783718/hades-ii-2-1-0-update-review-pc-nintendo-switch#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/783718/hades-ii-2-1-0-update-review-pc-nintendo-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Steam's latest client beta has given you another way to quickly check whether you've got secure boot enabled before you hop into some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>sing about. Enabling the setting's become mandatory for the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, as the possibly futile war on cheating continues to rage like, er, well, you know.</p>
<p>It's a controversial way of going about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">trying to limit the amout of fraudulent 360 no-scopes</a>, as it involves publishers mandating an aspect of how players' hardware's used, if a pretty easy one to check with a trip to your BIOS if you know what you're doing. Not everyone's used to delving into those settings though, which is why it's nice Valve have made this useful addition to their game playing place.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545621427784515587">brief post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/steam-now-lets-you-check-if-you-have-secure-boot-enabled-the-security-feature-were-all-going-to-have-to-get-to-grips-with-for-battlefield-call-of-duty-and-more/">Pretty Cold Grandma</a>, a Steam client beta update deployed early this morning has brought in this tweak.</p>
<p>To use it to check if you've got secure boot enabled, you'll first need to opt into the latest client beta if you haven't already. On desktop, that's done by heading to the Steam logo in the top left when you open up Steam, then selecting 'Settings' from the drop-down menu. From there, you go to 'Interface', 'Steam Client Beta Participation', and select 'Steam Beta Update' from the drop-down menu to the right of the latter. A restart of Steam'll be required, then once it loads back up, you can head to 'Help' in the top left, select 'System Information' from the drop-down.</p><p>You'll get a list of info about your PC, and in the bit about your operating system, you'll find a line which specifies whether or not secure boot is enabled. Just below that's a line listing your Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version, this being a processor that allows your PC to carry out cryptographic operations with some added security measures. It's generally a requirement to get secure boot up and running.</p>

<p>We'll see if these measures ever manage to do more than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-battlefield-6-betas-hacking-problem-shows-the-difficulty-in-playing-cat-and-mouse-with-cheaters">continue to move the goalposts those keen to cheat will likely just find another way to auto-aim their bullets through</a>. At least if the amount of time/energy it takes to check if secure boot's enabled can be minimised, with the added bonus of making it easier for the less tech-savvy, that's something positive.</p>

              <p>It’s almost as if Amazon knows you’re thinking about upgrading your older laptop for something newer, faster, and packed with more features than you thought possible. Why else would they offer this deal on the Dell 15 Inspiron touchscreen laptop in its most souped-up state — <strong>the max 64GB of RAM and 2 TB SSD, preloaded Windows 11 Pro, and a free accessory bundle worth $199?</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4278/">It lists for $2,400, but right now it’s just $900 dyring this killer 63% off limited-time deal.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Credit where credit is due, Amazon has been hard-selling this high-end Dell model lately, maybe because they know that a touchscreen laptop packed with as much RAM and SSD space as possible and driven by an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor (speeds up to 4.5GHz) and AMD Radeon graphics chip is a literal game-changer to anyone who’s been slogging through their work and play with an older, slower machine. Why else would they take a do-it-all machine like this and slash $1,500 from the price?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Machine, Premium Deal</h2>
<p>The top-of-the-line specs, preloaded Windows 11 Pro — including the AI wizardry of Microsoft Copilot — and compact profile and light weight of this Dell laptop virtually guarantees it would be a significant upgrade for pretty much anyone. (Other than the happy shoppers who have already cashed in on this deal.) It’s slim and lightweight enough to pop into a backpack or briefcase to take anywhere, and built sturdily so it won’t break down or fall apart during your road trips.</p>
<p>The touchscreen has all the responsiveness of a high-end tablet, but it’s also a full-HD screen with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, and IPS technology for wide viewing angles. The energy efficient LED-backlit screen helps keep your power bills manageable, and the entire screen plus processor plus graphics card is the equation for awesome streaming on the Dell Inspiron 15. But if you insist on using the high-end visuals for work, there’s also an HD webcam and MaxxAudio Pro speaker for those unavoidable Zoom calls.</p>



<h2>No Upgrades Needed</h2>
<p>You won’t need to immediately drop more money on upgrading the OS of this Dell Inspiron 15, because Windows 11 Pro is already loaded and ready to go. Which also means Copilot AI is at your service. This AI assistant has gotten rave reviews for power, speed, and intuitiveness, and the Dell Inspiron 15 gives it more than enough processing power to do that research or write that email for you almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>We’ve been playing Whak-a-Mole with these massive PC laptop deals at Amazon — every time we think we’ve covered the last of them, two more pop up. But there’s on guarantee these will continue to drop like this, and this one that saves you $1,500 off the price of a brand-new Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen laptop and free accessories bundle valued at $200 isn’t going to get beat anytime soon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4278/">Head to Amazon now and make the upgrade that puts a powerful touchscreen PC laptop in your hands and a pile of money back in your pocket.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

                <p>The 1.0 version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/">Hades 2</a> is here, along with an assortment of questions and vague pointers about one of the biggest mysteries in Early Access. Whether you're jumping into the game for the first time or after being caught up with the story available during Early Access, the task of locating the Three Fates is quite an involved endeavor.</p><p>The launch of Hades 2 allows you to finally move the "Melinoë, Help Us" objective forward, which has been a constant presence in the Fated List of Minor Prophecies. As you'll soon find out, this turns out to be a questline with multiple steps, some of which solving riddles with far from clear answers. If you're wondering how to locate the Three Fates in Hades 2, as well as the answers to the riddles of Melinoë, Seek Us, we have all the answers below.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_Complete_Melino____Help_Us_in_Hades_2">How to Complete Melinoë, Help Us in Hades 2</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_Complete_Melino____Remember_Us_in_Hades_2">How to Complete Melinoë, Remember Us in Hades 2</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_Solve_Every_Hades_2_Riddle_in_Melino____Seek_Us">How to Solve Every Hades 2 Riddle in Melinoë, Seek Us</a><ul><li><a href="#Seek_to_know_he_who_is_our_emissary">Seek to know he who is our emissary</a></li><li><a href="#Seek_to_know_they_who_created_the_world">Seek to know they who created the world</a></li><li><a href="#Seek_to_know_he_who_cast_us_out">Seek to know he who cast us out</a></li><li><a href="#Seek_to_know_she_who_trained_you">Seek to know she who trained you</a></li><li><a href="#Seek_to_know_he_who_rebels_against_the_gods">Seek to know he who rebels against the gods</a></li><li><a href="#Seek_to_know_he_who_labors_for_the_gods">Seek to know he who labors for the gods</a></li><li><a href="#We_shall_attempt_to_reach_you_thus_again">We shall attempt to reach you thus again</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#How_to_Complete_Melino____Find_Us">How to Complete Melinoë, Find Us</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="How_to_Complete_Melino____Help_Us_in_Hades_2">How to Complete Melinoë, Help Us in Hades 2</h2><p>One of the first questions that might come to mind, especially if you were all caught up with the Early Access content ahead of the 1.0 release, is how to actually make progress in the Melinoë, Help Us prophecy.</p><p>The answer involves the main story. In order to move the prophecy forward, you first have to <strong>hit credits in Hades 2</strong>. Doing so involves tackling the Dissolution of Time incantation, as well as locating Entropy. If you need some pointers, we have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-dissolution-of-time-how-to-get-entropy/1100-6534844/" data-ref-id="1100-6534844">full guide</a> explaining how to get to the very end of the main story.</p><p>As somebody who was up to date with the story available in Early Access before release, here's how it went for me: After completing the main story, <strong>the prophecy updated on its own</strong>. Keep in mind that by this point, Moros should already be in the Crossroads. If you get stuck at any point, make sure to speak to him, as well as Hecate and Chaos, who tend to be the main people discussing the Fates' whereabouts.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571388-20250915024323_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571388" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571388-20250915024323_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571388"></a><figcaption>You can consider this the epilogue after reaching the credits of Hades 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571388-20250915024323_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_Complete_Melino____Remember_Us_in_Hades_2">How to Complete Melinoë, Remember Us in Hades 2</h2><p>After reaching the credits of Hades 2, you'll gain access to Melinoë, Remember Us in the Fated List of Minor Prophecies. The sole objective here is to investigate the Underworld and Olympus.</p><p>Simply put, the epilogue story component kicks off by encouraging you to continue doing runs. I did three Underworld runs and one Olympus run, and this seems to have completed the objective. During said runs, I spoke to every NPC that had a question mark on them. It seems talking to Chaos was key, too, but it's hard to confirm due to how Hades 2 works.</p><p>Take the run numbers as a ballpark to strive towards, and make sure to always double-check the Fated List of Minor Prophecies whenever you're back at the Crossroads to see if you've completed the objective. Once you do, prepare yourself--the next objective will take a while.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571390-20250915173244_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571390" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571390-20250915173244_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571390"></a><figcaption>I've been wondering the same thing, Hermes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571390-20250915173244_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_Solve_Every_Hades_2_Riddle_in_Melino____Seek_Us">How to Solve Every Hades 2 Riddle in Melinoë, Seek Us</h2><p>Melinoë, Seek Us is easily one of the most confusing objectives in Hades 2. It involves "seeking to know" six characters, and while some of them are easy enough to discern based on the riddle description, it's hard to know exactly how to progress with them.</p><p>First, we'll mention the answer to every riddle before explaining what we did for the objective to count in the prophecy itself.</p><ul><li><strong>Seek to know he who is our emissary</strong>: Moros</li><li><strong>Seek to know they who created the world</strong>: Chaos</li><li><strong>Seek to know he who cast us out</strong>: Chronos</li><li><strong>Seek to know she who trained you</strong>: Hecate</li><li><strong>Seek to know he who rebels against the gods</strong>: Prometheus</li><li><strong>Seek to know he who labors for the gods</strong>: Hermes</li></ul><h3 id="Seek_to_know_he_who_is_our_emissary">Seek to know he who is our emissary</h3><p>This required maxing out the bond with Moros. This means completing all interactions and giving him the gifts he's open to until you reach the Bond Forged status, which adds the Moros icon on top of its Keepsake.</p><h3 id="Seek_to_know_they_who_created_the_world"><strong>Seek to know they who created the world</strong></h3><p>When we got access to Melinoë, Seek Us, this objective was already completed. We didn't have a full bond with Chaos, but we had a conversation with them that spoke about the Fates. Our recommendation is to plunge into any Chaos Gates you see and gift them nectar until this conversation happens.</p><h3 id="Seek_to_know_he_who_cast_us_out"><strong>Seek to know he who cast us out</strong></h3><p>Once you finish the main story, Chronos will re-appear at the end of the first region during Underworld runs close to the water fountain. We had spoken to him before learning about the new prophecy, and similarly to Chaos, we had this objective completed on its own. You can also pursue a bond with him after you gift him at least one nectar bottle. We didn't need to on our end, but it's a plan B in case this is different on your save file. Still, we don't think you need to max out the bond itself.</p><h3 id="Seek_to_know_she_who_trained_you"><strong>Seek to know she who trained you</strong></h3><p>This step was odd. Hecate mentioned the Three Fates multiple times as we gave her gifts whenever she was open to them at the Crossroads. Right before the last Bath Salt to reach the Bond Forged status, we activated the Vow of Rivals from the Testaments list, and fought the alternative version of Hecate. After being victorious and completing the Underworld run, we returned to the Crossroads, checked the list, and saw that the objective was completed. If you're stuck upgrading your bond with Hecate, give this a try.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571391-20250915175918_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571391" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571391-20250915175918_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571391"></a><figcaption>Eventually, even Prometheus will ask about the Fates.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571391-20250915175918_1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Seek_to_know_he_who_rebels_against_the_gods"><strong>Seek to know he who rebels against the gods</strong></h3><p>Prometheus doesn't have a bond, and you can only interact with him during the boss encounter in an Olympus run. It took us a couple of runs until he mentioned the Three Fates on his own, and that marked the objective on the list. Again, it's hard to know the exact number.</p><p>At the same time, Heracles also mentioned the Fates during an Olympus run, and he shares similar philosophies to Prometheus. Considering Melinoë, Seek Us is about prominent characters, it's hard to say that you actually need to talk to Heracles instead. But, in case you get absolutely stuck, make sure to give Heracles nectar bottles when you stumble upon him.</p><h3 id="Seek_to_know_he_who_labors_for_the_gods"><strong>Seek to know he who labors for the gods</strong></h3><p>Similar to the previous objective, this riddle can refer to either Hermes or Charon. The latter is the safest option, as he's the de facto worker for the Olympian gods. The thing is, we didn't actually make any progress with his bond. When we got the objective, we had already hit a limit with him, which reads: "Charon may not say no to Ambrosia after earning more Nightmare and using Obol Points to redeem rewards."</p><p>We completed several runs, enabling Testaments to get Nightmare (up to seven, to be exact), and spent Obol Points at the Crossroads whenever the shopkeeper allowed us to. At the same time, we progressed through Hermes' bond. He had a limit as well, in which he would accept Ambrosia "after his immediate concerns subside," and when you "spend enough at his shrines."</p><p>Along with spending money on his shrines whenever we had the chance and the spare change, making progress through the other objectives on the list eventually unlocked this, and allowed us to reach the Bond Forged status. Once we did this, the objective completed itself once we were back at the Crossroads. Meanwhile, Charon's bond remained stuck at the aforementioned lock.</p><p>In short, it's hard to know whether you need Hermes or Charon for this objective. If you can get to the thresholds we outlined, you should be good.</p><h3 id="We_shall_attempt_to_reach_you_thus_again"><strong>We shall attempt to reach you thus again</strong></h3><p>This one is more simple. Once you have all other objectives done and dusted, go ahead and do another run. I went for the Underworld, but it should be indistinct. Then, once you return to the Crossroads, Moros will say something about the Fated List of Minor Prophecies "shaking" while you were out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571386-20250917165810_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571386" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571386-20250917165810_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571386"></a><figcaption>Almost there!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571386-20250917165810_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_Complete_Melino____Find_Us">How to Complete Melinoë, Find Us</h2><p>If you thought you were done, I've got bad news. There's one last objective to tackle before locating the Three Fates in Hades 2.</p><p>Melinoë, Find Us involves the following: "Using our Emissary's gift in the depths of Oceanus, active it thrice in successive chambers, then purposely return to shadow." This is referencing the <strong>Engraved Pin</strong>, which is Moros' Keepsake. Equipping it makes it so that when you fall to 0 HP in an encounter, you become doomed. If you clear the encounter in 10 seconds, you're brought back to life.</p><p>For this, you'll have to do an Underworld run, and get to Oceanus, the second region. Melinoë will mention something about the Fates when you set foot on it. The trick is that you must make it far into an encounter without beating it, let yourself get killed, complete the 10-second challenge, and repeat two more times in subsequent rooms. So, do this in one room, pick a room that will have an enemy encounter rather than a shop or an NPC interaction, repeat, then do the same a third time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571387-20250917172653_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571387" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571387-20250917172653_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571387"></a><figcaption>Melinoë will likely mention the Fates upon entering Oceanus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571387-20250917172653_1.jpg"></figure><p>Here's how it went for us: We started this right from the very first room available. The key is to try and pick enemies one by one until there's only one or two left, just to see if there's another wave incoming or not. If not, then let yourself get hit until you reach 0 HP, and swiftly take down the remaining enemies.</p><p>After completing three encounters having succeeded in the Engraved Pin challenge, we jumped into a fourth enemy room and repeated the same process, only this time we didn't fight back to reach a defeat state. Now, since the previous step in the Fates questline involved maxing out the bond with Moros, we encountered a romance scene instead. So, we had to repeat everything again in another run.</p><p>If successful, "return to shadow now" will lead to a cutscene related to the Three Fates. This culminates the questline, and you can cash in the reward back at the Crossroads, which is three Nightmares. If you're having trouble with this challenge, deactivating any Death Defiances you have and solely relying on the Engraved Pin helped on my end.

                <p>Earlier this year, One More Level--the developer behind the cyberpunk action title Ghostrunner--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghostrunner-devs-reveal-next-game-a-first-person-souls-like-set-during-the-napoleonic-wars/1100-6534021/" data-ref-id="1100-6534021">debuted their next title</a>, a first-person action-souls-like called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valor-mortis/" data-ref-id="5000-691455">Valor Mortis</a>. Gamescom attendees were able to play it in August, but next month, Valor Mortis is getting a playtest that's open to everyone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kxjGXZ7Bv8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_kxjGXZ7Bv8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The public playtest for Valor Mortis will be held from October 6-13. Fans who want to participate are invited to sign up on <a href="https://valormortis.firstlook.gg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's official site</a>. The playtest features the first chapter of the game's pre-alpha build, which introduces the world and its story while giving you 10 possible levels of progression as you make their way past a mini boss. If you make it that far, a main boss is waiting to fight you while giving you a chance to demonstrate what you've learned. You can also access the first section of the upgrade tree.</p><p>One More Level and Lyrical Games will be sponsoring community contests during the playtest, including speedruns, screenshot contests, and fan art. Players who take part in those challenges will earn a chance to win prize packs when the game launches.</p><p>Valor Mortis may remind some players of the Dishonored series, due to its first-person action and period setting. Although the game is set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century, it doesn't take place in our world. Instead, it's a twisted version of our reality where a newly discovered substance called Nephtogolobin horribly mutates the living and the dead.</p><p>The game places players in control of of William, one of Napoleon's former soldiers, as the Nephtogolobin gives him the ability to rise from his grave multiple times. He's going to need that power to make it past his former comrades, most of whom now look like undead monsters.</p><p>GameSpot had a chance <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/valor-mortis-hands-on-impressions/2300-6466294/" data-ref-id="2300-6466294">to play Valor Mortis</a> earlier this year, and the first impressions were very promising. Valor Mortis is available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2828710/Valor_Mortis/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, and it will be released on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 in 2026.</p>

                <p>Embracer Group CEO Phil Rogers has commented on AI in gaming, saying it's the "most powerful technology tool of our generation" and one that the company wants to deploy strategically.</p><p>During an investor meeting recently <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/embracer-group-ai-fellowship-phil-rogers?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported on by Game File</a>, Rogers said, "Players aren't longing for generic, soulless side quests or synthetic AI voices." He's very bullish on AI technologies and how they may be able to help developers with things like "driving efficiency, and ultimately delivering the high quality, memorable games our players demand."</p><p>Rogers went on to say he is aware of the "concern from players and developers alike" about AI, but in his belief, a greater risk is using AI "without a strong ethical framework."</p><p>"Artists, actors, writers need protection from plagiarism" that could result from AI, he added. "Our developers will always have the final creative control and authorship. Transparency is mandatory. We're committed to being transparent with players about how, where we use AI in our dev process."</p><p>Rogers said Embracer is establishing "strict governance" around generative AI, including "controls," "audit logs," and "workflow approvals."</p><p>The executive went on to say that Embracer's teams have already begun to see "measurable increases in productivity" thanks to the use of generative AI technology. For example, a motion-capture shoot that previously took seven days to complete can now be done in half the time, he said. Embracer's AI technologies have also allowed developers to check code for bugs in real time, and that 2D artwork can be transformed into a "game-ready 3D model" in hours now, instead of days.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">majority of developers globally already use AI technologies in game development</a>, despite ongoing and serious concerns raised by developers about it. Recently, Smash Bros. boss Masahiro Sakurai said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">AAA game development is becoming unsustainable, and that using AI can help.</a></p><p>Kingdom Come director Daniel Vavra previously spoke positively about his hope that an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-director-hopeful-ai-revolution-can-help-him-make-games-faster/1100-6531008/" data-ref-id="1100-6531008">"AI revolution" will help his studio make games faster and more efficiently.</a> Not everyone is so enthusiastic about the role of AI in gaming going forward, as enigmatic game developer Yoko Taro recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-director-yoko-taro-says-ai-will-make-all-game-creators-unemployed/1100-6531185/" data-ref-id="1100-6531185">"AI will make all game creators unemployed."</a> It remains to be seen how companies adopting AI systems might impact employment. Larian Studios' Swen Vincke has embraced AI to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">automate tedious tasks</a> no one wants to do.</p><p>Embracer in recent times has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-canceled-29-games-and-laid-off-1400-people-in-just-the-last-six-months/1100-6521108/" data-ref-id="1100-6521108">enacted mass layoffs, canceled games, and closed studios. </a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> players on the PC are now able to download a little mod that'll add a particularly famous meme to the game, in spite of the narrative director's public woes.</p>
<p>That's right, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/98">the Skibidi Toilet mod can be downloaded on Nexusmods right now</a>. This mod will add the infamous Skibidi Toilet face to in-game toilets, bringing everyone's fears to life. The mod was created by EpicNNG, developer and Borderlands content creator.</p>
<p>The reason this jokey mod is of note is thanks to Borderlands 4 narrative director Sam Winkler's comments on the game's tone prior to launch. <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1868768937259024578">On social media</a>, Winkler said that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-will-dial-down-the-toilet-humour-says-narrative-director">the "toilet humour" present in Borderlands 3 would be toned down</a>, and stated: "if the word skibidi ships in the game under my watch I’m gonna cry real tears".</p>

<p>So while Sam Winkler has been able to sleep peacefully knowing Borderlands 4 hasn't shipped with any especially cringeworthy gags, it seems certain corners of the Borderlands community have long memories. People say having open communication to developers is great for community building and strong ties to the folks making the experiences gamers love. The real reason is obviously this: to create mods to torment them.</p><p>It actually gets worse for Winkler, who also stated: "Paul Tassi joked that we were gonna have a gun called Hawk 2A and a fellow dev asked me if it was real and I wanted to put my hand down the sink grinder". <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1970646376997638326">EpicNNG posted on X</a> that "Hawk 2A is next", so here's hoping any Borderlands 4 DLC is written up and ready to go before Winkler does something drastic.</p>
<p>If this has somehow convinced you to try out Borderlands 4, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-review">why not check out our Borderlands 4 review</a>! In it reviewer Rick Lane concludes: "Borderlands 4 brings a more sensible script and a true open world to its pseudo-cel-shaded gun-show. But these moderate improvements are undermined by frustrating exploration and combat that takes too long to properly shine."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For all its melodramatic brilliance, the <a href="https://aftermath.site/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Yakuza</em>/<em>Like A Dragon</em></a> series has long carried a recurring blemish—substories and mini-games that veer from campy charm into outright cringe, usually involving real-life adult video actresses in awkward, fetishized scenarios. It’s the kind of thing fans have learned to grin and bear, knowing it’s a part of the series’ whole deal in the same way shonen anime always have a pervy mentor character traipsing about. Now, <em>Kiss or Die</em>, a Netflix variety show, takes that very same “scaring the hoes” energy and blows it up into a full-blown improv reality TV show, rife with an uneven tone, secondhand embarrassment, and a surreal sense of a <em>Yakuza </em>pitfall breaching containment into something with more valleys than peaks.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kiss or Die | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZTPMZGx5c0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Kiss or Die</em> is best described as a show within a show that’s part improv drama, part live reaction, and all cringe. Its premise sees professional Japanese comedians ad-lib scenarios in which they must resist kissing AV actresses. Meanwhile, a panel of celebrity guests and a live studio audience watch and react. If the comedians give in to a cheap kiss before becoming an ideal protagonist, their character dies. The result, at least on paper, is a surreal mix of comedy and drama where the comedians are dropped into plotlines that ask them to become heroic protagonists by resisting seduction. What I found most jarring about watching <em>Kiss or Die</em>’s six hour-long episodes, broken into three acts of two episodes each, was that it so neatly fell into the same pitfalls that have plagued <em>Yakuza</em>, which threaten to spoil the series like a rotten apple, and are long overdue for a callout.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Yakuza 6 did a lot wrong with Kiryu. <span></span><span>Sega/RGG Studio</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I love Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s <em>Yakuza</em>/<em>Like a Dragon</em> games—especially its recent stretch of releases—every entry has one glaring segment that teeters between cringe and camp.

Teetering on the edge. RGG Studio has long leaned into the spectacle of scanning real-life AV and gravure models into their games, often as themselves, and dropping them into a substory that feels like a separate genre entirely, even to the games’ most absurd side quests. From <a href="https://yakuza.fandom.com/wiki/Aika" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aika</a> to <a href="https://yakuza-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Anri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anri Okita</a>, to<a href="https://yakuza.fandom.com/wiki/Gravure_Photoshoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Rina Hashimoto and Hikaru Aoyama</a>, these actresses and models appear in minigames where players are tasked with playing dress up, snapping creep shot photos, or chatting in livestreams that unlock more risque one-on-one personal videos if players <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/yakuza-6/Live_Chatting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“perform” well enough</a>.</p><p>These segments are rarely plot-essential; still, they’re often something players will either goon unabashedly or avoid because of how weird they are. The worst offender, however, is <a href="https://aftermath.site/pirate-yakuza-hawaii-impressions-review-majima" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</em></a>. Despite centering on <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-game-review-1235270755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan-favorite Majima</a>, it features a substory so cringe-inducing that it demands you put the controller down and endure a series of live-action dates gone wrong, featuring AV models and Twitch streamers who auditioned to be in the game, which lasts nearly an hour.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - Live Action Masaru Date With 5 Minato Girls Timestamped" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lu2JodiOEqE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>What made those <em>Yakuza</em> quests painfully cringeworthy wasn’t their sexual content—the series isn’t puritanical, and that’s part of what makes it charming as a drama-meets-comedy mafia game. It's their one-sidedness. The actresses, especially in later entries, are fetishized for wish fulfillment without the give-and-take and chemistry that make for good comedy or romance. Even more, the newer <em>Yakuza</em> games’ use of live-action footage of the models and actresses worsens the tonal whiplash in their substories, particularly since the footage mirrors the girls' movements in cutscenes, which are similar to visual novels, where floating text boxes for players trigger stitched together scenes where the women read out lines and writhe like characters in a poorly-written eroge dating sim.</p><p>Earlier <em>Yakuza </em>games depicted women as in-game character models interacting with heroes <a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuma Kiryu</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/infinite-wealth-hawaii-yakuza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ichiban Kasuga</a>, at least placing them on equal footing with the player as characters in the same medium, rather than as real-life girls talking to the player. There’s a buffer, a kayfabe even. And the ones that aren’t creepy, like Ichiban befriending Kaho Shibuya and Ai Hongo and recruiting them as goofy members of his pirate crew, or Majima and Kiryu befriending Aika in their quest to rule the hostess club scene, are some of the best bits in their games that I would ignore the main quest for, and which others have written <a href="https://haywiremag.com/columns/live-your-own-way-what-running-a-hostess-club-in-yakuza-0-can-teach-us-about-life-under-capitalism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phenomenal essays about.</a>&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Cast These Celebs In The Next Hostess Club Mini-game | Yakuza: Like a Dragon" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZU4tCzOedYY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>You can imagine my surprise when the monkey’s paw on my long-held wish for one of <em>Yakuza</em>’s minigames, like the hostess club, to spin off into its own thing. Instead, the worst part of the series’ gravure AV fetishism breached containment and manifested in <em>Kiss or Die</em>, a series that lacks the tact to be a competent drama or comedy almost entirely.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of the show resembles a bad J-drama and porno script, with potential for some good situational comedy. Its first act is a tired office new hire setup that’s emblematic of the show’s self-aggrandizing cringe. Aside from being creeped out by the clichéd power dynamic of fish-out-of-water comedians having pretty women throwing themselves at them, the show fails at its own premise by not even being an entertaining manifestation of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever the rotating cast of comedians aren’t outright sabotaging the quality of the entire improv setup, leaving the actresses in a bind to play off them and at least make the best of their ad-libs, they’re either ruining scene setups by breaking the fourth wall, routinely calling out how stupid the show is, or, worse yet, using it as an excuse to be creepy toward the girls—turning potential good improv into cheap kisses that aren’t worth the show’s production or the high-brow Japanese actors they’re trying to bring credibility to the series with, like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0632804/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tokuma Nishioka</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susumu_Terajima" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Susumu Terajima</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamoru_Miyano" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mamoru Miyano</a> from <em>Death Note</em>, doing their best to carry the show’s ad-libbing on their backs.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, <em>Kiss or Die</em>’s relentless commentary from hosts Miyu Ikeda, Ken Yahagi, and Ryota Yamasato of <em>Terrace House</em> fame only undermines the actors for not playing along or breathlessly praises unearned scenes for being improvised. The one-note joke of comedians playing chicken with AV actresses quickly becomes old and overused, with increasingly lazy setups and repetitive bits aimed at trying to flirt with the comedians. It’s more painful to watch than an intentionally bad but funny moment, especially in its miserable second act.&nbsp;</p><p>So why watch six episodes of an unremarkable show I’ve written off as <em>Yakuza </em>eroge slop? Because, against all odds, <em>Kiss or Die</em> managed to eke out one saving grace—the improvisational brilliance of comedian Gekidan Hitori. His presence alone kept <em>Kiss or Die</em> from peaking too early and its finale from collapsing into a total crapshoot.&nbsp;</p><p>To my surprise, <em>Kiss or Die</em> revealed one glimmer of promise across its six episodes in its scenes between AV actress Nana Yagi and Hitori. While most pairings devolved into awkward skits with comedians either mugging for cheap laughs or trying to bait their scene partners into even raunchier territory, Hitori did the opposite. He dove headfirst into his character—a foolhardy CEO—and played the setup straight (or as straight as a comedic premise would), riffing off Yagi’s timid responses about liking books while she was blowing seductively in his ear. Instead of ignoring the ad-libbed prompt from Yagi, he would play off of it, interrupting her seduction with an impromptu timed presentation exercise to work on her shyness. Instead of breaking kayfabe by drawing attention to the show’s absurdity or forcing his scene partner to be even more lewd than the show called her to be in a scene, he built continuity.&nbsp;</p><p>That setup paid off brilliantly in the show’s most absurd twist: the women were all poisoned by a mysterious figure using them as weapons to trigger the comedians’ superpowers from their orphaned years. Apparently, the only way to activate their powers was through prolonged frustration, culminating in emotional and physical catharsis from a true love kiss. This kiss also served as a poison neutralizer, provided it was born from genuine love. While the other comedians phoned in weak justifications for their cheap kisses, Hitori brought back the earlier presentation motif, asking Yagi to list the things she loved about herself, saying, “You can’t love someone if they don’t love themselves first.” It was the only stroke of improv genius in a show predicated on its comedian’s ability to ad-lib, and it fucking landed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Everything else was a rinse-repeat cycle of cringe so grating that even the panel’s token female reactor, Ikeda, voiced her exhaustion of the rest of the show dragging on. Whenever Hitori wasn’t on screen, I was asking, “Where is Gekidan Hitori to right this sinking ship?” His theater chops and directorial instincts elevated every scene, pulling his co-stars into his orbit and giving them something actually to play off—not just endure—when the show finally dialed down its tired seduction farce and leaned into actual acting from all parties involved. With Hitori as a lightning rod, the rest of <em>Kiss or Die</em>’s cast started yes-anding each other, playing off cues, and delivering impassioned rebuttals that felt earned.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Gekidan Hitori is a goddamn actor.<span></span><span>Netflix. </span></figcaption></figure><p>No doubt, <em>Kiss or Die</em>, much like <em>Yakuza</em>, swings wildly between entertaining and insufferable. Its second act is especially rough, bogged down by convoluted plot points that should’ve given the cast more to chew on but instead exposed their limits. Yet through all the tonal whiplash and cringe, Hitori emerged as the show’s undeniable MVP, delivering the kind of clutch performance the series desperately needed.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Kiss or Die</em> ends on a tease for a potential second season. If that happens, I hope we get more Hitori as its leading man, and that the series learns from its plentiful misfires and builds something that leans into its rare highs while trimming the many lows that dragged it down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-problems-runback-criticism"><h3>I Love Silksong Even When It Bugs Me</h3></a><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is a once-in-a-generation platformer and a labor of love.

			<p>When indie developer Supergiant released the first Hades game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-damned-great/">out of early access in 2020</a>, it was nothing short of a masterpiece. An excellently crafted game that elevated rougelikes by weaving the storytelling and gameplay together in stronger and better ways than we'd previously seen in the genre.</p>



<p>It's a tightly made game, with incredible and twitchy action, a stunning visual language with evocative character and environmental design, and a wonderful score. It's very well written with strong voice performances to match, and above all else, it is an absolute blast. It was my personal pick for GOTY in 2020 and it remains one of the best games I've ever played. </p>



<p>At the time, none of that really surprised me. I've been playing <a href="http://wccftech.com/bastion-sells-500000-copies-wins-60-awards/">Supergiant-made games since Bastion</a>, and I know this is a studio that absolutely does not miss. I also knew that they had, at that point, never made a sequel to any of their games; they just moved on to a different project. I never yearned for a Hades 2, because I didn't expect it, and I just wanted another Supergiant game, whatever it happened to be.</p>

<p>Which is why I was both shocked and endlessly curious when Hades 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-announced-trailer/">was initially revealed</a>. It's the first time Supergiant is making a sequel to one of its games, and while the studio has proven to me that they can make a damn good video game at least four times over, a sequel adds a whole new set of expectations and concerns. Concerns that were quickly dashed, and expectations that were greatly surpassed the more I played Hades 2.</p>



<p>Before I continue, I should add a bit of context here. I know Hades 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-early-access-launch-full-release-2025/">launched in early access</a> last year, and that there are already a lot of people who have sunk dozens, if not hundreds, of hours into the early access version. I am not one of those people, for no reason other than the fact that I didn't play the first Hades until its v1.0 launch, so I wanted to have the same experience here. The only difference this time is that I played the first Hades game on my PC, before getting it on Nintendo Switch, whereas for this review, I've been playing Hades 2 on my Nintendo Switch, though I know I'll soon get it on my PC to play it with sharper graphics.</p>



<p>That's all to say that I shielded myself as best I could from any Hades 2 news and updates since May 2024. I'd heard good things from friends of mine who'd jumped into its early access version, but beyond that, I've been scrolling past anything Hades 2-related for more than a year to come to this v1.0 launch as fresh as possible.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Melinoë in Hades 2. Image credit: Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>So if you find yourself in the same boat as me, let me catch you up on where we find our protagonist, Melinoë, daughter of Hades, Princess of the Underworld, an immortal and extremely powerful witch taught by Hecate herself, at the beginning of the game. Chronos, the Titan of Time and father to the Olympians, has escaped his prison under Tartarus and returned to enact his vengeance on his children who sliced him to bits and scattered him across the Underworld, hoping they'd found a way to keep the deathless titan from coming back, since they couldn't necessarily kill him outright.</p>



<p>Melinoë never knew her father, her mother, or everyone's favourite Prince of the Underworld and her brother, Zagreus. She was still a baby when Chronos first attacked, taking the House of Hades for himself and ensnaring her faMelinoëmily. The all-powerful witch Hecate took her in and trained her from the moment she could walk for a single purpose: to kill Chronos.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Tartarus in Hades 2.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So once again, you're moving through the Underworld, though instead of trying to escape it, you're going the opposite way into its depths to find and defeat Chronos, and if you fail, you're sent back to this game's hub world, the Crossroads, a realm in between the Underworld and the Earth's surface. While there, you can unlock permanent upgrades with the resources you've acquired while out on a run, speak to various characters who will each deliver more of the game's narrative as you talk to them in between attempts, and practice with each weapon as you unlock the different Nocturnal Arms.</p>



<p>If you played Hades, then it's all old hat to you, as it was to me. But it's not just everything that was there before with a new coat of witchy paint, like how you unlock upgrades and progress key moments of the narrative by using the big caldron in the middle of the Crossroads and chanting a spell. What I quickly discovered was the running theme for Hades 2 compared to Hades 1: there is so much more to do and delve into.</p>



<p>First off, before even getting into how the build crafting that's possible in Hades 2 is far deeper than what it was in Hades 1, you don't have only one path when you go out on runs. Your main goal when you start the game is to head down into the Underworld and defeat Chronos, but you soon learn that the Olympians need help on Mount Olympus, and after a few runs, you discover the resources necessary to go up, towards Mount Olympus, instead of down into the Underworld.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Something is brewing on Mount Olympus.</figcaption></figure>



<p>You'll fight through four sections in the Underworld and four on your way to the top of Mount Olympus, making Hades 2 bigger than the first game just based on the number of areas you fight through. The areas also do more with the space, like how the Fields of Mourning are wide open spaces instead of a constant stream of close-quarters rooms, an element that the area boss also takes advantage of.</p>



<p>Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the boss fights in Hades 2 overall outshine the fights in Hades 1. They're still challenging skill checks that can send you back to the Crossroads before you know what happened, but the challenge ramp between them is paced out more thoughtfully and the design of the fights help encourage you to take advantage of all the new options you have in combat.</p>



<p>Regarding the rest of the combat, there's a solid amount of enemy variety, with only a few that feel exactly the same to fight compared to Hades 1. What's more interesting than their variety, though, is how Hades 2 pushes the combat into a slightly slower, more methodical direction. In Hades 1, you're constantly moving to avoid enemy attacks, while getting in your hits while you can. The same is true in Hades 2, but you have greater potential to combo your attacks, without the presence of boons, even, to deal huge amounts of damage.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Melinoë using the Witch's Staff in Hades 2. Image credit: Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Melinoë can cast a large circle around her that deals damage to enemies caught inside it and even traps them or slows them down, meaning you can catch an enemy chasing you while you then charge up a stronger attack to combo with your cast and hit multiple enemies at a time. You also have a mana bar on top of your health bar, which charts how much magic you have available to perform your cast, or a charged-up version of your main attack and/or special attack.</p>



<p>Melinoë's movement is also significantly shifted, because you no longer have to mash the dash button. She sprints when you hold it down, which seems like a small shift in the grand scheme of things but makes a massive difference compared to the first game and is a meaningful change that makes the combat in Hades 2 feel different while remaining familiar.</p>



<p>All of your six Nocturnal Arms weapons have non-charged and charged versions of your main attack and special attack, and you can cast your entrapment circle no matter which you're using. Of course, not all of them will be to everyone's tastes, but they're all viable in their own way. I'm personally partial to the Sister Blades, the Moonstone Axe and the Witch's Staff, in part because they are the ones I've spent the most time with, and I've found Aspect variations for each of them that I particularly enjoy.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Melinoë using the Umbral Flames in Hades 2. Image credit: Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Build crafting in Hades 2 goes far deeper than unlocking Aspects and levelling up your weapons, though. Of course, there are your boons that you'll acquire while you're out on runs, meeting new Olympians, and seeing design revisions of ones we were already familiar with in the first game. But your Arcana Cards and Animal Familiars, on top of the Keepsakes system from the first game, are significant and intuitive ways that let you shape your build and your run chances before you take your first steps on the path towards Tartarus or Mount Olympus.</p>



<p>Once you do take those steps, there are new Olympians you'll meet like Hestia, Goddess of the Hearth and my favourite symbol to see appear on a run, thanks to all of her boons being extremely useful for my preferred playstyle. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Hades 2 boons from Hermes.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are also new characters to meet in the middle of runs that grant you their own upgrades or boons, with a personal favourite being Arachne because she'll weave you a dress of armour that can make all the difference in a run, especially with her keepsake equipped.</p>



<p>Your Lunar boons (also called your Hex), granted by the Moon herself, are also one of my favourite changes to the boon system, with all of your strongest special abilities coming from her boons and opening up more space for boons from other characters you meet. Once you choose an ability, every time you meet her again on your path, you can upgrade it via a small skill tree that boosts it in different ways, depending on what you choose to unlock. It's another meaningful improvement on how your strongest attacks in the game work compared to Hades 1.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Frankly, I'm feeling hesitant to say too much because so much of the fun in rougelikes is discovering all of these new intricacies along the way for yourself, so I'll leave off by emphasizing that even after felling Chronos and reaching the peak of Olympus, when I thought I'd seen most of what the combat system and build crafting had to offer, there was still so much more to delve into. </p>



<p>It's astounding at the levels of depth available here for players who want to get into every nook and cranny of this game's combat, and what makes it all shine is how well executed and thought out it is, to go along with what I felt to be a much better-paced challenge ramp compared to Hades 1.</p>



<p>Moving away from the combat and to the story, again, I'm hesitant to really say anything because the fun is in the discovery, but I will say there are more surprises in Hades 2 than in Hades 1. Like who you meet when you get to the top of Olympus, which I won't spoil here. What I can say is that the voice acting and writing quality have remained at the same high level found in Hades, with Melinoë being a charming protagonist, even if she's a little more serious and less fast-and-loose compared to how Zagreus carried himself.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>I also have to call out the score, because it's once again a soundtrack that I know I will be listening to, as I have not stopped listening to the Hades 1 soundtrack since it became available. Darren Korb knocked it out of the park again.</p>



<p>Visually, I'm happy to say that, as someone who didn't buy a Nintendo Switch 2 for what I personally believe to be an exorbitant amount of money, Hades 2 looks and runs great on my OG Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite. I went back and forth between the two, playing in my preferred handheld mode over docking it on my TV, and it honestly made my Switch feel new again; it looked that good.</p>



<p>The painterly art style still pops, even at 720p, and it's a smooth 60 FPS the entire time. Sure, it'll look better on a Switch 2, and even better on a PC, but if all you have is your eight-year-old Nintendo Switch to play Hades 2 on, you can grab it with the confidence that it'll still be a good experience.</p>

<p>Overall, I really can't recommend Hades 2 enough. I already loved the first game, and went into this sequel curious as to what Supergiant making a sequel would look like. Now, I really don't want to be doing anything else other than playing Hades 2. I'd rather be playing Hades 2 than writing this sentence right now.</p>



<p>Supergiant doesn't miss, even when it comes to sequels. While Melinoë looks to the Moon and her light for guidance, I'll be looking towards Supergiant to guide me to whatever they do next.</p>

				<p>Hades 2 is a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further.</p>

			<p>The floor at Tokyo Game Show 2025 might not technically be open, but this year's annual event has already kicked off through the multiple showcases that have premiered, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-0-directors-cut-announced/">RGG Summit</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/">Kojima Productions Beyond the Strand presentation</a>. Today, you can add Capcom's presentation to the list, where a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming third-person action game, Pragmata, premiered, but it unfortunately did so without a proper release date.</p>



<p>The new trailer shows off what will be your shelter in Pragmata, a safe zone where you're able to have a rest between fights, and upgrade your armour and abilities. Your upgrades will let you deal more damage, and have Diana hack multiple enemies at once. You'll also be able to unlock new weapons at your shelter, all of which is pretty run-of-the-mill linear action game fare.</p>

<p>Its familiarity isn't a problem, of course, but it remains an upsetting fact that we don't have a proper date to look forward to. The trailer ends with its previously confirmed 2026 release window, while other major releases from Capcom, like Resident Evil Requiem, have had a date set for months now.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll get a proper release date reveal soon. When Pragmata <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-sci-fi-game-pragmata/">was first announced all the way back in 2020</a>, it was a big mystery project that we didn't really know much about. Then it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-gameplay-delay/">delayed, and the radio silence around it</a> started to feel like it would go down in history as a game that never actually made it out the door. </p>



<p>But now that it feels like it's actually close to release, and like it'll be an intriguing blend of quick puzzle solving and third-person shooting combat, it's all the more frustrating to still not have a date to look forward to.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/">Wccftech checked out Pragmata at Gamescom 2025</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote, "<em>While opinion is divided between action game fans regarding the game's unique combination of action and puzzle game elements, I feel that once PRAGMATA is in their hands sometime next year, the general consensus will be generally positive, expecially if the game's quality will be on the same level as that of the Gamescom 2025 demo.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced the Early Access release date for&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>fighter&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>, and if you want to check the game out, you'll be able to do so very shortly indeed.</p>

<p>As part of a new video detailing what's going on with the game,&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>executive producer Tom Cannon revealed that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" rel="nofollow">free-to-play two-on-two fighter</a> will launch on PC via Early Access on October 7th.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's no word yet on when you can expect the game to land on consoles, although it is due to launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as well as PC. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out when console players can curb stomp Yasuo to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>Each season will bring a new champion, and that includes Season 0, so there's still one more character to be announced for the game; Riot says you should keep an eye out for the trailer and dev update revealing that champ "soon".</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>launches in October, it will bring with it "a full season of content", including combo trials for each character to help you get to grips with their movesets.</p>

<p>Throughout the Early Access period, Riot says it will be introducing features like a battle pass and a ranked play system, as well as "balance tuning", which, if I know the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>community, will be heavily requested from day one.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>when it launches on PC via Early Access on October 7th. There's no word yet on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S release dates, so stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;Riot Games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>release date may have leaked ahead of a potential spot in today's PlayStation State of Play showcase, if two listings on Amazon Japan are to be believed.</p>

<p>While the listings have been removed, they weren't taken down quickly enough to avoid being spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, and they appear to point to a release date of February 6th for the upcoming Soulslike action RPG.</p>

<p>Listings for both the standard edition and the Treasure Box edition of&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>were spotted on Amazon Japan, and both of them bear the same release date.&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is currently slated for an early 2026 launch, so while these dates might be placeholders, they feel a little too specific for that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nioh-3-release-date-amazon-japan-leak-boss.jpg?itok=vPhbEpQk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nioh-3-release-date-amazon-japan-leak-boss.jpg?itok=yk4uJj15 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is launching this February.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're interested,&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>'s Treasure Box edition will apparently include goodies like an art book, a soundtrack CD, and a furry key chain (that's a key chain with fur on it, rather than the alternative).</p>

<p>While it hasn't been confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>will feature during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-confirmed" rel="nofollow">today's State of Play show</a>, the game is currently a PlayStation 5 console exclusive, and Amazon Japan listings appearing now (and then being removed) seems to suggest that they were supposed to go live following an announcement.</p>

<p>It's possible that&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>'s release date will instead be announced during tomorrow's Koei Tecmo Tokyo Game Show program, which will be dedicated to&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>, although a release date reveal during State of Play followed by a TGS gameplay deep dive seems more likely to me.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's the third game in Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja's&nbsp;<em>Nioh&nbsp;</em>series, which marries fast-paced hack-and-slash gameplay with Soulslike exploration and boss battles.</p>




<p><em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is set for release sometime early next year (and probably on February 6th) for PC and PlayStation 5. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/genshin-impact-to-honkai-nexus-anima-can-hoyo-fans-keep-up</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/from-genshin-impact-to-honkai-nexus-anima-can-hoyo-fans-keep-up.1306965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As <em>Genshin Impact</em>'s fifth anniversary draws near, it's clear that HoYoverse has big plans in store for their most prolific game. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-luna-i" rel="nofollow">The Song of the Welkin Moon arc has only just begun with the Luna I update</a>, but it's a strong indicator of where the developers plan to take <em>Genshin </em>in the coming years.</p>

<p>Surface-level improvements include more expressive character animations, more visually distinct playable areas and NPCs within the same region, and being able to interact with playable characters in the open world via the Anecdotes system.</p>

<p>Chances are that there are behind-the-scenes upgrades too as new characters are starting to get their own unique elemental sub-reactions, bosses are getting more complicated mechanics, and there's even going to be a brand new game mode called "Miliastra Wonderland" where players can create custom game modes and maps for others to enjoy.</p>

<p>Given that <em>Genshin's</em> Luna I update comes with the caveat of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">ceasing operations for the PS4 version of the game</a>, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to claim that it is also&nbsp;a modernization package in disguise. While the limitations of mobile hardware will likely prevent the developers from going too crazy, this does suggest that HoYoverse wants Genshin to be their "big tent" game with a bit of something for everyone.&nbsp;</p>




<h2><em>Genshin Impact</em>&nbsp;| The Only One Who Can Kill Me is Me</h2>

<p>Ironically, the biggest speed bump in <em>Genshin Impact's</em> new era is going to be HoYoverse itself. Currently, HoYoverse is running five different live-service games at once. When <a href="https://hna.hoyoverse.com/en-us" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em></a> releases in the future, there are going to be six concurrently running live-service games that will likely have a significant amount of audience overlap.</p>

<p>Most of the promotional material for <em>Nexus Anima</em> shows that it's going to bring together characters from all of HoYoverse's IPs. The obvious problem is that with six different games running at once, fans are going to have to start rationing their time more aggressively.</p>

<p>Of course, no one is forcing anyone to play all six games at once. If we are limiting the discussion to <em>Genshin Impact</em>, <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a>, and <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>, one can feasibly play all three without much trouble. That's (presumably) not an entirely realistic picture of the games' audience though. Chances are that most people are playing other games at the same time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-talent-mat-domain.jpg?itok=PNkuGSed 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-talent-mat-domain.jpg?itok=ElMoOmDI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guess everyone will have to wait until Sunday for their materials.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Genshin Impact |&nbsp;</em>Farming Isn't Much, But It's Honest Work&nbsp;</h2>

<p>HoYoverse would probably love it if people took breaks from games developed by other studios, but that seems unlikely. Even with the Luna I update, <em>Genshin </em>retains some odd mechanics that other HoYoverse games have seemingly abandoned. The most annoying example would probably be how the developers insist on locking character and weapon upgrade materials to certain days of the week.</p>

<p>Smaller, otherwise inconsequential annoyances build up over time as well. <em>Genshin </em>still lacks a stamina overflow mechanic. You have to manually convert resin to Condensed Resin, albeit at better rates with the Luna I update. You can't directly upgrade lower tier materials into higher tier materials from the character screen. There's no way to downgrade higher tier materials either.</p>

<p>There's also the fact that you have to manually collect character level-up materials, another practice that has been minimized with HoYoverse's subsequent games. Granted, this is more of a quirk of open-world games more than a fault of <em>Genshin </em>itself, yet all signs point to <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> having its own open-world portion to some degree.</p>

<p>If <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> is swooping in with its own open world with potentially improved comparable features, then <em>Genshin's</em> main selling point might start to look like an inconvenience. People will still play <em>Genshin </em>for the story or the user-generated content, but if building characters becomes a hassle, then they might not really bother with farming enemies and collecting random flowers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-nod-krai-fatui-boss_0.jpg?itok=s7-UmxTq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-nod-krai-fatui-boss_0.jpg?itok=aljE2gpz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At least you can brute force his shields... for now.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Genshin Impact |&nbsp;</em>HP Inflation? In This Economy? It's More Likely Than You Think</h2>

<p>If people aren't putting in the effort to build characters, then that would imply that they don't really need to play the endgame modes to completion, and if they're not playing the endgame modes, then there's less of a need to pull characters. Pulling characters for their open world mobility is an option, although whether this represents a sizable portion of the audience is anyone's guess.</p>

<p>Something has to make way eventually. <em>Honkai: Star Rail's</em> combat can be entirely automated. <em>Zenless Zone Zero's </em>non-endgame activities let you spend an entire day's worth of stamina in literal seconds. You could build up endgame-ready characters almost passively in both games and then focus on the story or events. <em>Genshin </em>has no such luxury, and it's starting to become quite noticeable now thanks to both Imaginarium Theater and the Luna I era of boss mechanics.</p>

<p>It's not as if HoYoverse is allergic to porting mechanics from one game to another. The ability to build your own Artifact didn't originate from <em>Genshin</em>, and <em>Genshin's </em>improvements to the mechanic has made its way to other HoYoverse games to some degree. The same goes for the in-game character guides and the Anecdotes feature.</p>

<p>Alternatively, HoYoverse may be counting on<em> Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> to pressure <em>Genshin's</em> player base to spend more. If there's less time to play, then people might be willing to part with some money to bypass the more tedious activities so that they can concentrate on story and endgame activities. The mechanism already exists in the game, people just have to be desperate enough to spend.</p>




<h2><em>Genshin Impact |&nbsp;</em>Hold Up, Let HoYo Cook</h2>

<p>None of this precludes the existence of a middle ground. <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> may have open world elements, but its core gameplay loop appears to revolve around minigames and autochess. Neither particularly encroaches upon <em>Genshin's&nbsp;</em>territory, and it's hard to imagine a scenario where autochess requires any huge commitment of time or attention.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as we've seen with the release of&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> and <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, people can just bounce around and take breaks whenever there's a relative lull in content. You might miss out on some premium currency or an event here and there, but if you're planning to play these games over the course of years then it's almost irrelevant.</p>

<p>Regardless, HoYoverse might want to consider ironing out some of <em>Genshin Impact's</em> more annoying quirks to keep people happy in the long run. The Luna I update is certainly a step in the right direction, offering both meaningful content and mechanics that can be used to reduce the tedium of farming (albeit only in the current event).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The real test would be when&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em>&nbsp;releases. Will people stay with <em>Genshin Impact</em> in spite of its somewhat archaic approach to character building, among other annoyances, or will&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>be a good enough open-world replacement? Or will both games be able to coexist? Even if players can manage with an additional game, what about the next game, or the one after that? Only time will tell.</p>
