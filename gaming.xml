		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-sacred-tree">Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</a> shows a side of Bandai Namco that we don’t always see. Sure, this is an anime-flavoured Japan-centric roguelike brawler, but it’s one that’s priced as a smaller indie title, and it is doing things just that little bit differently. Personally, I think we could do with more of this kind of thing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree - Guardian Trailer 3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D87bFNKiKS0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The village of Shinju, named after the benevolent god who watches over it, is home to Towa. A being that is neither human nor god, Towa lives as the village guardian, protecting and nurturing the inhabitants of the village. Shinju remains an idyllic haven until Magatsu arrives. Alongside an army of monstrous Magaori, Magatsu spreads his miasma across the land, poisoning and corrupting everything that lies before him.</p>


<p>Towa, with eight chosen ‘prayer children’ from the village, sets forth against the forces of evil, wielding the Sword of Ablution and the staff of Divination, both of which allow her to tackle the monsters and the corruption that lie before her.</p>
<p>That said, it’s not Towa you directly take control of. You actually control one of the Prayer Children – starting out with Rekka in our hands-on – but Towa is tethered to you, following you into battle, while you protect them from harm.</p>

<p>Combat isn’t quite as you’d expect either, with Rekka carrying two swords, each of which have a finite amount of energy. When you’ve used up the energy, the damage from that sword will halve, forcing you to swap to the other option. Each has specific qualities, and ranges, so you have to plan ahead as you face each foe. It takes some getting used to, with early encounters feeling a bit clunky as you consistently ‘break’ each sword over and over again, but you soon find the rhythm of attacks, and start to learn how to use each one effectively.</p>

<p>Besides your standard attacks, there’s also special abilities which are provided by your support character. Towa is able to cast a zone of protection that freezes enemies, or summon a giant hand to bash the bad guys with. Dodging plays an important role too, made somewhat easier by enemy attacks being displayed via glowing area-of-effect zones.</p>
<p>Defeating all the enemies in an area will drop some kind of reward, with Graces enhancing a character’s attributes, or ores being usable in crafting back at the village. These rewards get better based on your performance, and you’re given a selection to choose from so you can tailor your character through your run – or Journey as the game calls them. Graces come in different levels too, so if you’re lucky you might find an Epic move nestling amongst more ordinary ones.</p>
<p>Once you’ve made it through the opening moments, you can assemble a team of two from the eight Prayer Children. Each of them has their own look, weaponry and abilites, but one member of the team must be the Tsurugi, the main attacker, while the other becomes the Kagura, who supports them with spells. You can switch it so the Kagura stays in place, though the Tsurugi can only go a limited distance from the Kagura.</p>

<p>Playing solo sees you controlling both as a team, and you tend to find that the Kagura ultimately loses a lot of health as they’re not your primary focus, and they don’t quite dash in time with your main character. It feels as though the designers really want you to play in co-op, and fortunately there’s both local and online options to make that possible. It definitely makes the game easier, and you only have the one character to worry about.</p>
<p>As a roguelike, runs feel fairly familiar, with each area housing a small number of enemies or a boss, and collecting better abilities and more power the further you go. I like that you can see the different rewards across each route, but otherwise this remains about making yourself as powerful as possible, while collecting permanent upgrades for further runs.</p>
<p>There’s plenty to keep you busy outside of the Journeys when you return to the village. Forging new swords is a key task, and it presents you with a minigame that lets you design and customise your own blade. It’s a little unclear what you’re doing – it should have a tutorial for all of the sections the first time you do it – but once you’ve got the hang of it, it’s an intriguing task. Swords can be equipped by all characters so that removes any issues with swapping between them, but upgrades are limited, so you will need to focus on your favourites from the roster and their upgrade trees ahead of everyone else.</p>

<p>There’s some interesting differences between the in-game visuals and the artwork from the cutscenes. Where the in-game action is an attractive, isometric-view anime battler, the cutscenes boast traditonal Japanese art, evoking a more realistic and human approach. There’s then further comic-like art during the fully-voiced character conversations, and while all of them look fantastic in their own way, there’s some visual dissonance to the way that each character is perceived. Towa in particular is pictured in the cutscenes as a powerful goddess, in traditional Japanese garb, while the in-game version of her comes across as a mildly annoying traditional anime girl. It doesn’t detract from the action, but it’s an odd choice.<br>
That said, I really like the design of the eight Prayer Children, especially the adorably huge canine Bampuku who makes a great companion for the Carp-like Nishiki.</p>
<p>Towa and the Gaurdians of the Sacred Tree makes a good first impression, and the giant boss characters you face along the way add a real sense of scale to the action. The story and characters are interesting, and the action sufficiently unique, to immediately draw you in and, with the game launching on 18th September, I’m looking forward to spending more time with them through the coming weeks.</p>

No release date or window has been shared, but we'll be getting an official announcement at Gamescom 2025, which kicks off tomorrow (19th August).</p>
<p>And, yes, the wording is just 'Nintendo" an not Switch or Switch 2, so we have no idea if the game is coming to one or both consoles. If we had to guess, it's <em>probably</em> aiming for Switch 2, but that's just speculation.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gukmiw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Shenmue III Enhanced is exactly what it sounds like — an upgraded version of the long-awaited 2019 Shenmue sequel created by former Sega legend Yu Suzuki. This version will bring upgraded graphics, gameplay tweaks, and improvements to character interactions.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of all the upgrades:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Enhanced Graphics &amp; Performance</strong> – Sharper textures, richer details, faster load times, and smoother gameplay.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>4K Texture Uplift</strong> – Refined, more detailed environments and characters.<br>
<strong>- DLSS/FSR Support</strong> – High-quality upscaling without sacrificing performance (supported platforms only).<strong><br>
-</strong> <strong>Increased NPC Density</strong> – The city village Niaowu feels more alive with more characters populating the streets.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Classic Camera Mode</strong> – An optional camera perspective inspired by <em>Shenmue I &amp; II</em>, alongside the modern view.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Gameplay Tweaks</strong> – Optional stamina system adjustments, health restoration before fights, and reduced money barriers for smoother progression.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Improved Interactions</strong> – Cutscene and conversation skip options, expanded QTE timing window for more accessible gameplay.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Menu &amp; UX Enhancements</strong> – Streamlined navigation and helpful purchase alerts.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Optionality First</strong> – All major changes can be toggled to preserve the original experience for purists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally announced at E3 2015 as a Kickstarter project, Shenmue III released to mixed reviews four years later on; some loved that it stayed faithful to the Dreamcast originals, while others were frustrated with the lack of changes and the story. Our sister site Push Square rather enjoyed it for what it is, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/shenmue_iii">scoring the game a 7/10</a>.</p>
<p>ININ Games has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/shenmue-iii-on-switch-2-publishers-latest-tease-suggests-it-might-be-happening">teasing this announcement for some time</a>, so we're glad the wait is over! Now, to see what it looks like at Gamescom, then.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-is-europe%E2%80%99s-best-selling-new-game-of-2025-so-far.1272729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In what feels like the greatest period of turmoil for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/">Ubisoft</a> in the company's history, Assassin's Creed Shadows continues to be the bright spark of life that the company needs, as a new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-no1">The Game Business</a> (backed by numbers from Europe's <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">Game Sales Data</a> firm) names it the best-selling new game in Europe in 2025 so far.</p>



<p>To clarify, Shadows is, at the time of this writing, the best-selling PC and console title in Europe of all the games released in 2025. It's not the best-selling game overall, since that marker unsurprisingly goes to last year's EA Sports FC 25, which will likely hold the title until <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/">EA Sports FC 26</a> next month. But as of right now, Assassin's Creed Shadows stands above games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-drive-another-record-year-for-capcom/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, and every other major release you can think of from this year so far.</p>



<p>In fact, according to GSD figures, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/">Split-Fiction</a> is the only game to get close to Shadows as far as 2025 releases are concerned. The next-closest is Monster Hunter Wilds, and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-early-digital-sales-toby-fox-deltarune/">Mario Kart World</a>, which is followed by Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Oblivion Remastered, and Nightreign after that. Out of the top-20 best-selling games in Europe for 2025 so far, including games released last year and older, Split-Fiction, Wilds, World, Deliverance II, Oblivion Remastered, Nightreign, and Shadows are the only seven games released in 2025 to make the list.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the list not released in 2025 are <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a>, which is having an incredible year despite being nearly eight years old at this point, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege, which is enjoying a boost from Ubisoft revamping it with <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/">Rainbow Six Siege X.</a></p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top-20 best-selling games in Europe on PC and consoles according to GSD, per The Game Business: </p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 25</li>



<li>Assassin's Creed Shadows</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Split-Fiction</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>



<li>Mario Kart World</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</li>



<li>Star Wars Battlefront II</li>



<li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li>



<li>It Takes Two</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto Online</li>



<li>NBA 2K25</li>



<li>F1 25</li>



<li>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege</li>



<li>Mario Kart 8: Deluxe</li>



<li>Battlefield 1</li>
</ol>



<p>Of course, it's worth remembering that this is just what the sales charts for Europe's PC and console videogame releases look like so far. Those are the key words here, because by the end of this year, it's doubtful that Shadows will be able to hold onto that top spot for 2025 releases. Not just because EA Sports FC 26 is on the horizon, but because FC 26 is coming, and this year's new Call of Duty, and Battlefield 6, and Borderlands 4, and Ghost of Yotei, and Pokemon Legends Z-A, and The Outer Worlds 2 - and those are just some of the big autumn-to-winter-timed games we know about that have release dates.</p>



<p>We'll see what this top-20 list looks like in a few months' time. But for now, Ubisoft can enjoy its moment at the top.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shenmue-iii-enhanced-wants-to-be-the-definitive-shenmue-iii-experience.1272726/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shenmue&nbsp;</em>auteur Yu Suzuki and his studio Ys Net have announced&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced</em>, a...well...enhanced re-release of&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>that brings visual and gameplay improvements aplenty.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/shenmue-iii-enhanced-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-nintendo-and-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced&nbsp;</em>is slated for release on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and "Nintendo" at some point in the future. No release date was revealed, and it's not specified whether "Nintendo" refers to both Switch 2 and the original Switch or just one of the two.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced&nbsp;</em>will bring improved visuals and performance, complete with 4K textures, support for DLSS and FSR on PC, and increased NPC density to help Niaowu feel "more alive with more characters populating the streets".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shenmue-iii-enhanced-edition-landscape.jpg?itok=UUdDARBq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shenmue-iii-enhanced-edition-landscape.jpg?itok=g0Xn-Hev 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>is getting a re-release in future, and it'll bring improvements galore.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just the visuals getting some love, though. Ys Net is also promising gameplay tweaks, including a new "classic" camera mode that brings&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III</em>'s gameplay perspective closer to that of its predecessors.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to stamina system adjustments, Ryo's health being restored before fights, and "reduced money barriers for smoother progression", as well as the opportunity to skip certain cutscenes and conversations.</p>

<p>All of the gameplay improvements promised by&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>can be switched off if you want the original gameplay experience, though, so if you just want to enjoy the game with its new and improved visuals, you can do that as well.</p>

<p>If you missed out on&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>the first time, it's the long-awaited sequel to 2001's&nbsp;<em>Shenmue II</em>. Launching <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shenmue-iii-release-date-delayed-three-months-to-november" rel="nofollow">eighteen years after that game</a>, it continues the story of protagonist Ryo Hazuki, who's on the hunt for his father's murderer.</p>




<p>Many of&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced</em>'s additions have seemingly been introduced to combat much of the criticism of the original game, including its slow pace, gated money grinds, and frustrating combat.</p>

<p>If you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>before the enhanced version launches, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/878670/Shenmue_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-CUSA12289_00-SHENMUEIII0000US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>.

All that’s left are Jolteon and Flareon, then all the current versions of Eevee’s evolution line will have joined the roster.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon Trading Card Game</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Worlds | TCG | New Mega Evolution Pokémon ex Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9uj-A1J_rf0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Outside of the mobile app, the regular </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> TCG is also featuring Mega Evolutions pretty heavily next year.

<p>The 2026 Street Fighter 6 movie is shaping up nicely. Cody Rhodes has been touted as one of the big-name stars set to light up the Street Fighter stage, and while it’s not official, we think we’ve gotten an idea of how Guile could look, presumably, with Cody playing (and looking) the part.</p>



<p>It’s not uncommon for WWE superstars to transition from the hallowed grounds of the squared circle to the silver screen. The likes of Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, and Rowdy Roddy Piper famously paved the way. Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson was the one to make the complete leap from professional wrestler to actor.</p>



<p>Others have followed suit—such as John Cena—and the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-has-reportedly-lined-up-chun-li-balrog-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Street Fighter</a> movie could catapult Cody Rhodes into greater superstardom.</p>

<p>Actor and comedian <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andrewschulz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Andrew Schulz</a> is playing Dan in the Street Fighter movie. They recently took to their personal Instagram page to share a story showing the shadow of someone sporting an iconic hairstyle—Guile from Street Fighter.</p>



<p>Guile’s inverted shaven style is equal parts bizarre and legendary. I’ve never tried to replicate it, and it’s not something I’m going to try—although it’s nothing a few cans of hairspray couldn’t sort.</p>



<p>Again, we’ve not had official confirmation that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-casts-m-bison-and-eyes-wwes-cody-rhodes-for-guile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cody Rhodes is playing Guile</a>. Eagle-eyed fans can infer this to be the case if they look at the song mentioned in the IG story. If you didn’t know, Kingdom by Downstait is Rhodes’ famous theme song he’s used for years. Put 2 and 2 together, and I think we get the picture.</p>

<p>The Street Fighter Movie cast also features more rumors and confirmed names, including Jason Momoa, 50 Cent, and fellow WWE star Roman Reigns.</p>



<p>Will the Street Fighter movie be a knockout? Or will it be a swing and a miss? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Daggerfall </em>certainly has '90s DOS RPG charm in spades.

<p>Ostensibly, C:\ArsGames is to some extent about actually driving a few game purchases, but in reality it's mostly an excuse for me and my colleagues to wax nostalgic about the games that were formative for us. Case in point: This entry in our ongoing series with GOG is about a game that's completely free. I think Ars can withstand this tiny revenue shortfall for the sake of peak nostalgia!</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons I chose <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fthe_elder_scrolls_chapter_ii_daggerfall"><em>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</em></a> this time around: its co-creator, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/julian-lefay-the-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-has-passed-away-at-59/">Julian LeFay, recently passed away</a>, so it seemed timely. Also, it was one of the defining games of my youth—one I have continued to revisit now and then.</p>
<p>But it's also interesting because of where its developer, Bethesda—a studio people both love and hate—is at today. Going back to <em>Daggerfall</em>, we find a game that shows off so much of what we've lost from the bygone era of '90s PC gaming, but also one that makes it abundantly clear why the industry left those sensibilities behind.</p>
<p>I'll spoil the conclusion though: I still love this game. It's profoundly not for everybody, but it's definitely for me.</p>
<h2>The kids don’t get it</h2>
<p>OK, so we've established that I love <em>Daggerfall</em>. Knowing Ars Technica's readership, some of you probably do too. So who, exactly, doesn't like it?</p>
<p>Just search YouTube and you'll find a bunch of videos with titles like:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdaxG_bFASk&amp;pp=ygUQdHJpZWQgZGFnZ2VyZmFsbA%3D%3D">I FORCED myself to play Daggerfall in 2025</a>"</li>
<li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7NejhzVz3M&amp;t=537s&amp;pp=ygUQdHJpZWQgZGFnZ2VyZmFsbA%3D%3D">Skyrim Player Tries Daggerfall (It Goes Terribly)</a>"</li>
<li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPZ0nYJM4XM&amp;pp=ygUQdHJpZWQgZGFnZ2VyZmFsbA%3D%3D">I really tried. But I can't play Daggerfall anymore.</a>"</li>
</ul>
<p>Ouch. That's rough. Granted, one of those isn't actually negative if you sit through the video, but it still acknowledges that it's not easily accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>Look, I get it.&nbsp;<em>Daggerfall</em> hails from an era when "game design" primarily meant "experiment with programming techniques to come up with cool, unproven stuff no one's seen before" rather than "meticulously craft a conveyor belt of nonstop fun via proven formulae."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Those experiments are all exciting and interesting, and it's refreshing to go back to an RPG from this era that was willing to try some wild ideas and deep systems, as opposed to most (not all!) RPGs today, which seem to have the same basic format with talent trees and so on.</p>
<p>I love that <em>Daggerfall</em> includes odd mechanics that you don't often see in RPGs, like climbing. I like its vast world and accurate representation of most wilderness as meaningless liminal space. I think its opaque and sometimes maddening faction reputation systems are fascinating. Its character progression system is detailed and interesting.</p>

      I know this is already what the game is best known for, but I'd be remiss if I didn't note that the scope of the game's map is <em>staggering</em>.

<p>For me, the most frustrating aspect to <em>Daggerfall</em> is not its jazzy mechanics. It's the mechanics that aren't explained at all.</p>
<p>For example, in the playthrough I started to refresh my memory for this article, I spent a couple of hours doing quests in Wayrest, one of the most prominent cities in the game. Everything seemed to be fine as I rode my horse around town helping people out, training my skills, and buying new gear. But then a guard ran up to me and arrested me for assault. Who did I assault? I had no idea, but I pled guilty in order to get a softer sentence, even though I was pretty sure I wasn't <em>actually</em> guilty.</p>
<p>I wrote that off as a fluke, but then it happened again: assault. And a third time, again assault. I couldn't fathom why I kept getting arrested.</p>
<p>To DuckDuckGo I went for a quick Internet search to see if anyone else was having this problem. It was pretty common, and the cause was something I never would have imagined: I had been riding my horse around the town, galloping for speed to complete quests faster. It turns out that galloping too close to wandering NPCs in the street registers as assault, with penalties of up to a month in prison and hefty fines.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>There was no feedback about this when it was happening. I didn't even know I was doing it. I don't specifically remember having this problem back in the '90s, but it seems likely I did, and I must have just shrugged it off, because back then I would have had no way of figuring out what was going on.</p>
<p>I get why this sort of thing is a big barrier to new players, but I also think some of the YouTubers I watched applied a double standard. One complained that the game doesn't explain itself, but then in the same video extolled the virtues of <em>Minecraft</em>—a game that explains itself even less.</p>

<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>

      Save early and save often. That was ingrained in me by '90s gaming. Watching some of the YouTubers take this game on, it stressed me out how little they saved.

<p>It may be that we're more patient with learning games when we're kids. I played <em>Daggerfall</em> as a kid (well, a young teenager) so I'm relatively chill about its opaqueness and idiosyncrasies. That YouTuber played <em>Minecraft</em> as a kid, so that's the one he's willing to gloss over.</p>
<p>If you're willing to spend a lot of time on wikis (just like with <em>Minecraft</em>) then <em>Daggerfall</em> as a lot to offer to those who are patient. I often feel the most engaging games in the long run are ones that have a steeper learning curve up front.</p>
<h2>The unspoken spiritual successor</h2>
<p>Of course, it's not just the learning curve or opaque mechanics that are an issue for many players. A lot of people don't like <em>Daggerfall</em>'s procedurally generated world and quests—especially players who are used to <em>Skyrim</em>'s more hand-crafted environments and quest lines.</p>
<p>Yes, <em>Skyrim</em> has "Radiant Quests," which resemble <em>Daggerfall</em>'s. But with the exception of a relatively small number of main story missions, <em>Daggerfall</em> only has what <em>Skyrim</em> calls Radiant quests.</p>
<p>A loose modern analogue to that is <em>Elite Dangerous</em>, which has no meaningful story content at all. Some people might be more comfortable calling that a simulation than a game.</p>
<p>But there's another modern space title that has some strong resemblances to <em>Daggerfall</em>: Bethesda's own <em>Starfield</em>. As with <em>Daggerfall</em>, <em>Starfield</em> has a small cohort of obsessive fans amidst a much larger crowd that thinks it's just terrible.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>When people bought <em>Starfield</em>, they were expecting <em>Skyrim</em> in space. I believe that one of the reasons a lot of people were disappointed was that they actually got <em>Daggerfall</em> in space, and that's a very different experience.</p>
<p>Like <em>Daggerfall</em> and <em>Elite Dangerous</em>, <em>Starfield</em> not only accepts but even centers the notion that most of the environments are filled with, well, not a whole lot. It accurately reflects what space or wilderness actually are and makes much of the game a slow-paced mood piece rather than a constant dopamine dispenser.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p><em>Starfield</em> has some structural and design similarities to <em>Daggerfall</em>.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Most of <em>Starfield</em>'s dungeons are randomized. It's more about taking in the vibes and playing with the systems than it is about following an authored narrative—though <em>Starfield</em> does have an authored narrative. (It's just not the game's strongest suit, so it explains why people who are looking for that aren't big fans.)</p>
<p>Granted, there's little crossover between the original <em>Daggerfall</em> team and the folks who made <em>Starfield</em>. <em>Daggerfall</em> was pre-Todd Howard-as-creative-director and pre-Emil Pagliarulo, the two main creative leaders at Bethesda Game Studios since the <em>Morrowind</em> days.</p>
<p>But that's why it's all the more surprising that <em>Starfield</em> is, at best, a hybrid of the sensibilities of <em>Daggerfall</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>. Given those YouTubers trying and failing to play <em>Daggerfall</em> in 2025, it's no wonder that <em>Starfield</em> didn't land for a lot of people.</p>
<p>(I quite like it, personally, but I also like <em>Daggerfall</em>, so I'm either a masochist, old and archaic, or just plain wrong, depending on who you ask.)</p>

<h2>A pure expression of one of gaming’s oldest dreams</h2>
<p>There has long been a recurring dream in PC gaming of one super game that would allow you to fully live out a particular fantasy life of your choosing. Whether it was intended by developers, promised in marketing, or just in hopeful players' heads, there's an appeal to the idea of living an alternate existence in a sophisticated simulated world that's so immersive in its escapism that you reliably forget your real life for hours on end. The idea is "I want to be a space trader," or "I want to be a wandering fantasy adventurer," and the game gives you a toolkit that's both wide and deep to experience that entirely on your own terms.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>A lot of times, the titles that went for this on some level seemed more like simulations than games or stories. They were less consistently fun than other games, but they were often profoundly ambitious.</p>
<p>Since they were all about helping a player live out something in their imaginations, they were also prone to viscerally negative reactions at launch from people who had personal expectations that didn't map to the reality of what a game can actually do or chooses to focus on. (This continues today: look at the reactions to <em>No Man's Sky</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and yes, <em>Starfield</em>.)</p>
<p><em>Daggerfall</em> is one of those games. It is not for everybody. But for that niche group of players who are up for something jazzy and simulation-y that takes risks to let them live an alternate fantasy life that's as much in their head canon as on the screen, it's one of the best games of all time.</p>
<p>I strongly believe it's important to judge a game (or any other art or media) more on whether it achieves what it's <em>going for</em> than whether it meets whatever external expectations you might bring to it. If you agree, then that puts <em>Daggerfall</em> in a better position than if you have a more prescriptive attitude about game design.</p>
<p>The fidelity expectations of modern AAA titles and accompanying scope and cost make the kind of experimental, life-sim focus of a game like <em>Daggerfall</em> all but impossible to pursue now, but I miss it. Personally, I'll usually take a deeply flawed work of sheer ambition over a retread of proven ideas I've already experienced before, no matter how skillfully crafted and consistently fun the latter is.</p>
<p>Yeah, I enjoy a good formula game now and then; my point was exactly that when I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-dad-rock-of-video-games-and-i-love-it/">wrote about <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a> a few months ago. But as much as I have enjoyed&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, it won't stick with me for 30 years.&nbsp;<em>Daggerfall</em> has, and revisiting it this week, I can see that's not purely because of nostalgia. It represents a maximalist philosophy of game design I feel is sorely underrepresented in today's market.</p>

      The Unity version of <em>Daggerfall</em> installs on top of a normal DOS installation, and it makes the game much, much more playable in 2025, with additions like long view distances.

                <p>A Nintendo Direct has been scheduled for tomorrow--the third one in the past month--this time focusing on a single game: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kirby-air-riders/">Kirby Air Riders</a>. Much like how his Super Smash Bros. Ultimate presentations went, game director Masahiro Sakurai will be hosting this particular Direct.</p><p>According to the livestream's description, it will "provide an in-depth look at the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game," and will be roughly 45 minutes long, which is longer than both of the previous two Directs combined. It kicks off at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET / 2 PM BST, and you'll be able to watch it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtkHiB7WKf4">Nintendo's official YouTube channel</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Kirby Air Riders – Official Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Kirby Air Riders was announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-is-getting-a-kirby-air-ride-sequel/1100-6530561/">back in April</a> during a Nintendo Direct that revealed a bevy of Nintendo Switch 2 games, though at the time all that was shown off was a pre-rendered trailer. Not much is known about this sequel, but with tomorrow's Direct running at around 45 minutes, that will soon change. The game will also mark the first time Sakurai has directed a Kirby title since the original Air Rider for the GameCube.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo hasn't held a traditional Direct since its full Switch 2 reveal, instead opting for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/">Partner Showcase in July</a> and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-showcase-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6861/">Indie World Showcase</a> earlier this month. The Partner Showcase didn't have too many massive reveals, though it did include a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-announced-coming-to-switch-2-next-year/1100-6533579/">new Monster Hunter Stories</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/once-upon-a-katamari-revealed-gets-october-release-date/1100-6533587/">Katamari</a>, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-trailer-shows-partner-attacks-and-more/1100-6533582/">fresh look at Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. The Indie World Showcase was on the quieter side too, but still well worth a look for some neat upcoming titles.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced that a Kirby Air Riders Direct will air tomorrow, 19th August. The video presentation will be approximately 45 minutes long and deliver info on the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> exclusive.</p>
<p>The news of the Direct was posted on Nintendo Today, the publisher's mobile app.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tune in tomorrow Tuesday, August 19th at 2pm UK time for a livestreamed Kirby Air Riders Direct featuring about 45 minutes of information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game.</p></blockquote>
<p>Very little on the game has been revealed so far, although we got this description on the game's listing on <a href="http://nintendo.com/">Nintendo.com</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kirby Air Riders, a brand new title originated from the Nintendo GameCube classic racing-action game Kirby Air Ride, is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 this year – directed by Masahiro Sakurai.</p></blockquote>
<p>A trailer for Kirby Air Riders was released back in April. The trailer, which you can watch below, doesn't give much away, and we've had to wait four months to get new info on the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> open beta is over at the time of this writing, ending just hours prior to this post, and as far as we know right now, we won't get another chance to play it until it launches this coming October 10, 2025. But if you can't wait that long and want more Battlefield right now, EA has released a new update for Battlefield 2042 to help tide you over until October.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-9-2-0">Update 9.2</a> for Battlefield 2042 adds a new fan-favorite map to the 2021 release, Iwo Jima, a map that is new to the last major release in the Battlefield series, but veterans of the shooter will recognize from multiple entries, including Battlefield V, Battlefield 1942, and Battlefield 1943. You'll enter the fight from the sea with boat landings, and jump into close-quarters fighting in the bunkers and trenches with an active volcano in the background to complete the grandeur of Iwo Jima.</p>



<p>The update also includes two new weapons and vehicles for players to check out: the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle. The two new vehicles are two new fighter jets, the A10 Warthog and the SU-25TM Frogfoot.</p>

<p>Along with the new map, weapons, and vehicles, EA is also adding a free battle pass that runs right up to Battlefield 6's release, titled the Road to Battlefield Battle Pass, which includes 60 tiers of cosmetics for players to earn, celebrating previous Battlefield titles stretching all the way back to Battlefield Bad Company 2.</p>



<p>There's also a bevy of bug fixes and balance changes included in the update, and though EA doesn't specify what the rewards will be, the company does say that players who dig into the new content added in this update will "<em>unlock exclusive Battlefield 6 rewards</em>."</p>



<p>We've still got a while to wait for Battlefield 6's launch, but if you're really craving a bit of what we saw these last two weekends, then this new update, along with the rest of the content already available in Battlefield 2042, will help you get your fix until October 10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>An August Nintendo Direct is indeed happening, though maybe not the one fans were expecting. The company announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194">a deep dive into <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> is coming on August 19, the same day that Gamescom kicks off in Germany. We basically know nothing about the upcoming racer except that Kirby creator and <em>Smash Bros.</em> director Masahiro Sakurai is in charge, and it’s scheduled to arrive before the end of 2025.</p> <p>“Tune in on Tuesday, August 19, for a livestreamed <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct featuring about 45 minutes of information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game,” Nintendo posted in its Switch 2 news app today. Nearly an hour about <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>? In this economy?</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kirby Air Riders – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJVsNMp_nAU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The game was originally revealed during the Switch 2’s April Nintendo Direct, but with only a cinematic teaser and Sakurai’s name flashing across the screen. It’s a sequel to the 2003 GameCube fan-favorite, which included, among other things, the novel mechanic of players not needing to hold a button to accelerate. But it was also largely overshadowed on a console that already had <em>F-Zero GX</em> and <em>Mario Kart: Double Dash</em>.</p>

 <p>The new <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> falls into a similar position with the Switch 2, coming so soon after <em>Mario Kart World</em>, <em>F-Zero</em> via the Switch Online retro library, and the great indie launch racer<em> Fast Fusion</em>. Expectations are also markedly higher for exclusives featuring first-party characters in the Switch 2 era, though <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is a joint venture between Sakurai’s studio and Bandai Namco.</p> <p>The upcoming game is supposed to round out Nintendo’s holiday release lineup, though we’re still waiting on the release date for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, a game that was originally teased back during the first years of the Switch 1’s life cycle. A <em>Kirby</em> Direct probably wasn’t on most fans’ bingo cards for August, but hopefully a big Nintendo Direct that helps define the longer-term roadmap for the Switch 2 will still be coming soon.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders is taking center stage at the latest Nintendo Direct showcase, announced for tomorrow.</p>



<p>Due for release on Nintendo Switch 2 later this year, Kirby Air Riders is the first new game in the franchise since 2022’s Kirby and the Forgotten Land and is one of the big remaining Switch 2 launches this year.</p>



<p>The latest Nintendo Direct continues the approach of focusing on a single game rather than several titles, an approach already seen this year with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-revealed-during-mario-kart-world-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-by-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and plenty of details are set to be revealed.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-direct-announced-for-august-19">Nintendo Direct Announced For August 19</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More details coming. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a social media <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1957427985625088145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Nintendo announced the Kirby Air Raiders Direct would take place on August 19 at 6am PT/8am CT/9am ET/2pm BST/11pm AEST.</p>



<p>The announcement stated the livestream presentation will “last 45 minutes” and provides an “in-depth look” at the title, releasing exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>A social media <a href="https://x.com/KirbyAirRiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a> for Kirby Air Riders then went live, which will share the “latest announcements and updates” for the title, which will likely be extremely active following the Nintendo Direct showcase.</p>



<p>Details on exactly what will be shown are unknown, though it’s highly likely that a release date will be provided given we’re approaching the latter end of 2025 and details so far have not been shared.</p>



<p>Further reveals from Nintendo for Switch 2 could be on the cards this week at Gamescom, where the company’s attendance is confirmed.</p>

And while Patch 1.5 does address many of these issues, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-performance-patch-makes-drastic-changes-to-enemies-and-story-and-players-arent-happy"><u>it also made sweeping, and unexpected, changes to many of the game's enemies, dialogue, and story</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we explained at the time, prior to the patch, you were able to target and kill certain human NPCs you encountered throughout the game. These characters were passive and didn't attack you, but murdering them affected your character's "madness" mechanic. That's no longer the case, however — the NPCs are untargetable and unkillable, effectively removing the ability to choose to interact with the madness mechanic in that specific way, and you cannot kill boss enemies any longer, but only "exhaust" them into surrendering. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect, the changes have not been well received, and many players have taken to Steam's discussion forums and user review section to share their disappointment. And within days of 1.5's release, a modder has already created a mod that rolls back the changes wholesale, be they for the better or worse, to version 1.4.1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience - Most late game bosses, NPCs and enemies now get exhausted instead of dying and give you meaningless banter instead of story-advancing dialog from the original game," the modder <a href="https://v/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a>. "Basically, patch 1.5 has ruined the game's story and immersion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mod creator themselves admitted it's a "fairly complex mod that modifies game files," and as it also undoes some of the QoL improvements introduced in Patch 1.5, they point some players who want to rollback the story changes but keep QoL changes to additional mods like <a href="https://https//www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/136" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fast Vertical Traversal</u></a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/146" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Improved Recovery</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/124" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fast Item Pick Up</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is a Soulslike action-RPG set in the land of Shu during the dark and tumultuous late Ming Dynasty. You play as a mysterious warrior afflicted by a horrific feather disease, who uncovers hidden secrets and battles supernatural enemies in an ancient empire teetering on the edge of collapse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is yet another great soulslike to add to the ever-increasing pile, featuring excellent combat, wonderful level design, an incredible skill tree, and fearsome bosses. Just watch out for some steep difficulty dips and spikes, and a reliance on cheap-feeling 'gotcha!' ambushes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

<section><p>Thunder Lotus' game about end-of-life care showed me that it's never too early to try to understand someone better.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>Spiritfarer is celebrating its 5-year anniversary today, August 18, 2025. Below, we reflect on how the game's compassion and empathy can help influence our own lives.</em></p><p dir="ltr">When it was first introduced, Developer Thunder Lotus billed Spiritfarer as "a cozy management sim about dying," which immediately intrigued me. What's so cozy about dying, and what difference does the team see between a game about dying and a game about death? The wording seemed unmistakably intentional. Many games are, to some degree, about death--and specifically, avoiding it. But Spiritfarer not only makes dying unavoidable; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-little-death-positivity-in-video-games-can-be-go/1100-6471051/">it makes dying the whole point</a>. As Stella, players ferry over a dozen characters through a purgatorial plane, waving them goodbye as they cross the Everdoor into a permanent afterlife. But it's her thoughtfulness and understanding of each passenger, regardless of the life they lived, that I find so inspiring. Stella's hospice care approach works great on the precipice of the afterlife. But we don't need to wait until it's nearly too late to express such a devotion to forgiveness.</p><p dir="ltr">It's Stella's job to manage the many personalities that find their way aboard her boat, helping each passenger with their unfinished business before sending their souls floating away into the warm glow of the Everdoor. Though this sounds like the setup for something so saccharine it may induce nausea, in reality, Spiritfarer doesn't shy from the much gloomier and less picturesque aspects of life. And yet, despite its flawed, hurting, sometimes even hurtful characters, it never wavers in its expressions of love and understanding, and it's that difference that helped me learn something about my own life.</p><p dir="ltr">Each character that comes into Stella's (after)life does so in a new physical form, like an animal, a tree, or a mushroom, but keeps intact their name and personality from their time on Earth. There's Gwen, a surrogate big sister of Stella's, who took up smoking as a way to protest her overbearing father. The smoking eventually killed Gwen, as she succumbed to lung cancer in her 40s, bringing her to Stella's spacetime-defying boat in the shape of a deer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4550291-ss_a751970e68bc928538fbc4f52d6090c6ff1d8974.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550291" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4550291-ss_a751970e68bc928538fbc4f52d6090c6ff1d8974.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550291"></a><figcaption>Atul presents himself as an outgoing fellow eager to help, but beneath that layer, he's more complicated.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4550291-ss_a751970e68bc928538fbc4f52d6090c6ff1d8974.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Atul, presented as a large, jovial frog on the ferry, was, in life, a builder and a union leader. In the game, Atul is always enthused to help Stella improve her boat, but as you get to know him, you realize he has a sadness about him that he keeps from the world. On Earth, Stella knew Atul as her uncle, who disappeared back home while she was traveling abroad in her 20s. Some interpret Atul's story to end in suicide, and when he similarly disappears from the boat one day, not allowing Stella to ferry him to the Everdoor herself, this tragic, abrupt ending is reflected in purgatory.</p><p dir="ltr">One of my favorites of all passengers is Giovanni, a complicated, self-obsessed man (made into a lion on the boat) who fought in World War II during his time on Earth. In life, Giovanni loved Astrid, a woman who also appears as a lion during the game, but it's said that the two had a tumultuous relationship, partly due to Giovanni cheating on Astrid during their time together following the war.</p><p dir="ltr">Every character in the game's long line of passengers is written this way; they made mistakes, they acted out of feelings like spite or impulse. Sometimes they did bad things for regrettable reasons. Some of them inflicted pain not just on themselves but on others, like Bruce and Mickey, brothers who were injured when Mickey was drunk-driving--an event that long preceded their reunion on the ferry. Stella becomes a mediator between the two, helping Bruce forgive his brother so he can find peace. Others seem tragically innocent, like Stanley, a boy who died of a terminal illness at a very young age, or Alice, an elderly woman expressing on the ferry the same dementia she suffered in life. In these instances, Stella's task becomes less about forgiving them for their mistakes or helping them forgive themselves, and more about comforting them in their final moments.</p><p dir="ltr">But the universal truth of all the passengers is their need for love and understanding, which Stella never withholds from them. The last thing virtually all of them experience before swimming into the warm light of the Everdoor is an affectionate hug from Stella, a mechanic that actually has a dedicated button in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Expressions of love can take different forms. For some, it's a hug when you're feeling blue or scared. For others, it's taking the right tact when a loved one's lucidity is slipping. For Stella's passenger, Buck, love looks like buying into his fantasy role-playing obsession, yes-anding his live-action role-playing like a method actor. Bedside manner is something Stella had to learn in her life as a hospice nurse, and this quality makes her a wonderful candidate for the game's titular role, too. She cares for everyone on the ferry, meeting each of them where they are; their flaws don't scare her away, and their wrongdoings don't cause her to shun or judge them. She understands she is there to bring them kindness through closure, and she is past the point of judging people for their mistakes or hardships. It's something I'm striving to achieve in my own life.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="929747318" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">When I moved 3,000 miles away from my parents and siblings to start my own family, it was very hard at first, then I sort of got used to it. Days come and go, and life has a way of getting in the way of letting you slow down to take inventory of what you should maybe be doing with your time. But now, with my third kid on the way and the health of a loved one deteriorating, I find myself stuck on the feelings that Spiritfarer so often grapples with. When we're staring down the inevitable loss of someone we love, it's easier to crystallize what it is we wish we had been saying for years before. Suddenly, the words can be found, after years of biting our tongues, failing to make amends. If you've not lived far away from your family before, you may not know the unique sadness you feel when you notice your parents have visibly aged between FaceTime calls with their grandkids, or when it seems like they're noticing the same about you or your kids.</p><p dir="ltr">In Spiritfarer, we see this occur a lot; characters like Giovanni, Astrid, Summer, Gwen, and Stella's sister, Lily, all get their time alone with Stella, to say what they need to say, either to Stella specifically or just to say it out loud, knowing Stella is there to listen with love and understanding. For them, it's now or never. The Everdoor awaits, and what they need to say will be said. I think what Spiritfarer taught me is that, however helpful it may be to find that closure at the very end of a life, it's going to be even more comforting and meaningful if you can find it sooner. I don't want to wait until I or my loved ones are on the ferry.</p><p dir="ltr">I felt close to a certain loved one for most of my life, but for many reasons--geographical, political, personal, and surely others I'm not exactly cognizant of--it feels like we've drifted apart in recent years. They don't have a terminal illness, but their life has been a series of hardships, and it's taking its toll on them physically and mentally. I think I'll lose them soon. They wear a sadness about them, a gloom that intensified when their mother died half a decade ago and has exacerbated personal issues they've had their entire life. Seeing how their mother's death affected them has further led me to wonder what I can do better about my relationship with them while they're still here.</p><p dir="ltr">I don't believe in an afterlife, and I don't believe in souls. To me, these remaining years are all I'll get with them. There is no purgatorial safe space for us to hash it out later. There's only here and now, so I have only now to forgive them and make our time together more meaningful. To the extent I've found any value in religious writings, I point to Thich Nhất Hạnh. The late Zen Buddhist monk is someone I read and re-read often. I wouldn't be surprised if the philosopher also inspired someone at Thunder Lotus when the team was designing their unique take on Greek myth and Charon's role in ferrying souls down the River Styx. Nhất Hạnh practiced a radical kind of forgiveness, believing that when "someone makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over. He does not need punishment; he needs help. That's the message he is sending." Though I don't know if the game's writers would endorse that view, I see a lot of his teachings inside Spiritfarer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4550296-ss_3ea9b42a39a6a5652b6df197ada7ac0a03f47661.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550296" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4550296-ss_3ea9b42a39a6a5652b6df197ada7ac0a03f47661.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550296"></a><figcaption>Stella, along with her cat Daffodil, is willing to help whomever comes aboard her boat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4550296-ss_3ea9b42a39a6a5652b6df197ada7ac0a03f47661.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When Giovanni was self-absorbed, or Bruce and Mickey were straight-up jerks, or Alice was frustratingly slow to speak or make sense, Stella didn't take offense. She didn't overreact. She saw that their lives to that point made them that way, and it didn't make sense to hold it against them. Instead, she accepted them, cared for them, and helped them pass on. Even now, as I try to repair my once-close relationship with this person in my life, I'll tell you that they are incredibly frustrating at times, but lately I find myself feeling like Stella more and more, and I think it's only a healthy thing for me. I don't want things to feel strained, or forced, or awkward. I don't want to hold this person's past wrongs against them if I can instead find a way to forgive them. I don't want to be angry about their flaws if I can instead understand that they need help, and maybe one form of help is an almost radical forgiveness. I can look inside their heart and see goodness, and when that goodness is veiled by their personal demons, I don't let it change who they are to me.</p><p dir="ltr">Stella was well-practiced at being there for people who needed her due to her years working in a hospice. But we don't have to wait until someone is receiving end-of-life care to let our guard down. Eulogies often exaggerate the good parts of a person and overlook the bad parts, memorializing by way of sugarcoating. I think what I find so refreshing and important about Spiritfarer is that it doesn't do this. It shows you flawed people and tells you they deserve love all the same. Whatever someone has gone through, and however those experiences have shaped them, the best thing we can do is be there for them.</p>

            <p>Developer Herobeat has announced its next game, Rewilders: The Lost Spring, which has been inspired by the works of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli films.</p>
<p>The developer is known for its debut game Endling - Extinction is Forever, which was released back in 2022 and went on to score itself not only a BAFTA win, but a nomination at the Game Awards as well. Rewilders: The Lost Spring is a follow up to Endling - Extinction is Forever, though not a sequel. That said, the developer has promised "echoes" of its predecessor's storytelling, as well as its aesthetics and score.</p>

		<p>Herobeat, the studio behind Endling: Extinction is Forever, has revealed its brand new game with the title of it being Rewilders: The Lost Spring. Rewilders: The Lost Spring is an open world roguelike that also incorporates creature collection, and it is set in a time where the world’s surface is too poisonous for people to live on. Players take on the role of Abi who descends to the world to find her family, and restore the world to a more healthy state.</p>

<p>The gameplay of Rewilders: The Lost Spring will see Abi split her time between her airship above the clouds, and the poisoned surface below. The airship acts as a laboratory where Abi can unlock new abilities and upgrades to help in fights and traverse the world. The upgrades include access gliders and grappling hooks. As Abi makes progress she can rewild the world and restore the different biomes that make up the world.</p>
<p>The creature collection part of Rewilders: The Lost Spring refers to Abi finding the native creatures known as Hantu, each of which has its own abilities. Together with Abi they can restore the world and face off against the dangers that have made the poisonous world home. As you restore the world, you will have a choice to make on whether you restore the world to its former glory or choose to let it continue down a darker path.</p>

<p>Rewilders: The Lost Spring does not yet have a release date but is available to wishlist on Steam.</p>

			<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet developer Racoon Logic Studios has just released a new update and a new demo for its sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/">2020's Journey to the Savage Planet</a>. The demo is only available on PC, but the update is on all platforms, adding a new photo mode, new habitat customization features, and on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, a new Performance graphics mode that gets the framerate up to 60 FPS.</p>



<p>The news also came with a new trailer, showcasing the features of its fairly extensive photo mode, which lets you make several edits and changes, even add in some of the creatures you'll study and capture over the course of the game's campaign.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the demo, it'll showcase Revenge of the Savage Planet in two parts. The first, which is available now, is just the first hour of the game, giving you a chance to get acquainted with the game's setting and tone in those opening moments.</p>



<p>The second, which will be made available at a later date, is a custom abilities mode, which will let you experience how the game feels when your character is upgraded and kitted out with more gear and tools. It'll also be playable in co-op, which can be a key element to having as much fun as possible in Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>



<p>For the new habitat features, 40 new objects have been added to the game for players to customize their homes with.</p>

<p>"<em>We know that money is tight. We feel you. So if you’re not 100% certain you’ll enjoy our game, here’s a free demo</em>," said Racoon Logic Studios creative director, Alex Hutchinson, in a press release.</p>



<p>"<em>Try it. We think you’ll like it. We worked on it for 4 years and now it’s the price of two expensive coffees. You’ll play the tutorial and then maybe fool around with a bunch of late game abilities. Give it a shot. Please?</em>"</p>



<p>If you enjoyed the first game, and have yet to check out Revenge of the Savage Planet, it's worth giving the demo a chance. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">I reviewed it for Wccftech earlier this year, I wrote</a>, "<em>Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released a new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>update in preparation for the release of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>later this year, and it's packed with stuff, including a new map, new weapons, and more.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1957412193198100646" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a>, this latest&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>update is intended to be one of the first steps on "the road to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>", which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">due to launch in October</a>&nbsp;(and which, mercifully enough, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing" rel="nofollow">won't cost you $80</a>).</p>

<p>The first big thing you're getting in this update is a new map in the form of Iwo Jima, which was, as EA says, "a fan favorite previously seen in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 1942</em>,&nbsp;<em>1943</em>, and&nbsp;<em>V</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-2042-update-iwo-jima.jpg?itok=9n-zLMWZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-2042-update-iwo-jima.jpg?itok=hU59xsQr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battlefield 2042</em>'s latest update is bringing a brand new map, plus more.</figcaption></figure><p>The new version of the map is a "reimagined" space that EA says will "give you plenty of options to flex your tactical muscles", and it comes complete with an "active volcano" that you'll have to watch out for as well.</p>

<p>As well as Iwo Jima, you can also look forward to two new weapons in the form of the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle.</p>

<p>The former is a "highly accurate" rifle that's also easy to control, and the latter is a "vicious semi-automatic anti-material rifle" that will be given to players who joined&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s open beta. If you didn't, however, you'll still get a chance to get this weapon "later down the line".</p>

<p>Two new vehicles are also being added: the A10 Warthog and the SU-25TM Frogfoot, both of which are attack jets that will be available in All-Out Warfare. They'll join a free battle pass that comes complete with 60 tiers of cosmetics to earn.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517290/Battlefield_2042/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/battlefield-2042/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/battlefield-2042-xbox-series-xs/9p0t51bddwvt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, meanwhile, is due for launch across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/battlefield-6/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/battlefield-6-standard-edition/9pjxv87jtsvq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 10th, and you can read our Erren's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-good-company" rel="nofollow">preview of it here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta has ended. For two weekends, hundreds of thousands of players went to war with each other. Now that the dust and rubble have settled, it’s time to see what the community has judged to be the best Battlefield 6 map—and worst.</p>



<p>Battlefield has had its fair share of classic maps over the years. Everyone always wants to see a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-battlefield-games-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ranking of the best Battlefield games</a>, but we recently went one better. We broke down our favorite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/9-best-battlefield-maps-of-all-time-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield maps</a>, giving high praise to Wake Island and Caspian Border. It’s time to see which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta</a> maps stood out.</p>



<h2 id="h-siege-of-cairo-leads-the-way-in-battlefield-6">Siege of Cairo Leads The Way in Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A clear winner. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Yes, I’ll cut straight to the chase, Siege of Cairo has comfortably been voted as the favorite Battlefield 6 map.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>, a poll was launched to find out the answer. It states that only roughly 10,000 votes were cast. Given that the Open Beta recorded well over 500,000 players, we get it’s a tiny percentage of the crowd. Still, it’s fun to analyze this portion of the data.</p>



<p>Out of Siege of Cairo, Liberation Peak, Empire State, and Iberian Offensive, Siege of Cairo came out on top with 47% of the vote. Liberation Peak was a distant second with 27%, Empire State recorded 16%, and Iberian Offensive only managed 11%.</p>



<p>These polls are always subjective, though. Personally, I loved Iberian Offensive. I wouldn’t have had it last (maybe Liberation Peak). </p>



<div><article><p><span>According to a community’s poll with over 10,000 votes via </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Battlefield</a><span>, Siege of Cairo is the most favourite map from </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a><span>‘s Open Beta whereas Iberian Offensive is the less, favourite map.</span></p></article></div>



<p>But this is the time to tell us what you think. Do you agree with Siege of Cairo being number one? Or is it ranked too highly? Head to the comments to let us know. Plus, go to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to talk all things Battlefield 6.</p>
