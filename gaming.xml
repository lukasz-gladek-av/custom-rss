		<p>The new leader of the Space Pirates, Sylux puts the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> into motion and is the main antagonist that Samus has to face off against in this game.</p>
<p>And you will have to face off against him multiple times, each time with Sylux bringing new and more powerful moves to try and defeat you. But you wouldn’t expect Samus to lose these fights, would you? Still, she could probably use a few hints to make her life easier, right?</p>
<p>Obviously <strong>there are some progression spoilers</strong> within this guide, so at this point, <strong>stop reading if you aren’t currently struggling to battle Sylux!</strong></p>


<p>Right… all good? Let’s get on with it.</p>

<p>In this guide, we’re going to talk about the first encounter with Sylux.</p>

<p>Battling Sylux in Volt Forge, scans give very few clues as to what gear he is using and how best to defeat him.</p>
<p>From a damage perspective, you mainly want to just constantly hit him with Beam Cannon attacks and Missiles. Lock on to target him, and keep firing while strafing and dodging his attacks.</p>
<h2>Sylux attack moves and how to avoid them</h2>
<p>Sylux will dish out the following attacks:</p>
<p><strong>Run and gun</strong> –&nbsp;Sylux runs laterally around the arena while shooting at you. If you’re strafing and moving, this is easy to evade.<br>
<strong>Charge attack</strong> –&nbsp;Winding up for a melee attack, Sylux mmoves his right arm across his body before leaping forward to deal a short range swipe. While locked on, double-tap B to dodge out of the way at the right time.<br>
<strong>Energy wave</strong> – Sylux slams the floor and sends an energy wave from his position. Watch for his move and jump over the attack.</p>

<p><strong>Homing darts</strong> – Standing still, Sylux creates two sets of three homing darts. If time it right, a charged Power Beam attack can trigger and explode these darts before they fully launch, converting them to health and ammo for you. The darts are otherwise fairly easy to dodge with good timing.<br>
<strong>Green tornado</strong> –&nbsp;This is the trickiest move. Sylux starts moving around like a spinning top, creating a green field that deflects your attacks until you can break him out of this mode. You need to deal damage to his feet, and the most reliable method I found was to switch to the Morph Ball and place Psychic Bombs while leading him. Getting this timing right is difficult and Sylux can immediately launch back into this attack a couple of times. After hitting him enough times, he will be staggered for a damage phase.</p>

<p>Below 2/3rds health, Sylux will add two more moves to his repertoire:</p>
<p><strong>Flying shot</strong> –&nbsp;He hovers and flies around, shooting from above. Similar to Run and Gun.<br>
<strong>Energy Rain</strong> – Sylux hovers and sends out rings of green energy balls that drop down in a growing radius. Find the gaps between energy balls to evade.</p>

<p><strong>Faster Green Tornado</strong> – As before, but his rate of movement is faster and direction changes can be more erratic. Still use the same tactic.</p>
<p>Below 1/3rd health, there’s another new attack:</p>
<p><strong>Energy Beam Swipe</strong> –&nbsp;From the middle of the arena, Sylux sends out a solid beam of energy and swipes it across the room. Jump over or ball to avoid.</p>

<p>Defeating Sylux this first time isn’t so bad, and you’re rewarded with an Energy Tank to boost your health going forwards. There’s also a rather odd little surprise. What could <em>that</em> possibly mean?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Typically lauded as one of the best shooters of its era, <em>Blood</em> is a game I've tried to enjoy so many times, but things just never clicked. It's weird, because I voraciously consume games like <em>Shadow Warrior, </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/quake-remastered-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Quake</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/duke-nukem-3d-world-tour-review-world-star" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Duke Nukem 3D</em></a>, all of which have similar gameplay and came out within a year or so of <em>Blood</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>I love the work <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios/" rel="nofollow">Nightdive</a> does and, though I was apprehensive about trying <em>Blood: Refreshed Supply -- </em>a remaster built from the ground up with new code and tons of enhancements -- I bit the bullet and went for it. I'm happy to say that <em>Blood</em> finally clicked for me, and now I see why it's such a cherished title.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<h3>My Interest in <em>Blood </em>is Refreshed</h3><p>If you've read my Nightdive reviews, you know the drill by now: We start with the enhancements and improvements. Nightdive always exceeds expectations in this regard. Nightdive's previous touch-ups with <em>Blood: Fresh Supply</em> (not to be confused with <em>Refreshed Supply) </em>felt a bit too antiquated for me. With all the improvements from this remaster, things feel on par with Nightdive's most recent ports.</p><p>Rebuilding the entirety of <em>Blood</em> from its source code seems to have done wonders in terms of feel, because the gameplay is buttery smooth. Movement feels perfect, and the gunplay is impactful. Not to mention, it looks fantastic. <em>Blood: Refreshed Supply</em>'s revitalized visuals proves this is one of the best looking games from its era.</p><p>This is comparing the visuals to the original, but when comparing the two ports, I want to say there might be just a <em>slight</em> improvement over <em>Fresh Supply</em>. Perhaps the most noticeable change is the re-done cutscenes. These are done with brand new 3D models.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>The old cutscenes were often too dark, muddy, and compressed for me to even tell what was going on. With these new changes, <em>Blood: Refreshed Supply</em> allowed me to get engaged with the story, even if cutscenes are few and far between. Everything still looks pretty retro, mind you, so Nightdive keeps the old-school aesthetic in these.</p><p>Outside of these revamped cutscenes, <em>Blood:</em> <em>Refreshed Supply </em>stands out by adding fixes to enemy behavior. These include "Improve Monster Navigation Around Water" and "Fix Gargoyle Aiming," and a bunch of other things, all of which can be toggled on and off. Oldheads will probably appreciate these changes, but as someone who hasn't gotten too far in <em>Blood</em> in the past, I'll just appreciate that these made the game more accessible.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Very interesting to see an in-progress level, untouched since the 90s!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Blood: Refreshed </em>supply also includes a new scenario called Marrow, and another one in a future update. More content is great, and while I haven't had a chance to dive into this scenario yet, I understand there's also another on the way, so that's super exciting.</p><p>And besides that, there are <em>tons</em>, and I mean <em>tons, </em>of prototype and unreleased levels available in <em>Blood: Refreshed Supply</em>. Nightdive likes to include the "Vault" in their games, which has a bunch of concept art and behind-the-scenes documents and videos, but sometimes they even come with unreleased levels.&nbsp;</p><p>There are quite literally dozens of these to play and choose from, so I can see how this feature would be appreciated by longtime fans. It's fascinating to see a behind-the-scenes look at the level creation process, especially so for a game almost 30 years old.</p><figure role="group">

<h3>Dynamite!</h3><p>By now, you know my history with <em>Blood</em>: It just never clicked with me. I found it too difficult, at least in the beginning stages. Because of that, this time I opted for a lower difficulty, and I'm glad I did.&nbsp;</p><p>A few issues with my previous forays into <em>Blood: </em>Ammo and health are stingy at the start, and you feel outmatched. This isn't inherently a bad thing, but when cultists hitscan you with their guns, it becomes a nuisance. I got past the initial hump on the now lower difficulty and completed several episodes, which is way further than I've ever gone before.</p><p>Yes, cultists still hitscan you and that's annoying, but at least I'm able to get the lay of the land and grasp the basics of <em>Blood</em>. And because I gave the game a chance with <em>Blood: Refreshed Supply</em>'s new improvements and my change in mindset, I found that this shooter has some of the most creative weapons and level design in the genre.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Get poked, bozo.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While weapon variety is wanting (there are like several different types of dynamite, which isn't all that compelling), the rest of the roster feels great to use. <em>Blood: Refreshed Supply</em>'s weapons are super unconventional: A flare gun that takes a few seconds to alight, a very short-ranged shotgun, and the double-edged sword that is the dynamite.</p><p>The dynamite feels great to use once you have a bunch of bundles at your disposal. Causing a bunch of explosions and gibbing enemies is great, and it also requires you to be careful of your position to the dyanmite considering it also hurts <em>you</em>. So, when your back is against the wall, and a bunch of zombies are attacking you, do you clear them out fast with dynamite and risk getting blown up, or try a less practical alternative?&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, you'll find a napalm launcher, a Tesla cannon, and most -- if not all -- weapons also have an alt-fire. My favorite weapon of the bunch would have to be the voodoo doll. You poke it with a needle to damage enemies, and it packs a surprising punch. It's super goofy and creative, adding so much charm to the aesthetic of <em>Blood: Refreshed Supply</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<h3><em>Blood: Refreshed Supply </em>is a Quirky Horror Game With Undeniably 90s DNA</h3><p>Level design is another standout. The first two levels are arguably the weakest, and where I'd most often get bored and frustrated, and just quit in my previous playthroughs. Get past that initial hump and you start to see the personality of <em>Blood: Refreshed Supply </em>shine.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most memorable levels early on is a circus, complete with poppable balloons, tons of attractions, and mimes that you can just kill for no reason at all. The non-linear layout of this level makes it engaging, and you can tell the original developers put a lot of love and care into <em>Blood</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>I also deeply enjoyed exploring the interiors of a hotel inspired by <em>The Shining</em>, complete with a wintery maze and tons of creepy surprises waiting for you. After seeing what <em>Blood: Refreshed Supply</em> had to offer in terms of level design, it has this cheesy horror feel that only a game from the 90s could achieve; previously, I thought it to be a more sinister, creepy game.</p><p>To be clear, <em>Blood: Refreshed Supply</em> is still a dark game in terms of subject matter -- you're killing demons, cultists, and gore is aplenty -- but the quirkiness of the 90s adds a lot to my enjoyment of this game.</p><figure role="group">

<h3><em>Blood: Refreshed Supply</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h3><p><em>Blood: Refreshed Supply</em> is an excellent port of an excellent game. In all likelihood, you didn't need me to tell you this. What I do hope is that my review encourages those similar to me -- individuals who couldn't get into <em>Blood</em> for one reason or another -- to give it another shot with this revitalized version.</p><p><em>Blood: Refreshed Supply</em> is a case of Nightdive doing what Nightdive does best: Taking a game with, let's say, some antiquated features, and making it more accessible for modern audiences. Now, it's time for me to dive back in and play more of this fantastic remaster, and you best bet I'll be waiting for that new and upcoming scenario with eager anticipation.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em><strong>Blood: Refreshed Supply</strong> was reviewed on PC using a code provided by the developer over the course of 6 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Garmin Plays Zero Profit With Forerunner 165, Now Selling OLED Watch at New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-plays-zero-profit-with-forerunner-165-now-selling-oled-watch-at-new-record-low-2000650527</link>
            <guid>1373758</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Garmin kept its Black Friday pricing active on several models including <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/">this Forerunner 165 that’s still sitting at its all-time low of $199 instead of the usual $249</a>. This watch <strong>targets occasional and regular athletes</strong> who want serious training features without dropping a grand on the latest Fenix flagship model.</p>
<p>The compromise here hits perfectly for people who run a few times a week or mix various activities but don’t need ultra-endurance battery life or sapphire crystal displays. The bright AMOLED touchscreen combined with traditional buttons gives you the best of both interface worlds without forcing you to choose between touch convenience and physical control reliability.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Watch Is Good for Real Training Programs</h2>
<p>Instead of sticking to a strict schedule that doesn’t take into account how your body feels, <strong>the daily suggested workouts</strong> change based on how well you did and how quickly you recover. The watch looks at your training load, sleep quality, and heart rate variability to suggest workouts that will help you improve without overtraining. This is very helpful if you want to get better without hiring a personal trainer because the watch basically sets up your training based on sports science. With Garmin Coach integration, <strong>you can get structured training plans for races of certain distances, like 5K, 10K, or half marathons</strong>.</p>



<p>Training effect labels tell you exactly what each workout did for you, like whether it helped you build your base endurance, improve your aerobic capacity, or raise your anaerobic threshold. This feedback helps you figure out if you’re really getting closer to your goals or just running a lot of miles for no reason. Recovery time calculations tell you how long your body needs to rest before the next hard workout which stops people from making the mistake of doing too many hard workouts too close together and getting hurt or burned out. The<strong> morning report shows you your sleep quality, HRV status, training readiness, and the weather forecast</strong> all on one screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>AMOLED screen has bright colors and deep blacks</strong> that make it easy to read data in bright sunlight or dim indoor light. This is more important than you might think when you’re trying to keep your pace while running without stopping. In smartwatch mode, with heart rate monitoring, notifications, and daily tracking turned on, <strong>the battery lasts for 11 days</strong>. GPS mode uses up power faster, only lasting 19 hours per charge but that’s still enough for several marathon-distance runs or several weeks of normal training before you have to plug it in. The<strong> 43mm case size fits smaller wrists well</strong>&nbsp;but it’s still big enough that you can read the screen without squinting while you work out.</p>



<p><strong>Built-in GPS</strong> tracks your pace and distance without requiring phone connection, so you can leave your device at home for runs and still get accurate route mapping and performance data. Wrist-based heart rate monitors keep track of your heart rate all day and during workouts. However, they can have trouble with high-intensity interval training because quick changes in heart rate can confuse optical sensors. The <strong>watch has more than 25 activity profiles for running, cycling, swimming, HIIT</strong>, strength training, and other sports. Each profile has its own set of data fields and metrics that are relevant to that activity.</p>
<p><strong>With smart notifications</strong>, you can stay connected to your paired smartphone without having to check your phone all the time. Your wrist will show you incoming calls, texts, and app alerts. With Garmin Pay’s contactless payment support, you can get coffee or snacks after your run without having to carry cash or cards. Just make sure your bank supports the service. The watch has safety features like incident detection, which sends your location to emergency contacts if it detects a crash while you’re outside, and manual assistance requests, which you can use if you need help.</p>
<p>At $199, the Forerunner 165 is one of the best training watches because it has features that used to cost $400 or more and this $50 discount makes it even better. You’re getting adaptive training advice, recovery metrics, and full activity tracking in a package that doesn’t feel like a compromise compared to more expensive models.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Splitgate 2 had a rough launch this June. Players were unsatisfied with the sequel’s changes, and it suffered a big PR blow from 1047 Games co-founder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqhyCGp2uU">Ian Prolux’s controversial stage presentation</a> during Summer Game Fest. After <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/22/splitgate-2-returning-to-beta-following-poor-launch-reception-as-developer-1047-games">unlaunching Splitgate 2 and returning it to beta in July</a> for a substantial rework, the game has reemerged with a new name: Splitgate: Arena Reloaded.</p><p>Launching on December 17, the free-to-play Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is described as “a revamped online arena FPS from 1047 Games that goes back to its community focused roots,” in a press release. This new version of the portal-jumping competitive shooter ditches the factions and abilities of the original Splitgate 2. It also sports a completely overhauled progression system to create an arena-style experience that hews much closer to the original Splitgate.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrcUZ_F7vX8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrcUZ_F7vX8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Splitgate has always been a love letter to the arena shooters we grew up playing,” said 1047 Games design director Josh Watson in a press release. “We’ve been hard at work rebuilding the game from the ground up, taking the best of Splitgate 1 and Splitgate 2, removing what didn’t work, and refining what did.”&nbsp;</p><p>Arena Reloaded also introduces five new maps, while six existing maps have been fully reworked. It also features three new primary weapons and a new power weapon, the Railgun. The game also boasts new Arena modes, along with Classic Arena, playlist selection, and an even-starts mode without customizable weapon loadouts. 1047 also promises a simplified battle pass, improved cosmetics, and reduced store prices.</p><p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/splitgate-2-has-been-rebooted-as-splitgate-arena-reloaded-and-it-launches-this-month]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/intriguing-sci-fi-first-person-bullet-hell-game-luna-abyss-gets-2026-launch-window/</link>
            <guid>1373734</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been more than two and a half years since I <a href="https://wccftech.com/luna-abyss-qa-devs-confirm-dlss-3-clarify-destiny-comparisons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> two of the main developers behind the promising first-person sci-fi action bullet hell game Luna Abyss. The game had already impressed many players with its visuals, both artistically and technologically, and also invited comparisons with Destiny, although the developers explained in our conversation that these were only superficial. Even Returnal is not a completely accurate comparison, as it's a full-on bullet hell experience all the time, whereas this game is a more varied action-adventure experience, according to its makers.</p>



<p>Anyway, it had been a while since I heard about Luna Abyss. Thankfully, the game resurfaced today with a new trailer and the promise of a 2026 launch on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1933000/Luna_Abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>



<p>The new press release also provides updated details. The main character is a prisoner sentenced to explore a derelict megastructure that sprawls deep beneath the surface of the mimic moon Luna. The protagonist is tasked with recovering forgotten technology from within the Abyss and the lost colony it consumed. Every move they make will be overseen by the artificial prison guard named Aylin.</p>



<p>These centuries-old ruins are alive with maddening echoes, insinuating secrets of the once prosperous city of Greymont and its terrible fate. The Scourge. The tenets of the All-Father. The choir of the Collective.</p>



<p>In Luna Abyss, players will uncover the mysteries of the mimic moon and the abyss within its depths. They'll come face to face with remnants of the colony's downfall and eventually discover their role within this doomed world. </p>



<p>The core gameplay is full of sprinting, jumping, and dashing through this brutalist alien megastructure. The developers promise fluid first-person platforming while exploring Luna and the depths of the abyss. In combat, players must defeat corrupted souls and the twisted cosmic horrors of Luna Abyss. In our aforementioned chat, the developers stated that all of the game's weapons have functions designed for specific scenarios, as well as general combat applications for emergent gameplay.</p>



<p>A free demo is available for download on Steam, in case you're eager to try it.</p>

<figcaption>Haddonfield Heights should provide a thrill if you're a <em>Halloween</em> movie fan.</figcaption>

<p>IllFonic design director Jordan Mathewson says Haddonfield allowed the team to "reimagine the tension" of the town "in a way that feels both intimate and terrifying".</p><p>He says the studio wanted players to "feel the comfort of the neighborhood they recognize from the film" before it quickly descends into "panic", with each "hedge, hallway, and backyard" intended to "heighten suspense and reward clever play".</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Halloween</em>, it's an upcoming asymmetrical multiplayer horror game along the same lines as Behaviour's <em>Dead by Daylight </em>or IllFonic's own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/friday-13th-dedicated-servers-shutting-down-this-month" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c879cbbc-8ea0-4c10-a2ef-2b4cd295e2a3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">ill-fated</a> <em>Friday the 13th: The Game</em>.</p><p>Playing as either The Shape (also known as Michael Myers) or one of his victims, you'll be tasked with either slaughtering everyone who's playing as a survivor or attempting to phone the police for help before Myers catches you.</p>

Samus Aran picks up a few new tricks in this sequel, including her new bike, the Vi-O-La. But if you want to hear some optional ambient music while Samus cruises the deserts of planet Viewros, it's going to cost you $30 or the price of a Samus Aran Amiibo.</p><p>Players have discovered that plugging in the Samus Amiibo enables Vi-O-La Radio, which enables players to choose the music that accompanies Samus's extended journey across the Sol Valley desert on the Vi-O-La. There is already some ambient music and noise to go with those scenes, this just allows players to choose music tracks from other areas to listen to. Finishing the game will also unlock two additional tracks for Vi-O-La Radio. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Samus Amiibo Unlocks</p>
      </div>
<p>The regular ambient music of Sol Valley doesn't make it a bad experience, and it seems to be evoking something thematically about the planet's history. The music may not be necessary, but some fans may resent having to pay for an option that could have just as easily been included in the base game.</p><p>While the Samus Amiibo adds the music, the Vi-O-La Amiibo unlocks the skin options for the Vi-O-La. The Sylux Amiibo unlocks the extended cutscenes (after you complete the game), but you can also get those by getting 100% scanning.</p><p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is out now for Switch and Switch 2. You can also find GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-prime-but-not-quite-prime-prime/1900-6418446/" data-ref-id="1900-6418446">Metroid Prime 4 review</a> to see what we thought of it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">You'd be forgiven for losing track of how many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/" data-ref-id="2900-5289">survival games</a> have come out in the last decade or so, and though I personally enjoy many of them myself, it's exciting to see a new one come along and dramatically overhaul what a survival game looks like, mechanically speaking. In a crowded genre, Hello Sunshine stands out. Yes, it's a survival game with many of the mechanics you'd expect, but it doesn't look quite like any others, thanks to its one (literally) huge twist.</p><p dir="ltr">That twist is the gigantic robot companion you have by your side. The building-sized automaton walks almost ceaselessly toward a destination, and it's your mission to use its shadow to stay safe from the scorching sun, while strategically dashing into landmarks to quickly loot supplies, all while you dodge other, smaller bots along the way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_2NcnBVZ4o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S_2NcnBVZ4o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Hello Sunshine is set in a post-apocalyptic world full of antagonistic robots, and if you're to survive, you'll need to scavenge food, water, and materials to build tools and weapons--all while avoiding the unforgiving rays of the sun. But rather than settle down and build a base for yourself and your robo-pal, you're almost always on the move. It's a much more nomadic experience than, say, Valheim or Minecraft.</p><p dir="ltr">Using a full day/night cycle, Hello Sunshine will dynamically adjust your mission parameters as each day progresses. Early in the morning, the abusive sun is in a different point in the sky than it'll be later in the evening, causing you to mindfully stay behind, ahead of, or perhaps to one side of the giant robot.</p><p dir="ltr">During these daytime hours, the pacing is made to feel hurried. You can head out of the safe shadow, but not for long, as the robot is forever moving onward, with or without you. How long do you spend in a dilapidated building seeking crafting and healing supplies, knowing that you'll need to sprint back through the desert to reunite with your big metal security blanket? You can survive for a short moment in the sun, but it's not long before it starts chipping away at your health. Therefore, you don't want to let the robot get so far ahead that you lose track of it, but sometimes the allure of rare loot or vital health items keeps you two dangerously apart.</p><p dir="ltr">Even the best-laid plans can go awry when those smaller, antagonistic bots show up to slow you down, or push you out of the shadows when you're not careful and well-prepared. Weather events such as sandstorms can also dynamically disrupt your journey, severely limiting your ability to keep your robot in view, despite its gargantuan stature.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of each day you survive, you'll reach a service station, where the robot finally rests--charges, really--and allows you to do the same overnight. It's here that you'll craft items, recycling scraps you've amassed so far to make new clothing, flashlights, and weapons, among other things.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4616369-dkoimjdw.png" data-ref-id="1300-4616369" data-ratio="0.5375" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4616369-dkoimjdw.png" data-ref-id="1300-4616369"></a><figcaption>Strengthening the bond with your robot companion will be a major part of the story in Hello Sunshine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4616369-dkoimjdw.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As much as you can focus on yourself, you can also repair and upgrade the robot. This was my favorite part of the hands-off demo I was part of: seeing how you'll bond with the robot, which at first seems to pay you no mind whatsoever, seemingly unaware of your existence. But as you tend to it, it'll start to take an interest in you. Based on some thematic hints the creators at red Thread Games mentioned in my preview (which I won't spoil here because they joked that maybe they'd said too much already), I expect your bond with your giant companion to grow quite close over the game's hours, which leaves me wondering how much the story will later test that same bond. But these are the emotional beats that would bring the experience all together for me, so I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next, even if it hurts.</p><p dir="ltr">The team behind the game teased that there is a lot more to the story and world you'll explore, including multiple biomes, so it won't all be set i nthe desert, as well as online and split-screen co-op elements they weren't ready to talk about in great detail. What they didn't mention yet is a release date, though you can sign up for the free, upcoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3245140/Hello_Sunshine/" rel="nofollow ">Hello Sunshine playtest</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Fullbright, the studio behind <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/gone_home/b/pc/archive/2013/08/15/gone-home-review.aspx">Gone Home</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/09/06/opinion-tacoma-takes-interactive-storytelling-in-a-promising-direction.aspx">Tacoma</a>, has revealed Springs, Eternal, a new first-person exploration game set within a mysterious hot spring. Revealed during the PC Gaming Show today, it's currently in development for PC and scheduled to launch on Steam sometime in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, Fullbright is now "primarily the solo developer label of founder Steve Gaynor," who previously stepped down from the development of a once-Fullbright game, Open Roads, following <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/08/04/open-roads-studio-co-founder-steps-down-following-toxic-workplace-allegations-issues">allegations of employee misconduct and creating a toxic workplace</a>. After stepping down as the creative lead of Open Roads, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2022/07/21/a-new-destination-how-open-roads-changed-direction-and-saved-its-turbulent-road">the developers behind the road trip adventure game</a> formed the Open Roads Team to release it. It's been over a year since Open Road's launch in 2024, sans Gaynor, and now Gaynor is preparing to launch Springs, Eternal next year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the Springs, Eternal reveal trailer below:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dIUoQBAzgSw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dIUoQBAzgSw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"In Springs, Eternal, players explore the dark, winding, wooded paths of Stillwater Springs, a secluded, dreamlike, and eerie retreat nestled deep amongst the fog-shrouded pines – an otherworldly location that is equally inviting as it is unsettling," a press release reads. "As they tread and illuminate the trail, flashlight in hand, players will begin to piece together the humanistic and deeply heartfelt memory of the romantic relationship that brought them here, and perhaps discover where it will lead them next."&nbsp;</p><p>During Springs, Eternal, players will encounter a cast of other lost souls, each with their own reasons for being at Stillwater. The press release says that, "In a first for Fullbright, engaging in branching dialogue with this cast of characters reveals who they are, how their stories relate to your own, and what other secrets the supernaturally-tinged Stillwater might be hiding."&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dustborn-a-familiar-feeling/">Dustborn</a> and <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/dreamfall-chapters-two-fates-bound/">Dreamfall Chapters</a> developer Red Thread Games is expanding beyond its usual boundaries of narrative games with Hello Sunshine, a survival RPG that the studio's creative director acknowledges isn't their usual beat, but is excited to bring its own narrative-focused spin on this desert survival game.</p>



<p>Ahead of the studio showing off Hello Sunshine during the PC Gaming Show today, I got the chance to check out a hands-off presentation given by Red Thread Games' creative director, Ragnar Tørnquist, and game director Jonathan Nielssen, showing a bit of gameplay and talking about their vision for Hello Sunshine.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hello_Sunshine_Footsteps-scaled.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Red Thread Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Hello Sunshine puts you in a dystopian desert world where, thanks to corporations like Sunshine Industries (of which you are the last remaining employee), the planet is starting to resemble Arrakis, which is to say that the part of the world you'll be exploring is entirely engulfed in sand, and the sun is a constant threat. Thankfully, it doesn't seem like there are giant sandworms about, but there are small (and sometimes quite large) robots that have you doing your best Aloy impression with a bow and arrow at your disposal and a slew of arrow types to craft to help you take down every kind of rogue metal beast, big or small.</p>



<p>That said, combat isn't the core challenge to the experience; the challenge is to survive. You'll need to constantly search for resources to keep yourself alive and manage your time in the sun so you're not collapsing from total dehydration. And you'll need to do all of this while constantly moving forward, because you have a big, giant, walking tether with you at all times. A skyscraper-sized robot that not only keeps you alive, but is your best friend in this downtrodden world.</p>

<p>And it's your giant robot friend that makes Hello Sunshine an interesting prospect as a survival game. Survival players are used to managing resources and ensuring that they are not exposed to the elements for too long. And if your year has been anything like mine, you've also sunk a good chunk of hours into <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-2025-qa-we-just-need-to-keep-working-and-solve-the-problems-we-have-one-of-the-best-survival-games/">Dune: Awakening</a>, where keeping yourself safe from the elements is key to your survival more than your ability to fight off enemies. </p>



<p>But in Dune: Awakening, I can stop under a rock and rest a while, waiting for the sun to pass. Hello Sunshine's continuous day and night cycle does mean you'll get the space to rest, but during the day, you can't stop moving because the robot won't stop moving.</p>



<p>The robot is constantly moving forward, driving the momentum of the game, and because your survival is tied to staying in the robot's shadow, your looting and exploration time is always limited. I think it's an incredibly interesting way to frame a survival game, especially one with a narrative slant, because survival in life is all about moving forward, about not being stagnant and losing track of where you're going. Hello Sunshine forces you into a constant state of motion while asking you to manage all of the other regular survival elements, which I think is an extremely interesting premise for a survival game.</p>

<p>Your robot pal does sit down and charge every evening, which gives you respite not just from the sun but from the game's forward pacing. You also don't have to stay entirely glued to the robot the whole time, and certain procedural elements can allow you to stray from the robot's path for longer than you would in a clear day, like sandstorms that block out the sun, letting you wander a little further on your own. You'll also earn upgrades deeper into the game that mitigate your reliance on staying glued to the robot, but leaving its side is always a risk. Even at night, you'll freeze to death if you're not near the robot, as it releases all the heat it collected from the day.</p>



<p>Corporations like the one you were still working for when the world ended may have been the planet's downfall, but what's left behind by them is also your salvation. You'll craft upgrades and improve your character's survival chances at resting stations set up by Sunshine Industries while your robot buddy sits down and charges for the night. A 3D printer takes all of the scraps and resources you collect during the day and turns them into whatever you need to prepare for the day ahead.</p>

<p>These rest stations are also where your relationship with the robot begins to build. During the presentation, Red Thread Games describes your relationship with your iron giant friend as that of our general relationship to ants - we don't notice them unless they make us notice them. While the robot charges for the night, the Sunshine Industries rest stations are also where you can upgrade the robot's capabilities. Slowly but surely, the robot begins to pay attention to you, and your relationship with the robot evolves.</p>



<p>Tørnquist also likened your relationship with the robot to that of a child-parent relationship. Kids grow up in their parents' shadow, and it's up to them to walk out of it into the light, and how that relationship evolves is at the core of the narrative for Hello Sunshine.</p>



<p>As for how Red Thread Games approaches telling that kind of story, the team will let players experience it for themselves once the game is in their hands. They wouldn't go deeper into the story, but described Hello Sunshine as a game where its mechanics are the muscles of the game, but its strength is at its heart, which is the story. The studio also didn't delve into the co-op gameplay, but did say that Hello Sunshine's co-op "reframes the story" and that you won't actually get "the full story" without playing both solo and in co-op.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As with every hands-off preview, we'll have to wait and see if Red Thread Games is able to pull everything off. It's stepping outside its comfort zone, but you'll never accomplish anything staying in your comfort zone. Hopefully, whenever Red Thread Games is ready to release Hello Sunshine (which is still without a release date), its time straying from its own giant robot comfort zone will have proven fruitful.</p>

			<p>Publisher Deep Silver and developer KING Art Games (the German studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/iron-harvest-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iron Harvest</a>) have released a new story trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-stunning-in-engine-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV</a>, the upcoming new installment in the real-time strategy series, as part of today's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025.</p>



<p>Black Library author John French is co-writing the game's 70+ mission campaign, which will be available in both solo and co-op play modes. Dawn of War IV is set on the war‑torn world of Kronus, where the Blood Ravens, the Necrons led by Chronomancer Thothmek, the Orks under Warboss Gorgutz and Guzcutta, and Technoarcheologist Potentia Delta‑9 all converge before the Dark Angels arrive to turn the tide for the Imperium.</p>



<p>The Dark Angels are a fully playable Space Marine faction across all modes, with their own commanders (Company Master Astoran and Chaplain Ezrael), missions interleaved with those of the Blood Ravens, and a distinct playstyle emphasizing large‑scale, all‑out warfare, whereas the Blood Ravens, the other Space Marine chapter playable in the game, are often engaged in smaller conflicts that require stealth and/or tactical finesse. According to the press release, Primarch Lion El’Jonson will also appear in the campaign's climax as a playable unit, giving players direct control of a Primarch for the first time in the series.</p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV will include four playable factions (the Space Marines, Orks, Necrons, and the Adeptus Mechanicus), multiple non‑linear campaigns, competitive multiplayer (1v1, 2v2, and 3v3), and returning modes like Last Stand and Skirmish. The game is slated to launch next year on PC. KING Art Games still hasn't shared the official system requirements, but we'll let you know once they are confirmed by the development team.</p>

            <p>"PRAISE NEATH", cry the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rogue-legacy">Rogue Legacy</a>. "What's Neath?", I ask politely. It's their new game, they say, a roguelike RPG with some tactical combat about an upside-down tower constantly shifting because a god can't make up his mind. It's out next year, they add, before their fingers lose grip on the ceiling and they crash down from their inverted positions.</p>

<p>"Lead a band of fragile warriors through a colossal, inverted tower, where Taboos, the everchanging edicts of a God, warp the laws of reality," reads the start of the game's cracking synopsis. The tower's pointy, but stout, with its orientation meaning that it's hanging rather precariously above a city in a crater. Think an infernal robo-stalactite. The city has a tavern, for the love of all that's roguelikey, won't someone think of the ale?</p>
<p>Anyway, my fear of things falling aside, you head into the tower with your party, where gridded battle rooms await. The order of turns is always shifting and the goal is to think one step ahead, anticipating enemies' moves. Each run aims to be like a classic dungeon-crawl, with the usual roguelike twists and turns to keep things fresh and have you uncover more clues to the dark mystery that needs solving.</p><p>Cellar Door co-founder and lead programmer Kenny Lee cites Subset Games' mech strategy-fest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/into-the-breach-ftl-sequel-review">Into the Breach</a> and board game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mansions-of-madness">Mansions of Madness</a> as Neath's inspirations. "Development has taken us far from our comfort zone, working in an unfamiliar genre with an aesthetic much darker than what we usually do," he said. "But we’ve got a lot of new ideas, from 'engagement locking' to the 'attack resolve system', and we’re excited to see if we can move this burgeoning genre in a whole new direction."</p>
<p>Neath's currently being aimed for a 2026 release on Steam. Cellar Door are planning some closed betas next year, which you'll be able to throw your name in the hat for via the studio's Discord. Here are former RPSer Ed Thorn's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rogue-legacy-2-review-a-dense-roguelike-youll-want-to-invest-in">thoughts on Rogue Legacy 2</a> if you're in need of something to tide you over 'til then.</p>

            <p>Gregorios Kythreotis, the creative director of sci-fi hoverbike adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a>, has a new thing. He's heading up a fresh studio dubbed Eteo, who'll be aiming to release their first game in 2027. Until then, the studio plan to start putting out a newsletter called Archetypes, which'll debut in January and discuss different elements of game design.</p>

<p>Eteo will be focused on "making vibrant game worlds with a distinctly mischievous flavour", and have funding in place from Outersloth, the indie game fund run by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a> developers Innersloth, for that unnamed first game.</p>
<p>"We started [Sable studio] Shedworks about a week after I graduated from studying architecture," Kythreotis recalls in the studio announcement video above. "We've just basically been teaching ourselves on the job for a decade now. Sable was our first really big game, it changed my life completely. Eteo is sort of the next step with that. Taking everything I've learned from studying architecture, from shedworks, from Sable, and applying that to new creative explorations, projects that are really personal, but carry on with that lineage of world building, of storytelling, and games that really engage people on an emotional level."</p><p>Starting in January 2026, the studio will be putting out Archetypes, a free monthly newsletter. For the next half a year making up a first volume, it'll see three writers per month "examine unsung aspects of video game design with each article examining themes relevant to Eteo’s design philosophies". The first month's theme is "Flying Cities", with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> creator Gareth Damian Martin having been drafted in to contribute, alongside Eteo Community Manager Emma Kent and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/christian-donlan">two-time RPS contributor</a> Christian Donlan.</p>
<p>If you're interested in Archetypes, you can <a href="http://eteogames.com/">sign up</a> to receive it via Eteo's website. Then maybe spend the wait until the first issue re-reading former RPSer Alice B's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sable-review">review of Sable</a>. Come on, you know you want to.</p>

              <p><span>One thing I love about this job is learning something new about games I do not play. That includes learning that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-gta-5-roleplay-ice-raid-new-save-collective-2000646967"><i><span>Fortnite</span></i></a> <span>has historically either obscured or omitted male nipples in its various skins. Until now, that is. Homer Simpson was the first man to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-fortnite-naked-homer-skin-leak-nipples-2000645750"><span>free the nipple last month</span></a><span>, and now new character Carter Wu is getting a skin that lets him bare it all.</span></p>   <p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-really-does-seem-to-have-changed-its-nipple-policy-and-now-its-not-just-homer-simpsons-chest-thats-in-the-game"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> lays out, </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>has featured several shirtless skins of both fictional characters and real-world figures, but each of them has either covered up their chest, like putting a pelt on Kratos from </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>, or just not rendering their nipples, like rapper Travis Scott or wrestler/actor John Cena.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This is odd, but not unheard of. Some anime or anime-inspired series like </span><i><span>Free! </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>do the same thing. However, after Homer and now Carter Wu have been added to </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>with nipples intact, it seems like Epic Games might have changed whatever internal rules it had about depicting male anatomy in the game.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>has thousands of skins, so I don’t think there’s a chance in Hell that Epic goes back and rectifies this for every shirtless man it’s ever rendered, but maybe this means that future skins won’t hide or remove male nipples moving forward.</span></p> <p><span>In other </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>news, the crossover battle royale is the latest game to be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-season-7-gen-ai-tim-sweeney-latata-2000649103"><span>caught in the generative AI witch hunt</span></a><span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Liquid Swords, the new studio founded by Just Cause creator Christofer Sundberg, has officially unveiled its debut game at the PC Gaming Show today. The earliest teasers for this game pointed to a gritty, narrative-driven open-world title that many likened to Grand Theft Auto 4 in its aesthetic, but now we know exactly what we’re getting into.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the PC Gaming Show, Sundberg and Liquid Swords were all over social media, posting screenshots and talking extensively about ‘Game 1’ coming out of the new studio.</p>







<h2 id="h-liquid-swords-asks-gamers-to-brace-for-impact">Liquid Swords Asks Gamers to Brace for Impact</h2>



<p>Founded by Christofer Sundberg, the co-founder of Avalanche Studios and the creative force behind Just Cause, Liquid Swords has just revealed its inaugural title, Samson: A Tyndalston Story.</p>



<p>This project has been in the works since 2020, and the early teasers posted online referenced a bleak cityscape, suggesting similarities to games like Grand Theft Auto and Max Payne. All we knew previously was that the game was being built in Unreal Engine 5 and that it would be a far cry from Sundberg’s previous titles, like the over-the-top, explosive action series, Just Cause.</p>



<p>The PC Gaming Show played host to the game’s first major trailer, which you can see below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Samson: A Tyndalston Story - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NbFnkUlyZlo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the lead-up to the trailer dropping, Sundberg revealed that the team at Liquid Swords features talent from Avalanche, Rockstar Games, and other major studios, which makes for a promising road ahead, given the team’s pedigree.</p>



<p>The trailer uncovered a gritty crime thriller backed by gruff voices, muscle cars, and gorgeous visuals. It looks like a perfect contender for games like Grand Theft Auto, which is a very ambitious thing to suggest.</p>



<p>Do you think <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story </strong>looks like your kind of game? Let us know what you’re thinking about Liquid Swords’ first title on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

Among the stars, the planet VESTA is discovered, a world that may hold the promise of a new home. To study it, the A.R.E.S. space station is launched into orbit to analyze its potential. But when the station, and the crew, was caught up in a space phenomenon, calamity struck…</p><p>You play as Miranda, who awakens alone aboard the station trapped in a strange phenomenon. With clues of the past echoing through the world: an object out of place, a door newly unlocked, a message left behind almost as if the station itself challenges you. To survive, Miranda must rely on her mind, solving intricate puzzles, experimenting with strange objects, and piecing together the truth behind what happened to her crew and the station itself.</p><p>As Miranda unravels the mystery, one truth becomes clear: progress always has a cost. Rivage is an atmospheric science-fiction puzzle adventure that blends exploration, logic, and narrative discovery into a deeply beautiful experience, where each step brings you closer to escape.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Immersive World</strong> – Step aboard the A.R.E.S. station, a meticulously detailed, fully interactable environment where every item tells a story. Examine artifacts, analyze research data, and uncover hidden notes scattered across abandoned workstations.</li><li><strong>Captivating Storytelling</strong> – The station was once home to a crew, each with their own goals, fears, and philosophies. Now, only fragments of their lives remain: journals, personal logs, and encrypted messages scattered throughout the station. Piece together their relationships, uncover the emotional toll of isolation, and experience a narrative that weaves scientific mystery with human vulnerability.</li><li><strong>Unravel the <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>ery</strong> – Every puzzle in Rivage is woven into the fabric of the story. You’ll repair broken systems, realign malfunctioning mechanisms, and solve environmental challenges that play with gravity, magnetism, and the very flow of time.</li><li><strong>The K9 System</strong> – With the K9 System, Miranda can log discoveries and retain certain puzzle solutions, allowing players to focus on what truly matters; uncovering the truth behind the distortions that have consumed the station. This balance keeps gameplay engaging, rewarding cleverness and persistence over repetition.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Rivage World Premiere &amp; Announcement Trailer | Wishlist Now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eLNwBRHVQxM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/science-fiction-puzzle-adventure-rivage-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2020, Just Cause creator and Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sundberg started a new company, Liquid Swords, alongside other industry veterans. Now, the team at Liquid Swords has shared the first trailer for its debut action title, Samson: A Tyndalston Story. It may remind some fans of Grand Theft Auto, but there are differences that make it a lot harder to earn money in this game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ4z_yQE5Xo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tyndalston is the name of the city, and players will step into the role of Samson McCray, an aging criminal who is facing a crushing debt. Players can steal the money they need, but this isn't like other open-world crime games where you can keep going non-stop. Samson has physical limits as to what he can pull off in a day, which are measured by action points. Use too many on a single job and you won't be able to do much else.</p><p>As time passes in this world, your debt increases. For every crime you commit, the city remembers and your reputation grows. According to Liquid Swords, "There are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse." This is a story about debt, consequences, and survival. Samson will have to deal with all three on a daily basis.</p><p>"We built Samson to strike fast and leave a mark," said Sundberg in a statement. "It's a raw, physical story with systems that push back at every turn. This is the start of what Liquid Swords stands for, and the team has delivered something with real teeth. We've come through a heavy cycle of change and sharpened every part of how we work. The entire industry is navigating pressure right now. Samson is our answer to that reality, a focused project built with intent, not excess. This is how we move forward."</p><p>Samson: A Tyndalston Story will be released on PC in early 2026 on Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>

This includes defensive perks that will help keep you alive, and an offensive perk designed for intel and aggressive plays.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Survivor</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This was already a helpful pick in recent seasons of Warzone, but it becomes even more powerful in this new year with BO7's integration. In addition to the health regen and faster revives, it also now protects you from getting one-hit by snipers so long as you're geared up with full plates.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tracker</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Tracker is the pick for aggressive players looking to hunt their opponents. This will let you track and ping enemies just as before, but now the perk gives the added benefit of also letting your teammates see the enemy footprints after you shoot an enemy. Put some bullets in your opponent, but they are trying to flee? Now, you and your team can work together to track their steps and hunt them down.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ghost</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's always helpful to have a Ghost class in Warzone, but the perk is very situational. There are some matches where your opponents just aren't calling in a lot of UAVs, and it might be better to have Tracker or Survivor as your third perk. Make at least one Ghost class, and this is something you can switch to if you find there are a lot of UAVs getting activated, or to keep you off the radar in a late-game situation.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Adaptive</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This is a brand-new perk that the developer says is designed to allow you to dynamically respond to combat situations. When your armor plates are full, it supports aggressive pushes. When plates are depleted, it grants a constant movement advantage to aid you in repositioning.</p><p dir="ltr">This perk could be really useful in various situations, but it will require some testing to see if the ADS and speed boosts are enough to make this a viable pick, but it's worth trying out to see if you find this beneficial to you.</p>

            <p>A new story trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4">Dawn of War 4</a> has just been revealed, showing off the Dark Angels as a playable sub-faction, and teasing the old and busted Lion El' Johnson who appears to actually be hanging around his kids for once.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us some more context as to why the four playable factions are back on Kronus, with Blood Ravens and Orks clashing like the good ol' days, while the Adeptus Mechanicus explore Necron tombs. We see a variety of units new to the series, including a Chaplan on bike, Necron skorpekh destroyers and an Ork Beastboss.</p>
<p>Lion El' Johnson interestingly enough has his helmet on at the tail end of the trailer, which may have prevented some from noticing his presence in the trailer. However, given we see his shield on full display, that's certainly him!</p>

<p>We also now know that the Dawn of War 4 campaign has been written by Black Library author John French. He's written plenty of Warhammer books over the years. This includes books focused on Ahriman, the first captain of the Thousand Suns legion. There's been a long-running fan theory that the Blood Ravens are successors of the Thousand Sons, so who knows? Maybe John French will drop a breadcrumb or two.</p><p>Other interesting tidbits from the trailer include the fact warboss Gorgutz is still alive and kicking. This makes sense as the Orks canonically were the victors of Dawn of War: Soulstorm, thus Orks would still be milling about the place. The Necrons have been fleshed out a bit too, ironically.</p>
<p>During the campaign, players will be able to pick between Dark Angels and Blood Ravens missions, allowing a degree of choice depending on which Space Marine faction you vibe with the most. These missions are "non-linear" according to the official press release for this story trailer.</p>
<p>Dawn of War 4 is set to release sometime in 2026, though you can wishlist it now! If you want to get an idea of what it's like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-and-it-feels-like-the-sequel-to-the-original-that-rts-fans-always-wanted">why not read our Dawn of War 4 preview</a>. In it, writer Chris Tapsell stated: "it feels like the sequel to the original that RTS fans always wanted".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the highlights of my writing this year was heading out to meet the team from 10Chambers at the European Unity headquarters, and getting to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/den-of-wolves-throws-an-inception-sized-wrench-into-the-multiplayer-heist-genre/">hands-on with Den of Wolves</a>. This futuristic heist game has a hell of a legacy – 10Chambers’ studio founder Ulf Anderson was the creator of Payday and GTFO – and even in our short time with the game, it was clear that the mix of planning, gunplay and crazy Inception-like sections was looking to be something special. While they’re continuing to work hard on the forthcoming game, 10Chambers are continuing a drip-feed of information, this time showcasing a new trailer, where they let four of the key community members for the game go hands-on. It looks like they had a pretty good time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves - Community Hands-On Trailer | PC Gaming Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCUnDA8BpIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Robin Björkell, the Communications Director at 10 Chamber said, “I’ve been begging management to give us a release window for Den of Wolves in the trailer – but no. They won’t budge. These developers really don’t want to make promises they can’t keep for the sake of marketing. It makes my job harder, but as a gamer myself, I respect it. I told them we at least need to prove that the game exists, and that was the starting point for this trailer. We invited some of our most loyal fans to come to our office and play the game. This is real footage of them playing the game – not scripted, not us playing. The game does exist – ask them,”</p>
<p>In fact, you can hear from one of them straight away, with RandomKenny, one of the invited players, saying, “Absolutely incredible experience being invited to play Den of Wolves early. Planning and executing how you’re going to tackle heists is super satisfying. I had such a blast playing, and I honestly can’t wait for the game to be released”.</p>
<p>In the trailer, the players can be seen tackling a heist in a previously unseen level inside a robot factory. Inside this gigantic factory, the players face resistance from both human and robotic enemies, all while deploying spider drills to hack vaults full of valuables.</p>

<p>Obviously, the big question remains, just when will Den of Wolves release? The team are remaining tight-lipped despite the huge groundswell of community interest, and it doesn’t look like we’re going to get a set date any time soon.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-458384">{“Source” : “NVIDIA APP”, “B64” : “eyJEUlNBcHBOYW1lIiA6ICIiLCAiRFJTUHJvZmlsZU5hbWUiIDogIiIsICJTaG9ydE5hbWUiIDogIiIsICJDbXNJZCIgOiAwfQ==”}</p>
<p>“Even though we’ve not conducted any closed or public playtests yet, Den of Wolves has over half a million wishlists. We’re so grateful for our community’s support, and we can’t wait to show more details about the game. The reason we’re shy about communicating a release window yet is that we learned our lesson with GTFO, which was delayed multiple times. We don’t think it’s fair to communicate fake dates for the sake of getting an announcement out,” says Oscar J-T Holm, co-founder of 10 Chambers.</p>
<p>Even if we don’t get a release date for Den of Wolves set in stone quite yet, here’s hoping that we learn more in early 2026, at least in terms of beta testing or a potential demo.</p>
