<p>Although this firmware update isn't a big one, it does appear to address some important issues. This includes an issue where a few Error Codes would repeatedly occur when attempting to perform a transfer between the Switch and Switch 2. There are also some fixes specifically tied to the Switch 2's Sleep Mode and Airplane Mode.</p>
<p>Apart from this, are some general system improvements on both platforms, focused on making both devices super stable.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ohxpli&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tile-mate-4-pack-hits-record-low-iphone-and-android-users-get-four-trackers-for-one-airtag-money-2000647050</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s AirTag is $29 individually or $99 for a 4-pack but those trackers lock you exclusively into the Apple ecosystem while leaving Android users out entirely. The Tile Mate <strong>4-pack works seamlessly with both iPhone and Android devices</strong> which makes it the universal solution for households where not everyone uses the same phone brand. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5897/">At $39, down from $79</a>, this bundle has hit a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday while selling thousands of units daily.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5897/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Universal Compatibility</h2>
<p>The <strong>cross-platform design lets iPhone users, Android phone owners, and tablet users</strong> track their items using the same <em>Tile</em> network, free from compatibility barriers. This universal approach proves essential in mixed-device households when parents use iPhones while kids carry Android phones or vice versa. The Tile Network takes advantage of <strong>its millions of active users running the app to create crowdsourced location</strong> updates when items stray beyond Bluetooth range, which works similarly to Apple’s Find My network sans platform restrictions.</p>



<p>It’s the ability to ring your Tile from your phone that enables the location of keys buried in couch cushions, bags left in another room, or water bottles hiding under car seats within Bluetooth range. This basic functionality covers the majority of <em>“I know it’s here somewhere”</em> situations where items are nearby but obscured. The reverse capability is equally useful: pressing the button on your Tile makes your phone ring at full volume even when set to silent mode, solving the universal problem of misplaced phones that don’t respond to calls because you’ve enabled Do Not Disturb.</p>
<p>Life360 integration provides significant added value <strong>and consolidates family location tracking and item tracking into a single interface</strong>. Instead of having one app to find your family members and another to track your lost items, Life360 displays all on one single map. Parents can see where their kids are while at the same time tracking the car keys of the whole family, a backpack of their teenager, or even a pet’s collar. The consolidated view makes daily logistics simpler and reduces app-switching friction, forcing people to abandon tracking systems that they find too complicated.</p>



<p>Beyond simple item tracking, <strong>the SOS alert feature provides discreet personal safety functionality.</strong> Pressing and holding the Tile button initiates an emergency alert to select contacts along with your location, making a panic button you carry on your keychain. This additional layer of safety is desirable for college students walking alone at night, elderly family members with medical concerns, or anyone working in situations where they may need to summon help quickly.</p>
<p>The four-pack quantity covers the items people lose most frequently: <strong>house keys, car keys, wallet or purse, and backpack or gym bag</strong>. Having multiple trackers lets users comprehensively cover everything that regularly goes missing rather than having to ration a single tracker across multiple items. The compact Mate form factor attaches easily to key rings, slips into wallet card slots, or clips onto bag zippers through the built-in hole. The<strong> 250-foot Bluetooth range</strong> extends coverage across typical homes and offices, though the community finding feature extends effective range infinitely through crowd-sourced updates.</p>
<p>With four Tile Mates for $39, you’re getting cross-platform tracking, bidirectional finding, SOS emergency alerts, and community finding at half the retail price this Black Friday. Apple’s equivalent 4-pack of AirTags costs $99 while locking you into iOS exclusively which makes Tiles both cheaper and more functionally useful for multi-platform households.</p>

                <p>This year has been a strong one for survival horror games, and one of the highlights has been Cronos: The New Dawn, an original horror game from Bloober Team, the studio behind last year's critically acclaimed Silent Hill 2 remake. The sci-fi horror adventure launched just a few weeks ago back in September, but thanks to Amazon's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> sale, you can grab Cronos: The New Dawn for up to 30% off.

<p>It once again highlights the title's 'T' for "Teen" rating, as the game features "animated blood and violence". Here's the official rundown. This same rating was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/metroid-prime-4-rating-spotted-on-nintendos-website">originally spotted on Nintendo's US website</a> in September. Here's the summary in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> is rated T for Teen by the ESRB with Animated Blood and Violence. Also includes In-Game Purchases. This is a first-person adventure game in which players assume the role of a space bounty hunter who must find a way home. Players explore a planet to uncover its mystery while engaging in combat against alien creatures and space pirates. Players use power beams, missiles, and elemental attacks to battle enemies in frenetic combat. Combat is highlighted by blaster effects, frequent explosions, and screen-shaking effects. A handful of alien creatures and boss characters emit blue/green blood when shot."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/metroid-prime-4-rating-spotted-on-nintendos-website">previously mentioned</a>, this age rating is consistent with the main <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> games before the fourth entry. And once again, here's ESRB's basic summary of this particular age rating, describing what a game under this classification may contain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Teen - content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. May contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling and/or infrequent use of strong language."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"In-game Purchases" are also specifically mentioned for the original Switch version of the game, which appears to be for the game's Upgrade Pack.</p>
<p>In other Metroid Prime 4 news, Nintendo has also recently revealed the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/icymi-metroid-prime-4-beyond-estimated-switch-2-and-switch-file-size-revealed">eShop file sizes of the game</a> on the Switch 2 and Switch. A demo for the game has also been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-demo-now-available-at-switch-2-kiosks-us">spotted at Switch 2 kiosks</a> over the past week.

The other benefit is that this also makes it easier to transport your turntable to a function or a party, and there is a wide variety of speakers to choose from. JBL has pocket-friendly devices like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Bluetooth-Built-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B08KW1KR5H?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">JBL Go</a>, while Sony's range <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-HT-S2000-Soundbar-Bluetooth-Technology/dp/B0BWLCLZPS?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">includes multi-function speakers</a> with a similar design aesthetic to the turntable.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-sells-eufy-solar-camera-at-break-even-50-off-means-no-profit-just-to-offload-stock-2000647046</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-sells-eufy-solar-camera-at-break-even-50-off-means-no-profit-just-to-offload-stock.1363492/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most outdoor security cameras are constantly draining batteries, require ongoing subscription fees for cloud storage or need complicated wiring/constant recharging that makes maintenance a headache. The eufy security <em>SoloCam</em> S220 eliminates these headaches <strong>through solar charging that keeps the battery perpetually topped up with just three hours of daily sunlight</strong>&nbsp;while local storage removes monthly fees entirely.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4912/">At $49, down from $99</a>, this wireless camera has hit a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday. The 50% discount makes buying individual units more economic than the multi-camera packs also on sale, which is strange since bulk bundles usually offer better per-unit pricing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4912/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solar Power That Works</h2>
<p>Most climates keep the battery charged indefinitely with an integrated solar panel, requiring only three hours of daily sunlight for continuous operation. This threshold is achievable even on overcast winter months in northern latitudes, although it’s obvious that southern, sunny climates easily exceed the requirements. For this reason, the solar capability makes this an install-and-forget solution that runs perpetually without intervention rather than a truly battery-powered camera that requires quarterly recharges.</p>
<p>You avoid the frustrating cycle of climbing ladders every few months to remove, recharge, and reinstall cameras that plague purely battery-dependent competitors. The environmental benefit of solar operation extends beyond mere convenience by eliminating disposable batteries and reducing overall energy consumption compared to wired cameras drawing constant wall power.</p>



<p>The <strong>2K resolution captures significantly more detail than standard 1080p cameras</strong>&nbsp;and allows for digital zoom into footage without losing clarity when reviewing suspicious activity or identifying faces and license plates. In daylight, the sensor resolves fine details of clothing patterns, vehicle makes, and facial features from reasonable distances. The f/1.6 aperture lets substantially more light reach the sensor than cameras with smaller apertures, such as f/2.0 and f/2.4, which directly improves low-light performance before infrared illumination even activates.<strong> Once darkness falls, infrared LEDs invisibly illuminate the scene</strong> to provide night vision that maintains clarity and detail, rather than the grainy, indistinct footage that renders cheaper cameras nearly useless after sundown.</p>
<p><strong>Human detection powered by AI on the device</strong> filters out false alerts from swaying branches, passing cars, or wandering animals that constantly trigger motion-based systems. The intelligence identifies actual people and sends alerts specifically when humans enter your monitored area, which reduces notification fatigue from dozens of meaningless alerts each day. Local processing happens completely on the camera itself without ever sending footage to cloud servers, protecting your privacy while facilitating faster response times since data doesn’t have to travel to remote servers for analysis.</p>



<p><strong>The process of wireless installation takes minutes </strong>where you drill one hole for the mounting bracket and essentially you are done. No running of ethernet cables through walls, no complicated electrical jobs, no coordination with electricians or handymen charging hourly rates. The compact size and wire-free design allow placement in optimal surveillance positions without concern for nearby outlets or limitations on cable routing. You can mount cameras under eaves, on fence posts, or attached to trees if needed, positioning for coverage rather than compromising based on wiring constraints.</p>
<p>In contrast, it is a <strong>no-monthly-fee model</strong> that genuinely gives long-term savings compared to subscription-based competitors like Ring or Nest, at $3 to $10 monthly per camera. Over five years, these subscriptions add up to $180 to $600 per camera just to unlock basic features like video storage and AI detection. The Eufy approach focuses on storing footage locally on the internal memory of the cameras and handling AI alerts on-device, thus removing any recurring costs while retaining full functionality.</p>
<p>The eufy security SoloCam S220 brings solar-powered operation and 2K resolution at a new record low for Black Friday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-dumps-40-inch-smart-fire-tv-at-40-off-your-black-friday-tv-hunt-ends-here-for-pocket-change-2000647056</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget TVs traditionally meant accepting mediocre picture quality, sluggish interfaces and limited streaming options that frustrated users daily. Amazon’s <em>Insignia</em> Fire TV line solves these compromises by integrating their proven Fire TV platform directly into affordable displays that prioritize functionality over fancy features. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5898/">At $89, down from $149, this 40-inch model has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday. The combination of <strong>1080p Full HD resolution, Alexa voice control, and access to virtually every major streaming service</strong> makes this one of the most practical secondary TVs available for bedrooms or kitchens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5898/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The <strong>integrated Fire TV interface ditches the clunky, outdated menus</strong> that plague generic budget TVs still running basic smart platforms from five years ago. Navigation feels responsive rather than laggy, with apps launching quick and content loading without frustrating delays that make you question your purchase. Access to over 1.5 million streaming movies and TV episodes spans all major services, including Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, YouTube, Apple TV+, Disney+, ESPN+, and countless others, all without requiring external streaming devices.</p>



<p>The included <strong>Alexa Voice Remote transforms TV control from button-mashing frustration into natural voice commands</strong> that actually understand context. Say “Alexa, find action movies,” and it searches across all your installed streaming apps at once rather than forcing you to check each service individually. Say “Alexa, open Netflix,” and it immediately launches the app without you having to swipe through menus.</p>
<p>This <strong>1080p Full HD resolution strikes a great balance</strong> and offers clear and detailed picture quality above 720p displays without the superfluous expense of 4K panels, which most viewers can’t tell the difference from at 40-inch screen sizes and typical viewing distances. If you’re sitting 6 to 8 feet away from the display, the human eye can’t really detect the difference in resolution between 1080p and 4K unless you stick your face right up against the screen.</p>



<p>The <strong>DTS Virtual-X processing on this set creates virtual three-dimensional sound</strong> from the TV’s integrated speakers, expanding the audio beyond the flat, tinny output most budget TVs produce. While this virtual surround can’t compete with a dedicated speaker system or a soundbar, it meaningfully improves dialogue clarity and makes the audio much more spacious, therefore adding to the movie- or show-watching experience.</p>
<p>Connectivity options range from game console and streaming device hookups via two HDMI ports to legacy equipment with composite <strong>AV jacks, digital optical output for audio systems, a USB port for media playback, headphone jack for private listening, and coaxial jack</strong> for cable or antenna connections. The diversity in this port arrangement caters to everything from minimalist, streaming-only setups to advanced home theater configurations that involve many sources.</p>
<p>At $89, this 40-inch Insignia Fire TV comes in at 40% off retail this Black Friday. If you need a capable TV for a bedroom, kitchen, or any space where 4K feels excessive, this record-low price makes Fire TV functionality accessible to everyone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A live-action <strong>Far Cry TV series</strong> has been <strong>officially announced</strong> for FX. Furthermore, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-tv-show-appears-on-ubisoft-site-is-removed-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as the rumors suggested</a>, the brains behind Alien: Earth and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia are working on it.</p>







<p>The Far Cry series has been a staple of the survival FPS genre since its first release in 2004. Since then, each entry has reinvented itself as an anthology, going to various locations around the world. However, it’s great shooting and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-far-cry-games-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often brilliant villains</a> (portrayed by big-name actors like Giancarlo Esposito and Troy Baker) keep fans coming back. While it’s been four years since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry’s last release</a>, Far Cry 6, we now have a new official project: a primetime TV show.</p>



<h2 id="h-fx-s-far-cry-tv-show-announced-created-by-noah-hawley-and-rob-mac">FX’s Far Cry TV Show Announced, Created by Noah Hawley and Rob Mac</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/far-cry-tv-series-fx-noah-hawley-rob-mac-1236591190/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">broke the news first</a>, announcing that <strong>FX has ordered a Far Cry TV series</strong>. It’ll be <strong>executive-produced</strong> by Alien: Earth and Fargo director <strong>Noah Hawley</strong> and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia actor <strong>Rob Mac</strong>. In the article, it’s mentioned that <strong>the show will be an anthology</strong>, like the games, in that <strong>each season will have a different cast and story</strong>. For the first season, while details aren’t given, <strong>Rob Mac is set to star in it</strong>. The show is set to stream on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally. </p>



<p>Speaking on the collaboration, actor Rob Mac said the following,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized,” states Mac. “Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, Noah Hawley spoke to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/far-cry-tv-series-fx-noah-hawley-rob-mac-1236591190/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> on the Far Cry show, saying,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“What I love about the ‘Far Cry’ game franchise is it’s an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of ‘Fargo’ is a variation on a theme,” Hawley says. “To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I’m excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, no date or additional casting has been announced as of yet. Still, given both Rob and Noah’s history with FX, Far Cry seems to be in very good hands. As a fan, it’ll be interesting to see where the first season goes. </p>

                <p>Near the end of October, Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">fired more than 30 employees</a> across offices in the United Kingdom and Canada. At the time, Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said that the employees had been terminated over "gross misconduct." But now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TvWNFBBwuY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">People Make Games</a> has reported that these employees' dismissal didn't have anything to do with spilling secrets from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> or any other Rockstar projects.</p><p>According to People Make Games, the issue at hand arose over internal company messages that were shared on a Discord server used by staff members and representatives of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain. However, the messages shared were about changes to Rockstar's Slack policy, which eliminated channels where workers could chat about topics outside of the office.</p><p>The report notes that Rockstar has such tight security that employees can't even check their email unless they're physically in the office. One of the employees apparently posted the Slack changes to the Discord server at a time when most of the other devs hadn't received any correspondence about it yet.</p><p>People Make Games' source suggests that someone on the Discord server brought that message to the attention of Rockstar management. That allegedly sparked the internal investigation which led to the employees being dismissed from Rockstar.</p><p>Subsequently, IWGB accused Rockstar of union busting and filed a legal claim on behalf of the staff members who lost their jobs. Over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-200-rockstar-devs-sign-letter-demanding-fired-staff-be-reinstated/1100-6536181/" data-ref-id="1100-6536181">200 Rockstar employees signed a letter</a> demanding that fired workers be reinstated. For now, there doesn't appear to be any resolution in sight and the case may go to court in the United Kingdom to sort out the fate of Rockstar's ex-developers.</p>

<section><p>It's time for a bolder, more creative approach to game remakes.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Looking at my past few years of reviews for GameSpot, I've noticed a trend: I've looked at a lot of remakes and remasters. A lot of them have been good--great, even. It makes me happy to see games that had a big impact in Japan in their heyday, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/live-a-live/" data-ref-id="5000-4962">Live A Live</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven/" data-ref-id="5000-632922">Romancing SaGa 2</a>, finally make the journey overseas.</p><p dir="ltr">But lately, I've been feeling like these remakes specifically are lacking something. While I enjoyed many of these titles, there was just something I couldn't put my finger on that felt off. I thought that maybe I was experiencing a sort of odd fatigue from having gone through so many of them over the past few years, but when I played through Dragon Quest I and II HD recently, I was finally able to figure out exactly what's irking me.</p><p dir="ltr">So many remakes lack ambition.</p><p dir="ltr">In entertainment media, familiarity and name recognition carry a lot of weight. If you watch or play through a new entry in a legacy series, like a Star Wars film or the latest Call of Duty, you generally know what to expect. Remakes tend to be even more predictable: the characters, setpieces, story arcs, and themes are already known, so you can just borrow that script, while modernizing the visuals and touching up gameplay bits along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">But stopping there would just be a remaster. Why should anyone be beholden to this structure for a remake? If you're going to take the step of completely redoing something, why not do something truly transformative? Why do you have to be constrained by what came beforehand?</p><p dir="ltr">Let's use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-632913">Dragon Quest I HD-2D Remake</a> as an example. The original Dragon Quest's story is about as simple as it gets: a destined warrior descended from a legendary bloodline appears one day to rescue the princess and save the world by defeating the wicked Dragonlord and his minions. Pretty standard for an RPG from the early days of the genre, and the games that followed DQI would dramatically expand on the story and character tropes of these early games, delivering some all-time classics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1532/15327795/4609181-4699439484-45931.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4609181" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1532/15327795/4609181-4699439484-45931.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4609181"></a><figcaption>Dragon Quest I HD-2D Remake.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1532/15327795/4609181-4699439484-45931.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The remake keeps true to the original game's plot, but attempts to "modernize" it by adding in mostly-superfluous details. You begin the game by saving some soldiers from Tantagel's elite team from monsters, and then making your way to the familiar castle where the king sends you off on your grand journey. These soldiers--who aren't even given names--appear again at parts in the story to try and add some dramatic gravitas. One's dying from an evil sickness, another abandoned his post in fear, and the third feels like a failure.</p><p dir="ltr">There's potential for these characters to be interesting companions, but Dragon Quest I was a solo adventure, and the remake doesn't change that, pushing these potentially interesting characters aside once the cutscenes involving them end. The romantic subplot with Princess Gawelin is a bit more interesting in the remake, as you now get to see her struggle in the monsters' captivity. However, she too falls into the background, only popping up to give guidance from afar--presumably because making her a more prominent figure would change the story too much from the original's tale.</p><p dir="ltr">The developers hamstrung themselves by remaining faithful to the source material. There's so much potential for interesting takes and expansions on DQI's narrative. We could have brief periods where those Tantagel soldiers act as NPC helpers--just like the changes to the Princess of Cannock's role in Dragon Quest II HD--giving them more background and characterization. And through this expansion in their characters, wecould get more background on the hero and the various ruined cities we encounter along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Those are pretty tame suggestions for building more on the plot, but it's possible to imagine some dramatic, surprising changes that would shake up the Dragon Quest I experience in interesting ways. What if Princess Gwaelin was swayed towards evil, even briefly? What if the hero had a crisis of duty and doubted his ability to save the world, having him do some soul-searching to rediscover his courage? (I'd say "What if you take the Dragonlord's offer to rule half the world before your final face-off" but there actually is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-quest-builders-review-working-the-land/1900-6416573/">a whole game based on that premise!</a>) There are so many possibilities to subvert players' expectations and surprise them, and none of those opportunities are capitalized on.</p><p dir="ltr">It's frustrating, because it feels like DQ1HD knows it doesn't have to always try and follow the progression and beats of the original game. It adds new areas like the dwarf and fairy villages, drops in some additional boss fights, and changes how locked doors work, but more often than not, it opts to stick with the same old story beats, just with more flowery dialogue and prettier, more dramatic (but hollow-feeling) cutscenes. (I do think its companion game, Dragon Quest II HD, does the "remake" concept better, with a new playable character and more locations and dialogue--though it also feels somewhat restrained.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4611663-4113591-re4_leon_png_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4611663" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4611663-4113591-re4_leon_png_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4611663"></a><figcaption>Resident Evil 4 Remake.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4611663-4113591-re4_leon_png_jpgcopy.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm not just tossing this criticism at old, story-light RPGs, either. There's a very good argument that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4-2005/" data-ref-id="5000-3941">Resident Evil 4</a> is one of the most important games of its generation, and it's held up so well over time that many (myself included) questioned why it needed a remake. And while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/" data-ref-id="5000-565525">the remake</a> turned out very well, it's still what you'd expect if you've played Resident Evil 4 before. So again: why bother, except to capitalize on name recognition? It might be idealistic, presuming that that’s not enough in itself for companies, of course. But I feel like there's incredible potential to re-explore RE4 with dramatically altered story elements. Hell, I'd love to see an "alternative" RE4: the game was known to have gone through several different concepts throughout its development. Why not revisit one of those, and give us an alternate-universe game based on the early "Castle" and "Hallucination" game concepts?</p><p dir="ltr">There are so many more examples I could give: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-rpg-legend-of-the-seven-stars/" data-ref-id="5000-17691">Super Mario RPG</a> on Switch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-589435">Metal Gear Solid Delta</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-3-reload/" data-ref-id="5000-590942">Persona 3 Reload</a>. All fine games, but all standard, by-the-numbers remakes. Unfortunately, developers seem downright allergic to the idea of making dramatic changes to a remake. In all these cases, we witness how unwavering fidelity to the source material comes at the sacrifice of creativity. Sure, you've always got fans who will throw a hissy-fit when any element gets altered for a remake--but I feel like these are the people that you likely can't ever fully please with a remake anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">Other artistic mediums aren't afraid to allow for different takes on a core idea--look at the many different adaptations of Superman, The Lord of the Rings, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, to say nothing of classic stories and myths like Sherlock Holmes, Frankenstein, and Arthurian legend. It's not just about handing over the keys to a beloved series to new staff, either--original creators have gone back to re-examine and recreate their own work, giving us transformative media like the Rebuild of Evangelion film series. These mediums seem to understand that the existence of a remake doesn't nullify the original's presence or lasting impact.</p><p dir="ltr">If you asked for an example of a remake that fits my ideal, I'd say something along the lines of what's being done with Final Fantasy VII Remake project. By this point, FFVII's characters and plot are widely known--but instead of just regurgitating those beloved plot beats, the remakes (Rebirth especially) are taking familiar characters and scenarios and twisting them in wildly different ways. You'll find some division among fans about how FFVII's story beats are being transformed and re-contextualized, which isn't surprising. But no matter how you feel about the way the story and characters have been handled, you have to at least give credit to Square-Enix for daring to do more. Final Fantasy VII Remake understands that it can coexist with the original Final Fantasy VII, so it's not afraid to shake things up--and that makes it all the more captivating.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, I feel that remakes shouldn't be afraid to take fresh, surprising, and different approaches to their source material. While it's important to understand the essence of what made a game beloved, not everything about the original games needs to be considered sacrosanct and unable to be altered. I'm not feeling completely down on remakes, though, since a few games on the horizon look to be doing some interesting stuff: Danganronpa 2x2 is offering up an entire alternate plotline, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties/" data-ref-id="5000-696295">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> is giving one of the series' most beloved villains a starring role in a new scenario. And as much as I've been down on the Dragon Quest remake, I'm hopeful that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/" data-ref-id="5000-694773">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined </a>will be more like the sort of game I wish that was. Hopefully we'll see more developers realize that remakes provide an opportunity to transform and recreate games in fresh and fascinating ways.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-offloads-move-2-at-zero-margin-portable-speaker-better-than-most-home-systems-goes-for-pennies-2000647037</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonos-offloads-move-2-at-zero-margin-portable-speaker-better-than-most-home-systems-goes-for-pennies.1363462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos represents the high-end tier of wireless audio, and the <strong>Move 2 portable speaker punches well above its weight in terms of sound quality</strong>, considering it’s a <strong>battery-powered mobile unit</strong>. The dual-tweeter architecture combined with the precision-tuned woofer creates a true stereo soundstage that outclasses many dedicated bookshelf speakers that cost hundreds more when the Move 2 is stationary.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5896/">$399, down from $499, this wireless powerhouse has reached a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday. The combination of audiophile-grade sound, 24-hour battery life, and portability makes this speaker phenomenal for anyone that won’t compromise audio quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5896/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Acoustic Architecture That Redefines Portable Audio</h2>
<p>The <strong>new dual tweeter setup supplants the original Move’s single tweeter</strong> configuration for a proper stereo soundstage that separates left and right channels for appropriate spatial audio presentation. What this means in terms of architecture is that vocals sit centered and defined while instruments occupy clear positions across the sound field rather than blending together in mono.</p>
<p>Delivering low frequencies with authority and control, the precision-tuned woofer provides deep bass that is physical in nature without a hint of muddiness or distortion, even at loudest volumes. The dynamic range of live recordings captures the emotional charge and energy of performances without compression, like cheaper portable speakers would do.</p>



<p>The automatic <em>Trueplay</em> feature continuously analyzes the acoustic environment of the Move 2 and <strong>adjusts output in real-time to optimize sound</strong> for wherever you place the speaker. Set it on a wood table, and the system compensates for surface reflections. Move it near a wall, and Trueplay adjusts for boundary reinforcement that can boost bass unnaturally.</p>
<p><strong>Battery performance reaches as high as 24 hours</strong> on a single charge, which represents double the runtime of the original Move despite the more powerful acoustic components. That’s long enough for an entire weekend camping, a full day at the beach, or a multi-day event without having to hunt for outlets. Efficiency improvements come courtesy of refined power management that coordinates amplification, processing, and battery draw.</p>



<p>In contrast, <strong>the IP56 rating gives serious protection against real-world conditions</strong>, not just friendly marketing splash resistance. Rain, dirt, dust, and spills will not destroy internal components or affect operation. The rating means complete dust protection and resistance to strong water jets from all directions, which, in other words, means that during beach trips, pool parties, and backyard gatherings where accidents inevitably happen, survival is assured.</p>
<p>The wireless charging base provides elegant docking which charges the speaker by simply setting it down. The upgraded design now includes a detachable power cable and a more compact adapter for easier packing during travel. The base stays at home for daily charging while USB-PD compatibility offers charging on the go with any USB Power Delivery power supply.</p>
<p>If audiophile-grade sound that travels with you anywhere is what you’re after, this record-low price offers premium portable audio without the usually associated Sonos premium.</p>

            <p>
Remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tower-of-fantasy">Tower of Fantasy</a>? It was one of those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>-ish gacha games, with its particular twist, so to speak, being that it's sort of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a>. I say sort of, because it's described as a shared open world, meaning you can see other players, and there are some MMO elements, but its monetisations are much more gacha like. Or, well, they are until tomorrow, November 25th, as in quite a big move developer Hotta Studio is stripping Tower of Fantasy of all of its gacha elements.
</p>
<p>
That is in one new server, anyway, <a href="https://tof.perfectworld.com/eneu/news/notice/20251121/259439.shtml">the Warp server</a>. Once there, you'll no longer need to pull for weapons and matrices (bits of gear), you can get all of that for free like by simply playing different events and "daily gameplay." With this there'll be a bit more of a traditional trade system, alongside a new in-game currency called dark crystals, where you can buy and, well, trade for resources and the like.
</p>
<p>
There'll also be a new season system! Not like the weather, like game seasons. These'll come with different progression styles and play modes, there's rewards to be earned like outfits, typical season stuff, though I'm not entirely sure if this will be a thing you pay for or not. On top of that, to make it much more like an MMO, there's some new social stuff, such as a new place called the Crew Base, a space you can just sort of hang out in with other players.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, specifics are weirdly scant, which is perhaps a misstep given how the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2064650/Tower_of_Fantasy/#app_reviews_hash">isn't exactly universally beloved right now</a>. Still, I do wonder if the old ways of gacha are on the way out. Games like Duet Night Abyss have decided to forgo them, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ananta-looks-expensive-like-a-mix-of-gta-spider-man-and-yakuza-and-a-bit-overwhelming">upcoming mashup between Spider-Man and GTA</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ananta">Ananta</a>, also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/despite-all-appearances-upcoming-f2p-open-world-rpg-ananta-isnt-a-gacha-game-only-charging-for-cosmetics-and-furniture/">isn't going the gacha route</a>. Here's hoping more games follow that path.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday deals are everywhere right now and most of them are pretty forgettable. Another discount on headphones you don’t need, a slightly cheaper subscription to a streaming service you already have-you know the drill. But here’s one that actually caught my attention: NordProtect, the <strong>most popular&nbsp;identity theft protection service</strong>, is running a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/">promotion that drops the price to $4.49 per month, down from the usual $14.99</a>. That’s a 70% discount, and unlike most Black Friday offers, this one addresses a problem that’s getting worse by the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<p>Here’s the thing about identity theft: it’s one of those problems that feels abstract until it happens to you. You hear about data breaches in the news, shrug, change a password or two, and move on with your life. But the numbers tell a different story: <strong>Every 22 seconds, someone in the United States falls victim to identity theft</strong>. Not every hour, not every few minutes-every 22 seconds. The FTC reported that over 1.1 million people filed identity theft cases in 2024, and last year alone, fraud cost consumers more than $12.5 billion, which is a 25% jump from the year before.</p>
<h2>Same Owner as NordVPN</h2>
<p>NordProtect comes from Nord Security, the same company making <em>NordVPN</em> and <em>NordPass</em> which means they are definitely not new in the security game. What they’ve done here is to create a service that handles all the tedious, anxiety-inducing work of keeping your identity safe-so you don’t have to be thinking about it every waking moment of your life.</p>
<p>It <strong>monitors credit reports from all three major bureaus</strong>, watches bank accounts for weird transactions and even actively scans the dark web for your personal information. That last one is of particular note since the dark web is basically the marketplace where stolen data gets traded around and if your info pops up, you want to know about it immediately. You can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/nordvpn/nordprotect">check out Gizmodo’s review of the service</a> for more details on how it performs in real-world usage.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2000646904" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646904"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646904">© NordProtect</figcaption></figure>
<p>The monitoring is only the beginning: What makes NordProtect practical is the fact that it doesn’t just tell you something bad happened –<strong> it tells you what to do about it</strong>. When your data shows up in some breach or suspicious activity gets flagged, you get an alert with concrete, actionable steps to take. No vague warnings that leave you Googling <em>“what to do if my email was in a data breach”</em> in the middle of the night.</p>
<h2>Up To $1 Million In Coverage</h2>
<p>Let’s say monitoring fails and you actually become a victim of identity theft. This is where things start to get costly and time-consuming for most people: hours on the phone with banks, credit card companies, credit bureaus, possibly law enforcement. You may want a lawyer. You may miss out on wages while taking time off work to sort it all out. <strong>NordProtect includes up to $1 million in coverage</strong> for eligible recovery costs-which means attorney fees, lost wages, and other expenses that come with cleaning up the mess. There’s also fraud insurance:<strong> as much as $50,000 for online threats or blackmail situations</strong>, and as much as $10,000 if someone actually steals money from your bank or credit card through an online scam.</p>
<p>But what really sets this apart from those credit monitoring services that send you reports is that you get an assigned case manager-not a phone tree, not a chatbot, but a real, live person based in the United States available any time of day or night. And if identity theft does strike, this person becomes your advocate. They’ll do the paperwork, communicate with financial institutions and credit agencies, make sure deadlines aren’t missed, and generally cut through the red tape on your behalf.</p>
<p>The truth is that most of us are walking around with a dozen potential vulnerabilities. We shop online, we use public WiFi, we have accounts on websites that may or may not have great security practices. Each one of those is a potential entry point for someone looking to steal your information. You can’t eliminate the risk entirely-that would require living off the grid-but you can set up a system that catches problems early and helps you fix them quickly.</p>
<p>At $4.49 per month with this Black Friday deal, NordProtect costs less than a single lunch. The service includes a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee</strong> if you decide it’s not for you, so there’s room to test it out. Given that the average identity theft victim spends months recovering and often thousands of dollars in the process, having this kind of safety net feels less like a luxury and more like basic maintenance.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assetto-corsa-rally-is-here-to-keep-me-humble.1363438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>From<a href="https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5/"> <em><u>Europa Universalis V</u></em></a> to<a href="https://aftermath.site/tavern-keeper-review-impressions-pc-game/"> <em><u>Tavern Keeper</u></em></a>, I've spent much of 2025 playing games whose difficulty options were so comprehensive that I could tailor them <em>precisely </em>to my preferred style and level of ability.</p><p>That kind of accommodation is normally welcome. But also: sometimes you just need to get your ass kicked. To remind you of your place, to remind you that no matter how much of a cakewalk you can try to make things, your life is not easy, and that sometimes the only way to make yourself better, and to make you feel better about the resulting self-improvement, is to overcome challenges.</p><p>For many of you reading this, that might be why you play a <a href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hard-difficulty/"><em><u>Souls</u></em></a> game, or something like <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-problems-runback-criticism/"><em><u>Silksong</u></em></a>. For me, someone who can't stand either of those, it's why I spent last week playing <em>Assetto Corsa Rally</em>, a very serious car game instead.</p><p>Like the original <em>Assetto Corsa</em>, a track-racing game released over a decade ago, <em>Assetto Corsa Rally</em> is not fucking around. This is not <em>Art of Rally</em>, it's not <em>Sega Rally</em>, it's not <em>Colin McRae</em>, it's not even <em>Dirt</em>. This is a video game whose sole aim is to simulate the experience of driving a fast racing car on a loose dirt track as realistically as possible, and if that's brutally difficult to do in real life, then it's going to be brutally difficult to do here.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iKsSRLyb83o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Assetto Corsa Rally - Official Early Access Launch Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>To give you an idea how serious it is, I, a fairly avid racing game fan, booted the game up last week, picked a free practice session, selected a classic Lancia and tore off from the start line. I crashed into a tree on the first corner. And the second. Then I made it through a few corners before spinning off down a hill. Before I'd got even halfway through the course--in practice mode--half my car was missing and I was getting warnings saying I'd respawned too often.</p><p>OK, I figured, there's learning the ropes and there's getting your ass kicked, so maybe I'll just go into the options and turn on some driver assists, maybe disable some of the more punishing physics. Upon which I discovered, to my horror, that all the assists already <em>were</em> on. I was already in the baby training wheels mode, and I couldn't even play <em>that</em>.</p><p>Which for a second made me want to uninstall the game immediately in disgust, but after two more seconds made me smile like a sicko and decide to get to work. So I went back to the main menu, chose a more forgiving (read: modern) car, jumped back into practice mode and took things a bit more seriously. I stopped trying to drive at top speed the entire time, because learning the car's handling and the track layout was more important. I eased into corners instead of flying into them to gauge just how far I could sling this car at speed, and I started feathering the accelerator on straights instead of flooring it, because I (correctly) figured it was more important to make it through a stretch of road staying on the track than blasting 80% of the way down it before going sideways into a wall.</p><p>All of which sounds a bit boring, but you've gotta remember that a) this game looks fucking <em>incredible </em>on my <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-buy-prebuilt-pcs-now-and-have-finally-found-peace/"><u>new PC</u></a>, regardless of the speed or my success and b) because <em>Assetto Corsa Rally</em> is such a serious simulation, recreating the thrills and perils of driving a fast car so meticulously, that it's almost as fun to crash and burn as it is to clock a good time, because all the driving in this game is fun, whether it's being done well or not.</p><figure><figcaption><span>I wanted to check in with some experts--since I only dabble in racing games, I don't LIVE them--and...turns out the enthusiasts are very into this as well</span></figcaption></figure><p>I said above I'm not into <em>Souls </em>or <em>Silksong</em>, so why skip a challenge there and not here? I think it's because driving a car isn't some abstract concept to me. It's something I do every day, which I enjoy doing, and so unlike some unfamiliar idea or control scheme where what I'm doing to a controller (pressing a button) looks nothing like what I'm doing in the game (swinging a sword), in <em>ACR </em>I'm doing exactly what I already know how to do and do all the time. I just need to do it a bit faster, and on worse roads, and in fancier cars, and so the prospect of dragging my current skill level (driving to work without crashing) to the point where I'm winning races is one I'm <em>very </em>into.</p><p>So I appreciate the skill check, <em>Assetto Corsa Rally</em>. I've been getting soft playing all these cushy management games lately. It's time to let something kick my ass and get me into shape. </p>

              <p><span>Walt Disney Imagineering—the research and development arm of the Disney parks—will debut a new robot in its Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong parks. </span><i><span>Frozen</span></i><span> fans will certainly be excited to see Olaf the snowman stumbling around the World of Frozen area of Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland early next year, but those of us who have always found the icy sidekick unnerving will not be pleased.</span></p> <p><span>Disney’s dedicated an entire episode to Olaf and its history of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoPN02bmzrE"><span>robots on its Walt Disney Imagineering YouTube channel</span></a><span>. Olaf was created inside Disney Research’s Zurich, and is decidedly smaller than the </span><a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/entertainment/hollywood-studios/character-meet-olaf-frozen/"><span>Olaf’s human-sized character</span></a><span> that goes to Disney meet and greets. He appears to be just under hip height. It seems like he’ll be wandering Disney aimlessly, cursing parkgoers with his unhinged laugh.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Our latest Olaf is a fantastic example of representing an animated character as authentically as possible in the physical world—a challenging task because animated characters most often move in non-physical ways,” Kyle Laughlin, senior vice president of Walt Disney Imagineering Research &amp; Development, </span><a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/olaf-robotic-character/"><span>said in a news release</span></a><span>. “For example, to make Olaf’s snowball feet move along his body, we paired state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning with an artistic interface and advances in mechanical design.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Because Olaf is an animated character—and not inherently a robot, like Star Wars droids—Disney had to make “fundamental additions to our reinforcement learning framework to boost the believability of the character by enabling motion at the limit of hardware,” Laughlin said. So, for instance, Olaf’s body is softer, like snow, and you can pull off his nose.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Disney engineers in the video said they used reinforcement learning techniques to teach robots like Olaf and other droids how to act like their characters by ‘watching” artist-made animations. They’ve been through a bunch of iterations throughout the years, starting with a small, humanoid robot that’s shown in the YouTube channel being tripped by a stick. The BDX droids are featured heavily in the episode, too, showcasing how Disney made them more autonomous. They’ve got “eyes” and “ears” to compute what’s going on in the world using AI. So, for instance, if a person kneels down in front of a droid, it’ll move its head to look at the person directly. If they stand up, the droid looks up. It also shows the engineers “choreographing” a performance between three droids that gets recorded to be “played back” as a performance at the parks. And they do that by controlling the droids with what looks like Steam Decks. It’s described as “building blocks for the autonomous show.”</span></p> <p><span>Olaf is the next progression of Disney’s robots, but Disney isn’t clear how Olaf will work—whether it’ll need to be partly controlled by a human or not. The “self” in “self-walking robot” seems to imply that it’ll do a lot of the work itself, though.</span></p>

<p>If you want to earn an easy $2,500, you’d better step up and identify who it was that protested Valve’s ‘censorship’ of Gamdom’s branding at the StarLadder Budapest Major. Hours ago, footage surfaced online of protestors wielding ‘f*** Valve’ signs and demanding that the company reinstate Imperial’s new logo sticker, which featured Gamdom branding.</p>



<p>The group wore t-shirts that identified them as Gamdom representatives, but the casino’s founder came out on social media to suggest it was an act of sabotage by a competitor, and promised $2,500 for information leading to the identification of the wrongdoers.</p>



<h2 id="h-and-it-s-only-the-first-stage">And It’s Only The First Stage</h2>



<p>Images and videos surfaced online showing six protestors at the StarLadder Budapest Major, a $1.25 million Counter-Strike 2 tournament. These protestors wore shirts that spelled ‘Modmag’, which is Gamdom backwards, and they were there to ‘protest’ the recent change by Valve that removed a gambling reference from Imperial Esports’ sticker.</p>



<p>As if it wasn’t bad enough that the event had already been hit with audio issues and the incorrect lining up of highlight clips by the stream’s editors.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip from a channel on social media:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>😒 Another ""riot"" accident on CS Major grounds — this time the casino behind the Imperial team hired protestors with "FUCK VALVE" signs.  </p><p>Valve recently reverted the Imperial logo to the old one, as their current logo is a casino one.   </p><p>The video is blurred for ethical… <a href="https://t.co/pctUq85vwy">pic.twitter.com/pctUq85vwy</a></p></div>— CS2 NEWS (@CS2News_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/CS2News_EN/status/1992940298142363935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In a shocking response, the founder of Gamdom, <strong>Felix Römer</strong>, commented under the post declaring the protest an act of sabotage by a competing casino.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/GamdomHowly/status/1992952514124411390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is NOT Gamdom or Imperial “protesting” This is an effort to sabotage us more by a competitor Paying a $2.5k bounty per person that is identified here holding up the signs, we are going to take legal action, this bs doesn’t belong to the majors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, fans of the Counter-Strike scene were quick to pick apart <strong>Römer</strong>, suggesting that it’s <strong>his company </strong>that doesn’t belong in the competitive gaming scene.</p>



<p>Who do you think is in the wrong here, and is there a deeper conspiracy at play? Let everyone know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/24/exclusive-riftbound-spiritforged-card-reveal-jax-unrelenting</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-riftbound-spiritforged-card-reveal-jax-unrelenting.1363420/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Riftbound, the League of Legends physical trading card game, has had its Origins set go live worldwide. Now, Riot Games is looking towards its second set, Spiritforged; and <em>Game Informer</em> was offered the opportunity to reveal one of its upcoming Champion cards.</p><p>Surprisingly, our chosen card wound up being one familiar to both myself and fellow Video Editor Alex Van Aken. Jax is, in League of Legends, a potential menace in the top lane. As the last weaponmaster of Icathia, he wields a lamp as his chosen implement, leaping around the battlefield and smacking foes left and right. His Champion card Jax, Unrelenting reflects his particular proclivity for weaponry.</p><p>Jax, Unrelenting is Jax's Body (aka Orange) Champion Unit, standing at 3 Might for 4 and one Body Rune. The real eye-catching text is in the bonus text, however. Jax's Weaponmaster ability allows you to Equip an existing piece of Equipment on the field to Jax for one Rune less, even if it's already attached. This makes upcoming Equipment pieces like the Long Sword a free Equip-on-entry for Jax, The Unrelenting.</p><p>The second slice of text says that when you attach an Equipment to Jax, Unrelenting, you may pay 1 to draw 1. Card draw can be a very powerful advantage in card games. This version of Jax means you're drawing deeper into your deck, finding more options, and making use of those odd bits of floating, untapped Rune power.</p><p>Jax's associated Legend, <a href="https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--sfd-193-221">Grandmaster at Arms</a>, makes it easy to attach and detach Equipment as well. It seems like Jax is the Legend to go after if you want to lean into Spiritforged's introduction of Equipment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/what-my-video-game-family-is-bringing-to-thanksgiving-1845758556">Thanksgiving</a> is later this week in the United States. Loads of people are going to be traveling across the country to visit family members, some of whom they like, while eating food and cursing the fact that they have to do this all over again in like three weeks for Christmas. But who cares about all that? We are here to discuss the star of Thanksgiving: The food.</p> <p>What makes a perfect <a href="https://kotaku.com/public-school-thanksgiving-feast-the-kotaku-review-1820327714">Thanksgiving plate</a>? It’s a question that will likely get a lot of different answers, and all of them will be wrong unless they happen to match your perfect platter of tasty treats.</p> <p>For me, I have to have turkey at Thanksgiving. It’s the only time of the year when I’m willing to put the effort into prepping, cooking, and then carving up a giant turkey. And no, turkey isn’t dry or flavorless; you’ve just likely had some poorly cooked turkey. I’ve had turkey that was succulent and packed with flavor. The key is to brine, shield the white meat, and don’t overcook that thing or shove stuffing in it.</p>

 <p>Beyond a few big slices of turkey on my plate, I also have to have fluffy, garlic-y mashed potatoes, sweet corn, steamed but still crunchy broccoli (no cheese!), some stuffing that wasn’t cooked in a turkey, and a few Hawaiian sweet rolls. No gravy needed. Salad optional. It’s Thanksgiving. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bobs-burgers-thanksgiving-episodes-list-ranked-best-1851709655">I’m here to load up on carbs and collapse in front of a TV</a>.</p> <p>But that’s <em>my</em> perfect plate. What are you serving or hoping to be served on Thanksgiving? Let us know in the comments below! We’ll then be back later this week with a follow-up post sharing some of your answers.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Look, I have my fair share of problems with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a>, but to give credit where credit is due, after announcing their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">foray into publishing</a> earlier this year, they've lined up a suite of games. Dead Take, a psychological horror complete with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Neil Newbon and Final Fantasy 16's Ben Starr, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-take-is-an-fmv-horror-with-midsomer-murders-ben-starr-and-casualtys-neil-newbon">launched earlier this year</a>, Truckful just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-evil-ghost-lorry-in-truckfuls-demo-nearly-ate-me-and-the-lady-who-did-a-headstand-in-my-bed">looks like a delight</a>, and now there's Vision Quench, a game for freaks like me who like it when fantasy gets a bit techy.
</p>
<p>
How do I begin to explain Vision Quench? In genre terms, it describes itself as an "online co-op dark fantasy looter shooter," but I never think genres are a great selling point. The about section is a bit more tantalising. You find yourself in a place called the Green Tower, which you must climb to get the Sweepstakes Code. Along the way, you'll need to collect various cursed commodities to perform "the ritual," or alternatively consume them to gain certain abilities.
</p>
<p>
The whole setting is suitably fantastical, and modern at the same time. The setting is appropriately dungeon, but there are computers where "dark mining used for dark rituals" take place, toilets, soda pop cans, ventilation systems, vending machines, all of this amongst hand-monsters and evil rats and other mysteries.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetically, the game reminds me of renders from fantasy games you might find in magazines from the '90s, there's a colourful fuzz to it that's hard to pinpoint elsewhere. Your character can wear a bucket for a helmet while wearing a camo top, high-vis trousers, and what I think are Crocs, all while another friend has donned a knights' helm with a pistol in hand. It is fantasy by way of four friends mucking about in a digital realm they may or may not have hacked, and it is greatly appealing to me.
</p>
<p>
That is four friends to be precise, this is one of those kinds of games that I still don't know what to refer to as, but if I reference <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> or Peak you know what I mean.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there's no release date attached to Vision Quench just yet, but it should be releasing sometime in 2026. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3488690/Vision_Quench/">wishlist it on Steam</a> now.

            <title><![CDATA[Everything We Know About Playboi Carti Fortnite Skin]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playboi-carti-fortnite-skin/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-we-know-about-playboi-carti-fortnite-skin.1363390/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nothing is off the table for Fortnite anymore, so when it’s rumored that a Playboi Carti Fortnite skin could be added to the in-game store, it’s believable. Here’s the latest on the Playboi Carti Fortnite Skin leak, if it’s true, and more.</p>



<p><em>Another </em>small-fry name has been outed for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-chapter-6-finale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>: A small-time rapper with nearly 50 million followers on Spotify, number one albums, and a bunch of other successes. Obvious banter aside, Playboi Carti has established themself as one of the most prominent and mainstream rap artists on the planet.</p>



<p>What could be bigger than Playboi Carti? Why, a collaboration between Fortnite and Playboi Carti. Let’s see if it’s true.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-playboi-carti-coming-to-fortnite">Is Playboi Carti Coming To Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could be one for the album. Credit to AWGE &amp; Interscope</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Multiple leaks indicated that Playboi Carti was indeed on the way to Fortnite with at least one skin as part of a unique crossover, and then the rapper themself seemed to confirm the collab on Instagram.</strong></p>



<p>Usual leaker Shiina was one of many to suggest a Playboi Carti skin was coming at the very least. The official Playboi Carti Instagram posted a very interesting image to the rapper’s story to bolster the claim.</p>



<p>It’s a very simple and obvious clue: <strong>A giant Fortnite logo</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unless this is either a giant coincidence or evil trolling, it’s safe to assume that Playboi Carti is coming to the live-service shooter in one form or another.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-playboi-carti-content-will-be-included-in-fortnite">Which Playboi Carti Content Will Be Included In Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>The Playboi Carti content isn’t official, but leaks indicate that the game is receiving at least one Playboi Carti skin, and perhaps even a special in-game event to go with it.</strong></p>



<p>Happy Power thinks a skin is a guarantee, and says the content: “Will feature the ‘Evil Jordan’ outfit as well. </p>



<p>The attire in question relates to Playboi Carti’s song Evil Jordan, where the singer has a Batman/demon-esuqe head garment, with a red bandana and other eye-catching qualities.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Kurrco has gone one better and claimed an ‘In-game event’ is also planned.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Until anything is official, take any information with a pinch of salt. But it would be another in the never-ending conveyor belt of crossovers and special skins if it happens.</p>



<p>Where would a Playboi Carti bundle or special items rank on your wanted list? Is Epic and Fortnite’s pulling power officially unlimited?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Activision and Treyarch have <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-zombies-season-01#Multiplayer-Content">revealed the Season 1 roadmap</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which includes a slew of new content for players to dig into as the game gets going and tries to find its footing. It's "<em>the biggest Season 1 ever</em>," according to Activision, with multiple new weapons, several new maps for multiplayer and zombie game modes, and more.</p>



<p>While the focus is obviously on the new additions to the multiplayer and the zombies mode, there's also new content for its PvE Endgame mode, if you're still looking for something to do <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/">after completing the game's campaign</a>. There are four new Endgame events, eight new Exotic Skills to earn, and a new holiday-themed event coming down the pipeline.</p>



<p>Regarding the additions to multiplayer, three brand new maps are available right at the start of Season 1: Fate, Utopia, and Odysseus, and a fourth remastered version of Standoff to kick off the season. Mid-season, the new Yakei map joins the lineup along with the remastered Meltdown. Lastly, Fringe joins the map lineup before the end of the season.</p>



<p>Activision and Treyarch also released a new trailer showcasing what's coming in the season, which you can check out below.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>There are also new game modes getting added in this season, including favourites like Prop Hunt and Gun Game. One in the Chamber, Sharpshooter, and Sticks &amp; Stones are also joining in Season 1, with a holiday-themed limited-time Takeover mode getting introduced towards the end of the year. There's also seven new weapons joining the fray for players to grind.</p>



<p>Zombies players can look forward to a new Astra Malorum map and the continuation of the storyline, a new survival map called Exit 115, new traps, and a bevy of returning upgrades and loot from previous Zombies modes. </p>

<p>Black Ops 7 has been out for a little more than a week at the time of this writing, and while it was able to chart towards the top-end of reported sales charts so far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/">it's still majorly behind the year's other major shooter, Battlefield 6</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, it's too early to really count Call of Duty out, and we could still end 2025 with it being the best-selling game of the year if it's able to pick up the pace. We'll see where things land in January when we have the final full-year results for 2025. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-announced-at-the-riftbound-pax-unplugged-panel.1363363/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games hosted their Riftbound PAX Unplugged panel this past weekend. Taking full advantage of the venue of one of the largest tabletop conventions in the business, the studio laid out a roadmap for their bestselling <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Riftbound</em> PAX Unplugged Panel Announcements</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/announcements/recap-of-our-pax-unplugged-panel/" rel="nofollow">recap post</a> on Riot Games' website, the studio recounts everything announced at the Riftbound PAX Unplugged panel.&nbsp; The post opens by reiterating new Champions and mechanics coming in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riot-games-releases-riftbound-spiritforged-preview-confirming-new-mechanics-for" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Riftbound: Spiritforged</em></a> set. This includes familiar faces like Draven, Rumble, and Fiora and new mechanics like Gold and Repeat.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-pax-unplugged-collectability-panel-image.jpg?itok=EXs61id5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-pax-unplugged-collectability-panel-image.jpg?itok=XaPlm4xC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The panel does showcase a few other surprises. This includes new mechanics like Quick-Draw, which lets you play equipment as a reaction and attach it to a unit you control, and Weaponmaster, which lets you equip iconic characters with their signature weapons at a discount.</p>

<p>For collectors out there, the <em>Riftbound</em> PAX Unplugged panel confirms the Spiritforged set will include 30 Overnumbered cards with 12 signature variants. In addition, local game store events will include special Nexus Night promo cards. This was in response to the game's initial release running out of Nexus Night cards too quickly. Hopefully, it doesn't happen again for this new set.</p>

<p>The panel briefly switched to discussing the competitive scene of <em>Riftbound</em>.

<p>After months of rumor and speculation, Valve revealed its new Steam Machine console in November 2025, to the surprise of many. The announcement wasn’t advertised and, aside from some insiders, wasn’t expected. But then it happened, a new Steam Machine revealed nearly 10 years to the day of the release of Valve’s first attempt at the living room console space.</p>



<p>Valve’s newest piece of hardware—aside from the Steam Controller and Steam Frame VR Headset—is aiming to bring PC gaming to the living</p>



<p>Ahead of its release in 2026, there’s plenty to learn about the Steam Machine. That’s why Insider Gaming has put together a one-stop shop of information with everything you need to know about the Steam Machine. This page will be updated regularly as any news breaks, so bookmark it and check back often for the latest.</p>







<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-everything-we-know-about-the-steam-machine">Everything We Know About The Steam Machine</h2>



<p>The Steam Machine was <strong>announced on November 12, 2025</strong>, as part of a major announcement of the latest Valve hardware. In addition to the affectionately named “Gabecube”, Valve revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-announces-the-steam-frame-vr-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Frame VR Headset</a> and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-controller-2-announced-by-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second Steam Controller</a>. </p>



<h3>Steam Machine Release Date</h3>



<p>When the console was announced in November, Valve said that the Steam Machine would release in early 2026. As of writing, Valve still hasn’t confirmed an official release date. If you want to narrow down a window, it’s expected to launch by April 2026.</p>



<p>More details on a release date are expected to come after the start of the new year. That’s also when you’ll be able to find out where you can buy a Steam Machine for yourself. </p>



<h3>How Much Will The Steam Machine Cost?</h3>



<p>Like the release date, Valve has yet to reveal the price of the Steam Machine. What’s happened since the announcement, though, has been plenty of speculation. </p>



<p>Many fans believed that it would be priced like a traditional video game console. However, Valve has confirmed that it will, instead, be priced as PC because, as you’ll see later on, it is a fully functional computer. </p>



<p>When it releases, there will be two Steam Machine models to choose from: 512GB and 2TB. There will also be an option to buy a bundle that includes the Steam Controller. </p>



<p>That means a variety of prices will be available. There will be one price for the 512GB version of the Steam Machine and a different, more expensive price, for the 2TB. There will also be separate prices for the bundles with the new Steam Controller.</p>







<h3>What Are The Steam Machine Specs?</h3>



<p>When the Steam Machine was announced, the first thing everyone wanted to know was how powerful will it be. Based on the confirmed specs, it is being targeted to compare to most entry level gaming PCs.</p>



<p>Valve says that the system can support 4K 60FPS gaming when using AMD FSR. If you are just looking for 1080P gaming, you should have no problem reaching those numbers on higher settings.</p>



<p>The Steam Machine will feature an Arch-based SteamOS 3 but can support other operating systems if desired. It includes 16GB DDR5 RAM, an internal power supply, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. Where some might be disappointed is the fact that it’s video outputs are DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0. The older technology could limit quality in the coming years as opposed to just including HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.0 or 2.1.</p>



<p>You can check out full details on what’s inside the Steam Machine below.</p>

<h3>Steam Machine General Features</h3>



<p>The Steam Machine is a uniquely designed system that looks like nothing Valve has ever released. As mentioned, it’s a PC in a box that’s designed to make it easier to quickly play your PC games on your TV.</p>



<p>Size wise, it’s just under 6″ tall, about 6.3″ deep, and just over 6″ wide. Its small size should allow it to fit discretely in more entertainment centers. There is a large fan on the back aimed at keeping the internal power supply and other components cool at all times, and that’s kind of what the box is designed around.</p>



<p>On the back there are two USB-A 2.0 ports and a USB-C 3.2 Gen 3 port to go along with video outputs, ethernet, and power connector. The front of the box includes two USB-A 3.2 ports, a microSD slot, power button, and indicator LED. There are also two features on the front to give the Steam Machine a unique look.</p>



<p>First, the system allows swappable faceplates similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-selling-xbox-360-games-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox 360</a>. The plate is magnetic for easy removal, and there’s sure to be a number of third-party designs available when the system releases. For those who want to make their own, Valve is planning on making 3D files available as well. </p>



<p>Under the faceplate is a customizable LED strip that will let you change colors and animations for things like download progress, console updates, errors, and more. </p>
