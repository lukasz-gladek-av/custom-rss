		<p>The UK branch of Just Cause developer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avalanche-studios/">Avalanche Studios</a> is to close just a few weeks after the news that<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/07/avalanche-studios-contraband-is-no-longer-in-development-for-microsoft/">&nbsp;Contraband,</a> a game they were creating as an Xbox exclusive for Microsoft, is no longer in active development.</p>
<p>“In light of current challenges to our business and the industry, we have thoroughly reviewed how to best ensure Avalanche Studios Group’s long-term success,” reads a statement posted on the <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche Studios website.</a></p>


<p>“This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio, and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmö and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games’ needs.”</p>
<p>“Our immediate focus is to offer full support to all Avalanchers during this challenging time. Despite these changes, we remain deeply committed to providing amazing games to our passionate player communities.”</p>
<p>Avalanche Liverpool was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/03/avalanche-studios-liverpool-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up in 2020 </a>and had around 50 staff. Liverpool is the latest Avalanche studio to close, their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/04/avalanche-lay-off-fifty-staff-close-two-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York and Montreal studios were shut down in June 2024</a> with the loss of another fifty staff.</p>

<p>Avalanche has not had much luck with Microsoft, having previously worked on dinosaur shooter Second Extinction. That was revealed in 2020 and did make it into early access on both PC and Xbox, but was eventually cancelled in 2023. Avalanche’s website lists Contraband as the sole upcoming title, it’s not been officially cancelled but the listing does still link back to a Microsoft page that no longer exists.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Avalanche have another unannounced big project waiting in the wings.&nbsp; It had six projects in development in 2018 but those have either been released, such as Just Cause 4, or cancelled.</p>

From endlessly levelling jobs and sub-classing skills in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fantasy_v">Final Fantasy V</a> to building the perfect teams and pairings in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>, classes bring a level of customisation and character that feels pretty unique to the genre.</p>
<p>But while most games allow for a God-like amount of tinkering and levelling, there’s something to be said for the more restrictive class systems. Those that set your characters in a base class and allow them to change according to a class tree, branching down different paths that change the style and impact of that character.</p><div><figure data-videoid="23DYpTkUosk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f63eqgyrvp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>It’s for this reason that I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/seiken_densetsu_3">Seiken Densetsu 3</a>’s class system. It’s deceptively simple, relying more on team composition, adaptability, and filling in gaps rather than chopping and changing as you go. Once you choose a character’s Light or Dark job path, that’s it; you have to commit. And, even 30 years after it debuted, it's still absolutely delightful.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b7c7b8a2f6270"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b7c7b8a2f6270/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a big shift from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/final_fantasy_adventure">Final Fantasy Adventure</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/secret_of_mana">Secret of Mana</a>, two relatively simple action RPGs that borrowed from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>, which then evolved into a party-based multiplayer RPG. Secret of Mana will always be one of the most influential games in my life, but its sequel – now known as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trials_of_mana">Trials of Mana</a> – is <em>so</em> much better because of just how replayable it is. The first time I beat it, I immediately started playing it again, because I really wanted to build a perfect, all-destroying team.</p>
<p>And, honestly, you can’t go wrong with most combinations. A lot of the magic comes from being able to choose your whole party at the start of the game – who you choose as your lead character will determine certain story scenes and end-game dungeons, but other than that, it’s completely down to you.</p>
<p>So I went totally on vibes: Riesz was a must and my first lead, armed with a spear for decent damage; next was Kevin, a monk-like character and the best beast boy; rounding out the trio was Hawkeye, a roguish thief with charm for days. On paper, maybe not the most balanced group, as there’s no dedicated spell caster or healer (initially), but by the end it’s an absolutely monstrous trio with huge amounts of damage.</p>

<p>What makes Trials of Mana’s class system work so well is that it gives you an adequate amount of time with every stage. For the first 18 levels, you’ll spend a lot of time getting used to each character’s base moveset, which for me was mostly attack, attack, <em>attack</em>. None of my characters had any spells, buffs, or debuffs, so I just had to rely on perfectly-charged special attacks or careful use of healing items.</p>
<p>It’s a lesson in learning the strengths and weaknesses of each character early on, without the bells and whistles their class upgrades bring. Or, in my case, I guess I learned that all three characters could hit hard – especially Kevin. I’m comfortable with Secret of Mana’s systems (even the awful spell-queueing system which I exploited to level up magic), so it was an adjustment period to get used to the improved timing.</p>
<p>Level 18 is where the fun <em>really</em> starts, so examining a mana stone, I could finally pick whether I would send my characters down a Light or a Dark class path. Whichever one I picked, it would lock me out of <em>half</em> of that character’s classes. Plus, both sides for each character bring about different changes to their classes, narrowing down on niches that make all six playable characters unique.</p>

<p>Riesz, when she starts travelling down her job path, <em>isn’t</em> just a damage dealer. Her Light side gives her access to party buffs, while her Dark path focuses on debuffs. Class up again at 38, and her stat-buffs/debuffs either get stronger <em>or</em> are able to target multiple allies or enemies.</p>
<p>Choosing to go down the Light path with Valkyrie, the cogs are turning in my head. With Riesz as the buffer, the damage needs to come from the boys. I stuck with the Light path for Kevin, giving him a heal and a strength buff that worked during the day. Naturally, then, Kevin had to go Dark, but not <em>full</em> dark, allowing him to multicast ninjutsu spells.</p>
<p>That trio filled all of the gaps I had. Starlancer (Riesz’s Light-Dark Class) allows her to buff the entire team but also gives her a highly damaging summon, for a much-needed clinch moment during encounters, in that it wipes every single enemy off the screen. Kevin became <em>the</em> damage-dealer, tanky and able to keep the pressure on up close. Hawkeye, meanwhile, used spells to exploit elemental weaknesses (useful for those eight Benevodon bosses) while also adding to the damage Kevin dealt.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4f83d8f10e9f4"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4f83d8f10e9f4/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It was a surefire combo that turned out to be extremely fun to play with; what could’ve ended up as a disaster completely worked in my favour, giving me the variety I needed to win. I honestly just picked those three characters because they had the best designs. So, what if I went with a completely different theme?</p>
<p>My second playthrough started mere days after my first, and I went all-girls: Charlotte, Angela, and Riesz. No main physical attackers, simply a straight trio of supporters and magicians. I loved my first playthrough, but this Mana Girls party and their mix of classes cemented the game as one of my all-time favourite SNES RPGs.</p>
<p>The conundrum here was, how the heck am I going to deal a lot of damage? I had magic and healing covered, and I knew I’d be able to buff with Riesz, who I went Light Light with for Vanadis for single-target buffs and her extremely powerful single-target tech instead. But by this point, I’d become obsessed with researching classes online, from looking at the beautiful character designs and artwork and deciding which ones looked best to completing the perfect party and making the pieces fit together.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5689559125421"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5689559125421/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Charlotte didn’t need a damage buff for the most part, since I already knew Angela would be where the big numbers would come from. Instead, Charlotte would go from the adorable little kid to a Necromancer with the ability to debuff an enemy (read: a boss). Then Angela’s pure-Light class, Grand Diviner, was all damage all day, with Double Spell and whatever the most effective element for that particular fight.</p>
<p>I beat the final boss in under a minute. Trials of Mana isn’t exactly a hard game, but don’t take that moment away from me; I knew how to craft the perfect party and exploit all of their strengths and sharpen them. No real physical damage except for a charged attack that takes a while to build up? No worries, let me spam spells and buffs over and over again.</p>
<figure data-uuid="bf91599b224b1"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bf91599b224b1/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>These are the best kind of conundrums to solve in any job/class-based RPG – what works with what? What doesn’t? When <em>should</em> you use this skill, this class? It doesn’t matter how simple or complex it is; you simply need to think or experiment. In Trials of Mana’s case, well, you have to stick with it – your decisions are final, and in a way, that’s also part of the fun.</p>
<p>There’s no way to change easily like in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_tactics_the_ivalice_chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>. You have to live with your choices and plough your way through regardless. Did you forget to employ elemental weaknesses between Duran, Hawkeye, and Riesz? Well, just keep the pressure on. No healing? Better build up money and stock up on healing items. If you happen to put together a crappy team, the challenge and the joy come from how to make it work.</p>
<figure data-uuid="503d5453a6104"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/503d5453a6104/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s not a complicated game, and it never needed to be. There are optimal and less optimal compositions, sure, but is the ability to create a weird mix of jobs and classes not a huge part of the attraction? Why do you think <a href="https://www.fourjobfiesta.com/">Final Fantasy V’s Four Job Fiesta</a> has prevailed for so long? Sure, that game is amazing <em>because</em> of how good and flexible its class system is, but restrictions and challenges make it even better.</p>
<p>So, while Trials of Mana might not be as deep as other class-based RPGs, for its time, it’s exceptionally moreish and beautifully simple, allowing you to dip your toes into party composition and planning. It’s like a real D&amp;D game – a Bard, a Warlock, and a Thief might not sound like the <em>ideal</em> party, but it’s probably a real good time. Just like running a bunch of mages.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Battlefield Studios (DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive) announced that Battlefield 6 Season 1 will begin on October 28 and feature free new content for all players.</p>



<p>The first season kicks off with Rogue Ops, which includes a new map called Blackwell Fields, a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint, and new weapons. The second phase, California Resistance, begins on November 18 and includes a map located in Southern California called Eastwood, as well as a Sabotage mode designed for 8v8 combat. The final phase of Season 1, Winter Offensive, begins on December 9 and includes a seasonal map update to Empire State and a themed event.</p>



<p>Blackwell Fields' map includes support for all combat sizes, land, and air vehicles. The backstory is that, right after the end of the single player campaign of Battlefield 6, double agents from the antagonist faction Pax Armata launch a series of attacks on NATO targets, starting at a recently recommissioned American air base in the California badlands. The new Strikepoint mode is an intense, small-team tactical mode in which a squad fights another squad over multiple rounds to capture a key objective. Each round, players have only one life.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Phase one's additions also include:</p>



<ul>
<li>APC Traverser Mark 2 - A land vehicle that suits four players: one driver, one roof gunner, and two side gunners. </li>



<li>SOR-300C - A low rate of fire carbine rifle chambered in the higher damage .300 Blackout ammunition compared to the platform’s 5.56 version.</li>



<li>Mini Fix - A lightweight, bolt-action sniper rifle</li>



<li>GGH-22 - A high-capacity and fire rate sidearm</li>



<li>Rail Cover &amp; LPVO - Attachments for rifles and LMGs</li>
</ul>



<p>The Eastwood map will support all Battlefield 6 combat sizes, land vehicles, and helicopters. The setting is described as a sleepy, affluent suburb connected to a golf course. In Sabotage mode, players must destroy as many sites as possible before time runs out. Each team has one offensive and one defensive round; ultimately, the team that successfully detonates the most sites wins the match.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Phase 2 will introduce the Battle Pickups feature to the game. These are high-tech, powerful weapons that are limited in ammo and availability throughout a given map. Players will have to scour the maps to find where they're located if they want to exploit the advantage they bring. Other additions include:</p>



<ul>
<li>DB-12 - A dual-barrel pump-action shotgun</li>



<li>M327 Trait - High-damage (but low rate of fire) sidearm with eight rounds. This revolver is powerful in close quarters but has a significant damage drop-off compared to its .44 Magnum comrade.</li>



<li>Troy Angled - This grip attachment offers an alternative for underbarrel choices</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, in the final phase of Battlefield 6 Season 1, Winter Offensive, players will see a seasonal visual update to the Empire State map, where temperatures are now freezing. To go with that theme, there's also a limited-time Ice Lock event centered around a mechanic called Freeze (though this will only be active in specific experiences). Finally, a new melee tool, the Ice Climbing Axe, will be introduced to the shooter game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you plan to play Battlefield 6 on PC, you can now <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-battlefield-6-geforce-game-ready-driver/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get the NVIDIA GeForce Game Ready driver optimized for the game</a>.</p>

			<p>Fallout: London is an incredibly expansive mod for Fallout 4 that takes Bethesda's post-nuclear apocalypse across the pond to the United Kingdom, completely overhauling the game for what's essentially an entirely new Fallout 4 experience.

<p>Even beyond the content and bug fixes, today's news update adds another quality-of-life update that players might appreciate even more: a <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/teamfolonlimited-folon_launcher">new custom launcher for Fallout: London powered by Overwolf</a>, which Team FOLON describes as "<em>a one-click solution to install and update the mod seamlessly.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Furi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Haven&nbsp;</em>studio The Game Bakers has announced that it'll be delaying its upcoming survival-climbing sim&nbsp;<em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>to the first quarter of next year, although the demo is getting an update by way of some good news.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1588550/view/525355229451912425" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news update</a> on Steam, The Game Bakers reveals that&nbsp;<em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>will now be arriving in Q1 2026 so that the studio can "spend a bit more time on debug and optimization" and to "ensure that [the game] launches at its best".</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>is "truly special", according to The Game Bakers, the studio can "see the improvements [it] can still make to give you the best game [it] can", and the developer doesn't want to "rush" to the finish after five years of work.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cairn-delayed-q1-2026-mountain.jpg?itok=NhlweMrl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cairn-delayed-q1-2026-mountain.jpg?itok=Q4Kz-OMj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>will now be released in the first quarter of 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not all bad news, though.&nbsp;<em>Cairn</em>'s demo, which is currently available on both PC and PS5, will be getting an update on October 13th, and if you like to see how other players are faring on the game's unforgiving mountain, this one's for you.</p>

<p>The update will allow you to see other players' ghosts, including "speedrunners, community members, and the dev team", according to The Game Bakers. This way, you can look out for techniques other players are using to give them the edge, or just bask in the sense of distant camaraderie.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>is, it's the next game from The Game Bakers, the French studio responsible for boss rush bullet hell game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/furi" rel="nofollow">Furi</a>&nbsp;</em>and co-op RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/haven" rel="nofollow"><em>Haven</em></a>.</p>

<p>Your goal is to climb the imposing Mount Kami, managing resources like pitons, food, and other necessities as you ascend. You'll need to plan your route carefully if you want to make it to the summit.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/cairn/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> early next year.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/summer-eternal">Summer Eternal</a>, one of the infinite number of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> spiritual successor studios that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">cropped up last year</a>, have been mostly quiet on whatever it is they've been cooking up since forming. They announced their existence with an evocative political manifesto, and today they revealed what's next. No, it's not a video game, but something a lot more physical, tangible, and interestingly old fashioned: a book.
</p>
<p>
Quite simply titled <a href="https://summereternal.com/anthology">Summer Eternal Anthology</a>, it's actually volume one of that planned anthology, which does run on the assumption that they manage to release another one. A press release from Summer Eternal describes it as "part cultural journal, part expedition log, part development diary," and, most unusually of all, "part physical game announcement."
</p>

With the internet being the de facto place you announce a videogame these days, Summer Eternal are certainly doing something different here, more akin to magazine exclusives from days of yore. It's a bold move, and one they're hoping will support them financially, for this book is both an announcement teaser and a source of income in itself. There'll apparently be info on gameplay systems, the game's world, and how it all looks. Oh, and the game has a codename too, "Red Rooster."
</p><p>
Aside from that, you'll also find a few non-fiction essays, interviews, political thinkpieces related to the games industry, and a recap of what Summer Eternal have gone through to establish a worker-owned co-op. You'll have to wait a while for it though, as it's planned for spring 2026 earliest, summer 2026 latest.
</p>
<p>
In case you need a bit of a refresher on Summer Eternal as a studio compared to the other teams that boast of having former Disco devs on the books, this is the one co-founded by Argo Tuulik and Dora Klindžić, both former writers at ZA/UM. You may remember that Tuulik and Klindžić have had some legal back-and-forth with Riaz Moola, founder and owner of Longdue, a different supposed Disco successor.
</p>
<p>
Moola alleges that the pair violated a non-compete clause after they were previously employed by him, whereas Tuulik and Klindžić claim that this particular clause covered a separate industry. People Make Games <a href="https://youtu.be/lZEAs6M1wts?si=enfye4e3OBsazepP">explored some of this particular legal battle</a> in a follow-up to their <a href="https://youtu.be/JGIGA8taN-M?si=HafzykdWTFtfRgmb">original Disco Elysium/ ZA/UM documentary from 2023</a>, if you want a bit more depth.

Is a slot machine still a slot machine when you surround it with gunky visual metaphors for indentured servitude? Is a slot machine still a slot machine when you balance all the medulla-massaging twinkles and jingles against some gloating indications that the apparatus means you harm - drawerfuls of pink, polygonal flesh; shivery text that seems to crawl away from your eyes; a first-person camera that appears to be constantly hyperventilating; a trapdoor right beneath your feet? 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Is a slot machine still a slot machine when you add <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">the Steam page disclaimer</a> that "CloverPit is a rogue-lite horror game, and not a slot machine simulator. Our slot machine is designed to be broken and ultimately overcome, and will never ask you for real money!" Is a slot machine still a slot machine when it's a "sinister tale of addiction and escape" that also dangles the more-ish prospect of replay with different seeds or modifiers? Is a slot machine nothing more than a slot machine when it challenges you to "push your score to new heights in Endless Mode"?
</p>
<p>
Based on 20 minutes with CloverPit, I think the answer to all these questions is "no". I don't think CloverPit is a slot machine, even though it aims to be Endless, and I don't want to get it bluntly recategorised as an 18-rated experience or even removed from stores, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-junking-balatros-18-rating-pegi-will-develop-a-more-granular-rating-system-for-gambling-themes">as was the case with Balatro last year</a>. Still, I'm starting to find these ironic/satirical gambling simulators a bit, well, <em>too</em> cynical, in that I think we are perhaps trying to have our cynicism and eat it, just a smidge.
</p>
<p>
CloverPit released late last week, and there's still a demo on Steam. The basics of the game are that you're both gambling to pay off an ever-increasing debt, and slowly levelling up and optimising a slot machine by spending tokens - increasing the odds of certain symbols appearing, or how much they score, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>Fail to keep up with your debts, and whoops, there goes the trapdoor. The play environment has some fun widgets: you can remind yourself of the modifiers in play by conversing with a horrible toy phone on wheels. I'm quite interested in how they've found the balance between enticing and unpleasant in the design of those chunkily retro, blood-spattered visual props.
</p><p>
There are a lot of roguelikes with nudge-wink casino themes, from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/luck-be-a-landlord">Luck be a Landlord</a> through the wonderful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeons-and-degenerate-gamblers">Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</a> and various gamble-nots on Itch.io that haven't quite broken through the crust. At a glance, many have the same rough punchline: living under capitalism is a gaudy grind for a fleeting pittance beset by chronic indignity and unfairness, so why not laugh at your own helplessness. Why not revel in it?</p>
<p>Perhaps you can defeat the system from inside, but even if you can't, there's some catharsis to derive from seeing the system for what it is. Also, yanking the wrist of a one-arm bandit is Fun - even "addictive", in the words of one of CloverPit's professional reviews, but you know, addictive with a knowing smirk. Addictive in an above-it-all way.
</p>
<p>
I guess what I myself am nudging and winking towards is a proper longform accounting of comically gambling-adjacent roguelikes that queries them for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dire-comedy-bloodsport-king-of-meat-should-have-been-called-king-of-meme">signs of more obvious hypocrisy</a>, and perhaps chucks in some analysis of the inherently gamblery nature of the roguelite at large - a genre predicated upon but not reducible to randomisation and repetition. You'd have to weave in some thoughts about habit-forming elements in non-roguelite games - lootboxes, level-up noises, that kind of stuff. You'd have to talk about learned helplessness and defeatism as they are potentially manifest in entertainment works.</p>
<p>Ugh, now that I've smooshed together an outline, I don't want to write this, not least because I think I had much the same ideas five years ago, and either didn't follow through or wrote them up and forgot. I am spinning my wheels. Anyway, you might want to try CloverPit's demo, or watch a streamer try their luck. It's been doing well on the Steamvine - partly, I suspect, because it's solid reaction-video fare. Horror games tend to be a good fit for streamers. Still, I think I'm going to go back to playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, for the minute.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/12-tips-to-know-before-playing-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles.1312633/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve played <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> twice in the past couple of months. The first runthrough was of the original on PlayStation. The second <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040">was the excellent <em>Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster,</a> out today. Despite having grinded through the classic strategy RPG back in the day, I still learned a thing or two from revisiting it again all these years later. Here’s a bunch of friendly reminders, PSAs, and helpful tips, whether you’re playing <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> for the first time or coming back to it after decades away.</p> <h2>Keep every character a Squire until they learn JP Up</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630276" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630276"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630276">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Rule number one of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is “ABJPU”: always be JP-ing up. JP stands for Job Points and these are what you use to unlock skills across the game’s sprawling job system. As you rank up each job, you’ll collect more points per action you take, but the JP Up skill will double that, letting you progress your characters twice as fast. The skill is on the third page of the Squire skill list under the passive section. Hold off on swapping your fresh recruits to chemists, knights, or other starting classes until you have this one unlocked.</p>

 <h2>Unlock Focus if you really want to streamline grinding</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630277" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630277"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630277">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Characters earn XP and Job Points for successful actions. This means doing damage, healing, or buffing/debuffing something. The fastest way to level up characters is to stock up on potions, leave one enemy in a battle alive, and have everyone keep taking turns while staying healed. Accumulate is a Squire skill that raises your attack. It never misses. And you use it on yourself so you don’t have to move or worry about being in range.</p>

 <p>The quickest way to grind in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is to have everyone learn the skill (it costs 300 points) and stand around using it at the end of a random encounter. Because you can use it as a character’s second skill, it’s helpful no matter what job they are trying to level up, making it a sound strategy over the course of the entire game.</p>

 <h2>Always have a least one character with the Item skill equipped</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630275" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630275"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630275">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>The ability to use Phoenix Down items is one of the most useful skills in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. That’s because when characters die, they only have three turns before they turn into crystals. Once that happens, they’re dead for the whole game unless you reset. If Ramza dies this way, the game is over. Even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and there’s nothing worse than having a character die early on in a fight and realizing you have no way to bring them back. Make sure at least one character has the Item skill equipped and Phoenix Down unlocked (it’s only 90 JP points) no matter what job they are. I usually have at least two or three.</p>

 <h2>Job Point spillover is your friend</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630278" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630278"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630278">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is full of math that never gets overtly explained. One of the most important calculations is called JP spillover. Every time a character earns Job Points, the rest of your characters in battle get 20 percent of those points to that same job. Even if they don’t have the job unlocked yet, the points will still accrue in the background, showing up once it’s available.</p>

 <p>This has two important uses. The first is you can have people double-up on jobs and unlock specific skills much faster. The other is that you can earn a small amount of points that let characters unlock one or two lower-level skills without them ever having actually spent time ranking up in that job. If you have a Chemist in your party earn 2,000 points, that will be enough for everyone else to learn Auto-Potion, one of the most useful counterattack skills in the game.</p>

 <h2>Drag battles out when you can so human enemies turn into crystals</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630283">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>When humans fall in battle, they can turn into treasure chests or crystals. The treasure chests aren’t that useful, but the crystals contain all of the Job skills those soldiers had when they died. This is a really efficient way to unlock skills without spending any points, especially for lower-level stuff on jobs that character isn’t currently using. For example, your Chemist, Knight, or Archer might grab a crystal from a White Mage and learn a bunch of useful secondary skills like Cure, Raise, and Protect without ever grinding as a White Mage. There’s just one caveat: they need to have the job unlocked to be able to earn the skills from it this way.</p> <h2>Stats grow differently depending on the job you have when you level up</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630287"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630287">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Here’s some more arcane math the game doesn’t tell you about. Jobs have different base stats, so if you go from being a Knight to a Thief, even if you don’t change anything else, that character will have less health but be faster. Well, these stats also change in the background as you level up (with XP) in particular jobs. Players have spent decades trying to get the rough math right <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/197339-final-fantasy-tactics/57636648">in charts like these</a>, but there are some key things even casual players should be aware of.</p> <ul> <li>Monks, Knights, and Lancers have the highest health growth multiplier.</li> <li>Monks and Ninjas have the highest attack growth multiplier.</li> <li>Ninjas, Thieves, and Monks have the highest Speed Multiplier.</li> <li>Wizards and Time Mages have the highest magic attack growth multiplier.</li> <li>Priests, Wizards, Time Mages, and Summoners have the highest magic point growth multiplier.</li> </ul> <p>Mimes, the hardest job to unlock in the game, have the highest all around stat growth potential, while Bards have the worst for male characters and Chemists have the worst for Female characters.</p>

 <h2>Ramza kicks ass as a Monk</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630288"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630288">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Thematically, it feels like the main character should be wearing armor and tanking hits out in front. It’s also bad if he dies, so survivability also seems like a priority. But Monks, even though they wear light armor and less of it, can be exceptionally strong, and Ramza, because of his underlying stats, is one of the strongest. In addition to hitting for lots of damage and maintaining good speed, he’ll also unlock all of the Martial Arts skills which include ranged attacks, health and MP healing, status ailment removal, and a revive. Best of all, these skills cost no MP and happen instantly.</p> <h2>Pay attention to Bravery and Faith</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630289" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630289"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630289">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>More numbers! Each character in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> has a Zodiac sign and two numbers near their name. The first is Bravery and it measures their ability to deal and take physical damage. The second is Faith and it’s involved in calculating the effectiveness of magic spells, both used and received. A high Faith character, for example, will have a higher likelihood of spells working and dealing more damage, but will also be more susceptible to them in return. Take note of these stats in the Recruiter’s office when you’re looking for new party members and when you’re deciding on their job trajectories.</p>

 <p>If someone’s pursuing magic, they’ll do best with a Faith stat over 60 (I like to aim for 70). Same for Bravery when it comes to physical fighters. Bravery also effects the likelihood of counterattacks activating. This is extra important for things like Auto-Potion. A low Bravery character won’t react to being hit with their counterattack skills as much.</p> <h2>You can out-level for story battles but not random encounters</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630280"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630280">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’re stuck on a story battle like, say, the Dorter Slums or Lionel Castle Gate, you can keep grinding until your characters get powerful enough to overwhelm the enemy with sheer force. Random encounters, however, will always raise enemy levels to around where Ramza’s is, which is worth knowing before you try to go into a fight and grind with characters who are all learning new jobs they haven’t unlocked skills for yet.</p> <h2>Don’t rush into fights!</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630281"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630281">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>This is a lesson <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> tries to teach you itself in Ramza’s very first battle out of the academy when Delita warns him about taking things slow. Any time I have ever lost a battle, it is because I got way too aggressive way too early. This will leave your fastest, farthest-moving characters isolated and easy targets to be picked off while also spreading you out across the field too much.</p>

 <p>If you’re facing mostly Archers and Knights, turtle up and take advantage of healing and support spells that hit multiple allies at once. If you’re facing enemy spell casters, separate your party just enough to not have multiple people targeted at once while still being close enough together to burst down one enemy at a time.</p> <h2>Always buy the best armor you can afford</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630282"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630282">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Every couple of battles, new gear will become available at the Outfitter’s office. Armor doesn’t increase defense in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. Instead, it raises health and magic point totals. Lighter armor will be a more balanced mix, while heavy armor prioritizes HP. It’s okay to switch things up to suit your character’s skills. A Knight that also casts White Magic will want to wear mage robes instead of a full suit of armor to get more magic points.</p> <p>In the old days, traveling back to town could mean getting stuck in a random encounter, but the remaster gives you the option to flee any battle on the map, so there’s no downside to constantly tracking back for supplies and better armor. Unless you’re playing on easy,<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em> will require you to grind for cash and levels every so many story battles. Staying on top of the latest gear available will help even the odds.</p> <h2>Don’t under estimate the power of Move +1</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630292"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630292">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>One is the loneliest number. In a game full of big numbers, it can look especially unimpressive. But the maps in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> aren’t very big, and being able to move one extra square in any direction can pay off in big ways. Combine an early pair of Battle Boots with the Squire’s +1 movement ability and all of a sudden you have a 50-percent move bonus. Especially for characters who aren’t ranged, this can be the difference between contributing something meaningful to the fight during their turn and just constantly getting outmaneuvered until they die.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’m surprised it took </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>nearly a decade to have a proper skin creation contest, but Chinese artists are currently </span><a href="https://ow.blizzard.cn/trsj2025/#/"><span>competing for the chance to have a costume concept appear</span></a><span> in the hero shooter. Pushing aside with all our might the fact that it sucks that this is a China-exclusive deal when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-comic-zenyatta-ramattra-2000628236"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span> is played all around the world, it’s an exciting prospect, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-juno-venture-sprays-ai-generated-2000626941"><span>thankfully, the competition has a hard ban on AI art</span></a><span>. The team at Blizzard will get the final say in what ends up in the game, but fan voting has a chance to tip the scales. The theme of the contest is “What if the Omnic Crisis never happened?” which, for those who aren’t versed in the lore, means that all of these soldiers and agents would have likely gone on to live normal lives without payload pushing and point capturing. Some of these skins are pretty great, others are going viral on social media for…other reasons. Let’s look at some of the standouts.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000630267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630267"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630267">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The designs currently leading in fan voting are a set of three skins, one each for Cassidy, Kiriko, and Ramattra. Kiriko is dressed as a donut store employee, and even her fox spirit, which she casts out when she uses her ultimate, is carrying a pastry in its mouth. Cassidy hasn’t fallen too far from his roots, as he’s still depicted as a criminal, but as a fugitive on the run and dressed in prison orange. Ramattra is probably my favorite of the three, however; as the radical Omnic no longer has a war to wage, he has become a housekeeper. Making his staff a broom is a fun touch.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630266" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630266"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630266">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The current second-place skin is one for the water-wielding hero Wuyang that sees him dressed as a firefighter. In retrospect, this concept is such an obvious fit for him I’m surprised Blizzard hadn’t made one itself. Though I’m not sure if the tank top would pass a regulations check.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630265"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630265">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While some of these skins don’t really seem on-theme and just look like artists wanted to put their favorite character in a pretty dress (valid), my favorites are the ones that truly imagine where these characters might have ended up if they’d been born in a peaceful world. Zenyatta as a traffic police officer throwing tickets instead of his signature orbs is inspired.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630264" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630264"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630264">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>However, one submission circulating in the community has been gaining traction particularly rapidly on social media and, by extension, in the competition. The Chew Time-Huskyrat skin for Junkrat has crossed my desk a few times over the past couple of days, and it’s pretty imaginative, to say the least. At a glance, it’s actually a pretty fun skin that has the explosive hero putting away his bombs for bones and chew toys and looking like a fairly standard mascot character. If you look more closely, though, you see it’s also meant to be a reference to pup play and furry culture, and he’s wearing a diaper, which has plenty of implications you can google if you’re curious. I don’t think there’s a chance in hell that Blizzard puts this one in the game, even if it somehow skyrocketed to the top of the leaderboard, but it has entered the top 10, and fans are losing it as it climbs the ranks.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cancel that Chinese skin vote right fucking now why does the Junkrat furry diaper fetish skin have so many votes</p> <p>— jamie🎐 (@VentureFootJob) <a href="https://twitter.com/VentureFootJob/status/1971794747078726003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the concept of junkrat being a diaper furry if the omnic crisis never happened <a href="https://t.co/WpHSF7AiNr">pic.twitter.com/WpHSF7AiNr</a></p> <p>— matt 🗯 (@6luelights) <a href="https://twitter.com/6luelights/status/1971902800667050158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">being a junkrat fan after the diaperfur skin surfaced <a href="https://t.co/58Qlt1PqPy">https://t.co/58Qlt1PqPy</a></p> <p>— fRankie 🐀💬 #TRANSMASCJUNKRAT💙💗🤍💗💙 (@vishkar_junkrat) <a href="https://twitter.com/vishkar_junkrat/status/1971984646000071042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">STOP SAYING ID LIKE THE JUNKRAT FAN ART I DO NOT. 😭😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/AA1pzPlvhG">https://t.co/AA1pzPlvhG</a></p> <p>— Aspen (@aspenisoffline) <a href="https://twitter.com/aspenisoffline/status/1972332121793700011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">IS JUNKRAT WEARING A DIAPER 😦 <a href="https://t.co/R2t1Fsj4Jw">pic.twitter.com/R2t1Fsj4Jw</a></p> <p>— Rowan🌱Lifeweaver CEO 🌷 (@adoringniran) <a href="https://twitter.com/adoringniran/status/1971836185359405251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"…and then, in 2025, overwatch finally hosted a fan design contest."<br>⁰"how fabulous! did anyone submit anything good?"<br>⁰"someone drew furry junkrat… in a diaper…"<br>⁰"oh darling, that is simply dreadful!"<br>⁰"i know, rarity. i know…" <a href="https://t.co/QRRGbrzHJQ">pic.twitter.com/QRRGbrzHJQ</a></p> <p>— 𝘱𝘺𝘳𝘢 ໒꒱ (@pyraVT) <a href="https://twitter.com/pyraVT/status/1972252773866725666?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>E</span><span>ight winners will be chosen, including one first-place entry, two second-place winners, and two third-place contestants, and a popularity award will be granted to the top three highest-voted designs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re still about a week out from Prime Day — Amazon’s big sales week ahead of Black Friday in which you can save tons on tech, home goods, and more. Even though the deals event isn’t here yet, some stuff has already begun to see some major discounts. If you’re hoping to save some cash on some new stuff for your PC or laptop, you can. Take this docking station for example. Anker has a USB hub that’s normally priced at $270. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Right now, Amazon has it marked down by 37%. That saves you a cool $100, bringing the price to just $170 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stay Organized and Versatile</h2>
<p>This docking station from Anker can bring all of your devices together in one place. No mess on your desktop. This hub will allow you to connect to multiple displays, transfer data quickly, or even charge all your devices easily from one place.</p>
<p>The anker hub employs a number of different ports to manage your different needs. along the front, you’ll find four USB-C ports, two of which are capable of up to 100W max output and the other two capable of transfer speeds of up to 10Gb/s. You’ll also find two USB-A ports, one designed for charging at 12W max and the other for data transfer. When all charging ports are being used, you’ll have a total output of 160W.</p>
<p>The front smart screen display will show you information about the charging output to your plugged-in devices. An audio jack is also on the front beneath that to connect to headphones.</p>



<p>When we turn the Anker docking station around, we find three more USB-A data ports, capable of up to 480Mb/s. Two HDMI 2.0 ports are there so you can connect to multiple displays at once, allowing for up to 4K resolution. You have an Ethernet port capable of up to 1Gb/s. And then we have a USB-C upstream port.</p>
<p>With a ton of electronic devices plugged into the hub, you may be worried about overheating. Well the hub employs ActiveShield temperature monitoring to check temperature levels three million times a day. The airflow system efficiently works to keep the unit cool while it’s on. In the event it does overheat despite that, the smart display can warn you with overheat alerts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">For a limited time, Amazon has the Anker USB-C docking station on sale for a huge $100 discount</a>. The price is down from $270 to just $170 right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The director of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> has said Western players are more likely to choose the game's first-person option, after growing up on a diet of PC first-person shooters such as Doom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Japanese fans more accustomed to third-person console RPGs like Dragon Quest have tended to play Requiem's demo in third-person, director Akifumi Nakanishi told <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250929d" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Denfaminicogamer</a>, in an interview translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiem-devs-notice-japanese-players-are-more-likely-to-play-in-third-person-westerners-in-first-person/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Requiem doesn't launch until next year, a demo version has been publicly available at both Gamescom in Germany and Tokyo Game Show over the past couple of months. After attending both shows and watching fans try the game for themselves, Nakanishi said he had spotted the difference in how most opted to play in each location, and suggested it was due to how audiences had played other games while growing up.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think those kinds of differences are significant," Nakanishi said, describing the popularity of shooters in the west, as opposed to console RPGs in Japan. However, this was now changing, he continued, citing the popularity of both Minecraft and Apex Legends among younger Japanese gamers today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After originating in third-person, the Resident Evil series switched to first-person gameplay for Resident Evil 7. But recent years have also seen the launch of various re-releases of previous third-person classics, such as 2023's celebrated Resident Evil 4 Remake. Requiem will be the first title to hand players full control over which perspective their prefer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing the Resident Evil Requiem demo myself at Gamescom, there's definitely something to be said for its first-person perspective, which is presented as the demo's default. In first-person, it's harder to tell how close behind you the game's unsettling new monster might be, something that ramps up the horror elements. That said, the view does give you a narrower field of vision for finding hidden objects and clues, which sometimes proved a little frustrating. In reality, it seems likely that most players will likely try a bit of both.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil: Requiem - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Public demos for Resident Evil Requiem are important, Nakanishi told IGN at Tokyo Game Show, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-devs-say-they-cant-tell-if-the-games-actually-scary-anymore">Capcom's development team has now made so many games in the series they are unable to tell what is truly scary or not</a>.

            <p>The first batch of seasonal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> post-release content will arrive 28th October, a few weeks after the game's 10th October launch, EA has announced. It'll bring new modes, new maps, new weapons, and more. And it'll be free.</p>
<p>"All gameplay-impacting features will be free or earnable as part of our commitment to fair play and access for all players," a press release says. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-preview">And a blog on the game's website</a> has "free post launch content" emblazoned across a promotional image.</p>
<figure>

<p>Battlefield 6 Season 1 will unfold in three phases. The first phase will arrive on 28th October and be known as Rogue Ops, and it'll introduce a new four-versus-four mode called Strikepoint, in which you'll only get one life per round; a new map called Blackwell Fields, which looks like an oil-field but is apparently a recommissioned American air base; three new weapons, a new APC, and some new weapon attachments.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Battlefield Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The second phase, dubbed California Resistance, will land on 18th November, and bring a new eight-versus-eight mode called Sabotage, in which you have one round each on offence and defence, to see how many sites you can blow up; and a new Southern California map called Eastwood, which is a sleepy affluent suburb turned warzone; two new weapons and more.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Battlefield Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The third and final phase will drop on 9th December and bring a winter-themed and limited time Ice Lock event based around a mechanic called Freeze, appropriately enough; and a seasonal update to the Empire State map.</p>

			<p>Michael '<a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/pachter-nintendos-a-bad-company-with-iwata-a-poor-ceo/">Nintendo is a bad company</a>' Pachter, also known as Michael '<a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2022/03/10/michael-pachter-on-ps5-vs-xbox-series-x/">PlayStation is doomed</a>' Pachter, and sometimes known as Michael Pachter, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-01-24/this-netflix-analyst-has-cost-investors-a-2-000-return">the analyst who cost investors a 2,000% return when he advised them to sell their Netflix stock</a>, is back to an old stomping ground with a new claim that "<em>Sony is blowing it in the games business,</em>" because he predicts that games will move to cloud-based experiences connected to your TVs.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CktSxc9_4uk&amp;t=706s">Yahoo Finance</a> discussion (spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/michael-pachter-sony-is-a-terrible-company-they-are-blowing-it-in-the-games-business-games-are-moving-to-connected-tv-via-the-cloud.1312330/">ResetEra</a>) about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/">EA going private through its $55 billion sale</a> and where people should place their stock market bets in the videogame industry, when asked if people should be buying Sony stock, Pachter immediately responded, "<em>No, Sony for sure not, Sony is a terrible company, and they actually are blowing it in the games business.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Look, games are moving to connected TV,</em>" he continues. "<em>So, think about all the participants that are going to deliver games the way we get movies via Netflix, and forget the subscription model. Just think about iOS becoming on your TV. So free-to-play games on your TV, who's going to deliver that? Cloud providers, AI, anybody whose investing in making that happen is where you want to be.</em>"</p>



<p>Pachter continued to comment that if people looking to invest in the videogame industry want to invest in any current publishers, they should look towards <a href="https://www.playtika.com/">PlayTika, a mobile game company</a> that Pachter owns 500,000 shares of. Pachter added that it is currently trading at "<em>about a four and a half multiple</em>" and that if it were to get an EA-level multiple, he would make "<em>several million dollars</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Electronic Arts: Breaking down the $55 billion deal that takes the company private" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CktSxc9_4uk?start=706&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This isn't the first time Pachter has bet on <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-losing-to-sony-is-a-wrong-gamers-perception-says-pachter-they-want-to-win-business-not-console/">cloud and non-console-based experiences</a> in videogames being the future. He also previously claimed that Microsoft adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/">Activision titles to Xbox Game Pass would bring the service 100 million subscribers</a>, and claimed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-will-get-to-200-million-subs-in-10-years-bets-michael-pachter-exclusivity-model-is-wrong/">in the next decade, Game Pass will have 200 million subscribers</a>.</p>



<p>At this point, Pachter has made a career out of these kinds of wild claims and <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/michael-pachter">has been wrong more often than he's been right</a>. It's worth wondering when we can start considering Pachter just an old man shouting at clouds. Or, more accurately, about clouds.</p>



<p>Just days ago, Sony Interactive Entertainment chief executive officer Hideaki Nishino called the PS5 Sony's "<em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-ps5-is-the-most-successful-playstation-generation-ever-making-136-billion-in-sales-so-far">most successful generation to date</a></em>," with $136 billion in sales generated.</p>

<p>Last year, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">343 Industries announced it was rebranding as Halo Studios</a> and is working on multiple new games for the franchise. It shared a video titled A New Dawn, which included a look at Project Foundry: an experiment into how Halo games will look using Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>"It's fair to say that our intent is that the majority of what we showcased in Foundry is expected to be in projects which we are building, or future projects," Halo Studios boss Pierre Hintze said at the time.</p>
<p>Until now, the studio has been using its own Slipspace engine. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-halo-is-moving-to-unreal-engine-5-and-the-first-footage-looks-impressive">Digital Foundry</a> stated the change to UE5 could provide "a seismic shift in presentation and development".</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-sept">HaloWC blog post</a> on Halo Waypoint doesn't specify anything on these new projects, but Halo fans won't want to miss the announcements.</p>
<p>The blog reads: "Back in June we let the community know that we'd be continuing the conversation from last year's HaloWC and the 'A New Dawn' video and sharing more about what we’ve been working on. Like last year we'll be on the Main Stage to talk about it but this year we've also got a 'deep dive' panel planned for the Community Stage that you won't want to miss."</p>
<p>The last Halo game released was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> in 2021, which saw the Xbox's flagship shooter move to a semi-open world. While it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-campaign-review-master-chief-makes-a-leap-of-faith-and-nails-the-landing">received positively</a>, player numbers for its multiplayer mode have since plummeted.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="3c6d69b342a2a"><a title="Mario Galaxy Star" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c6d69b342a2a/mario-galaxy-star.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are mere days away from the long-awaited arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> on Switch (at least, the second one has been long-awaited). The new bundle arrives on <strong>2nd October</strong>, and the reviews have started rolling in.</p>
<p>Our very own Ollie Reynolds put virtual pen to virtual paper for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2">our review</a> and, surprise surprise, he still had a wonderful time with this pair of classics. Mr Reynolds awarded the galactic return an excellent 9/10 and enjoyed just about everything they threw at him. Here's a snippet of the review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With gameplay that subverts expectations and scenarios that wouldn’t be possible if not for the creative freedom of the cosmos, they represent the Mario series at its absolute best. They look better than ever, boast small yet welcome additions, and expand upon the narrative with new storybook pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:188104 @ 1759248905 -->
<p>But we're not the only ones with thoughts on Nintendo's latest, oh no! Below, we've put together a round-up of the critical consensus as it stands, and it'll come as no surprise to hear that it's really rather positive.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/super-mario-galaxy-12-review-despite-pointer-issues-this-is-still-3d-platforming-at-its-very-best/">VGC</a>, where Galaxy 1 + 2 got a full 5/5. The outlet had some issues with the new gyro aiming, but ultimately felt that "Both games remain the high point of creativity in the platform game genre":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Odyssey may have since topped the Galaxy games with its sheer craftsmanship, but, in my eyes, this is still 3D Mario platforming at its very best, which also makes Galaxy and Galaxy 2 some of Nintendo’s very best games.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/super-mario-galaxy-1-2-review-nintendo-switch-2-492056-20250930">GAMINGbible</a> awarded a similar 10/10 in its review and found very little to be negative about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2</em> are effectively the perfect package: two of the greatest video games of all time, just as you remember them, with only a few minor touchups here and there. This is, for my money, the best way to play two of the greatest video games ever made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things dropped ever so slightly in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/super-mario-galaxy-1-and-2-switch-review/">Destructoid</a>'s 9/10 review, where the only real sticking point is the bundle's much-discussed price:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While it's hard not to talk about the price, it's hard not to deny that these games are still masterpieces nearly 20 years after their release on Wii.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo/super-mario-galaxy-and-super-mario-galaxy-2-are-as-magical-as-ever-on-nintendo-switch-2">TechRadar</a> gave Galaxy 1 + 2 a 4.5/5, agreeing that it's the "definitive way to play two of the best Mario adventures of all time", though half-wishing there was a little more new content thrown in too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The combination of rock-solid performance, upgraded visuals, and new story content makes these experiences worth revisiting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/super-mario-galaxy-1-and-2-nintendo-switch-review-price/">TheGamer</a> opted for the marginally lower 4/5, enjoying almost everything the package had to offer, but struggling to get past the price or occasionally outdated mechanics and controls:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is now the definitive means to experience two of the best platformers ever made, it’s just unfortunate that the package is prohibitively expensive and borderline insulting to those who want to enjoy it most.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em>All in all, it's off to a pretty rock-solid start, eh? Will you be picking up this pair of classics later this week? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-the-reviews-are-in-for-super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2-on-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-day-one-patch-ray-tracing-improvements/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-day-one-patch-introduces-ray-tracing-performance-improvements-and-more.1312552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Ghost of Yōtei day-one patch introduces plenty of improvements to the game, including ray tracing and performance improvements.</p>



<p>As confirmed to <a href="http://ign.com/">IGN</a>, the 1.006 patch will be live by the time the game officially launches on October 2, and it is a highly recommended download for those who are going to play the game with a retail copy, as it will introduce some critical improvements. Chief among them will be multiple improvements to environmental rendering performance, fixes for Ray Tracing Mode to ensure lighting consistency and performance, and various performance improvements in missions with high character counts.</p>



<p>The Ghost of Yōtei day one patch doesn't stop at improving just performance and stability. It is also packed with gameplay fixes, animation improvements, significant environment enhancements, and interface fixes. The full details on every improvement and fix can be found in the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-details-ghost-of-yotei-day-one-patch-notes-includes-an-extensive-list-of-improvements"> full patch notes</a>.</p>



<p>Although improvements are always welcome, Ghost of Yōtei was not in dire need of them, as the game looked and played great even without the day-one patch, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">highlighted by Alessio in his review</a>. The game's only major issue, which no patch can fix, is its extreme similarity to the first entry in the series, although it is one that is easy to look past, considering its quality.</p>



<p>Ghost of Yōtei launches worldwide on PlayStation 5 on October 2. If its predecessor is anything to go by, the game is also expected to release on PC in the future</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-ryzen-7-laptop-bundle-crashes-to-64-off-loaded-with-freebies-and-likely-gone-before-october-prime-day.1312537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you happen to be on the hunt for a new laptop, whether that’s because you’re a student in need of something to complete assignments, a small business owner looking to handle your business needs, or just some guy looking to watch YouTube and draw pictures, come check out the Dell Inspiron 15. This laptop has a touchscreen and is bundled with some bonus accessories. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4388/">The Amazon listing has the full price set at $2,200, but the limited time deal indicates its been marked down by 64% to just $800</a>. Some quick napkin math will tell you that’s a $1,400 discount.</p>
<p>You might be thinking that’s absolutely ridiculous. How can this laptop be on sale for that much off? Well, you’re right to be suspicious. When we look at this bundle’s price history, we can see it has only existed on Amazon for about a month. After first being listed, it immediately dropped in price and it’s mostly been at that $800 amount since.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4388/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Lots of sellers on Amazon will artificially inflate the list price so that when they mark it down, the sale looks enormous. Even if we go to Dell’s website, we’ll find versions of this model laptop going for about the same as you find it here. All that said, this is a pretty good value.</p>
<p>What you’re getting is a 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop that’s powered by the AMD Ryzen 7 7730U. With that we also have an integrated graphics card, 32GB of memory, and a full 1TB of internal storage on its SSD. This laptop is designed to be able to take on school, work, entertainment, and any other sort of everyday task an average user might encounter — and it’s got the specs to support that.</p>
<p>The screen’s touch controls allow you to operate the laptop as if it’s a tablet, choosing to use pinch, zoom, and swipe gestures like you would on a mobile device. It has a resolution of 1080p and uses an anti-glare coating to help minimize reflections, making for more comfortable viewing in bright settings.</p>



<h2>Bonus Gifts Included</h2>
<p>Along with the laptop, you also get a number of free accessories. This Dell Inspiron 15 comes with a stylus pen to be used on the touchscreen, a cleaning clothe, a laptop sleeve for traveling, a USB flash drive with 128GB on it, as well as some port covers and webcam covers. Plus, the laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4388/">Right now, you can get the Dell Inspiron 15 and all these goodies for just $800.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4388/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While I've spent dozens of hours building my perfect dino park in Jurassic World Evolution 2, Frontier's prehistoric series always felt like it was sort of a younger sibling to their other park-builders, Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster. There are a lot of features in those two games that didn't make it into the first two Evolution entries. So when I got to play Jurassic World Evolution 3, I was most excited to see that it finally seems like a fully-fledged member of the Frontier flock, with the extremely deep customization and personalization features I've come to expect from the studio. Oh yeah, and the baby dinosaurs are pretty dang cute, too.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Spared No Expense</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Evolution 3's story takes place some time after Jurassic World: Dominion, at a point where dinosaurs reintroduced to the wild in the previous films are struggling to adapt and survive on their own. That brings us as park managers to work with the Dinosaur Integration Network, seeking to help them thrive and, let's be honest, make a tidy profit showing them off to people who definitely, probably, are not going to get eaten. I mean it's honestly very uncommon at this point, and we've learned a lot over the years from myriad disasters, but we are still going to need you to sign this waiver.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And the dinosaurs we'll help to integrate have definitely never looked better, both in terms of textures and animations. Some of them are still stuck with their 1993 designs based on what is at this point 30-year-old paleontology, which is a bit of a shame to me as someone who likes to keep up-to-date on these things. But I suppose you couldn't really make a Jurassic game without the distinctive creature designs from the films, and there are also some more scientifically accurate models like the gorgeous Utahraptor, joining the base game here after becoming the breakout star of Evolution 2's DLC.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The marquee feature for Evolution 3 is the breeding system and juvenile dinosaurs. And they are, as you’d guess, super cute.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the marquee feature for Evolution 3 is the breeding system and juvenile dinosaurs. And they are, as you’d guess, super cute. It's not just the babies adding variety to the roster, though, since adult males and females can now sport subtle differences in size and body shape as well. You can even customize the skin patterns for males and females separately to more easily tell them apart. And this means group dynamics need to be carefully managed, too, since different species will require different ratios of males to females to be content. Some can get along with more than one male in the same enclosure, while others can't. And most species will not like being segregated by sex, so you'll want at least one of each.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Next Generation</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Breeding will also be central to the management gameplay, with the ability to raise a dinosaur's appeal rating by selecting parents with high ratings. You can even breed for specific traits, like a longer lifespan or the ability to coexist with other species more peacefully. Otherwise, wellbeing is a pretty straightforward matter of making sure the dinos have enough space, food, water, and their preferred terrain mix. Smaller herbivores like low ground cover, whereas some flying species actually prefer a barren landscape they can easily scan from above. There's also an added consideration of nest placement, since some species won't, well, do the deed if pesky little mammals with their funny flashing rectangles are watching. You should at least have to pay extra for that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I didn't have enough time in my 90-minute demo to really dig super deep into this. I didn't get a great idea of how the financial management side is balanced, either. We did get to see a little bit of the campaign layer, though, which featured maps based on the Southwestern US, Hawaii, and Western China. And these maps look truly stunning even without prehistoric beasts wandering around them, showing off dramatic elevation changes, towering waterfalls, and unique vegetation. I especially enjoyed the one set in China's Sichuan Basin, which mixed the architecture of an alpine ski resort with the new East Asian building theme and a focus on flying species.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The basic routine feels pretty similar to Evolution 2 overall. You hire scientists, send them out on digs to collect DNA, synthesize new species, then let them out into the enclosure. It's at that point your breeding program takes over, which is the way to attain the highest appeal ratings. Naturally-bred dinosaurs are more interesting to guests than artificially incubated ones, which increases with the number of generations they have been breeding on their own. It's a bit of a challenge at first, since the low compatibility between artificially-incubated males and females makes producing viable offspring more difficult and time-consuming. But this compatibility can be improved over succeeding generations with help from your genetics team.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">All Systems Online</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Your scientists will also be responsible for researching new dig sites, enclosures, guest amenities, park administration buildings, and all the usual stuff. Each has a skill rating in three different areas and a special trait, like making expeditions faster or incubations cheaper, and demands a salary based on their proficiency. I did find it somewhat difficult to get a good spread of skills with the five slots and limited budget I was given, and I'm not sure if staff can develop new skills over time yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Managing the park requires ranger teams to visit enclosures and observe each animal to give you data on their physical and mental state, and you could be missing a major problem brewing if you don't set up your patrol routes well. You'll also need to provide camera coverage across your fence lines, or else you won't be notified if someone starts trying to chew a hole in one. Again, this is rare, but please, you came all this way, so you might as well sign the waiver.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the bulk of the new stuff doesn't have anything to do with directly controlling capture and repair teams, which is still pretty cool. It doesn't even have to do with dinosaur breeding. It's the rich wealth of customization options now available. Terraforming is extremely powerful, with tons of tools that each have plenty of settings for raising, lowering, smoothing, adding noise, and creating ramps. You can paint custom ground textures. You can even build enclosures that use steep cliff edges instead of fences as part of their design to keep the dinos in.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Land Before Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The way water works is a little bit strange. Aquatic species use their own dedicated lagoons, which is a whole other thing. But simply placing ground water isn't quite the same as it is in other park-builders. You can't just build a giant pit and fill it up to a certain height with water. Rather, ground water requires a flat surface as a starting point, and the depth is fixed using the water tool. This does let you create some fairly deep areas for semiaquatic species to wade and fish in. It looks nice! It's just not quite as flexible as what you can do on dry land, and took a bit of getting used to.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But when it comes to buildings, I was almost overwhelmed with all the new options. Similar to Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster, Jurassic World Evolution 3 contains all the rotatable, resizeable, and recolorable building pieces to create just about anything you can imagine. Even the pre-made structures include the ability to select, remove, copy, and remix existing pieces down to the smallest bits like roof corners and floor tiles. Windows can even be edited to make it look like there are various different kinds of shops inside when you really zoom in for a peek.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The editing tools are quite impressive and generally pretty easy to use.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, the editing tools are quite impressive and generally pretty easy to use. It was a ton of fun to mess around with, even in the very limited amount of time I had, and I can't wait to see what other people who are more creatively skilled than me can do with them – especially since you'll be able to upload your creations to share with other players. And if you don't have the time to custom-build absolutely everything, there are several different pre-made building themes to pick from, including the East Asian-inspired set that I especially enjoyed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just about everything I've seen so far of Jurassic World Evolution 3 has me excited to thrill my guests and make my lawyers nervous (seriously, we do need you to sign that waiver). From dino breeding to dramatic and different new park locations to extremely robust customization tools, it feels like it truly deserves its spot at the table with Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster now, rather than relying on the, you know, freakin' dinosaurs to make up for some of what it was missing. We'll be able to decide whether or not to endorse this park in its entirety on October 21.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>
