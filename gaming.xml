            <p>Nintendo's 3 v 3 wheelchair basketball game Drag x Drive doesn't appear to have support for local multiplayer.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo announced a release date for Drag x Drive, and now more details about the upcoming release have come to light via the game's store page on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>'s eShop.</p>
<p>While specific multiplayer modes aren't listed, the page reveals the game will retail for £16.99 here in the UK, and support up to 12 players online - online being the key word here. Drag x Drive can only be played by one player per console, meaning split-screen local multiplayer seemingly won't be an option.</p>

<p>This means even if you have an additional pair of Switch 2 Joy Con, you won't be able to participate in a spot of basketball with your friends and family at home. This seems like quite a missed opportunity, if you ask me. Eurogamer has asked Nintendo to comment on Drag x Drive's multiplayer support, and will update when we know more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-first-dual-mouse-mode-game-is-wheelchair-basketball-drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive was first announced back in April</a>, during Nintendo's dedicated Switch 2 Direct. The game will make use of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-good-are-switch-2s-mouse-controls-eurogamers-verdict-from-the-big-reveal-event">Switch 2's mouse functionality</a>, with players using the console's Joy Con to "intuitively steer, speed up, perform tricks and make plays such as dunks".</p>
<p>Drag x Drive is set to arrive on 14th August <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drag-x-drive-wheels-onto-switch-2-as-an-eshop-exclusive-this-august">as a Switch 2 eShop exclusive</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-game-drag-x-drive-appears-to-not-support-local-multiplayer]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod has become the latest studio to be hit by a wave of layoffs, if a spate of social media posts from now-former employees are anything to go by.</p>

<p>As spotted by journalist&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adnanriaz9.bsky.social/post/3lshydxkns22k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Adnan Riaz</a> (and collated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nod-montr%C3%A9al-hit-by-a-round-of-layoffs.1228692/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ResetEra user Maxime</a>), several employees of Don't Nod Montreal, which developed <i>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</i>as its first project, appear to have lost their jobs, including technical artist Laurent Dufresne and cinematic artist Mary Pouliot.</p>

<p>It's not clear how many Don't Nod Montreal employees have lost their jobs; Riaz spotted at least three, and it's possible more have been laid off without posting about it on social media.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-dont-nod-montreal-layoffs.jpg?itok=cXfm8YSh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-dont-nod-montreal-layoffs.jpg?itok=Tw1zoVb8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't Nod Montreal, responsible for&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, has been hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Dufresne, the layoff numbers are "non-insignificant", and the team is "relatively small", so it's safe to assume that more than just the three people spotted by Riaz have lost their jobs, unfortunately.</p>

<p>This wave of layoffs appears to be separate to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">wave that hit the studio's Paris office</a> late last year, in which around 70 employees' jobs appeared to be at risk. As a reminder, the Paris location is Don't Nod's main studio; it's responsible for games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden" rel="nofollow">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a>&nbsp;</em>and the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Aphelion</em>.</p>

<p>Don't Nod Montreal's layoffs come after a difficult time for the company. In September last year, the studio admitted two of its major 2024 releases, namely the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Banishers&nbsp;</em>and climbing game&nbsp;<em>Jusant</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">had underperformed</a>, leading to an 11% drop in revenue compared to the prior year.</p>

<p>In April this year, however, Don't Nod <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-revenue-2024-lost-records" rel="nofollow">revealed another revenue dip</a>, but at the time, the company also said that sales of&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>were "in line with forecasts", although the studio stopped short of revealing just how many copies&nbsp;<em>Lost Records&nbsp;</em>had sold at that point.</p>




<p>It's unclear what the future holds for Don't Nod Montreal, but for now, if you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, you can do so on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lost-records-bloom-rage/9n3f1lw9hc6c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

<p>Our very own Tyler also reviewed both parts of the game; you can find his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-review-rocking-in-90s" rel="nofollow"><em>Tape 1</em> review right here</a>, and his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-2-review-against-machine" rel="nofollow"><em>Tape 2</em> review here</a>.</p>

<p>Here comes the science bit...</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="three new switch ray tracing patents" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d60094e084873/three-new-switch-ray-tracing-patents.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now, we already know that the ability to use ray tracing is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/digital-foundry-says-switch-2-running-switch-games-at-4k-is-quite-the-thing-in-performance-breakdown">built into the Switch 2 console</a>, baked into its very fibre, as an entirely untechnical person might say. However, we've yet to be presented with any examples of it in action on the new machine just yet.</p>
<p>Well, as disappointing as it may be to not have had Mario's shiny face reflecting back on itself in real time from the get-go, Nintendo does seem to be up to something, at the very least, with regards to the tech. In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lsisrfobvk2d">recent social media post</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social">Nintendo Patents Watch</a> has highlighted three patents published yesterday in Japan, two of which have ray tracing antics in mind.</p>

<p>So, what are we looking at here, then? Well, as detailed by the post, the first two images show details of ray tracing techniques that improve both the amount of control the tech has on a per-object basis, as well as correctional adjustments for around screen edges. This is on top of a third patent that covers an improved shadow-mapping technique.</p>
<p>So, while we don't have any info on what all this is exactly, it sure does look like tweaks and adjustments, or just some further info, on whatever is already going on inside our Switch 2 consoles (which Nintendo has been vague on so far) with regards to ray tracing.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Looking forward to seeing how ray tracing actually pans out on Switch 2? What games do you think will, or should, employ it first? Let us know!</em></p>

			<p>A new The First Berserker: Khazan update is now live on PC and consoles, introducing new features, balance, and system changes, and more.</p>
<p>The update, which will go live on PC and consoles later today, introduces AMD FSR 3 and AMD FSR 4 support on AMD Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs. The latest version of the upscaler can be enabled via driver settings with the Adrenalin driver version 25.6.1 or later installed, and will be in use even if the in-game interface says that AMD FSR 3 is instead.</p>
<p>Besides introducing AMD FSR 3 and 4 support on PC, the new The First Berserker: Khazan brings new free DLC for all users, including new armor sets and hairstyles to customize Khazan's appearance, balance adjustments, difficulty changes, augment gear tweaks, interface improvements, and more. The full update notes can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543361383085900258?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam.</a></p>
<p>Though far from being the most original game, I have found The First Berserker: Khazan to be one of the best soulslike games released recently. Combining features from the FromSoftware franchise with mechanics lifted from Team NINJA's games like Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, the game offers a fast-paced, intense experience that's extremely enjoyable to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">review.</a></p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi left Square back in 2003, and his departure impacted more than the popular role-playing game series, as Square reportedly "collapsed" after he left.</p>
<p>As reported by<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-collapsed-after-he-left-final-fantasy-composer-on-how-hironobu-sakaguchis-innate-leadership-skills-held-the-company-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Automaton</a>, the creator of the Final Fantasy series recently spoke on the NOBIYO To Isshoni podcast hosted by longtime series composer Nobuo Uematsu about their time together at the Japanese publisher. The creator of one of the most beloved JRPG series was the "big boss" even in the company's early days, and managed to work even at the beginning when Square was more like a club of university students rather than an actual company. At the time, Square did not have a proper corporate organization, Uematsu-san recalled during the show, but everybody listened to Sakaguchi-san, whom he described as a leader. As such, when Sakaguchi-san left Square, the situation was quite bad, and the entire organization suddenly collapsed, so much so that even Uematsu-san felt that he should leave, but the Final Fantasy series ultimately commends Square Enix for getting back on its feet after so many key figures in the company left right before the merger with the Dragon Quest series publisher.</p>
<p>Although Hironobu Sakaguchi left Square over 20 years ago, the legendary game developer recently collaborated with the publisher again on FANTASIAN: Neo Dimension, the PC and console port of the JRPG originally released on the Apple Arcade service a few years back. Sakaguchi-san's touch is unmistakable in the game, so much so that it feels like a proper entry in the Final Fantasy series, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fantasian-neo-dimension-final-fantasy-in-all-but-name/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My friend group and I do our own version of<em>&nbsp;</em>Easy Allies' "<a href="https://easyallies.com/#!/show/the-hall-of-greats" rel="nofollow">The Hall of Greats</a>" every quarter, and we have a grand ol' time. If you don't know what The Hall of Greats is, it boils down to being a celebration of games; essentially, we get together, present what we think deserves to be in The Hall of Greats, and everyone takes a vote using poker chips. We all get five poker chips, and each one is valued from one to five.</p>

<p>Formal apology to my good friend Matt: he brought&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/system-shock-2-embracing-enigma-brief-retrospective" rel="nofollow"><em>System Shock 2</em></a>&nbsp;the very first time and was defeated quite soundly by many other games. I gave&nbsp;his pick a paltry one point, and I deeply regret it now. Not because I hurt Matt's feelings or anything, but because I now believe&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;absolutely deserves the coveted five-point poker chip.</p>

<p>Indeed, I had given&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;a try in the past and acknowledged its worth, but for a multitude of reasons, I lost interest. Still, it was quite a revolutionary game back during its release in 1999, so it has historical value. After playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios" rel="nofollow">Nightdive Studios</a>'&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Edition Remaster</em>, I now realize that few games come close to the depth and immersion it provides, even to this day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-wrench.jpg?itok=RxFnL4I_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-wrench.jpg?itok=iXdpDKIq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crisp, clean visuals!</figcaption></figure><h2>A Remaster That Makes an Incredible Game Even Better</h2>

<p>Nightdive is an incredible studio, modernizing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-review-return-of-kex" rel="nofollow">beloved</a>&nbsp;--&nbsp;and, well, some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/poed-definitive-edition-review-more-like-pooed" rel="nofollow">not-so-beloved</a> --&nbsp;classics to run on modern hardware. These aren't just your simple ports, no, Nightdive loves to give its titles the VIP treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Often, this VIP treatment comes in the form of new, refined sprites and models to revitalize and rejuvenate aging games.&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>, which is now certainly an all-timer in my eyes, did start to look and feel a bit dated. In comes&nbsp;Nightdive to save the day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-interface.jpg?itok=sK1S5JAG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-interface.jpg?itok=99ybE96M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't get intimidated by the interface. You'll get the hang of it!</figcaption></figure><p>I think I fell off of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;several years back&nbsp;<em>because</em>&nbsp;of it looked quite dated, and it felt like it, too. The&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>is the silver bullet for my previous complaints, resulting in the definitive way to experience a masterpiece.</p>

<p>Visually,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>&nbsp;is faithful to the original developer's vision, while adding some needed touch-ups to enemy models and weapons. Atmosphere is also so incredibly important for an immersive sim, and that is captured so well here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/systme-shock-2-hallway-run.jpg?itok=Zb0pyxNt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/systme-shock-2-hallway-run.jpg?itok=b53kZzGy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Duly noted.</figcaption></figure><p>Lighting, environment textures, and everything in between convinced me that I was actually there on the Von Braun space ship, the main setting of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>. The result from this attention to detail is an atmosphere akin to the movie <em>Alien</em>: a feeling of hopelessness and survival against terrifying odds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One other issue I had with&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2'</em>s non-remastered port was the controls and the clunkiness of its gameplay. The UI makes&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;appear more intimidating than it really is, and while that almost claustrophobic UI is still here, everything feels much smoother to play.</p>

<p>Mouse and keyboard controls are seamless and once you actually get the hang of things an hour or so in, everything clicks. This remaster also has controller support. Nightdive does a pretty good job at making the controller able to navigate menus, making ample use of various controller shortcuts since you're lacking the precision of a mouse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-character.jpg?itok=NF2c6nqw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-character.jpg?itok=GvnMz2JT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to get immersed in being this goofy lookin' fella.</figcaption></figure><h2>Get Immersed in the Foreboding Von Braun</h2>

<p><em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>&nbsp;is an immersive sim, and if you don't know what that is, I forgive you. They really just don't make very many of them anymore... but if I had to put it succinctly: an immersive sim is a broad term for games that allow for a high degree of player choice in approaching its various situations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Player choice comes in many forms, especially in<em>&nbsp;</em>this title. Right from the start, you're forced to pick a role without really knowing how it'll benefit you in the long run. You pick a career path in the UNN Marines, Navy, or OSA; following this choice, you go on a choice-filled tour of duty to give you a few extra stat bonuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each will essentially give you a kickstart on the path to whatever build you want to make in&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>. The&nbsp;initial few choices are quite intimidating. The Marines caters more toward your typical run-and-gun playstyle, the Navy is a bit more technical with hacking and maintenance, and OSA focuses on Psi powers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-melee.jpg?itok=big-yzRK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-melee.jpg?itok=5Wx38-BW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guns? Sure, they're useful, but so is this shard.</figcaption></figure><p>For a game from 1999, the amount of freedom you have with your character is quite impressive, and even by today's standards, it holds up. I didn't even&nbsp;<em>touch</em>&nbsp;Psi powers, focusing more on a hybrid between melee and ranged weapons, as well as hacking. I ended up doing just fine, but it's a game that incentivizes multiple playthroughs, since gameplay can vary so much.</p>

<p>Gameplay takes place mostly within the confines of the Von Braun starship. Something&nbsp;<em>horrible</em>&nbsp;has happened on the ship, and you're there to figure out what happened. You've just awoken from cryo-sleep on the starship, and things are, inexplicably, looking worse for wear.</p>

<p>Sneak, shoot, or hack your way through the ship as you follow objectives given to you by various characters in&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>. Polito, a surviving crewmate, gives players a lot of directions at the start, but the Von Braun is a rather confusing maze of pathways. Players have to rely on limited context, a not-so-helpful map, and reading the environment for the path forward.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-gun-animation.jpg?itok=NkaOnzaY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-gun-animation.jpg?itok=Z_f1hkT6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Locked and loaded.</figcaption></figure><p>Von Braun is a complex ship, with various sectors like the Hydroponics Deck and Recreation Deck. These areas have their own identity and feel distinct from one another, so as you're scrounging around for supplies and fighting (or avoiding) enemies, there's this exciting feeling of discovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was quite gratifying to go from being completely unfamiliar with the ship's interior to memorizing it through hours of exploration. And yet, there are still so many secrets for those who have a keen eye. Exploration is rewarding, giving players new weapons, upgrades, and the like.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-map.jpg?itok=T2mVb5ik 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-map.jpg?itok=z1Uajiu6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maps are hard, man.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>

<p>As you piece together the fate of the Von Braun ship and simply find a way to survive and escape, you'll have many different tools at your disposal. This is where the freedom of choice and your build come in. Plenty of weapons are strewn about, so you can go in guns blazing if you like. Or use that reliable wrench to whack away at enemies.</p>

<p>You can also try the stealthy path, which relies on patience and some hacking, too. Hacking is a simple mini-game, but it's crucial. Avoiding the ire of Xerxes is essential, as if you're seen by one of his cameras, he'll have hordes of robots and zombie-like reinforcements on you quickly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-grenade-launcher.jpg?itok=UMTqbjpK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-grenade-launcher.jpg?itok=bO5v1zPE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big robot? Nothing an EMP grenade won't solve.</figcaption></figure><p>Shooting played a large role in my playthrough, for when stealth failed, I'd pull out the big guns. Gunplay is not as tight as a boomer shooter or typical FPS, but you can improve the handling of guns and their damage by increasing stats at certain kiosks around the ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These kiosks are very important, as you'll want to constantly improve your build. You're not necessarily pigeonholed into being a run-and-gun type versus a psionic soldier, so you're given some freedom to experiment.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-energy-weapon.jpg?itok=Ke7Gxqv5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-energy-weapon.jpg?itok=vEu0jPG6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This energy gun was largely ineffective, as I didn't spec into using this type of weapon.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Narrative That Makes You Think</h2>

<p>Much of your time with this game comprises of utilizing the skillset of your choosing, while exploring the horrors and dangers of the Von Braun. Exploration is another key component here, and it's the means by which the story is delivered.</p>

<p><em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>&nbsp;relies on environmental storytelling, piecing together the grim fate of the starship by looking at the state of things. It also leans heavily on audio logs, which were a novelty back in 1999 when&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>was first released. Audio logs went on to inspire numerous games to follow this same delivery of narrative.</p>

<p>Audio logs seem tacky, but I mean, it makes sense -- most everyone on the Von Braun is dead. These audio logs range from mundane to intriguing, but the voice acting -- which is, again, from 1999 -- leaves a lot to be desired. Thankfully, the writing is still so well done. Piecing together the series of events that led up to<em>&nbsp;</em>the disaster on Von Braun will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-shodan.jpg?itok=5fNh6OQi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-shodan.jpg?itok=AQdteTU_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some horror elements are in&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>, so it can feel a little ominous and sinister!</figcaption></figure><p>This is a game that is perhaps more poignant than ever. We live in an age where AI is starting to develop rapidly, and it's scary and frightening. With AI being among the primary antagonists, we see the damage it can cause, even if that's far into the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than fighting robots sicced on you by AI, you'll have to contend with The Many. It's a Hivemind organism that's terrifyingly efficient and spreads like some aggressive fungus. This entity has a sort of collectivist mentality, and on top of that, you're contending with an AI that has a god complex. Regular humans are stuck in between these two -- it's a thrilling dynamic that engrossed me.</p>

<p>Like other Nightdive remasters, this version has a vault with an abundance of historical documents, concept art, and videos involving&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>'s development. I'm particularly fond of scans for a <em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>review from PC Format magazine, but there are also plenty of other fragments from history to enjoy.</p>

<p>For many,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;was considered among the best of the best. With the&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>, it's more accessible than ever and feels incredible to play -- it looks great, too. If there was ever a time to take the plunge and play it for the first time, it's now, and if you're looking to revisit, well, the Von Braun is ready for boarding!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's old news at this point to talk about just how popular the new <em>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> set is, but its for good reason. With a smart IP pairing between Wizards of the Coast and Square, incredible card design, and artwork that feels both true to&nbsp;<em>Magic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>, it's no surprise this set is going wild.</p>

<p>We've covered it plenty here at TechRaptor, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow">ranking all of the legendary creatures</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/discussing-magic-gathering-x-final-fantasy-with-daniel-holt-game-design-lead-for" rel="nofollow">chatting with the lead designer of the Commander decks</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/exclusive-mtg-final-fantasy-spoilers-card-reveals" rel="nofollow">even getting a chance to premiere our own preview cards</a>. Now that the set's settling down, Wizards of the Coast sent us some pre-constructed products to check out - so read on for our thoughts on the&nbsp;<em>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>Starter Kit and Limit Break Commander Deck.</p>


<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-main-photo.jpg?itok=fnICS15B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-main-photo.jpg?itok=axkj29F9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The&nbsp;<em>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy </em>Starter Kit contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>2 60-card pre-constructed decks
	<ul><li>1 Traditional foil legendary creature in each deck</li>
		<li>5 Non-foil new-to-<em>Magic&nbsp;</em>cards in each deck</li>
		<li>54 Non-foil cards from the main set in each deck</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>4 Non-foil double-sided tokens</li>
	<li>2&nbsp;<em>MTG Arena</em>&nbsp;code cards (available in select regions)</li>
	<li>2 cardboard Deck boxes</li>
</ul><p>Featuring the famous clash between Cloud and Sephiroth as depicted in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, the Starter Kit contains everything two players need to jump into the action and learn how to play&nbsp;<em>MTG</em>. Let's chat briefly about each of the two 60-card decks, talking about what they do and how they serve as introductory decks.</p>

<h3>Red-White Cloud Deck</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-cloud.jpg?itok=s4sj0I_w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-cloud.jpg?itok=sf5219uL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Looking at this deck's feature card, Cloud, Planet's Champion, gives us a good sense of what this deck wants to do. As you can see from the image above, if Cloud is equipped he gains double-strike and indestructible, which is obviously extremely powerful. The other rares from the deck - as pictured above - also clue is into the fact that this is a deck that's all about attack, attack, attack.</p>

<p>Get your creatures loaded up with equipment and then swing for the fences! The deck plays extremely fast, and once new players understand the nuances of equipping artifacts to a creature, this deck runs pretty smoothly. So you must be wondering, with creatures and equipment so powerful, what hope does my opponent have against me?</p>

<p>haha</p>

<h3>Blue-Black Sephiroth Deck</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-sephiroth-deck.jpg?itok=YBL7Gmq3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-sephiroth-deck.jpg?itok=_b1IFgDt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If the Red-White deck is all about attacking with creatures armed to the teeth, the Blue-Black deck is all about having an answer for just about whatever your opponent throws your way! Led by Sephiroth, Planet's Heir, the Blue-Black deck does exactly what you'd think Blue-Black does. It draws you cards and slows down your opponent (Blue), and kills your opponent's creatures before they can cause a fuss (Black).</p>

<p>I really like Xande, Dark Mage (pictured above), because he and other creatures like him really want you to not be bashful about casting spells to gain card advantage. If the hurdle for new players with Red-White is understanding equipment, understanding the Stack is going to be a hurdle with this deck. Once you understand the difference between instant speed and sorcery speed spells, and how effects resolve, you'll be slicing your opponents to ribbons with lethal precision.</p>

<h2>Starter Kit Final Thoughts</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-two-decks.jpg?itok=DsqLQeFk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-two-decks.jpg?itok=7GVKHYzo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I'll admit, I've seen more beginner-friendly pre-constructed decks over the years (remember the glory days of those $15 Intro Decks??), but these are by no means too complicated to wrap your head around. In fact, many newcomers to the game may find themselves impressed by the depth of strategy on hand with <em>Magic</em>, I know I was the first time I sat down to play. The rulebook included here is also a great resource, and is one of the clearest presentations of the rules I've ever seen! So if you're new to the game, or want to get a friend into it <em>and&nbsp;</em>they like <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>&nbsp;- this is a phenomenal place to start!</p>

<p>Now let's jump into a more advanced option, the&nbsp;<em>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;Limit Break Commander Deck - also starring everyone's favorite SOLDIER, Cloud!</p>

<h2><em>Magic The Gathering&nbsp;</em><em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;Limit Break Commander Deck</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-limit-break-commander.jpg?itok=TgBnK_ba 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-limit-break-commander.jpg?itok=DirKbPzR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The&nbsp;<em>Magic the Gathering Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;Limit Break Commander Deck includes the following:</p>

<ul><li>1 Ready-to-play 100-card Commander deck&nbsp;
	<ul><li>1 Traditional foil face commander</li>
		<li>1 Traditional foil featured commander</li>
		<li>98 Non-foil cards</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>10 Double-sided tokens</li>
	<li>1 Collector Booster Sample Pack</li>
	<li>1 Reference card</li>
	<li>1 Deck box</li>
</ul><p>Already hard to get ahold of, and selling for around $120 USD at the time of this writing, the Limit Break Commander Deck is a serious piece of precon hardware. Just like the Starter Deck (but completely super-charged), this deck is focused around Cloud and equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-two-commanders.jpg?itok=8ai58A77 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-two-commanders.jpg?itok=d-r6A5qL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The deck comes with two potential commanders for you to field, but I think - as is usually the case - you won't get much traction out of Tifa without a fair bit of luck. But Cloud... good lord... what a card! And of course he's a huge target the second he hits the board, but the fact the Cloud has haste&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;lets you auto-attach an equipment to him when he comes in mitigates the fact that you'll be the target here.</p>

<p>I really love a Voltron approach to Commander (I&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;built a nasty little deck with that Secret Lair Wolverine) because I love to turn my creatures sideways. So, this really appeals to me. But what's nice about this deck is that unlike the&nbsp;<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/magic-the-gathering-fallout-commander-decklists" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>Scrappy Survivors</a> deck from a few years back that saw you focusing on overloading a single creature with tons of equipment, you get a lot of benefit out of spreading your equipment around! Sharing is caring, even in Midgar!</p>

<p>The other cards in the deck are - as you'd expect - a mixture of great creatures, beat-down equipment (plus some good evasion equipment - shoutout to the inclusion of Trailblazer's Boots), and a few key spells to get you out of a jam.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-artifacts.jpg?itok=7kySyqUY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-artifacts.jpg?itok=53wjqWk4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It's old hat now to comment on the power creep of pre-constructed decks, but I played this in my pod against some pretty heavy hitting decks and it held its own until everyone realized it was a real threat - and then I was crumpled.</p>

<p>The other&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;Commander decks also look pretty cool, and each have a big bold approach (<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/final-fantasy-commander-decklists" rel="nofollow">you can check out all the decklists here</a>), but I'm really drawn to this aggressive approach.</p>

<p>The commander deck also comes with a Collector Booster sampler pack, which contains two cards. With single Collector Booster packs selling for $100, this Collector Booster sampler was a fun way to get a tiny taste of the action (like a drop of water in the desert, but still).</p>

<p>The high price retailers are asking for this deck isn't just about chasing valuable cards inside - this deck is a heater! Holy smokes, it really sings - and when it gets grooving you really feel like a big threat at the table, swinging for absolutely silly amounts of damage. Cue the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;victory music - if you can get this for a good price, and you like playing aggressive-leaning midrange, grab it!</p>

In this build we've made some optimizations so the Siege mode can last longer.” Full details are in the patch notes below, as per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500576552635859479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege mode itself, alongside its exclusive cosmetic rewards, are free, but there are new paid cosmetics (White Scars Chapter Champion and Blood Angels Customisation Pack). Elsewhere, Space Marine 2 finally has Ray Traced Ambient Occlusion (RTAO) and DLSS 4 support (better upscale, multiframe generation in Nvidia settings for 50xx series cards) on PC, and there’s the introduction of the Thunder Hammer for the Bulwark class (which the developers added <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-devs-tear-up-the-rulebook-let-the-bulwark-class-use-a-thunder-hammer-only-because-we-think-it-will-be-very-cool">simply because they thought it was cool</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Saber has indicated, it’s working on a “very big” update for customisation that lets players reuse chapter champion armour parts on other classes (with lore accuracy, clipping and technical restrictions). It’s not in Patch 8, so perhaps we can expect it in Patch 9.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 White Scars and Blood Angels Cosmetics</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-sells-7-million-in-less-than-a-year-and-you-can-see-why-space-marine-3-was-confirmed-so-soon">Space Marine 2 has sold an impressive 7 million copies so far</a>. It’s done so well it “changes everything” for Saber, Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN soon after the game came out last September. It was also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game"><u>a big financial success for Warhammer 40,000 owner Games Workshop</u></a>.

But given the huge sales you can see why the project was greenlit so soon. "Space Marine 2 has proven to be a transformative game for Saber," Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive, said at the time. Still, Focus and Saber had to put out a statement reassuring players of its commitment to Space Marine 2, which is still working through its year one roadmap of content. Without spoiling the Space Marine 2 campaign, it strongly suggests a continuation (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3"><u>IGN has reported on the enemy faction we’ll probably see in Space Marine 3</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Space Marine 2 players are wondering what else is coming to the game. Patch 8 does not add any new weapons or Operations mode maps, so it seems the focus here is squarely on Siege. But Saber has confirmed new content is on the way, including a new class. Season 4 also includes a new game mode for PvP and a new Chaos enemy.

When overwhelmed, players may call reinforcements for assistance. Engage in intense battles across three distinctive sectors, each requiring strategic adaptation. Side objectives emerge during combat, providing essential resources used to summon elite Space Marines or a formidable Dreadnought, drastically shifting battlefield dynamics.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Battlefield</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle unfolds within a fortified Imperial stronghold on Kadaku, relentlessly attacked by endless waves of Tyranid and Thousand Sons enemies. The fortress has three rotating sectors: Defensive Positions, the Arsenal, and the Control Room. In each sector, you will face five waves of enemies before your squad advances to the next sector, ultimately cycling back to reinforce earlier positions.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Survival Against Waves</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Face increasingly challenging enemy waves, with direct assaults from Tyranids and cunning sabotage by Chaos forces. Brief (1 minute) intermissions between waves offer strategic opportunities, clearly indicated through UI notifications.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Side Objectives</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Dynamic tasks such as capturing strategic points or retrieving Data-slates from fallen allies deepen tactical gameplay and supply critical resources essential for continued survival.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Shop and Reinforcements</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Earn Siege Mode resources through successful combat and Side Objective completion. You can spend these resources at the fortress Shop. You can:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Buy ammunition, medicae stimms, equipment, armour boosts, guardian relic (these items have the same exact behaviour as in Operations Mode).</li><li>Summon specialized Space Marines providing targeted support and bonuses. Each player can have only one summoned Space Marine.</li><li>Deploy Cadian Troopers to provide additional firepower. </li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><u><em>Note about reinforcements changes from the PTS</em></u>: guardsmen are now cheaper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">4. Collectively pool your resources to unleash the devastating power of a Dreadnought.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Boss Encounters</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Every fifth wave introduces formidable boss battles, occasionally facing multiple elite foes simultaneously. Triumph in these encounters to progress to new fortress sectors.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Infinite Waves</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If your resolve endures through fifteen brutal waves, prepare for endless combat of increasing difficulty, reduced resources, and shorter preparation times. Even the Primarch of the Ultramarines understands that ultimate victory here is unlikely — but your bravery will echo through the halls of eternity.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><em>Note about timer changes from PTS:</em></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The biggest criticism regarding Siege mode from the community was the wave timer limit. It exists only for technical reasons. In this build we've made some optimizations so the Siege mode can last longer.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Timer got reworked, instead of having a limited timer per wave that can get to a very short time on higher waves, there is a timer for the entire session and each time you beat a wave the timer increases.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We've also adjusted the difficulty curve of infinite waves so enemies will get stronger faster after the 15th wave. These changes will make players die in fair combat rather than due to the timer. Also, with some optimizations coming down later we think we can get rid of the timer entirely.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added an option to disable bots spawn in Private Mode</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Perfect if you’re looking for a challenge.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>RTAO experimental feature added — enables in in-game video settings</li><li>DLSS 4  — better upscale, multiframe generation in NVIDIA settings for 50xx series cards.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Season Pass Content</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added White Scars Chapter Champion. </li><li>Added White Scars Chapter Weapon Skin Pack. </li><li>Added White Scars Chapter Customisation Pack. </li><li>Added Blood Angels Customisation Pack.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">GAMEPLAY AND BALANCING TWEAKS</h3><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Extended Weapon arsenal in PvE</strong> </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added Thunder Hammer for Bulwark. Picking this weapon won’t allow you to use the Storm Shield.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We are adding this option only because we think it will be very cool and it's a shame that only 1 class can use the Thunder Hammer. We are not done with Bulwark, more interesting gameplay things are to come.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>New Finishers for Bulwark</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Adding new finishers for Bulwark with shield — 1 for Hormagaunt and 1 for Tzaangor.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Terminus Update for Absolute Difficulty</strong> </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>A second Terminus can now appear during a mission.</li><li>Carnifex, Neurothrope and Helbrute HP increased by 33% on Absolute difficulty.</li><li>Level specific Terminus enemies (with the exception of the Hierophant Bio-Titan) HP increased by 66% on Absolute difficulty.</li><li>Additional enemy packs will appear upon Terminus enemies spawn and again when their HP is reduced to 50%</li><li>These additional packs are now slightly more challenging featuring more Extremis enemies</li><li>Mission with final bosses can now also spawn Terminus enemies (previously, missions like “Decapitation” didn't allow any Terminus spawns)".</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This change is made according to the community poll that we made a while ago. We think that Absolute difficulty wasn't that hard to begin with and now with a slight power creep of constant weapons buffs, perk buffs and prestige perks the situation is much worse.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>After doing multiple test we have scrapped the idea of having 2 Terminus enemies in Operations mode at the same time (except in Siege mode), because this meant that you would have to encounter them all of the time, otherwise one run with dual terminus spawns would be much harder than a run with 2 Terminus enemies spawning one by one. We are increasing the health of the Terminus enemies on Absolute difficulty because they often can die before even dealing any damage. While this may seem like it goes against poll results, keep in mind that if we had 2 Terminus enemies, that would effectively be +100%  hp buff. Also we are nerfing Neurothrope base hp across all difficulty levels so its hp pool won’t become a problem for melee classes.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Instead we've tried to make Terminus spawns harder and more intense. We are going to continue to monitor how Absolute Difficulty is, and make necessary tweaks.</em></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prestige Perks Class Update</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Bulwark Prestige Perks Update</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>“Rally Point”: The perk has been reworked.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-endgame-gets-better-dune-awakening-vastly-expands-pve-portion-of-the-deep-desert-in-its-new-public-test-server.1228863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> now has a public test client, which offers players an early peak at upcoming changes coming to the game. One of these is a substantial change to the endgame Deep Desert - a vast expansion to the shielded PvE section.</p>
<p>Right now in the live game, the shielded PvE areas of the mostly-PvP dominated Deep Desert covers zones A and B. However in the Public Test Client version of the game, this has been pushed far out into the sands, covering zones A through half of E.</p>
<p>This comes in reaction to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">community-uproar around the Deep Desert</a>, as a substantial chunk of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-changes-next-update">game's huge playerbase</a>. In response, Funcom ceded ground on its original vision, with creative director Joel Bylos stating: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-studio-is-adding-partial-warfare-endgame-zones-to-address-pve-player-woes">Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system [they] have no interest in</a>."</p>

<p>What this means for the dynamic of the Deep Desert is all of the highest tier resources will still be found in PvP-flagged areas, valuable goodies like titanium and stravidium, will still be risky to farm. However PvE players will now be able to venture out into the Deep Desert, farm large spice blows, and explore a selection of challenging bio labs and crashed ships without worrying about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">swarms of enemy ornithopters</a>.</p>
<p>The spirit of PvP still remains strong in the Deep Desert however, especially where the Landsraad is concerned. House control points, a way of winning the weekly Landsraad, are always PvP zones in the Public Test Client.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-worms-its-way-past-one-million-sales-funcoms-best-performing-game-to-date">Funcom's biggest release in its history</a>, has proven popular yet divisive in its later hours. The developers have also stated they intend to release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">more substantial PvE maps to give those ardent anti-PvPers something to do</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-deep-desert-pve-expansion]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Following a tumultuous year for workers at the French studio</p>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>French studio Don't Nod have laid off workers across multiple departments. The full number is unconfirmed, but multiple affected staff have posted about <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adnanriaz9.bsky.social/post/3lshv5ffj6c22/quotes">their departures on LinkedIn</a>, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a> principal cinematic artist Mary Pouliot, technical artist Laurent Dufrense, and QA lead Sandra Cormier.</p>
<p>It's been a rocky year or so for Don't Nod's staff. Last September, the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-nod-pause-two-game-projects-and-refocus-others-following-jusant-and-banishers-sales-disappointment">paused two unannounced games</a> and said they're altering others, also unannounced, to be more appealing to a "wider audience", following warnings about an 11% decline in operating revenue for the first half of 2024. Chairman and CEO Oskar Guilbert attributed this to (the excellent) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jusant">Jusant</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden">Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden</a> performing "well below expectations" commercially.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Back in February of the same year, French union STJV alleged mismanagement at Don't Nod, including "contradictory" directions, shifting deadlines, and "no long-term vision" for staff welfare (cheers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-union-report-alleges-mismanagement-at-life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod">Eurogamer</a>). Following September's statements from Guilbert, the STJV published another statement of their own, accusing Don't Nod of creating "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leadership-at-dont-nod-are-creating-an-atmosphere-of-extreme-violence-with-planned-layoffs-says-french-game-workers-union">an atmosphere of extreme violence</a>” with planned layoffs and mistreatment of staff.</p>
<p>(I figure it's worth nothing here, re: the perhaps contentious use of the term "violence" that a.) French works differently to English and b.) the damage caused by extreme stress brought about from job precarity can obviously be genuinely physically harmful. Living under the protective shroud of being one degree of removal and deniability from the most literal definition of violence is how some of the worst people on the planet continue to be allowed to show their horrible little faces in public, after all.)</p>
<p>Sorry about that, had brief <em>commie flush</em>. Must be the weather. Ahem. "Jusant’s developers were left in the dark about their future, many without any work to do, for over 2 months", said the STJV at the time, saying that around 29% of the Paris studio's workforce could be at risk of losing their jobs. This coincided with another statement from Guilbert saying Don't Nod would be undergoing a "reorganisation project". Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-nod-announces-layoffs-that-could-impact-up-to-69-workers">an IGN report</a>, Don't Nod announced they were expecting to lay off employees at this time.</p>
<p>The numbers get a little bit hard to track from that point. In a <a href="https://www.actusnews.com/en/dontnod/pr/2025/04/08/don_t-nod-provides-an-update-on-its-strategy-implementation-to-adapt-to-new-market-conditions">strategy document</a> from April of this year, Don't Nod said that "ultimately, 59 job cuts are planned, including 12 departures that have not been replaced since the announcement". Last month, STJV <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/05/looking-back-on-the-fight-against-layoffs-at-dont-nods/">announced</a> that they'd "secured 23 voluntary redundancies for job categories not threatened by the plan, in order to save as many colleagues from being fired", as well as securing severance and strike pay. "Instead of the 69 layoffs initially planned, there were 46 voluntary departures and 1 layoff," STJV write (Thanks, <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/543386/article/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-studio-dont-nod-montreal-has-2nd-round-of-layoffs-after-union-intervened-the-1st-time/">Gameranx</a>).</p>
<p>Which brings us to the current round of layoffs. The STJV have yet to comment publicly. I've reached out to them, as well as Don't Nod to confirm the number of layoffs at the studio, and I'll update this if and when I know. Best of luck to all affected. Again, Jusant was bloody brilliant.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-developers-dont-nod-hit-with-more-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Jack Black will be reprising his role as playable skater Officer Dick in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>. In addition, Black will also be playing Dick's English equivalent, Constable Richard, on the upcoming skater's release.</p>
<p>Officer Dick first popped up as a secret skater back in 1999, with the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>. The character then appeared in the following two sequels, before he showed up again in the 2020 remake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a>, with Black providing vocals.</p>
<p>The Dick we already know is back once again, and will be a playable skater when Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 releases next month. "Richard Ennvee was mocked by other skaters and called a 'poser'. Overtaken by the need for revenge, Dick vowed to one day become what those skaters feared most - the long arm of the law," reads Dick's character bio. </p>

<p>"So we really loved Jack Black's inclusion in the previous iteration ['Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2']. He played a character called Officer Dick, and in the school maps, he was this school security guard who would yell at the skater and try and run them off the grounds," game director Kurt Tillmanns told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/jack-black-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-officer-dick-1236440201/">Variety</a>.</p>
<p>"We just thought that was a really fun, interesting character and kept in this tradition of the celebrity cameo in a Tony Hawk game. We wanted to carry that forward; we were really thankful we reached out to him and he was down to to come back, but we wanted to tell a little bit more of the Officer Dick story."</p>
<p>You can check out a trailer showing both Dick and Richard (who seems to share Black's penchant for kicking his leg up high) in skating action above. Yes, that is Black's English accent you can hear.</p>

<figure><a title="dying light retouched skipping switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/44af56b96e174/dying-light-retouched-skipping-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Techland</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dying_light_definitive_edition">Dying Light</a> is one of those absolutely huge games that just shouldn't really work on a Switch. It's way too big, it's way too pretty, and it's way too action-packed. Or at least that's what we thought, until Techland served us up a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/dying-light-platinum-edition">solid port of its excellent zombie survival epic</a> that ran just fine on Nintendo's dinky little machine. The wizards!</p>
<p>Now, however, it seems as though we may not be getting treated to any more magic, for the time-being at least, from this particular Polish dev. Yes, as detailed on <a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/news/ten-years-later-still-going-strong-dying-light-retouched-update-releasing-june-26">Techland's official blog</a> (thank you, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-1-gets-free-audio-and-visual-enhancements-this-week-but-they-wont-be-coming-to-switch">Eurogamer</a>), the Switch version of Dying Light will be skipping the brand new 'Retouched' update that's bringing a bunch of audio and visual slickness to versions on other, more powerful hardware.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067oirhkj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>As disappointing as this is at first blush, the details of the upgrade do make it fairly clear that the Switch doesn't make the cut for the sort of graphical advancements being discussed here (8k ultra-detailed shadows, anyone?). Indeed everything being added here is to take advantage of next-gen machines, so we guess fans who are Switch-only players will have to make do with they've got in the vanilla release.</p>
<p>Further to all of this, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-retouched-update-isnt-coming-to-nintendo-switch-as-techland-denies-plans-for-switch-2-port">IGN also reached out to Techland</a> and were told the following with regards to Nintendo's consoles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When it comes to a Switch 2 port of the original Dying Light: We have no plans at this moment...We're currently fully focused on delivering Dying Light: The Beast on August 22, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. We have no news to share about Nintendo Switch 2 at this time.”</p>

<p>So, it really does seem as though, for now, the Switch family of consoles is being left out of the vision for Dying Light going forward. Guess it's gonna be replay the original or check out one of the other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-zombie-games-on-nintendo-switch">fantastic zombie games on Switch instead...</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Credible reports from Bloomberg and The Verge earlier this week <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-is-reportedly-planning-another-major-xbox-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> another imminent big round of Xbox layoffs. These layoffs are supposed to be part of a wider Microsoft restructuring, and according to The Verge, some Xbox operations will actually cease in select regions.</p>
<p>Today, George Broussard, co-founder of Apogee Software (now 3D Realms) and one of the creators of Duke Nukem, <a href="https://x.com/georgebsocial/status/1938051752223232193" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> whispers from within the industry that the layoffs could remove as many as 2K employees. This would be around 10% of the workforce if we consider Activision and Bethesda as part of the Xbox teams, which is likely the case. The companies will most likely be affected anyway, as they were in the previous rounds of layoffs. Even more worrying is the rumor that studio closures could happen, too.</p>
<p>The first big round of cuts happened in January 2023, when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-slashing-10k-jobs-bethesda-the-coaltion-343-industries-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slashed</a> around ten thousand jobs, although that was across all its divisions and not just in gaming. The cuts involved Bethesda, The Coalition, and 343 Industries, among others. One year later, just a few months after the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed</a> another 1900 employees between the Xbox and ABK teams, amounting to around 8% of its gaming workforce. That also caused the cancellation of Project Odyssey, a survival game in development at Activision based on a new fantasy IP.</p>
<p>In May 2024, Xbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a> Arkane Austin (the development team behind Prey and Redfall, Tango Gameworks (The Evil Within, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and Hi-Fi Rush), Alpha Dog Games (The Mighty Doom), and Roundhouse Studios. Thankfully, Tango Gameworks was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revived</a> a few months later by KRAFTON and brought with it the Hi-Fi Rush franchise.</p>
<p>With Microsoft's financial quarter set to end on June 30, the announcement isn't far off and may come by the end of this week. Stay tuned to get all the official details as they come.</p>

            <p>Boy, that escalated quickly. Less than a day after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>'s PvE patch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-first-major-patch-has-entered-public-testing-so-you-can-give-some-deep-desert-pve-a-go">went into public testing</a>, changes that turn the "entire southern half" of the Deep Desert into a PvE area have been hotfixed into the full game.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-deep-desert-is-getting-partial-warfare-pve-areas-so-you-can-gather-endgame-resources-without-being-pvped-to-death">promised change</a> arrives alongside the first of the scout ornithopter balancing tweaks Funcom talked about in their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">recent AMA</a>, and a couple of other fixes. However, there's a bunch of stuff put into testing yesterday which hasn't yet made the jump to public release.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in the notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546739082808525243?l=english">hotfix 1.1.0.17</a>, the biggest thing it does is change the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-enter-deep-desert">Deep Desert</a> so that the entire southern half of it is made up of PvE areas - a pretty hefty scaling back of the PvP zones it comprised on release. This is in line with what creative director Joel Bylos said in a recent post addressing PvE and PvP concerns.</p>
<p>To ensure the area retains plenty of "Risk vs Reward" for competitive players, the PvP-filled northern part of it contains the densest deposits of valuable resources, the largest spice fields, and most of the control points.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The servers are now coming back online and patch notes for 1.1.0.17 are available.<br>We have some changes following the message from our Creative Director in this one!<a href="https://t.co/mPZhBBgNq7">https://t.co/mPZhBBgNq7</a><br>Remember to restart your Steam client if the download does not appear! <a href="https://t.co/1WP0uBv2mk">pic.twitter.com/1WP0uBv2mk</a></p>— Dune: Awakening (@DuneAwakening) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuneAwakening/status/1938151078337376594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Funcom have made some further balancing tweaks in light of the change, writing: "The lower half of the Deep Desert now offers PvE loot that is balanced toward shared loot and PvE activities. You may find better loot in the more dangerous PvP area located further north on the map. In the PvE area, for example, each player gets their own loot and can expect to receive one schematic. In the PvP area, loot is distributed on a 'first come, first served' basis, with higher quantities of everything. Players can expect to find 2–6 schematics there, which are among the rarest."</p>
<p>If you want to max out the number of schemactics you grab each week, you'll also need to visit Imperial Testing Stations in both PvE and PvP areas. If you're a bit taken aback by how quickly these changes have jumped from testing into the full game, like some players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lkui75/11017_patch_notes/">Reddit</a> and Discord, Funcom have made clear they'll make further adjustments based on player feedback if needs be. By putting these changes live for everyone, they're bound to get plenty.</p>
<p>Outside of that, the devs have started making tweaks to balance Ornithopters with this hotfix. Equipping a rocket launcher to your bird will now slow it down by 20% if it's a Scout Ornithopter, and 10% if it's an Assault one.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how this pretty huge shift in DA's endgame area plays out. It's proven pretty polarising so far, so it'll be interesting to see whether folks come around to it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-devs-arent-waiting-the-deep-deserts-huge-new-pve-area-has-already-been-patched-into-the-full-game]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"Square collapsed" after Hironobu Sakaguchi left the company, said Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, adding the "situation at Square was awful after he quit".</p>
<p>Final Fantasy series creator Sakaguchi joined Uematsu on the podcast Nobiyo To Isshoni earlier this month where they discussed their time together at Square working on the series in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>Sakaguchi resigned in 2001, before officially leaving Square in 2003 along with other key members of the company, ahead of its merger with rival Enix that same year.</p>

<p>"Square collapsed after Sakaguchi left," said Uematsu on the podcast (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-collapsed-after-he-left-final-fantasy-composer-on-how-hironobu-sakaguchis-innate-leadership-skills-held-the-company-together/">Automaton</a>). "To put it simply - he is the big boss. Always has been and always will be."</p>
<p>Uematsu described Square in its formative years as more like a club of university students than a serious company, but Sakaguchi was "able to manage the work even in that kind of environment".</p>
<p>He added: "We didn't even have a proper corporate organisation, yet everybody listened to him. It's a kind of quality you just have to be born with." Uematsu called Sakaguchi "a leader" - he may have been bossy and strict, but he was able to attract the people around him.</p>
<p>Uematsu continued: "Maybe Sakaguchi isn't aware of this, but the situation at Square was awful after he quit.</p>
<p>"He left and the organisation suddenly collapsed. I thought to myself 'Oh no, I should get away from here'."</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>After directing the first five Final Fantasy games, Sakaguchi moved to a producer role for subsequent games in the series. His final game at Square was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-x-2">Final Fantasy X-2</a>, for which he was executive producer.</p>
<p>Famously, his final years at Square were spent creating the Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within CGI film, which was deemed a financial failure. In 2004 he established his independent studio Mistwalker, which has since released a number of excellent RPGs with a cult following.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-final-fantasy-creator-hironobu-sakaguchis-past-present-and-future-can-be-found-in-fantasian">Sakaguchi discussed with Eurogamer how his most recent game, Fantasian Neo Dimension, is fuelled by nostalgia</a> for his past work.</p>
<p>Though there have been successes in the Final Fantasy series since Sakaguchi's departure - namely MMORPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> - the series has struggled to match the 90s golden era Sakaguchi oversaw.</p>
<p>As for Uematsu, he left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> in 2004, but has since frequently composed pieces for the Final Fantasy series. Last year, he confirmed he would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-composer-uematsu-returning-for-remake-trilogy-finale">returning for the third part of the Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy</a> with a main theme.</p>
<p>As such, he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-isnt-retiring-from-video-game-music">not retiring from video game music</a> as some had feared, but admitted he is "going to cut back a bit" on video game music work because "the time commitment for composing would be too long".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/square-collapsed-after-final-fantasy-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-left-says-composer-nobuo-uematsu]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Digital Extremes and Team17 have released a big update for Worms Armageddon Anniversary Edition, porting a whole host of classic Worms game experiences into the modern remaster and console release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition | Backworms Compatible Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Soa8O7CQokg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What’s particularly curious about how they’ve done this is that, rather than taking the PC release of each Worms Armageddon predecessor, they’ve instead gone with a bunch of console ports and adaptations, taking them from the 16-bit and 32-bit platforms of yore.</p>
<p>The three retro revamps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worms (Super NES)</li>
<li>Worms (Genesis/Mega Drive)</li>
<li>Worms World Party (Game Boy Advance)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then again, the game already included a playable version of the Game Boy Color version of Worms Armageddon, so going down the console and handheld path isn’t that outlandish, and these will make for some fun curios to explore.</p>

<p>Another nice touch is the community requested ‘Boggy B’ cheat code, which allows you to just toggle all unlockable content on via the Options Menu.</p>
<p>Having come out all the way back in 1999, Worms Armageddon is still considered by many Worms fans to be the high point of the series and it quite impressively still clings onto a daily player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/217200/charts/">a few hundred people on Steam</a>. It’s continued to outshine the potentially better for online play Worms World Party, which had a remaster a few years ago, and level pegs with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/22/worms-wmd-review/">Worms WMD</a>, which is also a fine take on the classic 2D form that is somehow already 8 years old!</p>
<p>Launching last September, Anniversary Edition took the PC game and gives it the once over with modern improvements and touches to work on console – the game still has periodic updates on PC <a href="https://www.tus-wa.com/forums/announcements/worms-armageddon-v3-8-1-released-33051/">as recently as 2022</a>.</p>

The company previously worked on the original Death Stranding, so it seems likely its services were retained relatively early.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Pictures staff members who worked on Death Stranding 2 include a motion capture director, numerous motion capture editors, motion capture coordinators, and a motion capture advisor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the acquisition, Nintendo Pictures has otherwise focused entirely on projects from its namesake, including Super Mario Bros.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has received another update, which along with some general fixes also makes changes to courses selected in Random during an online VS Race.</p>
<p>While the update notes for Ver. 1.1.2, as it is known, simply state the Mario Kart World team has "adjusted courses selected in 'Random' when selecting next course in a wireless 'VS Race'", there is more to it than it may first appear.</p>

<p>Prior to this update going live, if a player selected Randon during course selection while racing online, it would always result in a more traditional three lap race, rather than Mario Kart World's community dubbed "intermission tracks". These are the tracks that essentially run in one long and almost linear layout, and connect Mario Kart World's, well, world.</p>
<p>Now, however, these intermission tracks have been added to the online Random fray, which means playing Mario Kart World in a more 'traditional' way with consistent three-lapped courses is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Some online are rather unhappy with this development. "Nintendo has basically stepped in and said 'no, you're supposed to play this way'," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-updates-mario-kart-worlds-online-removes-the-only-guaranteed-way-to-play-normal-3-lap-races-with-randoms.1228638/">reads one comment on ResetEra</a>. "They saw players clamoring for a more traditional online mode and did... the exact opposite of what they wanted."</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2</a> update 1.5 is out now, the patch, which has been branded as the ‘Guns and Looting Patch’, bringing new weapons, new gameplay features and official mod support.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Guns &amp; Looting Showcase | Patch 1.5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yR2DDPJHHcg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting a the top, there are two new weapons included in the patch, with a new sniper rifle and a new pistol:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Three-Line Rifle:</strong> A lightweight, bolt-action sniper rifle with impressive range and precision. Ideal for sharpshooters, this rifle has quickly become a favorite among veterans of the Zone. Encounter it early in your journey and test your aim against distant threats.</li>
<li><strong>Kora Pistol:</strong> A heavy-hitting, clunky pistol that sacrifices speed for raw power. Each shot from its limited magazine packs a punch, making it a must-have for stalkers who value impactful firepower. Seek out the rare Night Stalker variant, a unique Kora coveted by weapon collectors.</li>
</ul>
<p>A further enhancement for patch 1.5 is Mutant Parts Trading. When you defeat bloodsuckers, fleshes, and other mutants, they now drop various parts like eyes, tusks and tentacles, which are apparently quite valuable and can be traded to NPCs for coupons. First you must visit Malachite to learn how to harvest them in a tradable condition, though.</p>

<p>Beyond that, patch 1.5 has a bunch of quality of life and system improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further A-Life improvements:
<ul>
<li>Life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player’s view.<wbr></li>
<li>Characters continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end.<wbr></li>
<li>The player can meet the same stalkers after some time.<wbr></li>
<li>Players may encounter more A-Life characters resting or interacting in various locations, adding to the world’s immersion.<wbr></li>
<li>Characters will no longer respawn directly in front of the player. When the player clears the mutants’ lair, for example, those mutants won’t simply reappear moments later.<wbr></li>
<li>A-Life Director will no longer respawn characters at the edge of visualization. Instead, respawn moved further away from the player, while maintaining the Zone’s population.<wbr></li>
<li>Visualization range is slightly increased. Characters now appear in visualization range with relevant animations and equipped weapons. This reduces the “pop-in” effect and contributes to a more seamless character visualization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Electric Water Tornado anomaly.</li>
<li>New vehicle models scattered across the terrain.</li>
<li>Expanded stash window size for better inventory management.</li>
<li>Distinct icons for each ammo type, making identification effortless.</li>
<li>Reload renewal, allowing Skif to seamlessly resume interrupted reloads.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, full and official mod support has arrived in the form of The Zone Kit. Available on the Epic Games Store, this allows players to reshape the Zone and tweak gameplay to their heart’s content. Mods can then be shared via mod.io and Steam Workshop.</p>
<p>It allows for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify or create new animations, weapons, mechanics, and anomalies.</li>
<li>Adjust gameplay to suit your preferences, whether you’re seeking more challenge, less difficulty, or something entirely new.</li>
<li>Share creations effortlessly via mod.io or Steam Workshop, depending on the platform.</li>
<li>Future updates will add even more functionality to the Zone Kit, ensuring endless creative possibilities. This marks Phase One of the mod support launch, so stay tuned for future updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>A very healthy update already, even in short, but the full patch notes high level patch notes for STALKER 2 Patch 1.5 are also available – <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/news/patch-1-5">more detailed and granular patch notes are available here</a>.</p>
<p>Looking back on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2 review</a>, Miguel said, “STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</p>

<p>Let's have a World Party!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Team17 and Digital Eclipse have unleashed the latest update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/worms_armageddon_anniversary_edition">Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</a> on the Switch, adding three additional retro games to the title.</p>
<p>So not only can you play <strong>Worms Armageddon</strong> and its charming Game Boy Color counterpart, but you now also have access to the SNES version of <strong>Worms</strong>, the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive version, and <strong>Worms World Party</strong> for the GBA.</p>
<p>Granted, there are still a boatload of Worms games to cover, but what was originally a neat little throwback to a single entry in the franchise is slowly morphing into a wider celebration of creator Andy Davidson's remarkably addictive series.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>In addition to the extra games, a ‘Boggy B’ cheat code has been added based on community feedback, and basically unlocks all content in the game immediately. Get in! This is also toggleable in the main menu, for the sake of convenience.</p>
<p>We reviewed Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition last year and called it "another slam dunk for Digital Eclipse and its ongoing mission of game preservation and historical documentation". It received a well-deserved score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition">9/10</a>.</p>
<p>For now, let's remind ourselves of the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Re-live 1999 with this faithful rendition of Worms™ Armageddon. With all the hilarious fun and madness you know and love.</p>
<p>- New Display features to suit modern hardware.</p>
<p>- An interactive documentary about Worms Armageddon alongside a museum timeline charting the history of the series.</p>
<p>- Also included is a fully playable version of the game released for Gameboy Color.</p>
<p>- Use over 55 classically weird and wonderful weapons and tools including Earthquake, Freeze and French Sheep Strike.</p>
<p>- Play single-player Deathmatch plus an exciting 40+ mission campaign</p>
<p>- Over 30 custom and comedy sound banks (including stiff upper lip, Cyberworms and more).</p>
<p>- Beloved features from the multi-player mode: Handicapping (add or deduct energy for a team), Allied Teams (team up with others to target another player), ‘Worms Disease’, Home Runs and many, many more.</p>

            <p>
Kindly Father Internet has dispensed a few new details for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-expanse-osiris-reborn">The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</a>, Rogue Trader developer Owlcat’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rogue-trader-devs-owlcat-are-making-an-expanse-rpg-with-mass-effect-style-combat">recently announced</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> adaptation of the sci-fi book and TV series. It sounds like it’s operating within the fine tradition of spin-off stories that are always a step behind or a room across from the live action celebrities.</p>
<p>I refer to games like The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age, in which the noble human ranger Alsogorn, the stout dwarven warrior Simarli, the shieldmaiden Eowynnish and the other members of the Followship of the Ring pitch in with Gandalf, Faramir and co in scenes that might have been lifted from Petey Jackson's cutting room floor. Except that turning the Balrog bridge fight into a five-way Final Fantasy slapfest is just naff.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Osiris Reborn will hopefully not be naff, going by Owlcat’s prior work in the party-based RPG space, and in light of the game’s admittedly target-footagesque announcement trailer. It takes place in parallel to the first two seasons of the Expanse TV show, and gives you a new set of characters. Things kick off on Eros Station, an asteroid city that takes a turn for the Eventfully Horizontal in the original James S.A. Corey books. The infamous protomolecule makes an appearance, as do corpo shitlords Protogen, and you'll hear a lot about the doings of a certain James Holden and the crew of the Rocinante.

<p>
"You will be seeing with your own eyes the repercussions of Holden's actions, all the situations like The Canterbury, and how it affects people in the belt, people in the inner planets," observes creative director Alexander Mishulin in a chat with <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-will-take-cues-from-mass-effect-souls-games-and-more/">CNET</a>. "You will be having your own adventure with your own goals, choices, consequences in the same universe [with] all the major events unfolding in this universe alongside your story." 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> aside, Mishulin says that the storytelling is “similar” to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a> in how your party members develop over the course of the tale. Crew members who don’t join your three-person away missions won’t twiddle their thumbs in your absence – they can go on jaunts elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
As for the other kind of character development, making numbers go up and down, “the RPG system is very open, allowing you to build whatever character you like”. There are no classes, which may come as a relief to those of us racked and corroded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>’s cyclopean skilltrees. Seemingly, there is a stronger emphasis on how weapons shape your approach than in previous Owlcat RPGs, though that’s me peering between the lines of the CNET piece. Gadgets include a visor that lets you identify foes through smoke and cover, which isn’t too mindblowing, but definitely helpful. 
</p>
<p>
The game courts the same “hard sci-fi” feel as the show, including the "feeling of the physics and how it should be" in outer space. The protomolecule in the ointment is that while you’ll get your own, lightly customisable ship and be able to fly around in it, they’re won’t be any ship-to-ship combat. No emergency deceleration manoeuvrers, no intricate missile tactics. I guess I’ll have to get my fill of that in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nebulous-fleet-command">Nebulous: Fleet Command</a>.

                <p>Later this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a> will take players to a distant colony world called Arcadi, where they can shoot their way out of trouble with a new assortment of weapons. According to the game's director, Brandon Adler, Obsidian Entertainment knew the sequel needed to be a significant improvement over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-review-over-the-moon/1900-6417345/" data-ref-id="1900-6417345">The Outer Worlds</a>. To achieve that goal, the team turned to the developers of Halo for advice.</p><p>"We ... talked to the Halo folks," Adler tells <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/25/the-outer-worlds-2-the-most-expensive-xbox-game-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a>. "They gave us a huge list of stuff and said, 'You guys should target this… you should add that to your weapon configurations.'" Adler also says that Obsidian "did a full breakdown on Destiny, because we love how that [gunplay] felt.'"</p><p>Adler notes that the sequel doesn't have loading screens before entering buildings like its predecessor, and the weapons have been revamped with fresh options and customizable features.</p><p>"We didn't want small changes," continues Adler. "Every weapon feels very different; every weapon has a cool, unique purpose. You can even take those weapons and add mods on to them to do all kinds of crazy things."</p><p>One of the other changes in the sequel is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-lets-players-choose-between-first-and-third-person/1100-6532273/" data-ref-id="1100-6532273">players can swap from first-person to third-person at will</a>, and decide how they want to experience the game. The Outer Worlds 2 also has the distinction of being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-releases-in-october/1100-6532242/" data-ref-id="1100-6532242">the first $80 game for Xbox Series X|S</a>. In a previous interview, Adler said that Obsidian didn't set the price for the game and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/outer-worlds-2-director-reacts-to-80-price-says-take-it-up-with-microsoft/1100-6532390/" data-ref-id="1100-6532390">suggested that players should take it up with Microsoft</a> if they have a problem with it.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 will hit Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on October 29.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3677" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532295 - The Outer Worlds 2 preorders" data-collection="" title="6532295 - The Outer Worlds 2 preorders">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">The Outer Worlds 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$80 | Releases October 29</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 standard edition includes the base game on your platform of choice.

                <p>Late last year, Epic Games filed a lawsuit against a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> player named Sebastian Araujo alleging that he used cheating software on multiple occasions during tournament play that allowed him to beat players who followed the game's rules. Now, Epic has announced that the court has made a summary judgment in its favor, in part because Araujo never responded to the lawsuit.</p><p>Epic shared the news on social media and noted that the judgment was for $175,000. Additionally, Araujo has been banned from Fortnite for life. Epic also stated that it plans to donate any money it collects to <a href="https://childsplaycharity.org/site/index" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Child's Play</a>, a charity that provides sick children in hospitals with toys and games to keep their spirits raised and encourage healing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/FNCompetitive/status/1937966876790751232" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">THIS JUST IN: The Judge ruled in our favor after the cheater ignored our lawsuit. The player is required to pay $175,000 and we’ll donate what we collect to charity. They are also banned from playing Fortnite forever. <a href="https://t.co/on0dYWBdq4" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/on0dYWBdq4</a></p>  — Fortnite Competitive (@FNCompetitive) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNCompetitive/status/1937966876790751232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>This outcome shouldn't be too surprising, as Epic has aggressively gone after cheaters as well unscrupulous players who sell cheating programs. In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-defeats-fortnite-cheater-in-court-donates-settlement-to-charity/1100-6503270/" data-ref-id="1100-6503270">Epic won a sizable amount from an Australian Fortnite cheat maker</a> and donated the settlement to Child's Play. Earlier this year, Epic took action against pro Fortnite player Morgan Bamford aka RepulseGod and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-shows-why-cheaters-never-prosper-after-epic-successfully-sues-pro-player/1100-6529540/" data-ref-id="1100-6529540">banned them from ever taking part in the game's organized tournaments again</a>. Bamford subsequently apologized and returned the prize money to Epic, which once again donated the total to Child's Play.</p><p>Cheaters aren't the only ones who have to fear Epic's legal reprisals. The publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-sues-fortnite-qa-tester-who-leaked-battle-roy/1100-6460042/" data-ref-id="1100-6460042">sued a game tester in 2018</a> for leaking Battle Royale Season 4 details. Even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-sues-fortnite-streamers-for-advertising-cheat/1100-6462540/" data-ref-id="1100-6462540">streamers who touted Fortnite cheats on their live-streams</a> haven't been immune from Epic's wrath. Earlier this month,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-is-suing-fortnite-cheat-makers-and-distributors/1100-6532371/" data-ref-id="1100-6532371"> Epic took a cheat maker and several associates</a> who distributed the software to court in a new lawsuit. The outcome of that case is yet to be decided.</p>

			<p>With the launch of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, we’re being assaulted by a barrage of new peripherals to go alongside it. Turtle Beach, never one to miss an opportunity to sell the odd headset or two, have seen fit to launch an all-new version of the Airlite Fit, previously a PDP product but now brought under the welcoming branches of the palm tree-toting brand.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Airlite Fit" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ucyy5jaW_-A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a budget headset. At £27.99 – and available for as low as £19.99 – the Airlite Fit is seriously affordable, and while it’s likely aimed at the younger gamers in your household, with its original Switch blue and red livery, older gamers will find that this is a comfortable and surprisingly great-sounding headset.</p>


<p>I’ve been putting the Airlite Fit through its paces with the Switch 2, and as a 3.5mm wired headset, I’ve been able to pair it with the new Switch 2 Pro Controller. It’s an ideal match, and you’ll find that there’s heaps of volume to drown out any external sounds, despite the Airlite Fit’s relatively weak passive noise cancellation.</p>
<p>The Airlite Fit lives up to its name by being exceedingly light. That’s thanks to the plastics used in the build, from the earcups through to the headband. There’s a serious amount of flex to the headset, and I worried about the sturdiness at first without any metal running through the centre. I didn’t need to worry, though, as you can twist it into all sorts of worrying shapes before it returns to its original shape. I don’t think it’s going to last as long as some headsets out there, but it’s solid enough to survive through regular play.</p>


<p>There’s then memory foam padding in the headband, and in the earpads, covered by soft jersey knit fabric, which helps to keep comfort levels good throughout extended play. The Airlite Fit does a decent job at this price point, but if you’re used to the finer things in life, or just a headset that’s a step or two up the price scale, then you’ll likely notice the slightly harsher plastics and fabric more keenly.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing about the Airlite Fit is just how good they sound. Outfitted with well-tuned 40mm drivers, there’s a lot of Turtle Beach’s trademark bombast to the audio output, giving every encounter a huge amount of drama thanks to the enhanced bass. It doesn’t come at the cost of the top end though, and they outpace some far more expensive headsets and headphones.</p>
<p>Whether that’s been testing out massive RPG hits like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-is-an-amazing-experience-on-switch-2-but-its-not-perfect/">Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma</a> or the new Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/hogwarts-legacy-on-switch-2-is-a-transfigurational-new-port/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, or diving into multiplayer in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/18/street-fighter-6-year-12-fighters-edition-is-a-great-port-on-the-wrong-hardware/">Street Fighter 6</a>, gaming sounds great with the Airlite Fit in tow, and there’s a lot to be said for the ease of plugging in a wired headset, and using its single volume wheel control.</p>

<p>That continues into other media, and listening to music, especially rock, metal and rap, really benefit from the tuning of the Airlite Fit. There’s not quite the detail you’ll find in more expensive or specialised headsets, but there’s drama and depth, with tracks like Bad Omen’s The Death of Peace of Mind, or Fort Minor’s Where’d You Go sounding absolutely great.</p>
<p>Thanks to its recent update, I’ve played a heap of Splatoon 3, with the added bonus of Switch 2’s onboard Gamechat functionality finally bringing Nintendo fully into the modern multiplayer age. The noise-cancelling mic is another high point for the Airlite Fit, with a flip-to-mute adjustable mic arm that sits exactly where you put it, with loads of adjustability. If you don’t want to use it, it sits well out of the way, but it’s exactly where you need it when it’s time to shout at your friends.</p>

<p>As we reported just a little while ago, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/everybodys-golf-hot-shots-brings-the-par-tee-to-switch-this-september">Everybody's Golf will be swinging onto Nintendo Switch</a> this September 5th in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hotshots</a>.</p>
<p>Following on from the reveal of the official release date, Bandai Namco has now dropped a juicy video showing almost five whole minutes of gameplay. You can check out the trailer above, and we have to say, it's all looking pretty much as expected for a series that certainly has its own unique thing going on.</p>
<p>Here's some delicious PR deets from Bandai Namco to tell us even more!</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Tons of Customization</strong> - Customize stats, clubs and balls to match every character’s play style</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The Largest Roster</strong> – With a series-leading 25+ playable characters available, build up character loyalty to unlock new shots, including spin shots, homing shots and character-specific special shots.</em></li>

<li><em><strong>Challenge Mode</strong> Join tournaments in solo play to fight to the top! Unlock more characters, scenarios and even bigger tournaments to become the ultimate golfer.</em></li>

<li><em><strong>Wacky Golf</strong> – This brand new mode brings chaos to the course with obstacles, challenges, and more in either solo or multiplayer mode, including Colorful, Scramble, Survival Golf and Dokkan Golf modes.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, Everybody's Golf Hotshots has raised a few eyebrows lately after its Steam page disclosed the minor detail that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/hot-shots-golf-fans-fume-at-use-of-generative-ai-in-ps5-revival">some of its background foliage is created using generative AI</a>, which is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/smash-bros-director-sakurai-laments-unsustainable-aaa-game-dev-discusses-ai-and-uncertainty">certainly a hot topic of debate at the moment</a> (and not a good look, in all honesty),so it's up to you to decide where the line is drawn on that particular aspect of this one.</p>
<p>One thing we don't get any news on here, unfortunately, is whether or not we can expect any kind of Switch 2 version, but perhaps that's something for further down the line. We'll keep you posted!</p>
