			<p>Today, publisher Deep Silver and developer Dambuster Studios have announced that Dead Island 2 has broken through the 20 million player milestone. This comes after the game immediately turned into <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-sales-exceed-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep Silver's best-ever launch</a>, with two million units sold in less than two months. Later, the player base expanded even more thanks to the launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Game Pass</a>, and more recently, it was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">given away for free</a> during the Epic Games Store 2025 MEGA Sale. Both promotions inevitably greatly helped inflate the player figures.</p>



<p>Still, today, the publisher-developer duo also confirmed that a new franchise entry is already in development. As teased by the image, it will likely take place elsewhere, abandoning the Los Angeles setting for somewhere else.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 was released in April 2023 after a very troubled development. It changed hands not once but twice; the original project was being handled by Yager (Spec Ops: The Line, The Cycle) and was scheduled to launch in Q2 2015. However, that year, Deep Silver announced it had decided to change the development studio. In 2016, that studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-developed-uk-studio-sumo-digital/">was confirmed to be Sumo Digital</a>.</p>



<p>That didn't pan out, either. Three and a half years later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-acquires-gunfire-games-milestone-new-saints-row-game-in-development-while-dead-island-2-changes-studio-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was put into the hands of the internal team Dambuster Studios</a>. That was just a few months before the pandemic, which would inevitably delay the project (as it did for literally everything) even further. After all this ruckus, Dambuster's game inevitably raised some eyebrows when it approached the launch window. However, it proved everyone wrong by delivering a solid and fun core experience.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Francesco De Meo rated Dead Island 2 7.5 out of 10:</p>



<p><em>Games that go through development hell hardly turn out great, but Dambuster Studio proved with Dead Island 2 that this is not always the case, although the game is far from a masterpiece. While the gameplay works and feels quite fun at the start of the game, things become repetitive very quickly due to the linearity of the experience and the shallowness of the combat system. Offering nothing more than some mindless fun, the game would have been more than fine if launched at a lower price, but at full price, Dead Island 2 doesn't offer that much to justify it.</em></p>

    <p><span>Star Wars-inspired expansion dated.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The <em><a title="Games > Destiny 2 [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>: Renegades</em> expansion will launch on December 2, <a title="Companies > Bungie [229 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/bungie">Bungie</a> announced. Additionally, the latest <em>Destiny 2</em> update, “Ash &amp; Iron,” is available today. <span id="more-990781"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em></strong></p><p>Inspired by the legendary <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy, “Renegades” merges <em>Destiny</em>‘s distinctive storytelling and gameplay with themes and elements drawn from the iconic science-fiction franchise. As the next chapter in <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s <a title="Series > Fate [69 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a> Saga, Guardians will experience becoming part of a crew of underdogs rising to challenge a powerful Cabal faction, the Barant Imperium, whom Drifter suspects have a connection to the Nine. Defying the Vanguard, Guardians will pursue Drifter and join a cast of new and returning characters as they navigate a world of shadow to build influence and power.</p><p>During today’s livestream, a newly released ViDoc “Infiltrating the Lawless Frontier” showcased new content arriving with “Renegades.” Highlights include the new Lawless Frontier game mode, new characters, and a new social hub, Tharsis Outpost. Players will unlock upgradeable Renegade abilities unique to Lawless Frontier, earn new weapons and gear, and build reputation with shady Syndicate factions through the Notoriety system to expand their arsenal. Renegades also introduces a new weapon archetype, the Blaster, inspired by <em>Star Wars</em> and built for <em>Destiny 2</em>. These energy-based weapons draw ammo directly from your reserves and feature a unique heat management system.</p><p>In the Lawless Frontier, Guardians will take on high-risk, high-reward jobs to complete contracts—smuggling, bounty hunting, and sabotage—either solo or with a fireteam. These missions span three planets and six maps inspired by iconic Star Wars locations. One feature, Invasion, allows players to opt in for additional challenges and rewards by enabling other Guardians to invade the battlefield. This introduces a layer of strategic unpredictability, where greater risk yields greater rewards.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_990782"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition</strong></p><p>The Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition is now available and includes both “The Edge of Fate” and “Renegades” campaigns, The Desert Perpetual raid, and an upcoming new dungeon. Pre-ordering “Renegades” through this edition instantly unlocks exclusive rewards: the Renegade Leader Exotic ship, the Starside Introduction emblem, the Exotic Sniper Rifle New Land Beyond with its ornament and catalyst, the Dark Side Legends bundle, the Enneachord Exotic Sparrow, and more. Players who already own the Renegades Standard Edition or the Year of Prophecy Standard Edition can upgrade to the Ultimate Edition, which grants access to all exclusive content and rewards included in the Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition. <em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em> launches on December 2, 2025.</p><p><strong>Ash &amp; Iron Update</strong></p><p>Today marks the launch of the first major update in the Year of Prophecy, available to all players. “Ash &amp; Iron” brings Guardians back to the Plaguelands for the first time since the original Destiny to investigate Maya Sundaresh’s experiments. Players will earn exciting new rewards by battling through Reclaim, a new three-player Fireteam Ops activity where Guardians hunt for Golden Age tech and complete evolving objectives against Vex and Cabal forces in a race against time.</p><p>The Rewards Pass for The Edge of Fate has also been refreshed, offering 110 ranks of additional rewards for all players, including a brand-new Strand Exotic Pulse Rifle, an armor ornament set, a Legendary shader, and more.</p><p>On September 27, the Epic raid for The Desert Perpetual will launch with new challenges and rewards for players to chase, offering a fresh twist to Destiny 2’s latest raid. Players who complete The Desert Perpetual Epic raid will unlock a new Bungie Rewards for purchase to be revealed at a later date.</p><p>Additionally, a new Exotic mission is coming on October 7, where players will confront Maya Sundaresh’s Vex and Cabal forces, uncovering new secrets unfolding within an old Warmind bunker.</p><p><strong>Festival of the Lost</strong></p><p><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s annual Festival of the Lost event makes its return on October 21, bringing along a host of new weapon holofoils and masks for Guardians to don as they collect candy and pursue ghoulish rewards. Closing out the first major update with Ash &amp; Iron is the new Call to Arms event from November 11 until December 1, available to all players. Call to Arms invites players to go head-to-head across several Portal activities, complete their Seasonal gear collection, earn exclusive cosmetics, and more.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new set of trailers and an archive of today’s live stream below.

The new iPhones will come in five different colors: lavender, mist blue, black, white, and sage.</p><p>The new phones support 120Hz ProMotion and a larger 6.3" display, which Apple said will be beneficial for gaming.

However, far from just an engine port, Skyblivion has been described by the TESRenewal mod development team as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-devs-make-its-case-in-light-of-oblivion-remastered-its-a-full-scale-remake/1100-6533675/" data-ref-id="1100-6533675">"a full-scale remake" of Oblivion</a>, one that features new areas, dungeons, music, gameplay enhancements, item changes, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">In a lengthy statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/Keyecomposer/status/1961922524700151893" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> on August 30, former Skyblivion level designer Dee Keyes aired a list of grievances against those in charge of the mod's development, stating the 2025 release date first announced in 2023 was a "massive mistake" and that the project was "never in the state that the videos would show off."</p><p dir="ltr">According to Keyes, the team did what he described as "fake" polish on parts of the game featured in the trailers, but it became clear that the team was "never gonna be allowed" to achieve that same level of polish across the entire project. He said voicing concerns to those in charge fell on deaf ears, and that those came from a place of realism rather than pessimism.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are unpaid and part time: This would be a massive undertaking for a paid dev team and yet every attempt we make to beg them to postpone we are ignored," Keyes said. "It's a sad time when even passion projects are getting rushed and have devs crunching."</p><p dir="ltr">Keyes finished his statement by comparing Skyblivion to Game of Thrones' infamous Season 8, stating two lead developers, one of them being project lead Rebelzize, are "forcing it out the door before it's finished despite everyone else on the team looking to do their best."</p><p dir="ltr">While the Skyblivion team has not addressed Keyes' concerns directly, communications lead Evan Flatt said on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyblivion/comments/1n4iqne/comment/nbly5os/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> in response to a concerned fan that the project is still aiming to release this year.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've made it clear our goal is to release this year; that being said, there is still work we need to finish," Flatt said. "Ultimately, Skyblivion will be released when the team is confident with it--our goal has been to have it ready to release this year.</p><p dir="ltr">"Now, what is 'ready?' That is an ongoing conversation we have been having because the nature of a fan-made passion project is that there has to eventually be a cut-off of adding cool new things. Right now, we all agree Skyblivion isn't ready (otherwise we would release it today). Our aim is that it will be by the end of the year, if we as a team decide that it isn't we will be sure to share that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ATiEK31Tqo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7ATiEK31Tqo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The latest development diary video, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-BqXk2WA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"The Final Stretch Towards Release"</a>, looked to make a case for the mod's existence in light of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">official Oblivion Remastered</a> releasing in April, emphasizing how the mod "reimagines Oblivion from the ground up, bringing it in line with modern RPG standards." The team most recently released a video spotlighting the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ATiEK31Tqo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first 15 minutes of Skyblivion</a>, once again describing it as an Oblivion remake. The trailer was uploaded a day after Keyes' statement.</p><p dir="ltr">In the video's description, Rebelzize said Skyblivion development has been an "uphill battle."</p><p dir="ltr">"This last leg of development has sometimes been harder than the totality of our previous years combined," Rebelzize said. "The team is not quitting until we have a game for you all to play and neither am I."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion, when it does arrive, will be free to download for those who own Skyrim: Special Edition and Oblivion: GOTY Deluxe on PC.</p>

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's latest DLC expansion, Legacy of the Forge, is now out across all platforms, alongside a new patch for the game from Warhorse Studios, <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/news/patch-14">Update 1.4</a>, which includes several quality of life changes, balancing tweaks, and, of course, bug fixes.</p>



<p>The DLC's release also came with a new trailer, showcasing a bit more of the new storyline that players will be able to delve and forge their own path into. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II - Legacy of the Forge DLC Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4820STHsRCE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The new DLC sees Henry join the Kuttenberg Blacksmith Guild, following in his adoptive father's footsteps by not only taking up smithing, but by attempting to complete what his adoptive father, Martin, could not. Fix the town's broken astronomical clock.</p>



<p>As Henry embarks on the journey to fix the clock and repair his adoptive father's legacy, he brings Martin's colleagues back together to get the job done. Along the way, the forge becomes a new home for players and for Henry, as you're able to decorate and build out your workshop, living quarters, and nearly every inch of the forge to your liking. </p>



<p>The expansion adds at least 15 more hours of game time for players who've rinsed everything else that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has to offer. While Update 1.4 adds a few welcomed balance tweaks, like halbreds being "<em>twice as durable</em>" now, and increased quality for the Trollbane hammer.</p>



<p>If you've purchased the Gold Edition of the game or the Expansion Pass, then all you need to do is update Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 to start playing the DLC. Otherwise, you'll have to grab it separately for £11.49.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jump-ship">Jump Space</a>! It's a game with a name that'll have you thinking, "wait, that's not what it was called, was it?" And you'd be right about that, as due to some trademark problems, the game was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506209223025108363">rebranded</a> from Jump Ship to its new name Jump Space back in August. Later that same month, developer Keepsake Games announced the game would be launching into early access September 19th. And now, as in today September 9th now, Keepsake Games have shared an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506212394141221550">early access roadmap</a> for the game, as well as how much it'll cost you.
</p>
<p>
Right, let's get the pricing out of the way. It'll be a pretty reasonable $19.99 / £16.75 / €19.50, making it the latest anticipated September release to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-wont-cost-nearly-as-much-as-they-could-probably-charge-for-it">priced in a way that'll have you wondering why they're not charging more</a>. On to the roadmap!
</p>
<p>
At launch, the sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> will include nine mission types. These include one where you'll try not to kick the bucket while fending off a bunch of robots, where you have to hunt for loot, and another where you'll be raiding some baddies' bases. There'll be more than 50 sectors to play in four galaxy regions, and you'll have two ships to choose from with 26 ship components to make them a bit more custom.
</p>
<p>
That's all a part of Chapter 1, The Resistance Coalition. Chapter 2: Atira Strikes back will bring a lot more to the game like multiple endless modes, sector modifiers, melee weapons, more story and sectors, new enemies, mission types, a photo mode, offline support and a lot more. These will be coming through multiple updates through to Q1, 2026, but a couple of features from this chapter, text chat and lobby browser, will be available at launch.
</p><p>
Then after that, Chapter 3: Secrets of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/telmari">Telmari</a> will add in a first-person pilot view, a scanner revamp, even more new enemies and mission types, a new ship, ground boss, and again, even more. These will start to be added from Q1 2026 onwards until Chapter 4: Heart of Corruption, which doesn't have a release window or any revealed features just yet. That's a lot of bloody stuff!
</p>
<p>
As of now, Keepsake doesn't know when early access will end and the 1.0 release will release, so you'll just have to join them for the ride in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
Jump Space launches into early access September 19th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/">Steam</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2%E2%80%99s-most-visually-impressive-port-just-got-better.1292892/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> recently landed on Nintendo Switch 2, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-assassins-creed-shadows-framerate-2000621760">despite some initial fears</a> that it would look and run terribly, the game is a bit of a technical marvel and easily the most impressive Switch 2 port yet. And now, a new update has improved this already wonderful-looking open-world action game on Nintendo’s hybrid console. Plus, a demo is coming, too.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123">Ubisoft and Massive’s open-world <em>Star Wars: Outlaws </em></a>was an incredibly gorgeous game when it launched last year. Sure, stealth sections could be annoying and combat could feel a bit stiff, but getting to walk around a perfectly recreated section of the<em> Star Wars</em> universe freely was amazing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-patch-stealth-speeder-softlock-1851665149">And some later updates improved the game a lot</a>, introducing some visual improvements on top of some significant gameplay tweaks.&nbsp; So I wasn’t sure what to expect when I booted up <em>Outlaws</em> on a Switch 2. Turns out, Ubisoft Red Lynx, who ported the game, did an amazing job. While it’s capped at 30FPS and lacks some of the higher-fidelity assets from the bigger console ports, this version of <em>Outlaws</em> is extremely playable, looks sharp, and feels great in handheld mode. <a href="https://youtu.be/XlKCBGzrB1I">As explained by Digital Foundry, it’s truly an extraordinary port.</a> Now, Ubisoft has made it look even better with the game’s first Switch 2 update.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/5d48mFSwXrfRnDvvBmOl7F/nintendo-switch-2-title-update-1">On September 8, Ubisoft put out a patch for <em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> on Switch 2</a> that features numerous visual improvements. Players should now see less “pop in,” less flickering smoke, better shadows, nicer-looking leaves, and a host of other “small visual fixes.” For a game that already felt like it was pushing the Switch 2’s hardware to its limits, I’m impressed by Ubisoft cranking the knob a bit more to eke out an even nicer-looking port.</p> <p>Oh, and if you want to see the game in action on your Switch 2 without buying it, good news: <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1kKhQ1Heps7YmSJdFiV87L/switch-2-release-faq">Ubisoft has updated the game’s FAQ page</a> to confirm that a demo for <em>Outlaws</em> is coming. Ubisoft says it will “share more information soon” about this upcoming demo.&nbsp; Anyway, here’s the full patch list for the new <em>Outlaws</em> update on Switch 2.</p> <p><strong>General Gameplay</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed several issues where NPCs would not spawn, e.g. when chasing Kay during the ‘Crashed’ quest on Toshara</li> <li>Reduced likelihood of Kay being stuck when traversing the environment</li> <li>Improved hiding and detection when in tall grass on Akiva</li> <li>Various stability improvements and other minor fixes</li> </ul> <p><strong>Graphics</strong></p> <ul> <li>Improvements made to visual quality when moving quickly through the world or using binoculars, with less “pop in”</li> <li>Reduced flickering with smoke and lighting</li> <li>Improved shadows at the edge of the screen when moving in cities and stations</li> <li>Improved quality of leaves, cloth and other things that let light through</li> <li>Various other small visual fixes and improvements</li> </ul> <p><strong>Camera</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed camera movement when traversing certain objects in certain ways with Kay</li> </ul> <p><strong>UI</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed controller image types and directional button prompts when switching between Joy-Con and Pro Controller</li> <li>Fixed the gadget inventory HUD not resizing when using the handheld preset custom scaling settings</li> </ul> <p><strong>Wild Card Story Pack</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue where NPCs would not be highlighted when using Nix to plant a card</li> </ul> <p><strong>A Pirate’s Fortune Story Pack</strong></p> <ul> <li>Mynocks are now visible when attached to your ship</li> </ul>

<p>There are a couple of notable additions and changes here, including a new 'pixel perfect' scaling option, and a revamp of the icon for the Switch home menu. Let's be honest, it wasn't exactly the most inspiring design before, now was it?</p>
<p>It's been confirmed that more patches will be released going forward, but this is certainly a good start, hm?</p>
<p>Let's check out the patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Icon changed<br>
- Optimizations to address slowdown (more planned)<br>
- Pixel perfect scaling option added<br>
- Button swapping added<br>
- Addressed crash when copying Empty Profile<br>
- Global language setting now saves properly</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="fP9LUp_ViPU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fP9LUp_ViPU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fP9LUp_ViPU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fP9LUp_ViPU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f7b22nkltou&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP9LUp_ViPU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I thought it had been rather quiet round these parts lately. It turns out it's been several months since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a> creator Hideki Kamiya had a tantrum about anything on social media. What are you steamed up about today, Kamiya-san? Ah, of course, Hideo Kojima. Specifically, Kojima's long-lost horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pt">P.T.</a> - a collaboration with movie-maker Guillermo del Toro which Konami banished from PlayStation Network in 2015, after cancelling Kojima's associated Silent Hills project.</p><!--more-->
<p>That P.T. is one of the finest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a> ever made and also, no longer officially available online is one of the better arguments for the wholesale nuking of the games industry. Seriously, if this is how you're going to behave, Konami, let's tear it all down and put the cockroaches in charge. Norman Reedus wept like a seal the night you deleted the storepage. Fortunately, he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">found other work since</a>.</p>
<p>How does Kamiya propose to set the world to rights? By making his own new version of P.T., except that his version wouldn't be a horror game, because Kamiya hates horror, even though he directed the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>. Erm.</p>
<p>One inclines to suspect that this Hideki Kamiya man may not be entirely serious in the things that he says on yonder <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1963791553694220633">TwiX</a>. Here's the full quote, anyway, as translated and passed along by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-should-make-a-new-pt-style-game-or-maybe-i-will-says-bayonetta-and-devil-may-cry-creator-hideki-kamiya">IGN</a>. "[I]f it's impossible to resurrect P.T., Kojima should make a new game in the same style," Kamiya wrote, adding: "if Kojima doesn't do it, maybe I'll give it a go. I hate horror though, so it wouldn't be horror... plus, I have no ideas."</p><p>I'm propagating Kamiya's bullshit because it's an excuse to start a comments thread discussion about P.T. If you never played it, allow me to sum it up the same way I summed it up to some party guests back in 2014, after they had the insolence to defeat me at Scrabble: there is an L-shaped corridor, and all you have to do is exit through the other end. My guests left that night white-faced and falsetto, shortly after getting the initial radio puzzle wrong. That'll learn the bastards to pop a cheeky "Quoth" on a triple-word tile.</p>
<p>P.T. may be long gone, and also, never actually released on PC, but it has spawned many imitators. There are the fullscale fan clones knocked together in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/of-course-somebody-recreated-pt-in-vr-using-half-life-alyx">the Half-Life: Alyx engine</a> and, uh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pt-is-even-creepier-as-an-old-macintosh-game">Hypercard</a>, and also, chilly apartment tours like <a href="https://shop.redcandlegames.com/app/devotion">Devotion</a> that apply something of the same claustrophobia.</p>
<p>Swivelling back to Kamiya in closing, the absolute best thing that can come of all this foolery is for Kojima to respond to Kamiya on Twitter, so that Kamiya can block him immediately. Kamiya does so love doing that.</p>
<p>Further reading: Philippa Warr's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horror-games-silent-hill-2">very old ruminations about trying to get into horror</a>. Fortunately for Pip, Alice O (also RPS in peace) found a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/qt-is-pt-but-cute-see-and-its-free">cute version of P.T. in 2019</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-car-cloud-gaming-lg-kia-2000624462</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98everything-is-an-xbox%E2%80%99-crusade-is-coming-for-your-car.1292856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft wants to turn your car <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-vr-game-pass-price-handheld-1851784984">into an Xbox, too</a>. Not content just to stream Game Pass to your TV, laptop, or smartphone, it’s also aiming to beam hits like <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> directly into your Kia Sportage. Microsoft and LG announced a new partnership on Tuesday to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to over 20 million internet-connected vehicles by 2030. Who’s ready to play <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> in the back of their Uber?</p> <p>“Our work with LG is the latest example of Xbox expanding to new places, building on partnerships that already bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to mobile devices, PCs, and TVs,” Xbox marketing VP Christopher Lee <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/09/xbox-cloud-gaming-vehicles-cars-lg/">said in a blog post</a>.&nbsp;“By adding vehicles to the mix, we’re giving players more choice than ever in how they enjoy their games.”</p>  <p>The initiative only pertains to EVs that support LG’s webOS Automotive Content Platform (ACP) which at this point is primarily Kia and mostly not in the U.S. But LG exec Eun Seok-hyun is promising there will be 20 million of these vehicles on the road&nbsp;<em>somewhere</em> in the next five years. Whether that includes the country where Microsoft is headquartered or not will depend on whether Congress ever revives the electric vehicle tax credit program it recently killed. Otherwise anyone who wants to make their car into an Xbox will have to do it <a href="https://xboxfreedom.com/xbox-360-game-car-installation-2265">the old-fashioned way</a>.</p> <p>Xbox’s recent pivot to being hardware-agnostic comes as it’s developing dedicated gaming OS layers for Windows on PC handhelds and bringing more of its exclusives to PS5 and Switch 2. It’s unclear if that will move the needle much on the overall growth of Game Pass, which hasn’t announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-game-pass-xbox-podcast-date-1851261824">new subscriber numbers in over a year</a>. This new campaign to turn cars into Xboxes comes just as Microsoft announces <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/774414/microsoft-return-to-office-policy-announcement">a mandatory return</a> to the office for all employees within a 50-mile radius of its Redmond campus. Now they’ll have something new to do while sitting in traffic, at least eventually.</p>

For much of my childhood, the back of a station wagon on the road between wherever the Navy stationed my old man. Then it was Florida. After I escaped, it was a small apartment in New York, then a slightly bigger apartment, and finally, a house. We tend to define ourselves by where we live at any given time, our memories of a time, of who we were, of the people who made those moments memorable, tied with a cord of steel to a specific place, for both good and ill. People fight for their homes. They rebuild after wars, famine, natural disasters. They preserve places, because those places are a part of us. What wouldn’t you do for your home, your community? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I haven’t played a ton of Octopath Traveler 0 yet, but from the jump I know the ideas of home and community were core to Square’s latest entry in the venerated HD-2D series. That’s probably because the first thing I did was build a house. Octopath Traveler 0 is a revenge story. See, your hometown of Wishvale was destroyed, and you’re (understandably) real mad about it, so you set out to get them who wronged you and restore Wishvale to its former glory. That means literally rebuilding the town, so that was the first thing I did.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Octopath Traveler 0 Nintendo Direct July 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Octopath Traveler 0’s townbuilding is honestly pretty neat. <em>[Editor's Note: We have since learned that the size of your town will have </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-platform-specs-reveal-town-size-limitations-on-some-devices">different limitations depending on which platform you're playing on</a><em>.]</em> I’m the kind of guy who spent a lot of his time in Age of Empires building beautiful cities, so it clicked with me immediately. You can build houses and other buildings of different design, assign who’s going to live where, make cobblestone paths, plant flowers and place benches, craft gardens to tend to, and find just the right place for storage crates to hold the lumber and other materials you’ll need to make stuff. There’s also trees, wells, chests, and all kinds of other things, and there’s plenty of freedom to make the town you want.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I appreciated the joy (and serenity) of building a neat little town.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But rebuilding Wishvale is only part of it. You can also do stuff in town, too, like cook food that you can use later and chat with the townspeople, and even upgrade the buildings for additional functionality. It’s pretty neat, and even though I only spent about ten or so minutes with it, I appreciated the joy (and serenity) of building a neat little town.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After that, it was time for a more traditional Octopath experience. My assigned protagonist, who is the only character that can change classes in Octopath Traveler 0, and seven of his closest buddies were in the sandy town of Sunshade looking for a merchant named Ludo. The long and short of it was that we needed a merchant to help us establish trade. After my buddy Phenn put his foot in his mouth and mistook Ludo for some random kid, which went about as well as you’d expect, he turned us down flat. Not because he was still mad, but because Wishvale had been destroyed before. Why do business with a town that couldn’t protect itself?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Ludo made us a deal: if we took out the pack of lizardmen that had been terrorizing the new trade route, he’d consider helping us out. With no other options before us and a love for our town as motivation, my merry band set out to do just that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was only one problem. As we made our way out of Sunshade, I saw a woman hanging out by herself. When I preview a game, I try to play it like I would if I were playing normally. And years of JRPG-playing have taught me that if you see someone, you should chat with them. So we sauntered on over. The woman in question asked to see my protagonist’s ring. A little weird, but okay. After admiring it, she asked if she could keep it. Uh oh. I knew where this was going, but there was no way out of it. I said no, and then she said she’d take it from us anyway. Cue fight.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/08/octo1-1757372112185.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is where I got my first glimpse of Octopath Traveler 0’s combat system. If you’re played the previous two Octopaths, you know how 0 works. Essentially, your job is to find out what attacks your opponent is weak against, use those to wear down their defenses until they break, and then use limited boosts to charge up your attacks and lay on the hurt while they’re vulnerable. It’s a good system, but 0 adds a couple of unique twists on top of that. First, like I said earlier, the protagonist is the only one who can change their class. Everyone else comes with their class, and it doesn’t change. Like Henry Ford said about the Model T, “you can have it in any color you want as long as it’s black.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The other big change is the ability to swap characters from your front to your back line at will. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The other big change is the ability to swap characters from your front to your back line at will. Characters in the back line can’t attack, but they regain health and skill points every turn. So if someone's taking a beating, it’s probably a good idea to swap them to the back line and let them catch their breath. This required more micromanaging on my part, but when I got the hang of it, it reminded me of getting into a groove when you’re bowling and everything you throw is a strike. You just <em>flow</em>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/08/octo2-1757372159854.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The other benefit of this system is that, because every character comes with their own boost charges, you have a lot more opportunities for big damage when you finally break someone’s defenses. That doesn’t mean it’s easy. I spent so long on the Woman Who Really Wanted My Ring that I was beginning to worry I wouldn’t have enough time to play the actual demo I’d been sent here to play. But eventually, she went down and I sprinted off to deal with the lizardmen, who were holed up in some nearby ruins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These fights went much more smoothly. After my would-be Ring Thief, a bunch of lizards who walk on two legs wasn’t that big of a deal. Through it all, I was impressed by how fast Octopath managed to feel without ever sacrificing how good its tactical gameplay feels. I was always making interesting decisions, even in more minor fights. And that battle theme had me vibing in my chair as I played.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/08/octo3-1757372256593.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Then I got to the Lizardmen Leader, who looked like he wandered in out of a Ray Harryhausen joint, and I was like, “Oh.” And man, that fight was tough. He had two minions, a ton of health, and he hit hard. But I stuck to what had gotten me to the dance. I found his weaknesses, exploited them, and when his defense was broken, I hit him with boosted attacks or a flashy Ultimate Technique. I wanted to pour it on as much as I could before he could shore up his defenses again. It wasn’t easy; several of my party members fell, and I had to use my items to bring them back, but he hit the floor just as my demo wrapped. Oh, and we earned the respect of Ludo, who followed up and stepped in to help when things looked bleak. Put one on the board for the good guys.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I put my controller down, I was really impressed with Octopath Traveler 0. Its combat feels like a step above its already excellent predecessors, it still has that gorgeous HD-2D look, and the soundtrack is fantastic based on what I’ve heard so far. All of those things are great, and I hope the whole game is as good as the little slice I got to sample, but honestly, the thing that stuck with me was Wishvale. Often, RPGs have enormous stakes. The fate of the world is on your shoulders. Here, I was just trying to rebuild my village and punish the people responsible for what happened to it. I like how much smaller that focus is, how much more intimate. Maybe it doesn’t stay that way. But as far as motivations go, fighting for your home is a good one, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t interested in rebuilding Wishvale when the time comes.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/in-octopath-traveler-0-revenge-is-a-dish-best-served-in-hd-2d]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Silksong's map dwarfs Hollow Knight in comparison.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you thought Hollow Knight's depths were vast, Hollow Knight: Silksong easily surpasses the original game. Team Cherry's long-awaited and highly anticipated sequel takes place in Pharloom, a new location that completely dwarfs the original in scope. We've visualized the difference and built a Silksong interactive map so you can explore it yourself at your own pace without getting completely lost.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Big is Silksong? Map Size Compared to Hollow Knight</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When you first dive into Silksong, its map might not feel much different from Hollow Knight's; both have many locations to discover and plenty of hidden areas and tunnels begging to be explored. But when you look closer, you realize just how dense Silksong is in comparison.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/09/silkmap-vs-hollowmap-1757424043958.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Silksong's map (left) vs. Hollow Knight's map (right)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight features around 15 distinct areas across the Hallownest. By comparison, Silksong's Pharloom features <strong>around 29 distinct areas</strong>, almost doubling the map size. When viewed at the same scale, as shown in our image above, Silksong's map (left) is clearly much denser and taller, with stacked vertical layers and endless sprawling passages and tunnels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More areas means more to do, meaning the larger world of Silksong brings a much longer playtime than Hollow Knight, over 200 enemies, and tougher bosses to defeat. Exploration feels much deeper too, with vertical paths that put your navigation (and jumping) skills to the test. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you enjoyed the sense of discovery in Hollow Knight, Pharloom promises even more out-of-the-way quests and plenty of secrets tucked into hidden corners, though this means it's easier to get lost in, especially when trying to track down collectibles or side quests.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Explore Pharloom With IGN's Silksong Interactive Map</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This is where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/hollow-knight-silksong/pharloom"><strong>IGN's Silksong interactive map</strong></a> comes in, an essential companion tool for any player looking to explore the world of Pharloom.

Finished a quest? Check it off. Unlocked a new Tool or Crest? Mark it as complete. The map automatically updates as you go and saves your progress, so you always know what's next on your adventure through Pharloom.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hollow Knight: Silksong Guides</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While our Silksong interactive map is an indisposable tool for your adventure, it can't answer every burning question you may have.

                <p>Pablo Sanchez fans, rejoice. After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-is-back-but-were-not-sure-exactly-how-yet/1100-6525954/" data-ref-id="1100-6525954">reviving the Backyard Sports name</a> and releasing three games in the quirky and cartoony series, publisher Playground Productions has launched Backyard Football '99 on Steam and mobile platforms. As with the original release, the football game stars a colorful cast of child athletes, along with younger versions of actual NFL legends.</p><p>Real-life players Barry Sanders, Dan Marino, Drew Bledsoe, Jerry Rice, John Elway, Randall Cunningham, and Steve Young are once again in the Backyard Football roster, though this modern remaster notably lacks Brett Favre. Developer Mega Cat Studios ended up replacing Favre with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2J9qBR1erE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original character Chase Downfield</a>, which marks the first time these remasters have introduced a new kid.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVqWQf22CCI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FVqWQf22CCI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While most of the kiddified professional football players are back, the game lacks any imagery or references to the NFL. The original 1999 release of Backyard Football let players use actual NFL team names, logos, and colors. Instead, players can form teams like the Labrador Receivers, the Dirty Socks, or the Ticklish Tornados. Interestingly, Backyard Baseball '01, which was released on Steam in July, includes MLB teams and references.</p><p>But despite being bereft of Brett Favre and any NFL iconography, Backyard Football '99 should still prove to be a familiar and nostalgic romp for those who played the original game on CD-ROM thanks to its faithful visuals and audio.</p><p>"Backyard Football ‘99 made me a football fan for life. From learning plays to managing teams, this game made football accessible, fun, and exciting for all ages," said CEO of Playground Productions Lindsay Barnett in a press release marking the remaster's release. "I am so proud to bring it back in time for football season."</p><p>Next up for Playground Productions and Backyard Sports are the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-continues-comeback-with-five-more-titles-on-the-way/1100-6527118/" data-ref-id="1100-6527118">re-releases of Backyard Basketball '01</a> and Backyard Hockey '02, though there are no announced release dates for either title yet.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the continued popularity of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, and how it's leaking out all over various forms of media and pop culture, every day, there's someone experiencing their first game of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. If no one in your group has played before there have been Starter Sets that are a decent place to start, but with the release of <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em>, there's now a <em>best</em> place to start.</p>

<h2>What's In The <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em> Box?</h2>

<p>Inside the <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em> Box a DM will be able to find:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Four Booklets: 1 for the basic rules (essentially taken from the<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="56eebec3-a321-4403-b71c-54e4edf91d0c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow"> 2024 DMG</a>), and three Adventure Booklets (One for the Keep, one for the Borderlands, and one for the Caves of Chaos)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Character sheets for Cleric, Rogue, Wizard, and Fighter from levels 1-3 (including two different sub-class options)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Game Cards for spells, equipment, magic items, NPCs, Monsters, and more</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Tokens to represent players, monsters, and unique terrain</li>
	<li aria-level="1">18 maps including overworld maps as well as battle and dungeon maps</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Handouts related to shopping locations and key NPC interactions</li>
	<li aria-level="1">A set of 11 dice (the core polyhedral set with one extra D20 and three extra D6)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">A pad of Combat Initiative Tracking sheets</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Four plastic ziplock sleeves (for keeping player cards together for extended games)</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-box-contents.jpg?itok=OmS9W7aD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-box-contents.jpg?itok=oXUKgPrA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I was blown away by just how much was in the box. Having learned to play D&amp;D myself with the Mines of Phandelver starter kit I was all too familiar with how much there can be to learn, how information can be spread all throughout the rules and adventure books, and trying to 'prepare' could have you pulling information from all over the place.</p>

<p>Splitting out all of the relevant information among cards, it creates a more component-heavy experience, but splits up the learning and the onus of having that knowledge among all of the players and doesn't just rely on the GM to take on everything.</p>

<p>The best way that I can think to describe it is that by making it more component-heavy, and tweaking things like the character sheet, they've 'board game-ified' Dungeons &amp; Dragons and created an experience that you could just pick up and run on a whim.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-cleric-character-sheet.jpg?itok=wYPSIAOj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-cleric-character-sheet.jpg?itok=DvUXByjZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Including monster and terrain tokens alongside maps feels like a more sensible approach to an official way to start playing as opposed to purchasing a Starter Set and then also picking up something like a Campaign Case. This feels like the evolved form of them all.</p>

<h2>Creating Your Character</h2>

<p>The character sheet for <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em> has been completely redesigned to be as beginner-friendly as possible and to work in conjunction with the card system that has been developed.</p>

<p>In front of the player, they'll be able to see each of their abilities and the modifying values (organized by stat and not alphabetically), stats such as speed, initiative, and HP, and their class features. To the right of their sheet, a player also has an indicated space for their species and background cards to be played.</p>

<p>Taking up the center of the card is space for players to place their equipment cards or stack up their spell cards. Within each of these spaces, you'll see recommendations for equipment as well as rules relevant to that space on your player board.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-character-sheet-wizard.jpg?itok=vqOBf1FD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-character-sheet-wizard.jpg?itok=2VlP8DEy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The last part of putting together your character is collecting the required health, ability, and gold tokens to have a visual representation of these components on your board. As a player, you likely won't ever need to pick up a pen to note something or keep track of your stats and abilities.</p>

<p>Placing your starting equipment on your player board, you can immediately understand the capabilities of your character, how to hit something or deal damage, how many uses you have of any ability, and understand how class features, species, and background can all work interchangeably.</p>

<p>Spellcasters have the added bonus of having cards for each of their spells. The back of each card features the full rules for a spell, while the front gives quick information such as the range and area of effect. For spells that call on a cone, or a magical effect in a range centered on the player, there's even a diagram showing you how it will work.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-spell-cards.jpg?itok=dfxh4IqQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-spell-cards.jpg?itok=fnnhyvBy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These spell cards have already been getting pulled out again for my regular home games</figcaption></figure><p>While there will be a learning curve, going from this sheet to a normal character sheet or a digital D&amp;D Beyond sheet, for a beginner with no prior knowledge, this character sheet is clear and approachable.</p>

<p>The only part of this character sheet that I can really fault is the health tokens. Gold, which is spent less frequently, makes the exchange of tokens fun, and the ability tokens moving off or returning to the board is easy enough, but swapping out HP tokens can be a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>I would have loved to have seen some kind of sliding tracker. Letting you move a HP token up and down your maximum health bar for the side of the character sheet you were on. It would have saved some time swapping out a 5hp token for 3hp tokens, only for the character to drink a potion and need more tokens again.</p>

<p>The new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Starter Set puts a party of four and their Dungeon Master in the Borderlands. This is an update of the setting from the 1979 <em>D&amp;D</em> adventure, <em>Keep on the Borderlands</em>. Time has moved on, and it's a good, setting-agnostic location to branch out and explore more of the world after getting comfortable with what's in the book.</p>

<p>In the Keep booklet, you'll have multiple locations for your party to visit in town. These can be roleplay locations, like the chapel or shops, to acquire new goods at. To further assist in shopping, you'll also find handouts for the different items on sale.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-adventure-and-rule-books.jpg?itok=vcFfK_nS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-adventure-and-rule-books.jpg?itok=d83b0jqy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each location has an NPC to meet and an odd job that they might be recruited for. These jobs will test not only players' roleplaying skills, but also prompt them for a variety of skill checks. While simple, these checks serve as a built-in tutorial for what you can do with your different abilities.</p>

<p>The Wilderness book provides you with some random travel encounters. These are a mix of combat and roleplay, and it's also where you'll find the combat tutorials for players. Easing them into gameplay with a combat encounter on the side of a road.</p>

<p>The final book is for a series of caves that each act as a mini-dungeon with a theme. It might be goblins, cultists, spiders, or really any other staple Dungeons &amp; Dragons monster that inhabits them. Each adventure is a short series of rooms with combat and exploration so it's easy to get in and out of with very little notice.</p>

<p>There is definitely a downside to not having a planned and structured adventure like the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a96fb387-895f-4837-9061-7bbd56e12239" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/phandelver-and-below-shattered-obelisk-review-not-quite-sure-what-it-wants-to-be" rel="nofollow"><em>Mines of Phandelver,</em></a> but the upside is that <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em> has more than enough content for planned mini-adventures and to teach all of the basics for a party to understand what kind of adventure they might be into before they set out on a larger adventure.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-tutorial-for-dm.jpg?itok=YEBOfBm0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-tutorial-for-dm.jpg?itok=7Z8LUYoZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Dungeon Master Assistance For First Timers</h2>

<p>For a new DM running a game can be a somewhat daunting task. There's a few ways that I think this Starter Set tackles things fantastically.</p>

<p>The first is in the separation of the information across quick to reference cards. You'll reach a new place at the Keep, or a new dungeon, and the book will inform you of exactly what NPC cards, monsters, etc you'll need. You can keep them to the side, all with their relevant information, and you never need to be flipping through a book or trying to determine what to do next.</p>

<p>The other way that these adventures make being a DM easy is by maintaining a bite-sized approach. There isn't any grand story that will take the party from level 1-5, but there's roleplay to perform at the Keep, random encounters to have in the Wilderness, and then a plethora of caves that act as multi-room dungeons.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-random-encounters.jpg?itok=ABgLUbRd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-random-encounters.jpg?itok=JjS5FUTq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Because each encounter or setting has only about a page worth of information no matter where the party goes you'll never need to read much to stay ahead of them.</p>

<p>This bite-sized information also means that each session can be ~2 hours without needing much prep time, and the role of DM can rotate around the table. You might have DM'd for Caves A and G, but that doesn't mean you know what's going on in Cave E when it's your turn to be a player.</p>



<p>This box set is absolutely the way anyone new should be getting into D&amp;D. The massive benefits that this has is a large number of bite-sized adventures, a unique approach to character creation and stat tracking that creates a more casual experience, and the lack of a need to do any major prep.</p>

<p>The only recommendation I'd make for players is organize a different way to track health so that you aren't worrying about moving a whole bunch of health tokens around.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-dungeon-exploration.jpg?itok=yyzrK5jw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-heroes-of-the-borderlands-review-dungeon-exploration.jpg?itok=GOAOBzaY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>By the nature of the shorter adventures and mini-dungeons you won't get the same sweeping narrative as you might in the other Starter Sets or full Adventure Books but by playing <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em> with your friends you'll be able to solve the basic questions of finding out who wants to be the longer term Dungeon Master, and what type of adventure/playstyle you're most interested in.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <em>Heroes of the Borderlands</em> opens <em>D&amp;D</em> up to being a casual game night endeavor where any group of up to five friends can casually create some characters, and run through a micro-dungeon with next to no prep necessary.</p>

<p>While the cost has increased compared to previous Starter Sets it's well worth it with so many tokens, reference cards, and maps that you can continue to use time and time again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frontier has announced the Sorcery Pack DLC for&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2</em>, promising hundreds of magical new scenery pieces, several new rides, and more for your park if you decide to pick it up.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the Sorcery Pack will add scenery pieces like castle spires, buttresses, gargoyle statues, and other sorcerous decorations, so if you want to give your park a mystical, magical angle, this is the DLC for you.</p>

<p>Two new coasters, the Outmax LSM Raid Coaster and Bike and Sidecar attractions, offer "adrenaline-pumping excitement" and "explosive acceleration" respectively, while the new Vector child coaster gives the kids something to do.</p>

<p>The Flying Theater is a new "immersive simulation experience" that gives your guests the chance to experience "truly soaring through the air", while Gale Force is a pendulum flat ride that will make your guests "feel every twist and tilt".</p>

Golly, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a bit hard, 'ey? I'm not here to feed into that discourse right now, you've probably seen enough of that on Bluesky and in the comments of YouTube videos about the top 10 things you missed in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>. No, instead I'm here to tell you that things could be much, much worse apparently, as it turns out an entire difficulty mode is hidden within the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> for you to unlock.
</p>
<p>
That might be music to the ears of those of you who are struggling a bit with the game (no judgement here, the game's tough). Unfortunately, this one isn't your tune, as the hidden difficulty mode actually makes the game harder, almost impossibly so. It's called Steel Soul mode, and the rules are pretty simple: "No reviving. Death is permanent." Great! Exactly what I want from a game where I've already died 10,000 times.
</p>
<p>
Unlocking the mode is, as discovered by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1n8d1xc/cheat_code_discovery_not_joke/">Reddit user Buttnugtaster</a> (no relation), monumentally easy compared to the rest of the game. All you have to do is head into the Extras menu, then input the following: up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right. You'll get a flash on the screen, and if you try to start a new save file you'll find Steel Soul as an option. I've checked this myself and it does work, and no, I did not start a new save. My experience of this mode will be entirely limited to watching someone inevitably attempt it at Games Done Quick.
</p>
<p>
While there is no easy mode in the game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/teamcherry">Team Cherry</a> did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-makes-some-early-bosses-slightly-easier-out-now-in-steam-and-gog-beta">outline an upcoming patch earlier today</a> that promises to make a few bits of the game like a couple of boss fights a smidge more forgiving. At least those of us who beat Moorwing already have bragging rights.
