            <p>
Just weeks after publicly releasing the Liberty City Preservation Project - an ambitious mod adding a playable version of Grand Theft Auto 4's map to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> - its developers have confirmed the project is being taken down following conversations with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Liberty City Preservation Project - which modding team World Travel has been working on since 2018 - generated significant interest when it launched earlier this month, giving GTA 5 players a chance to explore GTA 4 protagonist Niko Bellic's old stomping ground. It featured the entire Liberty City map -  complete with traffic, pedestrians, weather, and more - alongside improvements such as overhauled lighting, better textures, and new scenarios.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the mod's enthusiastic reception also set it on a collision course with Rockstar, and the Liberty City Preservation Project is now officially no more. As spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-liberty-city-preservation-project-shut-down/">Insider Gaming</a>, lead modder nkjellman announced its end on Discord, writing, "Due to the unexpected attention that our project received and after speaking with Rockstar Games, we have decided to take down the Liberty City Preservation project."

<p>
"We appreciate all the support the project has received," nkjellman continued, "and we look forward to continuing to pursue our passion for modding the Grand Theft Auto series."
</p>
<p>
Nkjellman didn't specify what had drawn Rockstar's ire, but the studio has frowned on similar mods before. Back in 2017, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ambitious-mod-project-to-put-liberty-city-in-gta5-canned">called time on the 'Liberty City in GTA5' mod</a>, saying that while it "generally [would] not take legal action against third-party projects involving Rockstar's PC games that are single-player, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property rights of third parties", it would not allow "use or importation of other IP", including its own. So it seems likely that's where the Liberty City Preservation Project has fallen foul of Rockstar's rules.
</p><p>
Perhaps notable, too, is the fact an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ambitious-mod-project-to-put-liberty-city-in-gta5-canned">official GTA 4 remaster</a> was reported to have been in the works back in 2022. At the time, the project was said to have been shelved due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">poor reception</a> of 2021's GTA: The Trilogy remasters - but the report also referenced a supposedly canned Red Dead Redemption remaster that did eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-ps4-and-nintendo-switch-later-this-month">show up in 2023</a>. It's possible Rockstar's rumoured GTA 4 remaster is also alive and well, which might have contributed to the Liberty City Preservation Project's swift slap-down. But regardless, 2025 is a massive year for the long-running series, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">currently expected to release this "autumn"</a>.

And some mods, like the Vice City mod, were taken down only for Rockstar themselves to announce remasters of those very games. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't to say Rockstar is working on a GTA 4 remaster, by any means, but there's certainly precedent.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/100t-valorants-boostio-says-nrg-cant-win-championships-with-fns/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>At the start of last year’s season, reigning VALORANT champion Kelden “Boostio” Pupello was one of several players to leave Evil Geniuses. In his first year with 100 Thieves, Boostio and the team won the first VCT Americas split, and barely missed out on Champions.</p>



<p>Ahead of his second season with 100T, Boostio took the time to talk to Insider Gaming. And rather than just talk about the upside of his own team, he also had something to say about a long-time rival.</p>



<hr>



<p>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</p>



<p><strong>Q: I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eg-coach-potter-says-yay-has-to-prove-hes-not-a-chamber-main/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke to your former coach Potter earlier</a></strong>. <strong>We talked about the importance of keeping a roster core together between seasons. From the in-game leader’s perspective, how important is it to you to have that familiarity between players already?</strong></p>



<p>It’s really important. It’s more important for the one or two people joining, because they’re going to be the ones out of comfort coming into our system. So when you keep a core, those players are going to be comfortable and [they] know what needs to happen in order to win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So for us four, we won split one [last year], we know how to win. When we were winning we were considered one of the best teams in the world; we were owning everyone. Since we kept the coach, IGL, and three other players, it makes it easier on us and the new player. We just need to execute like we did before.</p>



<p><strong>Q: How do you avoid replicating the slow start you had at Kickoff last year?</strong></p>



<p>[Smiles] Yeah I hope we don’t go 0-2. I hope we make Masters. This first tournament is so early on in the year, that anyone can really luck out, to be honest. I feel like a lot of teams could get lucky, like LOUD last year. They were clearly not a top team but they ended up making it to [Masters] Madrid.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption>Boaster has never shied away from talking trash. Photo by David Lee/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Q: Did <a href="https://x.com/Sentinels/status/1843418707244265495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bang’s departure</a> catch the rest of the team off guard?</strong></p>



<p>Me, bang, and Asuna all hang out in a Discord all the time, and we knew bang was leaving before the org knew or before the coach knew. When [Sentinels] contacted him, [since] he’s a younger kid and he doesn’t really know what he wants, he asked for advice. And so Peter and I told him: “Bro, go try out. You’re gonna get paid way more, you’re gonna be way more popular on Sentinels, go fucking do it. If you have to leave us, it sucks, but there’s no way you say no to that.”</p>



<p><strong>Q: It was a very light offseason for you guys with just one official series played at an event. With VCT less than a week away, how prepared do you feel you are, especially with the new agent now in play?</strong></p>



<p>I feel good. I think we are strong. Like I said, when we’re playing well, I think we’re the best team in the world, or [at least] one that can contend for a championship. And I think you have to be a pretty special team to even be in the argument to contend.</p>



<p>Like NRG, and this is clickbait but I fully believe it, are going to be a good team, probably. You have FNS on your team, and I think he’s the best NA IGL of all time, but with his mechanics, when you’re playing in championship matches, you’re not gonna win with someone like him on your team. It’s just not possible.</p>



<p>So for us, I think all five players are insane, if we just keep up mechanically like we normally are, which is better than a lot of teams, and keep our team play at a decently high level, we’ll just win.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/meta-quest-3s-failed-to-boost-holiday-demand-for-vr-in-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia analysis of Sensor Tower data reveals that the Meta Quest mobile companion app downloads fell on Christmas Day 2024 by 27% compared to 2023, despite the launch of the Meta Quest 3S in October. Priced from $300, the Quest 3S is a follow-up to the highly successful Quest 2. There was a palpable hope within the industry that it would reinvigorate VR hardware sales thanks to its attractive price (starting from $300), bundling the new </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Batman: Arkham Shadow</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game, and its enhanced passthrough mixed reality features.</span></p><p>Figure 1: Meta Quest mobile app downloads over the past six years</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Total 2024 app downloads grew slightly to 7.8 million, but this is still well below 2022’s record of 10.3 million (see Figure 1). December’s total downloads were down by 21% year-on-year. Even with an attractively priced bundle and good awareness for the brand, the Quest 3S struggled to attract new consumers, signaling broader challenges in the VR market (see: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/pr/2024/dec/reality-check-for-vr-omdia-forecasts-decline-as-apples-entry-fails-to-galvanize-market#:~:text=LONDON%252C%2520December%252012%252C%25202024%253A,line%2520with%2520Omdia's%2520earlier%2520projections.">Reality check for VR: Omdia forecasts decline as Apple’s entry fails to galvanize market</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While not an exact representation of Quest headset sales, Meta Quest app download figures serve as a good barometer, given the mobile app must be downloaded as part of the initial setup of the headset. Sensor Tower does not count re-downloads, app updates, or subsequent downloads on new or additional devices for an existing iOS/Google Play account.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Factors like second-hand sales, upgrades, headset sharing, and non-owners downloading the app to explore the app store muddy the data. Nevertheless, the flat app download figures strongly indicate that Meta is not significantly expanding the Quest's audience beyond its existing user base. This aligns with other indicative data, such as sales figures on Amazon product pages and VR headset components channel data, which similarly point to a plateauing market. Meta’s growing focus on smart glasses signals a shift in strategy, as the company explores alternative form factors that may better appeal to the mass market than VR.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Indicative Amazon data suggests Meta Quest sales underperformed during Black Friday month">Indicative Amazon data suggests Meta Quest sales underperformed during Black Friday month</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to data from Amazon product pages, over 160,000 Quest headsets were sold in November 2024 across eight countries – down by 16% compared to 2023 (see Figure 2). The Quest 3S accounted for 66% of sales, with the Quest 3 making up the remainder. November typically marks the peak VR sales due to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, during which Meta offered substantial discounts on both Quest 3 and Quest 3S models in all markets. The US site represented 73% of total sales, providing a good indication of the global picture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quest 3S struggled to attract new VR users or serve as a compelling upgrade for Quest 2 owners, as its improvements were viewed as incremental. Internally, the Quest 3S is very similar to the Quest 2 and retains its bulkiness, largely due to the ongoing use of Fresnel lenses. A recurring criticism from reviewers and users has been its inferior comfort compared to the Quest 3—which likely stems from Meta’s cost-cutting measures. Further hindering Quest 3S’ appeal is the limited AR content fully leveraging its improved hardware, as well as the compatibility of most Quest Store content with the Quest 2. These factors, combined with VR’s continued inability to appeal to a broader audience beyond existing enthusiasts, dampened demand during the holiday season.</span></p><p>Figure 2: Quest headset sales on Amazon declined 16% YoY during the Black Friday sales month</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Meta Quest smartphone app ranking data underlines the seasonal nature of headset sales and their US-centricity">The Meta Quest smartphone app ranking data underlines the seasonal nature of headset sales and their US-centricity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Meta Quest iPhone app's recurring appearance in the top 200 free app rankings during the holiday season aligns with the seasonal trend of headset sales, particularly around Christmas when these devices are popular gifts. This pattern also underscores the dominance of the US, Canada, and UK as key markets, where the app reliably breaks into the top 10 and often briefly reaches the number 1 spot on the Christmas Day. In stark contrast, the other three countries—Germany, France, and Australia—hover much further down the rankings, never coming close to the top 10 and barely breaking into the top 50, highlighting a significant gap in market engagement (see Figure 3).</span></p><p>Figure 3: iPhone App Store ranking data underlines Meta Quest headsets’ seasonality and prominence in the US</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although the surge in popularity and peak concurrent users engaging in VR games during the holiday period signals some positive interest, the larger issues surrounding the VR category persist. According to Omdia’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/om005309/consumer-vr-headset-and-content-revenue-forecast">Consumer VR Headset and Content Revenue Forecast</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, headset sales fell by 10% in 2024 to 6.9 million units, while those in active use fell by 8% to 21.9 million. Engagement throughout the year is inconsistent, posing a significant hurdle to Meta's ambition of cultivating a self-sustaining VR ecosystem. Limited compelling new content, developers questioning the ROI of VR projects, and a lack of broader consumer interest are the fundamental challenges that will be difficult to overcome, as long as VR headsets remain in their current form.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Principal Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">George is a regular contributor to Game Developer and a principal analyst at Omdia, leading research into games and AR/VR markets.

Here are the ones I enjoyed the most. </p><p>You might be thinking that mid-January in 2025 is awfully late to be sharing a list like this, especially since practically every other writer and site has done so already. But I have reasons! Firstly, I've been on vacation for three weeks. And secondly, I didn't want to post a list like this while the calendar still read "2024", because there are 365 days of video game releases in the year, and I wanted to give each and every single one of them a chance for its games to make the cut.</p><p>In no particular order, then, here are my favourites, from the most expensive AAA release to the tiniest little game about a naughty dog. </p><p><strong>Yakuza: Infinite Wealth</strong></p><figure></figure><p>A modern masterpiece. <a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The game so good</a> I <a href="https://aftermath.site/infinite-wealth-ichiban-kasuga-friendship-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed it twice</a>. A single sprawling, joyous RPG that managed to simultaneously farewell an old hero and chart an exciting new course for the series.</p><hr><p><strong>Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</strong></p><figure></figure><p>If it's not the greatest video game adaptation ever, it's certainly near the top, <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-douglas-slocombe-cinematography-cutscenes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so faithful it even paid attention to the <em>cinematography</em></a>. With its <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-immersive-machinegames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laboured movement and devotion to the first-person perspective</a> it felt as much like a new Indy movie as it did an Indy video game, and I mean both of those as the highest order of compliment. </p><hr><p><strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong></p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-outlaws-review-impressions-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This was a great game, and some very good Star Wars</a>. With a fun cast of characters, and an exploration of a side of the universe that mercifully didn't include Jedi, you'd be a moron to let the "discourse" surrounding this sour you on it. </p><hr><p><strong>Songs Of Silence</strong></p><figure></figure><p>One of the best-looking games of the year came out of absolutely nowhere to <a href="https://aftermath.site/songs-of-silence-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not only stun my eyeballs, but strip a tiring Total War formula to the bone as well</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>The Plucky Squire</strong></p><figure></figure><p>With one eye on gaming's past and another on its future, <a href="https://aftermath.site/plucky-squire-pc-switch-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this puzzling quest oozed character and class</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Caravan Sandwitch</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Rarely a week has gone by where <a href="https://aftermath.site/caravan-sandwitch-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I haven't thought about this game, its beautiful soundtrack and its cast of misfit characters</a>. I had more fun in its small, fully-realised sandbox than worlds ten times--and ten times emptier--its size.</p><hr><p><strong>Wild Bastards</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Did you know I've never played <em>Balatro</em>? Because I know myself and my habits, and I know if I ever allowed myself to, I'd be in trouble. Did you know I'm also an idiot, because <em>Wild Bastards</em>--with its quickfire missions and roguelite escapades--<a href="https://aftermath.site/wild-bastards-blue-manchu-fps-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped in and fucked me up for weeks all the same</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Tactical Breach Wizards</strong></p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/tactical-breach-wizards-pc-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turns out 2024's best tactics game was also 2024's funniest video game</a>. And those are two of my favourite things. </p><hr><p><strong>Total War: Pharaoh</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Talk about pulling it out of the fire! Creative Assembly released one of the worst Total Wars of all time in 2023, but just a few months later dropped all of its planned DLC at once and, <a href="https://aftermath.site/total-war-pharaoh-dynasties-impressions-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whaddya know, suddenly it was one of the best</a>. </p><hr><p><strong>Thank Goodness You're Here</strong></p><figure></figure><p>An outrageously <a href="https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funny video game</a>, animated and written and voiced all so wonderfully that even months on from release<a href="https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-impressions-north" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I'm still thinking about smoking fish, meat pies and Matt Berry</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Cataclismo</strong></p><figure></figure><p>A marriage of beautiful art, grisly monsters, fashionable soldiers and sandbox fortress building, this tower defence/RTS/city-builder hybrid came very close to being <a href="https://aftermath.site/cataclismo-impressions-rts-city-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the perfect video game</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Synergy</strong></p><figure></figure><p>It's not the best city-builder I've ever played, <a href="https://aftermath.site/synergy-pc-city-builder-impressions-review-moebius" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but it's certainly the most interesting</a>, and with its Moebius-inspired visuals also one of the downright <em>coolest</em>. </p><hr><p><strong>Galacticare</strong></p><figure></figure><p>I don't know anybody else who played this, or even wrote about it, which is weird. It's a <em>Theme Hospital</em>-style game that is, I think, better than many of its peers--<em>Two Point Hospital</em> included--<a href="https://aftermath.site/galacticare-review-impressions-pc-bullfrog-theme-hospital" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and is not only genuinely funny, but has a super smart interface to boot</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Homeworld 3</strong></p><figure></figure><p>I appreciate its attempt to try something slightly different, coming so many years after its predecessors, <a href="https://aftermath.site/homeworld-3-pc-review-impressions-blackbird-steam-rts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but it fell short and so didn't <em>quite</em> hit the same highs</a>. Ah well! What's there was still great, <a href="https://aftermath.site/homeworld-3-concept-art-making-of" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and it was lovely to see all those incredible little ships again</a>. </p><hr><p><strong>Little Kitty Big City</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Much like <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em>, it was another triumph for a bite-sized sandbox. I got to know every corner and shop in these city blocks, and gliding a cat around them doing dumb cat stuff was a blast. <a href="https://aftermath.site/little-kitty-big-city-cat-game-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There have been a few cat games released recently, but this is by far my favourite</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>Doronko Wanko</strong></p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/dorongo-wango-impressions-steam-pc-bandai-namco-pomeranian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I love this naughty little dog so much</a> and I just wanted to see him make a GOTY list. </p><hr><p><strong>1000xRESIST</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Stop the presses! As you might be able to tell from the lack of hyperlinks in this paragraph, this is the only game on this entire list I hadn't already written about on Aftermath because, well, I only just played it on my vacation.

In search of a way to stop the murders, the perpetually phenomenal Hsu tries to circumvent the curse with over-the-jeans dry humping, remembers her covid-era safe sex romp that had her and <em>Search Party</em>’s John Early trying to dirty talk through N95 masks, and tells her former throuple with Simu Liu that they could die soon.</p><p><em>Laid </em>doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it does steamroll over any drama, flattening it into nothing more than soil from which humor can sprout. Ruby is taken to task by all of her ex-lovers over her inconsiderate actions, including drunkenly sleeping with AJ’s boyfriend and lying about it, and any deep self-examination she might engage in is promptly undercut as she makes a crude joke about her predicament. She’ll yell at an incompetent police officer about how much of a terrible person she is, then tell him she didn’t instinctively check to see if his partner was wearing a wedding ring because she instantly saw that he was gay. <em>Laid </em>is a laughs factory with a joke manufacturing strategy I wish other “comedies” followed. </p><p>We live in a world where an anxiety-riddled drama like <em>The Bear</em>, an existential deep dive into the psyche of a hitman like <em>Barry</em>, and an exploration into grief through the eyes of a children’s TV host like <em>Kidding</em> can all be nominated for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes. All three are spectacular shows, but the laughs are few and far between. Post-<em>Breaking Bad</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>Hollywood has become too enamored with the relatable antihero trope, to the point that it’s found its way into nearly every genre of TV. Why can’t we just have a goofball going through absurd situations in which the only real goal is to find new ways to make the audience laugh? </p><p>Luckily, we have shows like <em>Hacks</em>, <em>Abbott Elementary</em>, and, of course, <em>Laid</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>making sure we remember that even fully fleshed-out human beings can be fuckin’ hilarious all of the time. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Stray Kite Studios--an indie developer that includes veterans from BioShock, Borderlands, and Age of Empires--has debuted the first look at the company's inaugural original title Wartorn. As seen in the trailer below, the game thrusts players into the lives of two elven sisters who are trying to survive long enough to reunite with their family. And they'll have to make some tough decisions along the way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tt1bNPFk0U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2tt1bNPFk0U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Combat will play a major role in their journey, but it won't be the only thing that impacts their fate. Stray Kite indicated that the sisters will "confront moral dilemmas and battle external and internal threats." Luckily, they aren't powerless in this fantasy world.</p><p>"Wartorn challenges players to navigate the chaos of a divided world while finding purpose and joy in selflessness," Stary Kite Studios creative director Paul Hellquist said in a statement. "We've poured our hearts into creating a game that not only entertains, but also makes players think deeply about sacrifice, survival, and the bonds that unite us."</p><p>The studio also touted the destructible environments as well as the dynamic combat system that puts the elements of water, fire, and electricity in the hands of the players. Wartorn's roguelike progression system will offer upgrades, items, and new abilities that will carry over to each run. Players can also slow down time to keep their characters from being overwhelmed in the heat of battle.</p><p>Prior to this game, Stray Kite Studios worked with Gearbox and 2K Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragon Keep: A Wonderlands One-Shot Adventure. The studio has also created minigames through Fortnite Creative.</p><p>Wartorn will be available in early access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296660/Wartorn/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and Epic Game Store in Spring 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-next-zombies-map-is-called-the-tomb-and-plunges-players-into-ancient-catacombs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
As <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> readies for the release of Season 2 on 28th January, developer Treyarch has shared initial details of Zombies mode's next map, The Tomb - which plunges players deep beneath the earth, down into ancient catacombs.
</p>
<p>
"As the rumours have it," Treyarch explains in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-115-day-announcement">post on the Call of Duty website</a>, "a British archeologist by the name of Sir Archibald Fotherington-Smythe conducted an excavation at the site back in 1908 with grand expectations. Although no one can say for sure what became of him, a handful of photographs from his doomed expedition have recently surfaced..."
</p>
<p>
Picking up after the events at Citadelle des Morts - Zombies mode's third Black Ops 6 map, introduced during Season 1 - The Tomb sees Weaver, Grey, Carver, and Maya following Gabriel Krafft's final words to a nearby excavation site as they continue their search for the Sentinel Artifact. From there, the only way is down - deep into long-undisturbed catacombs built on an ancient burial ground, and perhaps even deeper still.

</figure>
<p>
Treyarch says The Tomb has been designed to offer a similar experience to Zombies mode's Liberty Falls map, featuring tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability. It's also promising "plenty" of Easter Eggs, and a reimagined Wonder Weapon inspired by the series' past. More specific gameplay details will be shared closer to The Tomb's release - but in the meantime, the studio has revealed a number of other additions coming to Zombies mode in Season 2.
</p><p>
These include a much-requested co-op pause feature which, as its name suggests, enables a party leader to pause the game during play, provided all participants are in the same party. That's on top of loadout recovery for players who rejoin a session after being kicked while AFK, plus a range of Challenge Tracker and Near Completion improvements, and the ability to set up separate HUD presets for Zombies and multiplayer modes.
</p>
<p>
According to Treyarch, Black Ops 6 players have now amassed 480m hours in Zombies mode since its launch last October, with Directed Mode - introduced a month later - having helped raise the average Main Quest completion rate from 3.38 percent to 8.23 percent. "This still means over 90 percent of people who've played Zombies haven't completed a Main Quest yet, so our mission continues," it notes, "but we're proud of these initial results, and excited to welcome so many new players into the fold with this new feature. Onward and upward!"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/acer-chromebook-plus-516-ge-review-gaming-pc-laptop-1851740112<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2023, Google partnered with different PC makers to create  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-premium-chromebook-plus-laptops-for-productivity-and-gaming-with-google-ai-built-in&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-premium-chromebook-plus-laptops-for-productivity-and-gaming-with-google-ai-built-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromebook Plus</a></span>—a new line of its stripped-down spin on a laptop running its own OS. The idea was to offer a more powerful version of the Chromebook to those who wanted that extra oomph. And before Christmas, Google sent me a new Chromebook Plus from Acer so I could check out this device’s gaming capabilities. After a few weeks with it, I’m happy to report that this is a solid laptop that I might buy in the future. But it’s not a great way to play most games.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The Acer 516 GE is the specific <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-plus/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromebook Plus</a></span> I was sent to review. And before I leap into my issues with streaming on it, I should clarify that the device itself is sleek, modern, has a solid battery life, and never gave me any technical issues. Watching videos, writing, and surfing the web using the Acer Chromebook Plus was a very enjoyable experience. </p><p>In the past, I’ve used Chromebooks and didn’t enjoy it. The stripped-down ChromeOS-powered laptops have been around for a decade or so now, but whenever I touched one, I always walked away disappointed by the lack of performance and function. </p><p>Now, in 2025, as more apps are web-based and mobile hardware has become incredibly fast, using a Chromebook isn’t painful. In fact, while using the Acer 516 GE I would forget it was a Chromebook, as many things I do every day on a computer—check my email, chat with co-workers, read news, and write stories—are done through a browser anyway. As a result, I never had a problem using the Acer 516 GE. Well, until I tried to play games. </p><figure id="" data-id="12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-recommend-id="image://12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2900" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Acer / Google</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-recommend-id="image://12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2900" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-plus-516-ge-cbg516-2h&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-plus-516-ge-cbg516-2h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">516 GE Chromebook Plus</a></span> is marketed heavily as a gamer-focused device. Google sent it to me, a writer at <em>Kotaku</em>, because its supposedly a gamer-friendly device. But if you know anything about ChomeOS and Chromebooks, you know that these things can’t play high-end games. The solution? The power of the cloud.</p><p>That’s the big selling point of the 516 GE. You don’t have to download games or worry about tech requirements. Just log into your preferred game streaming service and play stuff like<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em>Fortnite </em>instantly. And maybe, in another five years, this promise will become a reality, but for now streaming games is still a bad way to play stuff. </p><p>I tried <em>Fortnite, Cyberpunk 2077, </em>and <em>Gears 5</em> using different methods including Game Pass, Nvidia Geforce Now, and Amazon Luna. And while some were better than others, none of them matched the experience of playing a game natively on a device like a console or PC. </p><figure id="" data-id="afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-recommend-id="image://afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-format="png" data-width="1195" data-height="682" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Acer / Google</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-recommend-id="image://afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-format="png" data-width="1195" data-height="682" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now, you can install Steam on the 516 GE (it has a speical built-in feature to allow this) and using what I assume is Proton, I was able to play some 2D games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Vampire</em> <em>Survivors </em>and <em>Balatro</em></a></span><em> </em>just fine on the 516 GE. But that’s not impressive in a world where my phone can do that, too. No, the big selling point of this device is being able to play high-end, AAA video games on the go with no downloading and without having to shell out thousands of dollars on a dedicated gaming laptop.</p><p>Sadly, in 2025, even with Google Fiber internet (which I have), the 516 GE can’t remove the lag, choppiness, and visual artifacts that you encounter when streaming games. </p><p>So, if you are looking for a powerful Chromebook that can play some basic 2D games and retro stuff (I was able to get <em>Turok </em>running on it without any issues) then the 516 GE is worth checking out. Just don’t expect it and its game-streaming capabilities to replace your Switch, Steam Deck, or PS5 anytime soon. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-25/">Madden NFL</a> is touted as having new and exciting presentation elements with every new installment in the series. These elements, such as commentary, field-level camera work, and halftime shows, are inconsistent at best and tend to leave a lot to be desired, especially when you compare them to the same aspects of games like NBA 2K and MLB The Show. But the latest presentation gaffe in Madden 25 feels like a strangely unforced error.</p><p dir="ltr">In the most recent patch, the EA Orlando team introduced the Team Pass, a new battle pass-like cosmetic rewards tree that offers both free and paid unlockables that amount to player banner customization options. You can unlock things like profile pictures, backgrounds, and borders, just like you can in Call of Duty or many other games. These cosmetics are all centered around one particular team of a player's choosing and are meant to be proudly displayed in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">In practice, this means the scorebug in any game replaces the logo of the team you're playing as with imagery based on the team you chose in the Team Pass. This is a reasonably innocuous feature for game modes like the arcadey Superstar Showdown and the fantasy-sports-inspired Ultimate Team (MUT). However, forcing this cosmetic change in Franchise mode quickly becomes an eyesore given players are tied to the hip with one particular team--and not necessarily the same team as that in their Team Pass--and are much more likely to be interested in simulating the product they see on TV.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428326-image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428326" data-ratio="0.51203007518797" data-width="1330" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428326-image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428326"></a><figcaption>Sit down; the Atlanta Jets and New Orleans Rob Lowes game is on. (Image credit: CouchCoach16 on Twitch)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428326-image.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can't change your chosen team once you've opted into the Team Pass, though the game suggests a new Team Pass will be sold in a few months during the next live-service season. The Team Pass seems built on the assumption that players will choose their favorite team and that it will be the same team they tend to use in various game modes. It's arguably a fair assumption some of the time, but Franchise is a mode in which players often purposely take on a team other than the one close to their heart.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe they want a rebuilding project, or they want to create a custom team in a new city with a new name and uniforms, or maybe, like in the case of <a href="https://forms.gle/9LRHh7J3xXjqjzQK6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">my online league</a>, there are 32 players and few of us will get our favorite team. My league plays year-round, switching to the latest Madden every August. Our teams become our identity. To have an unrelated team tied to our long-term persona is a jarring feature the moment you first see it on the screen. Why would I want a team other than the one I'm controlling and the one I'm facing to be featured on the scorebug?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428329-jets.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428329" data-ratio="0.22666666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428329-jets.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428329"></a><figcaption>A closer look at the strange new presentation decision by the Madden team. Previously, you'd see Falcons and Saints logos here. Now, neither is visible.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428329-jets.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the worst case, the scorebug now features up to four teams: the two teams playing each other, identified by their three-letter abbreviation, and as many as two more teams that have overtaken the team logo spaces and replaced them with potentially several extravagant cosmetics. I don't know how it got through testing. It's kind of like if the scorebug's remaining timeout nodes were changed to various emojis. Can I figure it out soon enough? Yeah, sure. But does it improve anything? Does it make sense? Does it look nice, the way cosmetic options for sale within a game should? Nope. Nobody looked at a game between the Steelers and Ravens in which the scorebug suggests--in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect" rel="nofollow ">Stroop test</a> fashion--it's actually the Seahawks and Patriots and thought something was wrong?</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly perplexing is what happens if you opt out of the Team Pass entirely. The game then applies a default logo to your profile, the NFL shield, so you end up looking like the NFL franchise <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2020/1/19/21073367/rob-lowe-nfl-hat-nfc-championship-packers-49ers" rel="nofollow ">embodiment of Rob Lowe</a>, giving games a strange one-team-versus-the-league aesthetic at a glance. This is easier to read than the possibly very busy illustrations the Team Pass may grant you, but it still replaces a sensible team-specific logo with the default NFL logo as a means of getting you to care about the Team Pass. It's the equivalent of NBA 2K's annual bland, brown shirt for all new create-a-players filtering into the game. It's purposely unappealing to inspire you to spend money on something nicer. But in this case, the nicer option isn't so nice.</p><p dir="ltr">There are bigger problems in the world. Heck, there are even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/">bigger problems in the Madden world</a>. I haven't lost sight of that. But so often, better, more consistent sports sims sweat the small stuff to such an appreciable degree that it's exciting to see what those games will roll out with each new game. In the case of Madden, I have been conditioned to merely hope the game<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-23s-disastrous-franchise-problems-continue-with-saves-permanently-lost/1100-6510276/"> doesn't permanently erase my hundreds of hours of Franchise saved data</a> or that I can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-24-mercifully-lets-players-turn-off-one-of-the-series-worst-features/1100-6514909/">eventually turn off an unbalanced mechanic</a> that never improved across several iterations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428328-58b7f56c-24e0-43cd-a4c8-4c10db3a1b9b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428328-58b7f56c-24e0-43cd-a4c8-4c10db3a1b9b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428328"></a><figcaption>To each their own, but even without the scorebug problem, it's hard to rationalize why they felt they needed three Patriot logos on this one profile pic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428328-58b7f56c-24e0-43cd-a4c8-4c10db3a1b9b.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm not interested in buying the Team Pass, but I acknowledge that it could be fun and harmless for a portion of the massive community to chase these rewards. Every live-service game has a mandate to be what I like to call "a little more Fortnite." Customization and cosmetic brags like a rare skin or profile picture inspire tons of spending and countless hours played. Maybe Madden will enjoy a similar outcome with its first Team Pass. But in a mode like online Franchise, in which players already painstakingly tweak the game's sliders, rules, and behaviors to cover up some of the inherited blemishes the series drops in our laps, these MUT-like touches just get in the way of what is often already a head-scratching experience.</p><p dir="ltr">My hope for this new cosmetic overhaul is that the EA Orlando team will find another place for us to show off our player banners--a non-obstructive, non-headache-inducing place. Additional revenue streams are unavoidable in many games today, especially those operating like a live service such as Madden, so I get that this stuff is here to stay, but does it have to stay in my way?</p>

Take-Two might not need the extra money, but raising the price of<em> GTA VI</em> could give cover to other companies to raise their prices as well. The increasingly hollowed-out middle ground could go from charging $40 and $50 to $60 and $70, so the reasoning goes. Then again, in the current zero-sum environment, raising the cap could also just drive even more money away from smaller companies and lesser-known franchises. </p><figure id="" data-id="bd6b415eb1ea39c5ee1ec569ba6c6f8c" data-recommend-id="image://bd6b415eb1ea39c5ee1ec569ba6c6f8c" data-format="png" data-width="1192" data-height="848" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows how much of the gaming market is dominated by the top franchises.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This isn’t the first time someone’s brought up the idea of <em>GTA VI </em>potentially breaking the current $70 price barrier. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/take-two-ceo-no-pushback-70-price-sega-zelda-gta-vi-2k-1850456925&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-ceo-no-pushback-70-price-sega-zelda-gta-vi-2k-1850456925">asked about it on investor calls in the past</a></span> and responds by saying the company always wants to overdeliver in terms of quality and value. That noncommittal response certainly doesn’t close the door to <em>GTA VI </em>being $80 or even $100, and Take-Two was one of the first companies to push existing games into $70 territory with the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p>Before that, premium boxed games had been $60 since the launch of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/game-prices-go-up-to-70-the-first-increase-in-15-years?sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/game-prices-go-up-to-70-the-first-increase-in-15-years?sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remaining stagnant for roughly 15 years</a></span> even while most other things around them got more expensive, including development budgets. When <em>GTA 3</em> came to PS2 back in 2001, it was $50. If it were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjusted for inflation</a></span>, it would cost $90 today. And in fact many big blockbusters, like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, already have $100 versions for those players who want limited-edition skins, premium battle passes, extra in-game items, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675">and early access to play ahead of the official launch</a></span> (the ultimate edition of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is even more at $110). </p><p>In his analysis, Ball points to a number of reasons why companies are so hesitant to raise game prices, or at least now use a one-size-fits-all approach to selecting them. The mere fact that game prices have historically not changed much has reinforced how “sticky” they are and leads to outsized player scrutiny any time price hikes are discussed. Other factors are competition from the rise of free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Genshin Impact</em> and the desire to reach as big a player-base as possible for battle passes, DLC, and other paid add-ons down the road. Plus it’s no secret how many people are already trained to wait just a few months for major discounts on everything but the best-selling games. </p><p>Nintendo recently showed that price hikes aren’t the end of the world when done smartly. It charged an extra $10 for <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> despite still being on the same hardware as the $60 <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. The game still went on to sell over 20 million copies and it also didn’t mean that <em>Pikmin 4</em> was all of a sudden going to cost $70 too (though it certainly would have still been worth it). <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was only $60 on PC, but could have been another obvious contender for an $80 or even $100 game.</p><p>“I don’t love the artificiality of pricing structures post retail,” Larian Studios head of publishing, Michael Douse, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1828078408397623473&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1828078408397623473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote online last year</a></span>. “Use the inflated base price to upsell a subscription, and use vague content promises to inflate ultimate editions to make the base price look better. It all seems a bit dangerous &amp; disconnected from the community. I think a game should be priced accordingly with its quality, breadth &amp; depth. I’m not against higher prices, but this arbitrary uniformity just doesn’t make sense to me. It feels so unserious.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian is celebrating 100 million mod downloads by giving the game's undead hero Withers some big naturals. The developer has added the <a href="https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3/m/withersbignaturals" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Withers Big Naturals" mod</a> by creator MaybeeAdam to its official mod list, meaning console players can give their Withers a set of big boobs, if they feel so inclined. The mod is a reference to the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-in-gods-name-is-gandalf-big-naturals-the-surreal-photoshop-lotr-meme-explained" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Gandalf Big Naturals" meme </a>that originated on Tumblr in 2021.</p><p>Larian announced the addition, and the number of mod downloads, with a social media post featuring a picture of Withers with the text "100 million mod downloads."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-indie-game-funding-mike-bithell<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Depending on where you’re standing, the video game industry is in a state of caterpillar-like transformation into something new or a full-on crisis. Funding is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cheap-money-and-bad-bets-how-the-games-industry-turned-pandemic-success-into-disaster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scarce</a>. Companies are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-10/why-so-many-video-games-cost-so-much-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNjUzMjA0NywiZXhwIjoxNzM3MTM2ODQ3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUFZXTzlEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.qopDytLFnUY5oOkR9UB2NLBxokJ4yJH0HqzkZP5_dvw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rife with mismanagement</a>. If a big game flops, execs often ensure that it <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takes entire studios with it</a>. But perhaps, some observers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffwebb.tech/post/3lcdsucykp22j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have suggested</a>, this is merely a course correction. Last year was <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-palworld-helldivers-manor-lords-aaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a goldmine of breakout indie hits</a> like <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Manor Lords</em>, <em>Palworld</em>,<em> Animal Well</em>, and <em>1000xResist</em>; maybe it’s time for the meek to inherit the industry. Problem is, indies need money, too – a lot more than you might think. On the latest episode of <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/you-are-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You Are Error</a>, we discuss that not-so-little stumbling block and how one of gaming’s foundational myths, the solo indie dev, helped get us here.</p><p>We’ve arrived at a point in time when, more so than ever, “indie” means a lot of different things to different people. As it turns out, many games players refer to as “indie” now cost hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to make. And as big companies struggle to find funding, it’s not like small developers are suddenly flush with cash. Where does this disconnect come from? Why do so many fans – knowledgeable and engaged ones, no less – still view indies as solo operations running on passion, a pocketful of pennies, and a dream? And did independent game development ever truly work that way? Or were we all swindled by the glitz and glamor of <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24162580/indie-game-the-movie-rewatch-fez-braid-super-meat-boy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Game: The Movie</a></em> back in 2012?</p><p>My guest today is Mike Bithell, head of Bithell Games, the studio that brought us early indie hits like <em>Thomas Was Alone</em>, as well as recent, more mainstream fare like <em>John Wick Hex</em> and <em>Tron: Identity</em>. In many senses, he’s one of the original “solo” indie devs, even as he now runs a whole studio and tries to educate people on the time, resources, and manpower it takes to make smaller commercial games these days. In selecting Mike as the focal point of this episode, I was hoping he’d be down to take a look in the mirror and grapple with potentially pernicious elements of his legacy. And he was!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can hear us talk about all that and more on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7w7V296dt8HCoDryWiofI4?si=f79446b5647c44bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/you-are-error/id1782231480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you enjoy the show, please consider leaving a review so that Aftermath can amass <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-2024-finances-subscription-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the necessary resources to sustain itself</a> – which is still a fraction of what you’d need to fund many modern indie games.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a couple excerpts from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> I think there is still a perception that indie games are independently funded, and I think that’s a reasonable expectation given where indie comes from and the word “indie” itself. But if you look at most of the indie games the average player has heard of, they’re perhaps not completely independently funded by the development team that’s making them, and I think that’s probably the root of it: We’re more dependent on the industry at large than the average player probably realizes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Let’s dig into that. I saw some conversation online where people were discussing the amount that it costs to make an indie game these days, which I think if you’re pulling your perception of how indie games are made from an earlier time, that [cost] might have changed. I saw Cara Ellison, who does writing for video games, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/caraellison.bsky.social/post/3lcdz5srg522t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">say</a> that these days it can be $500,000-$1 million. When you hear the word “indie,” you probably don’t think $1 million. But does that seem accurate to you based on your own experiences or observations?</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> I agree with Cara on a lot of things, but I would say it’s broader potentially than even she’s laying out there. Obviously there’s indie games that cost nothing except the time of the person who’s making them; that still exists. But then on the upper end of things, I would say it can go into the multiple millions. We’ve certainly worked on games that are multiple millions of dollars just in development costs. If you’ve got a group of people coming together for a game, and it’s a sizable team, then that’s gonna cost [a lot].&nbsp;</p><p>I think that’s another aspect of this that people maybe don’t fully understand: The most expensive thing in games, rightly so, is people. It’s the salaries of the people who gather to make the game. So if you just do some math yourself: If there’s 10, 15, 20 people on that kind of money for X number of years, those numbers suddenly come to bear. A million dollars is a lot of money on an individual level, but in sustaining the salaries of a group of people, it’s actually not a lot of money over those timelines and at that sort of scale.</p><p>I think indie – and this is definitely true of conversations I’ve seen around filmmaking as well – because indie is so intrinsically linked to this idea of the hobbyist, or the person working on their own, the solo developer, it can create this sense that you fund it in the same way as you’d fund a hobby. If you want to make games as a hobby, you’d have to buy an OK computer, basically. Or you’ve already got one. And then you just invest your time in it. There’s a big jump from there to a professionalized kind of development process.&nbsp;</p><p>We kind of blur that, and I think arguably, indies, we’ve done well from intentionally blurring that a little. There’s that kind of plucky underdog story. I remember when my first game started, lots of thinkpieces were like “Sell your narrative. Sell the story of you. Sell that heroic underdog story – the little dev that could.” We all kind of framed ourselves in that way because that’s what the audience wanted from a satisfying story point of view. It would be hypocritical to be offended that they then come to the assumption that that was a completely honest depiction of how games are made.</p><p>***</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It strikes me that this notion of the solo indie dev as kind of a formative myth for the video game industry – sort of the default of how a lot of people perceive indies – [gained traction with <em>Indie Game: The Movie</em>]. It focused on these individuals as a way of at the time humanizing developers, which I think was useful because there wasn’t as much of that back then. But it also created this archetype. That movie didn’t come out of thin air, though. It’s not like somebody creates a documentary and thinks “OK, I’m gonna craft this entire narrative from nothing.” Where did the seeds of it come from? What did [the documentarians] see that made them think “This is the story we’ve got to tell?”</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> To an extent, it was true. I’m a big believer that no work can exist because of one person. Even if you’re on your own, you still have teachers, you still have peers, you still have a community. But back then, a lot of those games were made if not by solo devs, then maybe one person who was focused and fixated on it and satellite people who would help out. <em>Thomas Was Alone</em> was me in terms of the core of it, and then I had Dave [Housden], the composer, and Danny [Wallace], who voiced the narrator in it, and that was it.&nbsp;</p><p>On a basic level, I think it’s true. It was also good marketing. From a storytelling point of view, we got to do <em>Rocky</em>, basically. We got to sell ourselves as these individuals fighting the system, and we were encouraged to do that by the games journalism of the time as well. They were good stories, for sure, and fair enough.&nbsp;</p><p>I think what I’ve certainly tried to do– despite having a company called Bithell Games, which I’m very aware of; at the time, it was just me and my mate Daz [Watford] in the company, and we were talking about names for the company, and he was like “I would like to coast on your name if I could.” He was like “You’re the one they’ve heard of. Can we just call it after you?” I wish I hadn’t listened to him, because once you’re 20 people, it’s so embarrassing to introduce yourself as “Mike Bithell, the owner of Bithell Games.” It’s awful.</p><p>But yeah, I think what I try and do is always emphasize the group. Whenever I do interviews or I’m talking like this, I will always mention the team as much as I can. But people like simple stories, and there is always gonna be a chunk of the audience who plays our games that think of them as the sole expression of me. I even started, 15 years ago now, putting opening title sequences on our games primarily so I could just have the names of people working on the game come up before you even start – and even that didn’t really push through too much.</p><p>So we do what we can. I think it’s true, though, of most things – definitely of music. Movies, we think of in terms of [for example] Spielberg. We don’t think about the enormous number of people [who contributed]. And often it’s a good shorthand, because a director, say, may work with the same editor, the same this, the same that every film, so it becomes a shorthand. Literally it happened to me with a friend the other day. We were talking about <em>Tron: Catalyst</em>; we’d released some screenshots, and they were saying “It looks like a real Mike Bithell game.” And it’s like, it looks like a Daz Watford game. He’s been doing my art for a decade now. That’s the distinction. That’s the kind of stuff you try to correct for.</p><p>But ultimately, I think it’s a good shorthand for marketing. It’s a good shorthand to protect the team. If one of our games is badly received, I want to be the lightning rod for that. I don’t want the team to be getting angry messages. It’s always a balancing act. It’s incredibly embarrassing to be perceived as egotistical, so I’m terrified by that at all times.&nbsp;</p><p>But yeah, I think you’re absolutely right: This does play into the conversation. People don’t think about the team with any game, and most devs nowadays – definitely my generation of indie devs – are making games at this kind of scale. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty [people]. There are new generations coming up that are doing the solo dev thing, often successfully. But what’s interesting there and what I’m finding interesting in the discussion surrounding that generation is, that generation’s using a lot more things like asset packs and resources that have been built by other people and sold to them – and they should take advantage of anything that’s available to them. So technically they’re not solo. They’re using assets made by other people, and there’s all of those hands that have touched that game.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a weird one. Unless you’re making a game about rectangles, you’re probably not a solo dev. There’s probably someone else who’s had an impact. There are exceptions to that rule, but it’s much rarer than the average person believes it to be.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/luke-plunkett-aftermath-game-of-the-year-2024"><h3>Luke’s Favourite Video Games Of 2024</h3></a><p>From archaeologists to Barnsworth, it was a good year</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-reveal"><h3>You Can’t Rush Christmas</h3></a><p>A thing is announced when it's announced</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NetEase has announced that the Advanced Suit 2.0 is coming to Marvel Rivals to celebrate the PC launch of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. The company posted a reveal on Twitter earlier today, stating that the suit will be available for Spider-Man from January 30.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-friendly-neighbourhood-spider-man">Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man</h2>



<p>In the post on Twitter (X), NetEase wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Take the first look at Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (2023) in Marvel Rivals, the Advanced Suit 2.0 blends Otto Octavius’s science with Peter Parker’s genius. Crafted for the toughest battles, it symbolizes Spider-Man’s true grit as a hero.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the reveal image used to showcase the Advanced Suit 2.0 in Marvel Rivals:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Spider-Man 2 was released in 2023 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, and while Insomniac neglected to follow up with any major expansions, the game has remained popular since. On January 30, the web-slinging hero title will land on PC via Steam.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has been a boon for NetEase since being released in December 2024. It has pulled in tens of millions of players and has become one of the best hero shooters to emerge in recent years. It’s challenging Overwatch in the genre and will be a thorn in the side of Valve’s Deadlock.</p>



<p>In Marvel Rivals, Spider-Man is one of the most challenging Duelists. He has a five-star difficulty rating and relies on unparalleled acrobatic abilities to dominate the playing field.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of Spider-Man 2, you’ll want to snag the Advanced Suit 2.0 when it appears in Marvel Rivals on January 30.</p>

<p>In a recent update posted on Steam, it was revealed that Fortune’s Run, a retro sci-fi indie shooter, will have all development activity put on hold for three years. This is because the sole developer, ‘Dizzie’, will be serving a 36-month prison sentence, which was handed down as a result of the dev living ‘a very different life’ before they started working on Fortune’s Run.</p>



<p>As of today, Fortune’s Run boasts a ‘Very Positive’ rating on Steam, where it has existed since September 2023.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-unclear-what-will-happen">‘It’s Unclear What Will Happen’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> on Valve’s PC platform, Steam, the sole developer of Fortune’s Run explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been sentenced to prison for the next 3 years. It’s a long story, but I’ve lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn’t living very well. My case is about 5 years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I’ve been working on this. I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I’m going away next month. </p>



<p>It’s a shame, but it’s the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn’t going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The post went on to explain that Fortune’s Run ‘sold okay’ and that once Dizzie is released from prison, they’ll hopefully be back on their feet and will return to the game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I’m never going to stop making games. I’d like to finish this one, but I don’t know what will happen. I’m going to do my best, because I love this game and I want to finish it. Seriously, I just want to finish it. Finish it already, Dizzie!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This news was followed up by a couple more posts explaining some updates and tweaks being made to the game – which will likely be the final changes Fortune’s Run will see for quite some time.</p>

After years away from the planet under a lucrative (if morally dubious) spokesperson contract for the Bureau of Shipping, you return to visit some old pals and recover from corporate burnout. But before your vacation can even begin, a mysterious blast from the planet’s surface sends you crashing into a new land, far from friends and alone in an alien wilderness.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Explore a Dynamic Alien World</strong> – Woanope is alive, thrumming with ecological interactions, curious creatures, friendly alien societies, and heaps of stories to uncover. Lure a Trunkle into an explosive meadow, fish up some Pho-rays by <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a>light, or help those mischievous alien kids commune with a (probably) harmless multidimensional being. What could go wrong?</li><li><strong>Fight on Your Terms</strong> – As you explore Woanope you’ll discover and craft all manner of gadgets, elixirs, and weapons that deliver mix-and-match playstyles. Fight using <a title="Genres > Stealth [73 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a>, traps, environmental hazards, and distance weapons. Or chug an Elixir of Juking, stun your opponent with a Space Wok, and jump right into the fray. Or just get… weird? Turn fish into bombs, or make a Pact with the Void to convert your pain into martial prowess.</li><li><strong>Construct a Home Away From Home</strong> – After a long day of exploring the wilderness, fighting Sluggabuns, and getting sneezed on by Trunkles, you’ll need a place for you and your alien pals to relax. Build a cozy home-away-from-home where you can retreat from the outside world to craft, chat, fish, and farm—or tame that orphaned Sluggababby you adopted—in peace. Just don’t forget to make space for your newfound friends… and potential roommates.</li><li><strong>Build Friendships</strong> – Meet a colorful cast of characters in your journey across Woanope, each with their own unique skills and knowledge.

                <p>Esteemed Polish development studio CD Projekt Red has a number of projects in development, including a remake of the 2007 original The Witcher game. It appears to still be relatively early days for the game, but there are already some key details to know. In this post, we're rounding up everything you need to know.</p><p>In addition to The Witcher remake, CD Projekt is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel,</a> a new Witcher game codenamed Project Sirius, and a new IP codenamed Project Hadar.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4428260-screenshot2025-01-15at2.31.09pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4428260" data-ratio="0.55088495575221" data-width="904" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4428260-screenshot2025-01-15at2.31.09pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4428260"></a><figcaption>The Witcher is getting a remake.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4428260-screenshot2025-01-15at2.31.09pm.png"></figure><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_The_Witcher_remake_be_released_">When will The Witcher remake be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_The_Witcher_remake">Preorder The Witcher remake</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_trailer_information">The Witcher remake trailer information</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_platforms">The Witcher remake platforms</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_story__setting__and_characters">The Witcher remake story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_game_engine">The Witcher remake game engine</a></li><li><a href="#Who_s_developing_The_Witcher_remake_">Who's developing The Witcher remake?</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_development_news">The Witcher remake development news</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="When_will_The_Witcher_remake_be_released_"><strong>When will The Witcher remake be released?</strong></h2><p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/46225/the-witcher-remake-is-in-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced The Witcher remake in October 2022</a>, and there is no word on a release date as of yet.</p><h2 id="Preorder_The_Witcher_remake">Preorder The Witcher remake</h2><p>Preorders for The Witcher remake are not open yet, but it can be assumed that players will be able to eventually order the game from CD Projekt's own GOG store in addition to a variety of other destinations.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_trailer_information">The Witcher remake trailer information</h2><p>As of yet, CD Projekt has not released any official trailers for The Witcher remake.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_platforms">The Witcher remake platforms</h2><p>CD Projekt has not announced any platforms for The Witcher remake, but PC seems to be a given, while it is expected the game will also come to console platforms.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_story__setting__and_characters">The Witcher remake story, setting, and characters</h2><p>The Witcher remake is a new version of the game "rebuilt from the ground up." CD Projekt Red boss Adam Badowski <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/46225/the-witcher-remake-is-in-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> "going back to this place and remaking the game for the next generation of gamers to experience" feels "just as big, if not bigger" than when the studio first released the original game in 2007.</p><p>The game is based on Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski's novel series, taking place in a medieval fantasy world and telling the story of the monster-hunter Geralt of Rivia and his travels throughout a dangerous world filled with human and fantastical enemies alike. It's expected the remake will tell the same story.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_game_engine">The Witcher remake game engine</h2><p>The Witcher remake is being made using Epic's Unreal Engine 5, which is the newest version of the engine. CD Projekt has a deal in place with Epic to make more of its games using Unreal Engine 5 as well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">including The Witcher 4.</a> Previously, The Witcher series was developed using CD Projekt's own RedEngine.</p><h2 id="Who_s_developing_The_Witcher_remake_">Who's developing The Witcher remake?</h2><p>CD Projekt created The Witcher series, but the studio handed off development to Fool's Theory for the remake. CD Projekt boss Adam Badowski sung the studio's praises, saying the team knows the source material well and understand that fans have been looking forward to a remake for some time. A number of Fool's Theory staffers previously worked at CD Projekt on the original Witcher game. CD Projekt Red is providing "full creative supervision."</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_development_news">The Witcher remake development news</h2><p>A key difference between the original Witcher and the remake is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-be-fully-open-world-unlike-the-original/1100-6509525/" data-ref-id="1100-6509525">the remake will be fully open-world</a>. Not only was the first Witcher game presented in a more linear fashion, the sequel, Assassins of Kings, was as well. These games featured large open zones players could explore. However, progressing the story past certain key points would move players to a new zone, closing off the previous area entirely. The series didn't go fully open world until 2015's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p><p>According to Jakub Rokosz, who heads up the remake's developer, Fool's Theory, parts of The Witcher that are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-remove-simply-bad-and-outdated-elements/1100-6520729/" data-ref-id="1100-6520729">outdated or are "simply bad" will be removed.</a></p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-remake-dev-pledges-to-remove-the-parts-that-are-simply-bad-and-i-think-i-know-whats-first-on-the-chopping-block/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), Rokosz said that "first and foremost, we need an honest, down-to-earth analysis of which parts are simply bad, outdated, and need to be remade," but these changes will be done while "highlighting the parts that are great, should be retained, or are direct key pillars that can't be discarded" for the remake.</p><p>Some fans have already begun predicting which elements will be sent to the chopping block. Obvious changes include the dated combat and traversal systems, while online, fans are speculating that Geralt's infamous "Romance Cards" won't be included in the remake either.</p>
