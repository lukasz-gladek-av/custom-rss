            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fresh off the news that it had banned YouTuber and “predator hunter” Schlep from the game, Roblox has taken to its website to talk about the “removal of vigilantes” from the platform. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/more-on-removal-of-vigilantes-from-roblox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy post</a>, Roblox’s chief safety officer Matt Kaufman discussed the company’s policy regarding “vigilantes” and why they remove them from the game.</p>



<p><strong>“We have been monitoring vigilante activity on Roblox for some time,”</strong> Kaufman said. <strong>“These groups began by reporting safety concerns, commenting on news about Roblox, and challenging us to do better. We appreciated this feedback and used these reports to improve our safety systems.”</strong></p>



<p>Kaufman continued to say that, recently, activity within Roblox “evolved”. Rather than just report safety concerns, he said, these people began “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-legal-notice-banned-predator-hunter-freeschlep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impersonating children and actively sought to connect with adult users</a>“. The conversations would then mimic what they believed to be inappropriate behavior while actively encouraging others to connect on different social media and messaging platforms. These actions would bypass Roblox’s safety systems.</p>



<p><strong>“These were not one-off situations and we saw the behavior accelerating across many accounts,”</strong> he said. <strong>“This activity created an unsafe environment and normalized behavior that is both unacceptable on Roblox and is against our&nbsp;Terms of Use. Our policies prohibit directing other users off Roblox to another platform through chat and having/simulating sexually explicit conversations. These are serious policy violations that risk removal from the platform.”</strong></p>



<p>Kaufman said that none of the activities he mentioned were acceptable on Roblox. He said that the company has teams who are dedicated to reviewing and investigating the reports that are received. </p>



<p><strong>“When we find that violations have occurred, we act in accordance with our policies—up to and including permanently removing users from Roblox and reporting to law enforcement when warranted,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>Kaufman says that due to “privacy considerations”, Roblox can’t let users know if their reports led to any consequences. The company, he says, wants to protect the privacy of users as they work to keep them safe. Roblox, he said, submitted 254,522 reports in 2024 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) while also regularly meeting with the NCMEC to learn how to best support the agency and law enforcement.</p>



<p>It was said that Roblox understands the frustration from players in regards to how they handle reports of violative behavior that occurs outside of the game. Kaufman says that they would often be sent as screenshots from other applications, but they still do their best to investigate the reports. Action, however, can’t be taken without verification or similar behavior being observed within Roblox itself. </p>



<p>Despite these concerns from the community, Kaufman implored users to continue to report any and all concerns they may have so that they can “remove bad actors”.</p>



<p><strong>“Rather than taking actions that violate our policies and potentially creating additional risk, we encourage users to report issues through the official channels so we can investigate quickly and effectively,” </strong>he said. <strong>“We’ve designed our reporting tools to capture details and metadata that a screenshot cannot, including object IDs, avatar IDs, and context. This additional information goes a long way toward helping us investigate reported incidents.”</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-will-showcase-its-%E2%80%9Crecent-and-upcoming-releases%E2%80%9D-with-a-90-minute-capcom-presents-panel-at-new-york-city-comic-con.1270464/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom is hosting a 90-minute long panel at New York City Comic-Con later this year in October, where it will showcase "<em>recent and upcoming releases</em>" in its portfolio.</p>



<p>It's currently the next big showcase we're aware of for Capcom, as the company will also be in Germany next week for Gamescom, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-sgf-2025-hands-off-impressions/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> featured at the annual showcase. Reported by <a href="https://ew.com/new-york-comic-con-2025-panels-game-of-thrones-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-x-men-reunion-exclusive-11790222">Entertainment Weekly</a>, the panel will take place at the con's main stage on Friday, October 10, 2025, at 3:45pm.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what Capcom brings to the 90-minute showcase, as for now we can only speculate that it'll be more on Requiem ahead of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">February 2026 release</a>, and potentially another look at the recently announced mobile game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-survival-unit-mobile-game-reveal-capcom/">Resident Evil Survival Unit</a>.</p>



<p>We could also potentially get a better look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>, which we know is due out on Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year, but no release date has been provided yet.</p>



<p>Or maybe we'll get a reveal of a brand new game in the Devil May Cry series, which hasn't had a new entry since 2019's Devil May Cry 5, though it was still the company's<a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-is-capcoms-best-selling-title-in-q1-fy2026-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-have-dropped-significantly-since-launch/"> best-selling game in the first quarter of Capcom's FY2026.</a></p>



<p>Again, this is all just speculation, since New York City Comic-Con hasn't previously been a hot-bed for videogame related announcements and reveals. Anything like a new DMC game or a new game in general is probably being saved for a more game-specific stage, like The Game Awards, which will be about two months away at the time of the panel in October.</p>



<p>Regardless, it'll be interesting to see how Capcom fills up that 90-minute block, and hopefully it's not just news about games in its portfolio that are already out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Oh Thank God, The Battlefield 6 Open Beta Is Back]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back.1270458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>I’ll be honest, this last week I spent most of it sitting around and feeling down because all I wanted to do was play more <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628">Battlefield 6</a>.</em> And now, it’s back for one more open beta weekend, and this time around, there’s some new content, too. That will likely help its player count numbers grow even higher as <em>BF6</em>, months before launch, already feels like a blockbuster success for EA.</p> <p>Here’s everything you need to know about the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta</a>, including when it starts and ends, what’s included in this new beta weekend, where you can play it, and more.</p> <h2>When Does The <em>Battlefield 6</em> Open Beta Start And End?</h2> <p>On August 14, as EA and Battlefield Studios previously announced, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta returned on all platforms. And this time around, there isn’t any weird “early access” period where you’ll need a code to play. This weekend, anyone can hop in right away and start capturing control points and blowing up buildings.</p>

 <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-battlefield-6-open-beta-nyc-teaser-trailer-gameplay-1851786700"><em>BF6</em></a> open beta started on Thursday, August 14 at 4 a.m. EDT and ends on Sunday, August 17 at 4 a.m. PDT. That means you, and over <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-call-of-duty-record-2000616838">350,000 other fans</a>, have around 72 hours or so to play more of what might be the best online shooter of 2025. And maybe, if EA is feeling generous, the beta will get extended a bit. It’s happened before. We can only hope.</p> <h2>Is There Any New Content In The Second Weekend Of <em>BF6</em>‘s Open Beta?</h2> <p>Yes! Earlier this week, ahead of the beta’s launch, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/open-beta-week-2-playlist-options">EA published an in-depth blog</a> about the second and final beta weekend, confirming that a new map and game modes were being added. There are also some changes to how playlists work, with new options that combine some modes and rotate out during the beta.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 EMPIRE STATE PS5 Pro Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7cl2WRcIYc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The big news in weekend two is a new map to explore and blow up. It’s called “Empire State” and it’s set in New York City. I played this map during a preview event last month and really enjoyed it. However, some players might be sad to learn that this new NYC-themed map is not a massive one. We know there are big maps in the game, but it seems we won’t be getting any during the beta.</p>

 <p>Also being added to the beta are two new modes: Squad Deathmatch and the <em>Battlefield</em> classic Rush. At the previously mentioned preview event, I got to play Squad Deathmatch, and it was no good due to tiny maps and <em>CoD</em>-like combat. That’s not the kind of experience I want from <em>Battlefield</em>. Rush, on the other hand, is a fan-favorite mode, and I’m excited to see it return in <em>BF6</em>. There will be some new beta-only challenges, too.</p> <h2>Does the <em>BF6</em> Open Beta Include A Server Browser?</h2> <p>No! However, EA has added a new way to join matches and find specific modes and maps in the <em>Battlefield 6</em> beta. This new option is called “Custom Search.” Here’s how EA describes it:</p>

 <p>“Custom Search allows you to choose your favorite combinations of maps and modes. For example, if you want to play Conquest on Siege of Cairo, then matchmaking will prioritize putting you in a match with this combo, if available. During Open Beta, Custom Search will be available for Open Weapon mode playlists so you can mix and match maps and modes as you prefer.”</p> <p>It should be noted that EA makes it very clear that this isn’t a server browser. We know Portal, a separate mode in <em>BF6</em> that will feature user-made content, will feature a server browser. But the beta and traditional multiplayer in BF6, for now at least, won’t include the old school tool.</p> <h2>Are people already cheating in the<em> Battlefield 6</em> open beta?</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686">That is indeed a thing that happened during the last beta weekend.</a> Players online shared clips of people using what appeared to be wall hacks and other cheat software during the <em>BF6</em> open beta. EA says it has banned thousands of players and blocked even more attempts at cheating in the beta, but some people are annoyed that the game forces you to use Secure Boot on PC to help deter cheaters, which can be a hassle for some users, and yet still has a problem with people hacking it.</p>

 <p>I’ll say that in my time playing <em>BF6</em> last weekend, I never encountered anyone blatantly cheating. I did, however, run into people using flick aim, a controversial addition to <em>BF6</em> that some players say is unfair and makes the game too twitchy. The idea behind flick aim is that players on all platforms can assign buttons that almost instantly “flick” their character in a specific direction. For example, you could assign flick backward to down on the d-pad and be able to instantly pull a 180 spin at the touch of a button.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a must have setting in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> Flick Look allows you to achieve an instant quick 180 in combat! <a href="https://t.co/ElMW1yvrhh">pic.twitter.com/ElMW1yvrhh</a></p> <p>— TacticalBrit (@TheTacticalBrit) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1953513296042053713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While some players aren’t happy about this and have reportedly even accused others online of cheating when seeing them use the in-game flick options, others point out that it gives console and controller users a way to compete with mouse players.&nbsp;Personally, I think flick aiming options in <em>Battlefield 6</em> are fine, but perhaps my opinion will change on that if and when more players start using it and how that changes up the flow of combat in the game.</p>

 <h2>So, Is <em>Battlefield 6</em> Any Good?</h2> <p>As someone who has played every mainline <em>Battlefield</em> game, as well as an incredibly long list of other online shooters like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, I think <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>Battlefield 6</em> is fantastic</a>. If the full game can match or even exceed what’s in the beta and what I played during that preview event in July, I think there’s a really good chance <em>BF6</em> is a massive hit with both players and critics.</p> <p><em>BF6</em>‘s combat is snappy and feels wonderful, but also doesn’t feel too fast or twitchy like modern <em>Call of Duty</em>. Instead, soldiers have a weight to them, and firefights can go on for an extended amount of time as players lay down cover fire using extremely loud and dangerous-sounding guns. This is the gritty, grounded modern warfare <em>Battlefield</em> game that we’ve been missing since <em>Battlefield 4.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>I literally felt sad for most of the week, playing or doing anything else. All I’ve wanted to do these last few days is load up <em>BF6</em> and blast some fools while helping my team win. So I’m excited that the <em>BF6</em> open beta is back for one more weekend. Sadly, after this, we’ll all have to wait until October 10 to play <em>Battlefield 6</em> again when it launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. As someone once said, <a href="https://youtu.be/-KJPP7GkuPU">“The waiting is the hardest part.”</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-libra-summons-everdark-tips-2000617780</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign%E2%80%98s-newest-boss-fight-is-pure-chaos-and-i-love-hate-it.1270455/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereign-libra-fissure-1851786568">rotating summer boss fight extravaganza</a> just reached peak chaos. Libra Creature of Night, AKA Equilibrious Beast, is the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-night-reign-libra-madness-orb-sigil-phase-1851782989">latest Everdark Sovereign</a>, turning what was already arguably the hardest boss fight in the game into something even more punishing. But not in the way players expected. Instead of simply multiplying the difficulty of the original encounter, Libra returned with completely new mechanics that revolve around summoning an army of clones that swarm players in the fight. I love it. And I hate it.</p> <p>One of the things I enjoy about FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-endless-mode-datamine-depths-relics-2000616334">weekly Everdark Sovereign updates</a> is that they go live around 9:00 p.m. on Wednesday nights. Everyone logs into the game, goes about their usual runs, and runs into a brand new boss fight with no idea of what to expect. While it was relatively easy to muddle through recent boss fights with the right builds and the right amount of patience, Everdark Libra has been very different. His second phase begins early in the fight and revolves around summoning mirror images of the players facing him.</p> <p>Sure, okay, a trio of invaders. Straightforward enough. But they’re surprisingly tanky and lethal, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpxsrq/solo_guardian_is_unplayable_against_everdark_libra/">especially the Guardians and Wylders</a>. Plus, not long after you defeat them, Libra summons even more. Then he starts pelting the battlefield with madness glyphs and projectiles. An added layer of bullet hell ensues. Confidence borne of dozens of back-to-back wins <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpnmhk/what_the_actual_fuck_just_happened/">immediately shatters</a>. Everyone starts running for their lives. They can barely survive the adds, let alone get chip damage here or there on Libra. Meanwhile, cryptic text keeps flashing across the screen as Libra performs different rituals. What does it mean? Oops, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpznvt/whole_village_chasing_our_revenant_we_are_truly/">you’re already dead</a>!</p>

   <p>What makes this whole ordeal exhilarating instead of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpp0z5/turning_the_best_boss_in_nightreign_into_a_summon/">just a cheap summon gimmick</a> is that there’s a method to the madness. It just requires you to approach the first couple of times fighting Everdark Libra like a researcher. It trains you to watch the battlefield carefully, analyzing cause and effect, poking and prodding his attack patterns for underlying vulnerabilities that can be exploited. You can feel the chaos change in real time if you’re a consummate lurker on the <em>Nightreign</em> subreddit.</p> <p>So what’s actually going on in the fight? Players have been trained to mostly eschew Libra’s “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1ld9fg7/libras_deals_cheatsheet/">deals</a>” that give powerful buffs with unique and, in many cases, severe drawbacks. He offers them in the field during regular playthroughs and right before the beginning of his boss fight. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpp5cb/enhanced_libra_gimmicks_explained/">In the Everdark version, however, he also starts enforcing</a> them in the middle of the fight, whether you like it or not. You might get infinite flask heals that decrease your level each time or the passive frenzied fire attacks that also build up your own madness meter.</p> <p>Success in the fight requires constant awareness of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpojrc/all_of_everdark_libras_new_effects/">which rituals are in effect</a>. “Preaches Madness” imbues all attacks with madness, which can be used to break Libra as well (madness is one of his weaknesses). NPCs can get summoned almost every minute, but “Incites a Riot” will lead them to start fighting one another or even attack Libra. The longer into the fight you get, the more all of these effects begin stacking. And that’s before Libra uses one of his attacks to partition the battlefield with lines that punish the player when crossed.</p>

   <p>How do you win? Like in most FromSoftware fights, with a combination of patience and practice, which people with over a hundred hours in <em>Nightreign</em> aren’t accustomed to doing anymore. We’ve mastered the game, after all. We should be able to brute-force through any fight on skill and instincts alone. “You’ll need to completely rewire your brain from standard, rushed play,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mq4bwu/heres_how_to_beat_libra_patience_and_planning/">one player noted</a> on the subreddit. Everdark Libra isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon. This also requires players to approach how they normally do their daytime runs differently. More focus on stamina and buffs that help with swarms of enemies rather than upgrades aimed at bursting down a single target as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpw4xr/peak_chaos_thoughts/">are split</a> on whether the whole thing is genius or junk. Some love all of the complex moving pieces colliding into one frantic mess. Others hate fighting NPCs. “I want to fight Libra,” wrote one fan. “Not clones. I want a crazy grand attack. Not whatever that wet fart was.” I can sympathize! My favorite <em>Nightreign</em> fights by far are the ones that focus almost exclusively on the nuts and bolts of managing enemy aggro and frame-perfect dodging. The original Libra fight and Everdark Gaping Jaw both excelled at that.</p> <p>Eventually, winning those fights felt great, even if getting up to that point was sometimes a frustrating slog against my own limits. Everdark Libra is the opposite. Defeating him won’t feel like overcoming some great obstacle. But the experience of “solving” the fight and trying to find a way through all of the chaos more than makes up for it.</p>

Players will create new "timerunner" characters and experience faster leveling times, increased reputation gains, and an accelerated weekly content lockout schedule to make progressing even faster.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb0me06Fvcs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nb0me06Fvcs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There are, however, some big changes from last year's remix event, as recently <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24224370/watch-the-latest-wowcast-to-learn-about-legion-remix" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">outlined</a> by Blizzard. Instead of Mists of Pandaria Remix's ever-upgrading cloak and gem system, Legion Remix will instead double down on Legion's expansion-defining Artifact weapons. Players will earn an upgrade currency that can be used to upgrade their Artifacts even further than in the original Legion, with new upgrade trees that will see players embracing one of five different damage types--Nature, Fel, Arcane, Storm, or Holy. They'll also be able to find jewelry slot items that can add additional ranks to Artifact traits, increasing the weapon's power even further. Thankfully, players will be able to freely respec their Artifact weapon traits at any time.</p><p dir="ltr">Power for power's sake is nice, but Blizzard is introducing some additional challenges for players to put their upgraded Artifact weapons to the test. A new feature inspired by Diablo's world tiers will allow players to upgrade the difficulty of the game's open-world content to Heroic. Enemies will have more health and, in another move from Diablo, affix-like buffs that will make them even more difficult to overcome but yield greater rewards. In yet another page from Diablo's playbook, powerful shrines, called Timewarped Obelisks, can be found through the open world that grant players powerful temporary buffs. As Legion introduced the Mythic+ dungeon system, it will be back in Legion Remix with the expansion's original affixes, as well as four new ones for players to overcome.</p><p dir="ltr">A major part of the appeal of Mists of Pandaria Remix was as a means to earn exclusive cosmetics or hard to obtain items from the original expansion. Legion Remix is no different, though Blizzard has taken some criticism from the last go around. A frequent complaint during Pandaria Remix was that it was annoying that the event's central currency, Bronze, was used to both purchase cosmetics but also to upgrade gear, often making players choose between the two.</p><p dir="ltr">Bronze is coming back for Legion Remix, but this time it will only be used for buying cosmetics. Gear upgrades will instead come from simply doing more difficult content, which should eliminate some of the tension found in Pandaria Remix between upgrading or buying event-exclusive cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">On the cosmetics front, players will be able to earn all kinds of new loot, including fel-infused versions of Legion's class mounts and a corrupted version of Varian Wrynn's swords. Blizzard is promising "plenty of never-before-released mounts, transmog sets, and more" as part of the event.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas Pandaria Remix released with all of the expansion's content at once, Legion Remix will instead roll out Legion's content updates every two weeks. Each update will increase the maximum item level players can achieve. In a change from Pandaria Remix, characters can be transferred from Legion Remix to the current, The War Within version of the game early as opposed to having to wait for weeks until the end of the event. Transferred characters will be stripped of their Remix-specific items and abilities and given a new set of level-appropriate gear, though Blizzard warns that transferring a character early is a one-way trip and can't be undone.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't know exactly when Legion Remix will arrive, but it will likely be in the next 6-8 weeks, in keeping with Blizzard's fairly consistent update cadence. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">WoW's latest 11.2 update, Ghosts of K'aresh</a>, took players to the shattered homeworld of the Ethereals. The update looks to perfectly tee-up WoW's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-will-get-surprises-and-major-midnight-news-at-gamescom-this-year/1100-6532635/" data-ref-id="1100-6532635">Midnight, which is set to be fully revealed at Gamescom</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Stephen King adaptations have been hot TV property for much of the last decade. From <em>Castle Rock</em> to&nbsp;<em>11.22.63</em>, from <em>Mr. Mercedes</em> to this October’s&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/it-welcome-to-derry-trailer-pennywise-hbo-max-1851787189"><em>It: Welcome to Derry</em></a>, where King’s novels and short stories once made for notoriously terrible television, they’re now very often essential viewing. OK, there’s still a&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-institute-stephen-king-tv-series-mgm-from-lost-1851786460"><em>The Institute</em></a> here and there, but with the incredible Mike Flanagan working on a series based on&nbsp;<em>Carrie</em>, and maintaining that he’s developing&nbsp;<em>The Dark Tower</em>, things for King fans remain pretty great. But we’re never satisfied, so we’ve pulled together all the Stephen King stories we still want to see adapted as premium TV series.</p> <p>While cinematic outings could be astonishing hits (<em>Carrie</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Shining</em>,&nbsp;<em>Stand By Me</em>,&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>, <em>The Shawshank</em> <em>Redemption</em>, <em>The Green Mile</em>), unbearable misses (<em>Silver Bullet</em>, <em>Needful Things</em>, <em>Maximum Overdrive</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Mangler</em>,&nbsp;<em>Secret Window</em>, <em>Dreamcatcher</em>), or just perfect nonsense (<em>The Running Man</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pet Sematary</em>,&nbsp;<em>Creepshow</em>), TV adaptations often made for cringy viewing. If you’ve suffered through 1994’s <em>The Stand</em> or 1995’s&nbsp;<em>The Langoliers</em>, you’ve seen bad things, but they’re nothing compared to&nbsp;2013’s&nbsp;<em>Under the Dome</em>. I have a massive soft spot for 2004’s lunatic <em>Kingdom Hospital </em>(although this was King’s reinterpretation of a Danish show by Lars von Trier), and adored the light-hearted first four seasons of <em>Haven&nbsp;</em>(except that was barely based on&nbsp;<em>The Colorado Kid</em> in the first place), but it’s only in the last ten or so years that King’s work has made for prestige TV.</p> <p>Recently we’ve had Brendan Gleeson and Justine Lupe in <em>Mr. Mercedes</em>, (unfortunately) James Franco and Sarah Gadon in <em>11.22.63</em>, Sissy Spacek and Lizzy Caplan in <em>Castle Rock</em>, and Jason Bateman and Cynthia Erivo in <em>The Outsider</em>, and they’ve all been incredible.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile Mike Flanagan, responsible for Netflix’s extraordinary run of one-and-done horror series like <em>Midnight Mass</em> and&nbsp;<em>The Fall of the House of Usher</em>, is seemingly on a one-man mission to adapt all of Stephen King. He’s already made movies of&nbsp;<em>Gerald’s Game</em> (superb but very tough viewing), <em>Doctor Sleep</em> (a somewhat muddled&nbsp;<em>Shining</em> sequel, struggling under its own attempts to evoke Kubrick), and the critically acclaimed <em>The Life of Chuck</em>, and keeps promising he’s about to make&nbsp;<em>The Dark Tower</em>. What he’s definitely doing next is a TV version of&nbsp;<em>Carrie</em>, due in 2026, and while it will almost certainly be excellent (he’s yet to have a TV show that isn’t), it’s surely the least essential work to adapt, given Brian De Palma’s 1976 version is already one of the greatest movies ever made.</p> <p>So what should have been a bigger priority? Which are the Stephen King stories that we want to see as prestige TV? Here’s our top five.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617807" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617807"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617807">© Hodder &amp; Stoughton</figcaption></figure> <h2><em>Jerusalem’s Lot</em></h2> <p>While I’m very much looking forward to&nbsp;<em>It: Welcome to Derry</em>, I confess to being a bit disappointed that the title gained that preceding “<em>It</em>” at a certain point during its development. I had really been hoping for a more general exploration of the town that was also the setting for <em>Insomnia</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pet Sematary</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Tommyknockers</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bag of Bones</em> (partly) and so many other stories. Like&nbsp;<em>Castle Rock</em>, I was expecting a more general flavor, a town with the potential for so many other supernatural events. Instead, we’re getting four planned seasons, each set 27 years earlier than the events in the most recent movies, for each of Pennywise’s previous feasting sessions. So, given that role I’d hoped for isn’t being fulfilled, I propose <em>Jerusalem’s Lot</em>.</p>

 <p>Salem’s Lot, as the locals call it, is a place best known for the book and multiple adaptations of its vampire story, most recently HBO Max’s very poor effort last year. But it’s also had a prequel and a sequel set in town in the form of short stories <em>Jerusalem’s Lot</em> (which was the basis for <em>Chapelwaite</em>) and <em>One for the Road</em>. It also gets mentioned in so many other books like&nbsp;<em>The Shining</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Dead Zone</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dolores Claiborne</em> and even multiple&nbsp;<em>Dark Tower</em> books. The point is, it’s a place ripe for an anthology show, and while it would clearly have to center on vampires, it wouldn’t need to be only that. The main book had a wealth of characters, certainly enough to support a few seasons of development, and it’d be great to see a 2020s take on the tale. Also, in my ultimate King TV Universe (KTU), it would be an excellent hub show for characters from other outings to pass through.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617806" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617806"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617806">© Hodder &amp; Stoughton</figcaption></figure> <h2><em>Needful Things</em></h2> <p>Honestly, I can’t think of a more perfect Stephen King novel to turn into television. Well, apart from&nbsp;<em>The Dead Zone</em>, but someone already did that.&nbsp;<em>Needful Things</em> tells the tale of a shopkeeper, Leland Gaunt, who moves to Castle Rock to open his peculiar boutique of antiques and obscurities. He’s got something in stock that’s just perfect for every person in town. Strangely, however, Gaunt doesn’t way money as payment, but instead peculiar favors.</p>

 <p>Like so many of King’s books,&nbsp;<em>Needful Things</em> is less about the Bogey Man and his Evil Shop, and much more about a town of characters and their relationships in the face of turmoil. His Castle Rock books always excel in this way, creating characters to deeply love and viscerally loathe, and then when events unfurl, they&nbsp;<em>really</em> matter. And that’s partly why it made for such an awful movie, despite starring Ed Harris as the adored (in the novels) sheriff Alan Pangborn. (The best thing about that film is that it was directed by Fraser C. Heston, who played the baby Moses in Cecil B. DeMille’s <em>The Ten Commandments</em>.) But it’s also why it would work so well as a TV show.</p> <p>Each week we can focus on a different character, their interaction with Gaunt, the implications of their “purchase,” and how it affects their relationships with everyone else. As his evil machinations unfold, the season builds up more and more calamity, with ever more people being drawn into the mire. As it goes on, we then get to watch the band of those looking to fight back, to combat their nemesis, and should it all click into place as gloriously as I think it could, you need not have Gaunt flee the town but rather stay on with a new plan.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617805" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617805"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617805">© Hodder &amp; Stoughton</figcaption></figure> <h2><em>The Eyes of the Dragon</em></h2> <p>This would be such an interesting series to make, firstly because it’s King’s first foray into hardcore fantasy writing, and secondly because many characters appear in vaguely different guises in the other novels. There’s a King Roland of Delain (both <em>Dark Tower</em> references), an evil wizard called Flagg (<em>The Stand</em>&nbsp;and <em>Dark Tower</em>), and the witch Rhiannon (<em>Wizards and Glass</em>). This epic fantasy tale would make so much sense in a post-<em>Game of Thrones</em> world, especially when Amazon keeps trying to adapt wildly too big stories like <em>Wheel of Time</em>–this is just one novel, albeit an enormous one.</p> <p>There have been three failed attempts to adapt this novel, starting in the late ’90s with a movie that never reached production, followed by an abandoned 2012 attempt by Syfy, and an equally unsuccessful attempt by Hulu in 2019. It seems to come down to budget each time, but that’s not a concern for the likes of Amazon or Apple TV–it feels like an odd miss not to grab it.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617804" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617804"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617804">© Hodder &amp; Stoughton</figcaption></figure> <h2><em>Rose Madder</em></h2> <p>I feel like&nbsp;<em>Rose Madder</em> would have been such a disastrous book for any TV network to try to develop at any point in the past, but perhaps now is the right moment. This story of a physically abused woman’s escape from her cop husband is gut-wrenching and incredibly powerful, then made far more complex by its eventual twisting into magical realism. It’s fascinating that despite every short story, lengthy answerphone message and dropped Post-It Note of King’s seemingly getting made into a movie, no one’s touched <em>Rose Madder</em> in the 30 years since it published. Apparently HBO optioned it in 1996 for a TV movie, and in 2011 <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/518441/stephen-king-rose-madder-set-screen/">it was reported</a> that a script had been written and was due to be made by Grosvenor Park, but that never happened either. And good, because there’s far too much here for a film—such an adaptation could only be crass in trying to condense the establishing of Rose’s need to escape and the real danger she’s in with a story that eventually involves magical paintings and symbolic metamorphosis.</p> <p>But as a mini-series, this could be incredible. The time feels very right for a story that explores police violence, and Rose’s story contains so much hope and beauty in the face of violence and fear. With care, precision, and enough time, the peculiarities of this story would have room to play out as the spectacular metaphor they are. I say HBO should give it another go.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617803" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617803"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617803">© Hard Case Crime</figcaption></figure> <h2><em>Joyland</em></h2> <p>One of my all-time favorite Stephen King novels (my favorite, since you asked, is&nbsp;<em>Insomnia</em>, but no one should ever try to make that into a TV show!) is&nbsp;<em>Joyland</em>, a 2013 book written by King for the pulp crime publisher Titan Books. As such, and I won’t say either way, you’re never sure if it’s a straight crime story or whether it will have a supernatural twist.</p>

 <p>To me this feels like perfect Mike Flanagan material. He’s proven he can do the goriest horror, and the lightest positivity, but most of all, he’s proven he has a knack for stories that really care about their characters. This is a story of a young guy getting a summer job at a fairground, then staying on during its closed winter season to investigate a series of murders. There’s no potential for a second season here, but this book is so calm and thoughtful, with a great mystery at its core, that it’d make for a compelling mini-series.</p> <p>The only attempt to adapt it was by Freeform in 2018, but nothing’s ever come of it. And good, because no, not Freeform. Netflix for this one I reckon.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that Call of Duty and Battlefield complement each other in several ways. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-weekend-2-beta-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta weekend 2</a> has arrived, with hordes of players pouring in to try out the new map and modes that have been added. With all the attention Battlefield 6 is getting, many players have already started drawing comparisons with Call of Duty, and here’s what the developers feel about it. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-is-unique-and-offers-things-no-one-really-can">“Battlefield is Unique and Offers Things No One Really Can”</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1955668053250978274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jake Lucky</a>, Respawn Entertainment CEO Vince Zampella and Battlefield GM Byron Beede were asked whether they see Call of Duty as competition, considering that both had been part of the Call of Duty team in the past. Beede replied, stating  Battlefield and Call of Duty have both existed for so long together, and they “complement each other in different ways”. Battlefield has things that Call of Duty doesn’t, and vice versa. </p>



<p>Beede adds that Battlefield features elements like “destruction, the class system,” and more, which make it an “amazing experience.” The game is a competitor in a way, “like every other game’s a competitor kind of in a way”, but “Battlefield is unique and offers things no one really can”. </p>

<p>During the same interview, Zampella and Beede also touched on topics like community feedback, the class system, anti-cheat systems, the Battle Royale tease, and more. Players should also be aware that this interview was recorded during the first open beta weekend. </p>



<p>In contrast to what the developers have stated, former Blizzard boss feels Battlefield 6 will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-is-going-to-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-this-year-according-to-former-blizzard-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boot stomp</a>” Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s be real, Magic: The Gathering is complicated. I've been playing it for decades, but knowing how or where to start is intimidating if you haven't – until last year, when a product called the <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4Dw2?object_uuid=52bef2d0-569a-4524-b074-f5960d4916ca&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Foundations Beginner Box</a> finally provided the excellent starting point paper Magic has needed. Now, with a brand <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXLxL?object_uuid=52bef2d0-569a-4524-b074-f5960d4916ca&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">new Beginner Box</a> themed around the game’s upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-avatar-the-last-airbender-where-to-buy">crossover with Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> just a few months away, that inviting front door is being opened up to an even wider audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of the Avatar set’s first look earlier this week, Wizards of the Coast sent me the Avatar Beginner Box to open up and try out for myself. It’s been every bit the flavorful introduction I hoped it would be, full of fun references to the cartoon show and simple but still mechanically interesting cards to ease newcomers in. And with over 100 brand new cards, some of which are unique to this product while others are from the main set, we have a massive amount of spoilers to show off here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You can flip through the slideshow below or watch the video above to see every card in the Avatar: The Last Airbender Beginner Box:</strong></p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Card in the Avatar: The Last Airbender Beginner Box - Magic: The Gathering</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve already tried the Foundations Beginner Box, this is pretty much the exact same thing with new cards and an Avatar-themed coat of paint – and if you haven’t, or are simply an Avatar fan who is dipping a toe into Magic for the first time, this is genuinely a great place to get started. It comes with 10 differently themed Jumpstart decks, each of which is essentially half of a 40-card deck so that you and a friend can each grab two, shuffle them together, and play against each other on even footing. It also comes with a simplified rule book (trust me, you don’t need to start off with the comprehensive rules), two fold-out playmats to give you a sense of how the game is laid out, and some dice and tokens to keep track of other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are 120 total nonland cards in the Beginner Box, 50 of which have the TLE set code, which is represented by the set symbol that looks like Aang’s Glider (47 are brand new, while three are existing cards reprinted with new Avatar art). These cards are <em>not</em> part of the main set, instead only legal in places like Commander or other formats where they were already playable. The rest of the cards are from the main Avatar set, which has the set code TLA and a set symbol that looks like Aang’s head. Those <em>are</em> legal in Standard, with only four reprints and a handful of duplicates across the 10 theme options. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s hard to think of a better place for Avatar fans to start than this.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The real brilliance of the Beginner Box is how two of those Jumpstart decks are actually designed as a guided tutorial of sorts to show you and another player the ropes. They come stacked in a specific order and aren’t meant to be shuffled ahead of your first game, with each player getting their own guide book full of instructions to follow. These walk you through a mostly scripted game, complete with cute little word bubbles from Avatar characters discussing it on some of the pages. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not like playing that on-rails match is particularly exciting, but by taking a note out of a lot of board game rule books that do something similar, the Beginner Box is able to provide a foundation of understanding that is a truly effective learning tool. Magic has a lot of moving parts that are mostly invisible, relying on the players to track things like the phases of a turn or who has an opportunity to act at any given time – it’s a big reason why my go-to recommendation for learning the game has long been to download the MTG Arena digital client and play through that tutorial online since it handles those things for you. (And, to be fair, that is still quite a good way to learn.) But there’s just something satisfying about learning to play this paper game with paper cards, and that tutorial match sets you up for success in a way Magic has largely lacked offline. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also important that the Beginner Box isn’t <em>just</em> a tutorial as those introductory decks then become a part of the 10 half-deck pool, letting you mix and match themes, like pairing a green deck full of big creatures with a black deck all about going on the offensive. The idea of set packets like this isn’t anything new to Magic (Avatar is even getting its own proper Jumpstart release as well), but when the deck building of constructed formats like Standard or Commander can have a higher barrier of entry and the knowledge required for limited formats like Draft can be intimidating, it continues to be one of the most intuitive and approachable ways to enjoy Magic early on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, most of the praise I’ve slung so far is true of the original Beginner Box, too. What sets this one apart is obviously its Avatar flavor. As a huge fan of the show, it was a delight to recognize so many loving references across these decks – from different takes on characters like Aang or Sokka, to goofy moments like the one on the card How To Start a Riot from the show's Boiling Rock episodes. There are more of Avatar’s iconic hybrid animals than I can count, clever callbacks to some of my favorite moments, and friendly (or menacing) faces in every hand you draw. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, I don’t think any of these cards are going to light the competitive world on fire or anything, but they aren’t supposed to. They’re relatively simple takes on these people and places, meant to bridge the gap between Avatar fans and its Magic set. A card like Path to Redemption, which basically imprisons an opposing creature until you pay to essentially turn into an Ally, isn’t the strongest version of this sort of effect we’ve ever seen, but it is an incredibly neat way to tell part of Uncle Iroh’s story. It’s the kind of thing that helps make what Magic is trying to do flavor-wise make sense.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other cards make more direct references with their tie-ins, particular when it comes to bending. Water, earth, fire, and airbending are all represented in both the main set and the Beginner Box, each offering a different take on what they mechanically look like in Magic. Waterbending, earthbending, and firebending even have Jumpstart decks here specifically named after them that are blue, green, and red, respectively. Those colors make sense, with airbending also intuitively making an appearance in one of the white half-decks, but they don’t seem to be <em>restricted</em> to them either, with some Earthbending showing up in black in this product and some other color blending happening in the main set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, using one of Magic’s Universes Beyond crossovers as the theme for a new version of the Beginner Box seems like a great idea. Wizards of the Coast has talked a lot about how many new folk these tie-ins bring to the game, with the recent Final Fantasy set <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-expansion-made-200-million-in-just-one-day"><u>blowing away even the loftiest of expectations</u></a>. So, if you’re an Avatar fan who is curious about what this crossover entails but is intimidated by the three-decade old reputation Magic carries around with it, it’s hard to think of a better place to start than this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2698870/Midnight_Murder_Club/">Midnight Murder Club</a>, the new first-person shooter from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/knockout-city-dodgeball-is-life/">Knockout City</a> developer Velan Studios and published by PlayStation has surprise-launched out of early access today.</p>



<p>Similar to how Velan Studios took dodgeball, a game most people are introduced to when they're kids and gave it more of an intense spin with Knockout City, the team has turned hide-and-seek into a much more intense, and violent time, with Midnight Murder Club.</p>



<p>The game takes place in a pitch-black mansion, where players have to navigate the darkness through audio cues. Eric Feurstein, game director on Midnight Murder Club at Velan Studios, said in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/14/midnight-murder-club-jumps-out-of-the-early-access-shadows-today/">PlayStation Blog post</a> the team wanted to make its more violent version of hide-and-seek feel "<em>like a party game, where it's tense and spooky one moment, then chaotic and hilarious the next</em>."</p>



<p>It arrived on PC in early access this past March 13, 2025, and at least on Steam, has failed to make much of a splash, since it's only ever reached a concurrent <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2698870/charts/#max">max of 178 players</a>.</p>



<p>Today's 1.0 launch is hoping to change that however, with a new single-player PvE mode called Graveyard Shift, and the introduction of a new mechanic, Wildcards, which the studio hopes will add a bit more chaos to the fun of Midnight Murder Club.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Midnight Murder Club - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/izduT-4RWF4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Another boon in Midnight Murder Club's favor is that you don't need to convince your friends to buy the game with you if you want to try it out. You can buy it, and then get your friends to download the Guest Pass version of the game, which lets them play for free. So long as one person has bought the game, you can fill your team with friends who haven't yet spent a cent on it.</p>



<p>"<em>Midnight Murder Club started out as a weird idea I had almost exactly 10 years ago to this day,</em>" writes Feurstein. "<em>Back in 2015, I hacked together a small prototype in my bedroom and emailed it to my friends to play together. I never really knew what would become of it and a decade later I finally decided to pitch it to Velan and it was amazing how more people saw the potential of this strange idea of a shooter in the dark.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>In some ways the game is very similar to that small prototype, but also extremely different thanks to all the feedback we received over Early Access</em> <em>and the various playtests with everyone. Very few people get to enjoy this feeling of pitching a game idea, seeing it grow, and then playing the game with the public like we have with Midnight Murder Club</em>."</p>



<p>It's a nice story to hear, how Midnight Murder Club grew from Feurstein's small prototype to its launch today. But if it can't garner the number of players needed to keep a multiplayer game alive, it won't have such a nice ending, and <a href="https://www.knockoutcity.com/updates/knockout-city-special-announcement">go the way of Velan Studios last major release</a>.</p>

Layden, who <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-shawn-layden-aa-space-marine-2-fortnite-1851675017">loves nothing more</a> than to <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-acquisition-preservation-1850951069">profess doom</a> for <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-call-duty-gta-vi-halo-1850391113">video games</a>, implied that Game Pass profits could be the result of “financial jiggery-pokery,” then said that developing a game for the subscription service makes developers a “wage slave.”</p> <p>Layden has being laying into Game Pass for&nbsp;<em>years</em>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-layden-consolidation-is-the-enemy-of-diversity">repeatedly criticizing the subscription model</a>. Noting <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-call-duty-gta-vi-halo-1850391113">ballooning development costs</a> and questioning <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-shawn-layden-console-exclusive-1851325009">whether console exclusives are a good thing</a> in the first place, since leaving Sony in 2021 Layden is routinely wheeled out for a good ol’ gripe. But he’s arguably gone further than ever in his latest round of comments.</p> <p>“They’re not creating value,” said Layden to&nbsp;<em>GI</em> of developers whose games release day-one on Game Pass, continuing that they’re not “putting it in the marketplace, hoping it explodes, and profit sharing, and overages, and all that nice stuff. It’s just, ‘You pay me X dollars an hour, I built you a game, here, go put it on your servers.'” He then described this process as being a “wage slave.”</p>

 <p>“I don’t think it’s really inspiring for game developers,” he added.</p> <p>This odd outburst was all said out of his concern for the health of developers. Appearing to dismiss <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-profit-revenue-5-billion-1851787391">Microsoft’s recent announcement that Game Pass has made $5 billion in the last year</a>, Layden scoffed, “You can do all kinds of financial jiggery-pokery for any sort of corporate service to make it look profitable if you wanted to.” He went on, “You take enough costs out and say that’s off the balance sheet and, oh look, it’s profitable now. The real issue for me on things like Game Pass is, is it healthy for the developer?”</p> <p>What blows my mind about this is just how unlikely “all that nice stuff” actually is for so many game developers, facing the terrible gamble of pouring their blood, sweat, and tears into a game that may not actually find an audience, all without any sense of stability or security. In Layden’s idyllic version of events, all the profit sharing and overages all come right after the “hoping it explodes,” the direct equivalent of <em>South Park</em>‘s Underpants Gnomes’ Phase 2 in their profit-making scheme. And for every developer who’s faced the situation where that hope isn’t fulfilled, for the dozens of teams and studios that collapse every year after a game doesn’t hit, they would have given their arm to have had a stronger wage to support them in the aftermath.</p>

It’s not some abhorrent anomaly, this terrible affront faced by game developers pushed into the miserable situation of having a company pay them up front for their game’s development costs—it’s how most of the world exists. I, right now, am paid for writing <em>this&nbsp;</em>article. I get no profit from its success on the site. And while it sure sounds nice that if a post of mine went huge I’d get a nice extra bundle of cash, I’ll stick with getting paid for my time and effort for all the times they don’t. It’s entirely normal, and in fact often incredibly secure, to get paid for the hours you’re working, not gamble your time against some future pay-off that may never come.</p> <p>Many developers have reported how being hosted on Game Pass has allowed them to stay in business—<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/xbox/with-game-pass-price-hikes-sparking-debate-indie-developers-are-rising-up-to-remind-us-how-vital-the-xbox-subscription-can-be-to-the-tune-of-staggering-numbers/"><em>GamesRadar</em> reported last year</a> how important the service has been to many indie developers. That’s not to say that it’s a pure force for good, because of course it’s not, and there’s obviously huge debate to be had about whether appearing on Game Pass could sometimes cause a game to ultimately lose out on far greater sales had it stuck to the traditional model. But even this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/remedy-control-fbc-firebreak-lowplayer-count-update-1-3-1851785449">a company as big as Remedy made it absolutely clear</a> that the&nbsp;<em>only</em> significant revenue it’s seen so far from <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> has come as a result of day-one Game Pass and PS Plus deals. The idiotic wage slaves.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617753" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617753"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617753">© Remedy</figcaption></figure> <p>This idea that all creativity has to begin in a platonic fervor, then perhaps be bestowed with riches upon its culture-changing success, is the poetic disguise of the worst of capitalism. It says to all creatives, “Don’t settle for a wage, work for less, and if you’re lucky we’ll pay you later.” Yes, he’s arguing that in his ideal world, these developers not only get paid by the magic sky fairies that fund all game development, but also recoup the winnings after their game becomes a massive hit. But that’s not the reality in this industry, and implying that those who opt for security today over the slight possibility of riches later are in some way not being “healthy” just seems foolish. And note that it’s (always) being said by someone who is paid a <em>vast</em> salary for their time, and then receives bonuses, dividends, stock windfalls and so much more on top.</p> <p>Look, I’d love to set humanity free of the need for wages. Obviously universal income should be brought in immediately. I also want to see creatives return to the patron model that drove the creation of art for a thousand years before copyright bullshit broke everything. But these are currently dreams for which we should fight. In the meantime, I kind of like the idea that game developers should embrace the notion that their time and talent is enormously valuable, and they should be fully and properly compensated for their efforts at the time they’re being put in. Yes, definitely give them far more money later should their work become hugely successful and generate vast profits, but that should never be the only model by which they are compensated. For so many teams, it’s vanishingly unlikely. Even if that, for fucks sake, makes them “wage slaves.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Campaign and Multiplayer Will Merge With a 32-Player Mode on ‘Avalon’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-avalon-map-campaign/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-and-multiplayer-will-merge-with-a-32-player-mode-on-%E2%80%98avalon%E2%80%99.1270368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will integrate the campaign’s final mission into a 32-player multiplayer experience for the first time ever in the series.</p>



<p>According to sources who wished to remain anonymous as they couldn’t talk about the game’s plans, Black Ops 7’s hotly rumored ‘Avalon’ map, which was initially planned as a Battle Royale map, will be the title’s 12th and final mission in the Black Ops 7 campaign.</p>



<p>It’s said that although some POIs in Avalon will be present as a part of the game’s campaign (which can be played in up to 4-player co-op), the fully fledged map will be the game’s ‘final mission’.</p>



<p>The final mission sounds awfully like an extraction-based shooter, where players will need to complete objectives and extract, but we’ll have to wait and see exactly what that means.</p>



<p>It was said that the mission will be ‘hardcore’ and similar to other extraction shooters on the market; if you’re killed and your squad is wiped, you will lose all your character’s progress.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-full-integration">Black Ops 7 Full Integration</h2>



<p>It’s said that the somewhat bizarre move for the multiplayer and campaign merge in Black Ops 7 is a part of the game’s full progression integration across all three game modes (campaign, multiplayer, and zombies). Where, no matter where or what you play, you’ll still progress.</p>



<p>That means that even during a campaign mission, players will still be able to level up their weapons, characters, and even the Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Personally, I find it a bit odd that Avalon is being used for the mode, and if this experience is connected to only the premium, perhaps the goal is to offer free-to-play weekends to entice paying players? But does Call of Duty really need that? </p>



<p>More information surrounding the campaign, multiplayer, and zombies will be released on August 19, with the announcement of multiplayer happening at Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>



<p>Whether Black Ops 7’s Avalon will be a future Warzone map is currently unclear. Let me know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>&nbsp;what you think.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Amon Character Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on September 12, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-on-switch-2-will-run-mostly-at-30fps-will-also-support-joy-con-mouse-controls/1100-6533370/">Switch 2 version</a> slated for release on October 3.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>So earlier, y'all described Amon as "the most complicated yet approachable Vault Hunter to date." What does that mean?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nick Thurston</strong>: Yeah, I mean, complexity can mean a whole bunch of different things depending on your lens, but I think when people talk about Amon being complex, it's just the fact that he has so much that he can do as far as abilities. Historically, most Vault Hunters have "I press a button" [abilities. It's fire and forget, and [you set up] a nuke or a buff over time.</p><p dir="ltr">Amon's stuff is all about summoning a thing and doing a bunch of damage, but then he has a press one button and that does one thing, or press a different button and hold that to do another thing. Sometimes, through customization options, you can double tap your action skill button to do two different things and then press and hold to do a third different thing.</p><p dir="ltr">He just has more abilities than any other Vault Hunter numerically because of his trait, which allows him to have forge skills. I wouldn't say he's super complicated, but he has a lot more going on in the middle of combat, and he's a lot more active than I think a lot of people historically expect from Vault Hunters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549723-bl2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549723" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549723-bl2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549723"></a><figcaption>Physically, Amon is one of the largest Vault Hunters to date, rivaling Brick.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549723-bl2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How early into Borderlands 4's development did the Vault Hunters like Amon get finalized, gameplay-wise?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It really just depends, which isn't a great answer. A lot of times, we work in phases where we're like, "Here's the theme. Okay, now that's locked in. Here's action skill one. Now that's locked in. Here's action skill too. Now that's locked in."</p><p dir="ltr">And then sometimes even though we do it and we're happy with it, a year into development, when we start actually playing the game, the game fully comes online, and you can actually do combat. There's been times where we've had a fully realized action skill and where we're like, "Oh, this isn't going to work in our game." Maybe it was cool on paper in a test map, but in real gameplay, it doesn't work.</p><p dir="ltr">So sometimes we have to scrap the whole thing, and that's devastating. That's the worst part. But ultimately, what happens is Vault Hunters evolve over time pretty organically, and by the time that it ends up in the user's hands, it's something that we're really confident in.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549725-bl3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549725" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549725-bl3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549725"></a><figcaption>To match Borderlands 4's darker tone, the team decided to make the Siren character, Vex, much spookier this time around.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549725-bl3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How does the team decide which Vault Hunter gets to be in the next game? What sort of process did Amon go through where the team figured out that the fantasy Viking needed to be picked?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">There's a lot of nuance, but different people get rolled onto the project at different times. When I get rolled on, it's usually they have some concepts of where they want to go. Sometimes it's tied to narrative hooks where they're like, "Here's a darker theme which is going to go with our darker game. We want to operate in this space for this character."</p><p dir="ltr">That's an example of Vex where we were like, "The tone of the game is going to be a little bit darker. We haven't really had a dark-leaning Siren before, so <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">what if we had a Siren that had spooky powers</a>?" And by the time I rolled onto [the project], that was already a thing that was established, but then I had to flesh it out and realize it.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes, however, we only have this general idea of, "Hey, we need a brute character. We need someone who's big and beefy. We need a guy that's going to make enemies tremble in their boots just by seeing him."</p><p dir="ltr">And that was Amon. And Amon was an entirely different Vault Hunter when I started and went through a bunch of [iterations], but a lot of it didn't work out. And needless to say, we ended up switching over to Amon, and I actually had quite a bit of agency with who I thought Amon should be and what he should act like his powers should be. In a lot of ways, Amon is the one I'm most proud of, but that's because I've had the most influence on him.</p><p dir="ltr">But to go back to your point about how we deal with having a bunch of ideas: We constantly have ideas and we're throwing away ideas. We're not going to talk about DLC Vault Hunters [in this interview], but we did say that we are going to have them [in Borderlands 4]. And in that scenario, we actually polled the company and we were like, "Hey, does anyone have ideas?"</p><p dir="ltr">And we had probably, I don't know, 50 to a hundred ideas pitched. Some of them are like, "Oh, this could be a thing." And some of them are like, "Oh, the technology isn't there." And some of them are like, "This needs to be more fleshed out." Sometimes we'll combine ideas.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549726-bl4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549726" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549726-bl4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549726"></a><figcaption>Borderlands 4 is a seamless world, the first in the series.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549726-bl4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I love that you talk about Amon like he's your baby.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I think they're all my children. [laughs] It's hard to choose. People are like, "Who are you going to play?" And I'm like, "I don't want to pick between my kids."</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>In trailers, we see Amon primarily use incendiary and cryo damage in his abilities. Any narrative significance to these elements that necessitated their inclusion as opposed to others, like corrosive or shock?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's much less narrative. When it comes to picking elements, it's much more about the gameplay. Borderlands, as you know, has elemental matching where fire against fleshy enemies deals more damage, shock destroys shields, corrosive melts armor, [etc]. We always have to look at the elemental grid that we have and [make sure] every Vault Hunter [has] their own gameplay hooks, their own strengths and weaknesses.</p><p dir="ltr">When we're thinking about the elements that we say, "This is the primary character," we're really trying to identify what are his strengths and his weaknesses. Fire and ice, I just think go together aesthetically. I think there's some poetry there. He also has a lot of shock stuff, but that's more of a secondary thing. But yeah, I mean really we just want to create different experiences. If every Vault Hunter was good at fire damage, then fire would be less interesting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549722-bl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549722" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549722-bl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549722"></a><figcaption>Amon's abilities primarily deal incendiary and cryo damage.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549722-bl.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>With </strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/"><strong>Borderlands 4 adopting a seamless world</strong></a><strong>, how far can I throw one of Amon's axes? This is important Nick, I need numbers for my future career in trick shot compilations. [laughs]</strong></p><p dir="ltr">[laughs] I'll have to get you hard numbers later, but you can do some absolutely silly trick shots.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Excellent.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It won't shock me if there [is] a YouTube video where it's like, "There's an enemy this far in front of me and I'm going to chuck [Amon's axe] up in the air," and then six seconds later it'll finally come down and hit [the enemy] in the head.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>If you aren't being silly in a Borderlands game, then what are you even doing? Speaking of, so much of Borderlands' narrative is tied to humor. How does Amon fit into that? What type of jokes does he bring to the table?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The big, brute character is often dumb, but Amon is definitely very smart, and that is all about his upbringing. He was a part of a cult as a child, and his family died from a Vault monster so now he's filled with rage and filled with the need to exact revenge. But as you can see from a lot of the dialogue from the quips in the gameplay trailers, he's actually a very warm person, and he actually speaks in this warrior poet, almost scripture kind of way. If I had to equate him to [a trope in humor], he's the straight man.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Narratively, both Vex and Rafa have strong ties to long-standing pieces of Borderlands lore: the Sirens and Tediore. Is Amon also a callback to something familiar or is he mostly connected to a brand-new piece?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">He does not have any direct ties to anything that fans would know about. Of course, long-time fans are aware of both Vault monsters and how they're tied to the Eridians, and we'll be diving into a little bit of familiar lore there as far as, "Oh, there's cults that worship these Vault monsters that fans know about." So that will be familiar. But everything about who his family worshiped and stuff--I don't know if we will explicitly talk about it [ahead of launch], but that is all brand new stuff.</p>

		<p>Roguelikes have to do a lot to actually stand out these days, because not only is it a crowded field, but also one where the overall quality can be incredibly high. It’s not enough to be competent; the game has to be not only mechanically satisfying, but ideally mechanically different as well. Ovis Loop manages to do both of these things pretty darn well, even in Early Access.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ovis Loop | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1n91AzCgBn4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ovis Loop puts you in the shoes of a sheep, sort of. You might be all woolly, but you get to run around with a massive greatsword, and then absolutely smash the heck out of some wolves, some of which are robotic, and some of which are horribly mutated into things that can spit out fireballs, or just be massive. You’re a sheep hunting wolves, and that’s just a good concept to start with.</p>


<p>Without digging too deeply into the details of the story, being a roguelike means that it unfolds as you explore the levels and beat up baddies. Of course, so do your abilities. While the base level of fighting in the game is to just jump, hit, and dodge, the skills you have can completely change what you’re actually doing as you fight. There are plenty of cool builds to try in the game, even at this point. I really like mucking around with the electric attacks, as they not only deal damage, but also cause massive lightning strikes as the debuff up, but the drone builds are also good fun. There’s just something satisfying about constantly throwing out drones instead of fighting on your own, and that’s a blast.</p>


<p>Your skills go way deeper than this though. Each skill has passive augment slots as well as active ones. You can change the passives up so that the skill cools down faster, does more elemental damage, or gets more damage in exchange for less defence. The active slots let you put in extra skills, which you can activate sequentially as you go, and all of them get the passive buffs too. This lets you have far more skills than the four you eventually unlock, and also build up specific combos as you please.</p>
<p>You can also choose to make a build that hardly uses skills at all, and just focus on the core attacks and your weapon too. You do get new weapons to choose from as well, including the starting greatsword, but expanding into things like an electric rapier and even a gunblade. Each of these theoretically unlocks different playstyles, and it’s just a joy to muck around with them all.</p>

<p>Ovis Loop isn’t perfect, despite my glowing praise. The balance feels a little bit wonky for some of the boss and mini-boss fights, and there are some weird bugs too. Although it’s worth noting that a couple of those bugs actually got removed in the Early Access review window while I was playing, and that’s got to be a reassuring fact for the game’s continued development.</p>
<p>Ovis Loop is already one of the coolest action roguelikes I’ve played, and if it can keep improving and adding things while it’s in Early Access, it’s got potential to be one of my overall favorites. I’ve got high hopes for this my little sheep hero, and I reckon a lot of you will too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Crosswind Crew has announced that its eponymous debut game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/crosswind-is-an-upcoming-f2p-pirate-survival-mmo-in-development-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Crosswind</a>, will debut at some point next year <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041230/Crosswind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>. The studio also revealed a shift from the previous plan to deliver a free-to-play survival MMO to a more traditional premium survival game. Following the recent Alpha test, the developers surveyed players' preferences and behaviors and reached this conclusion.</p>



<p>New content, features, and gameplay will be added based on player feedback, such as the new biome and crew improvements shown in the summer teaser below. Crosswind Crew is also exploring new options available thanks to the transition to a paid experience, like the potential for mods and dedicated servers.</p>

<iframe title="Crosswind: Summer Dev Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9WFRYYWFOM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Crosswind is a survival game set in an alternative Age of Piracy. Featuring the classic "build, craft, survive" formula, it offers challenging boss fights, sea battles, boarding actions, and seamless ship-to-land gameplay. Driven by real-world characters and supernatural powers, the story unfolds as an epic fight against an ancient evil.</p>



<p>Players assume the role of a freelance captain who has been betrayed and stranded after a job gone wrong. What starts as a grounded story of survival and revenge quickly puts them in a conflict between empires, pirate clans, and mysterious dark powers looming on the horizon.</p>



<p>Crosswind lets players seamlessly continue their adventure from sea to land and vice versa: bombard coastal forts from afar, then close in and engage the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. Many different ships are available, from nimble cutters to frigates and even massive galleons.</p>



<p>Crosswind aims to be a refined and comprehensive survival experience at its core. Players will explore the game world's biomes to gather resources and then unleash their creativity through building and crafting. At first, they might build a shelter, which can eventually turn into a fully operational outpost. It is also possible to recruit and expand the crew to speed up harvesting and production.</p>



<p>In combat, a vast arsenal of melee weapons and firearms will be at the player's disposal. Movesets include parrying and dodging enemy attacks while using different strikes to the player's advantage, as well as managing food, potions, and oils to gain powerful buffs. Players will also find challenging bosses and defeating them will provide access to their juicy treasures. Of course, when in trouble, they might call on the aid of their friends via the co-op feature.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-warhammer-age-of-sigmar-flesh-eater-courts-battletome-preview-brings-ravenous</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/latest-warhammer-age-of-sigmar-flesh-eater-courts-battletome-preview-brings-ravenous-regality.1270332/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has dropped a preview for another <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> army. The upcoming <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome contains new mechanics and updated rules for the delusional undead army, and GW has provided a sneak peek.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/nudwrxbe/knightly-bannermen-join-a-riotous-bacchanal-in-the-flesh-eater-courts-armies-and-regiments-of-renown/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community</a> post, Games Workshop provided a glimpse at the changes in the new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome. This is the second undead army to get a spotlight in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-fourth-edition-signals-new-age" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newest edition</a> of the fantasy miniatures war game recently. The other army was the ghostly <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-previews-changes-in-new-warhammer-age-of-sigmar-nighthaunt-battletome" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nighthaunt</a> army.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-flesh-eater-courts-promo-miniatures.jpg?itok=oVmKhiaR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-flesh-eater-courts-promo-miniatures.jpg?itok=SyNT5gjy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>At their core, the Flesh-Eater Courts are still ravenous undead hordes under the strong delusion that they are royalty. That delusion can even be altered on the battlefield, adjusting the horde's behavior.</p>

<p>One of those changes are in the form of the Knights of New Summercourt delegation. It centers around Ushoran, Mortarch of Delusion. This delegation fights alongside Knights, Varghulf Courtiers, and Serfs. With "In Their Sire's Shadow," they can do a free Charge once per battle alongside Ushoran when certain conditions are met.</p>

<p>But Ushoran's behavior can change on a whim, which the <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome embodies. Once per turn, Ushoran can use "A Duel, Good Sir!" to challenge an enemy general. If the general accepts, both they and Ushoran can only target each other until either one of them are defeated.</p>

<p>Since the Flesh-Eater Courts are undead, dying can be more of a setback than a danger. "Red Errantry Hosts" lets you set up a replacement unit of Knights that have been defeated, albeit with half the models (rounded up).</p>

<p>Additionally, all units can utilize certain passives. "Equinox Parade" gives units a Run bonus on round one. "Ritual Dance" gives a movement bonus in round 3. And "Eat Your Fill" lets units heal after combat on round four.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome will be available for pre-order this upcoming Saturday.</p>

            <p>If you like your Bethesda <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with a bit more of another sort of Bethesda RPG, I've got good news. An <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> modder's decided to put another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout</a> feature into the 2006's hottest 'supposed to be a jungle, but Lord of the Rings is popular' game. This time, it's Adoring Fan skill bobbleheads, and they might help you come to find the annoying lad a bit more loveable.</p>
<p>Hey, if nothing else, you can stick them on the mantelpiece of that house you're using Obiliv in a thing called love's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system">Fallout-inspired settlement building mod</a> to erect.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4997">Bobbleheads of Cyrodiil</a>'s the name of the latest entry in the burgeoning genre, and it's the work of modder TheJaceWindu. "Ever wanted your own collection of tiny versions of Cyrodiil’s most infamous fanboy? No? [Too] bad," they wrote, "Because now there are 15 of them scattered across Cyrodiil, each lovingly sculpted in the image of the one and only Adoring Fan!"</p>
<p>They're not lying about the lovingly sculpted bit either. Each Adoring Fan bobblehead can pass perfectly for a little plastic model of the Arena's backrub merchant, and as with Fallout's Vault Boys, he's posed/dressed to mirror each skill the trinkets improve. I think my favourite's the one triumphantly posed in Imperial legion armour, which I assume to be the heavy armour bobblehead. Or maybe it's the one that improves your ability to bellow at random criminal scum, then get them in a tight camera zoom headlock, who knows?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bethesda / TheJaceWindu</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Each bobblehead grants a unique passive perk tied to a skill! Ranging from Heavy Armour to Speechcraft, Sneak to Alchemy," TheJaceWindu explains. "Find one, and you’ll gain a permanent boost. Find them all, and you’ll unlock the Collector’s Perk: a juicy bonus of +20 Luck and +100 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/feather">Feather</a>, because nothing says 'I’ve earned it' like hauling around a backpack full of tiny fans.</p><p>"The perks are permanent. Once you collect the little fan you get a passive ability perk that is unique to the associated skill! This means you don't have to keep them in your inventory! Unless you want to, as they weigh nothing! But you can use them to decorate your homes or spruce up your favorite local fighters guild."</p>
<p>They add that they've stuffed the fans in a bunch of nooks and crannies all over Cyrodiil, with some in building, others out in the wilderness, and a few sticking out more than an Elven bloke yelling 'By Azura'. In all seriousness, as much as this mod's not going to suit gritty Oblivion playthroughs (if such a thing is possible, I've not pulled one off yet), I'm definitely bookmarking it in case I need to spice up future wacky ones.</p>
<p>Also, my first thought when I saw this mod was that Adoring Fan bobbleheads are surely among the gift shop tat you can buy in real life, right? Having glanced at <a href="https://gear.bethesda.net/search?q=adoring+fan&amp;options%5Bprefix%5D=last">Bethesda's official store</a>, while you can get Adoring Fan badges and plushies, it seems they've not thought to crack the bobblehead market with him yet. Maybe they're worried it might cause that Hollywood primadonna Vault Boy to waltz off to his agent and demand more money.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're up for a bit of bobblehead collecting in Oblivion Remastered, you'll first need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/friday-the-13th-the-game">Jason Voorhees</a>, also known as the character who kills teens while wearing a hockey mask in various slasher movies, is back, and we can all say thanks to a beer company for his return. Really.</p> <p>Despite being one of the most iconic and famous slashers in horror movie history, it’s been nearly two decades since Jason Voorhees donned his hockey mask to slaughter people in an official live-action production. Sure, he’s popped up in some video games, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-smash-bros-wb-matrix-jason-all-characters-1851488213"><em>Multiversus</em> and <em>Mortal Kombat</em></a>, and he’s been in some fan films, too. But the last time the ’80s slasher star had killed some teens at Camp Crystal Lake was all the way back in 2009. However, Jason’s 16-year absence is over, and not how I expected.</p> <p>On August 13, <a href="https://youtu.be/O_dEbWGRXsg"><em>Sweet Revenge</em> was released on YouTube. The 15-minute short film</a> features a few couples traveling to a nice cabin by the lake who quickly experience all the tropes you’d expect from a <em>Friday The 13th</em> movie, including an encounter with a creepy guy, old stories of bad things happening, strange noises in the woods, and of course, someone getting into a car to escape but not being able to because they forgot the keys. The short takes a bit to get going, but I really enjoyed it. As a big fan of the<em> Friday the 13th </em>franchise,<em> Sweet Revenge</em> feels a lot like a classic <em>F13</em> slasher despite its short runtime. And I like the new look for Jason, even if some fans find him too skinny.</p> <p>And yes, <em>Sweet Revenge s</em>tarring Jason Voorhees was funded by beer manufacturer Angry Orchard. While you watch people get brutally murdered, count all the apples and Angry Orchard bottles in the shot. According to writer and director <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/features/friday-the-13th-movie-sweet-revenge-jason-killing-campers-1236487104/">Mike P. Nelson in an interview with <em>Variety</em></a>, Angry Orchard was a great partner to work with and didn’t push them to include obvious ads in the short. Instead, there are moments involving apples, including a pretty brutal scene involving an apple in the mouth. In fact, some of the kills in this are so gory that YouTube won’t even let me embed <em>Sweet Revenge</em> in this article. Instead, <a href="https://youtu.be/O_dEbWGRXsg">you’ll have to go watch it on YouTube</a>. Sorry about that.&nbsp; But here’s the trailer:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jason Universe: Sweet Revenge (2025) First-Look Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LZLi7Q5dUoE?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>As for that ending, which I won’t spoil here, it does seem like there’s more story to be told, which Nelson would love to do if given the chance.</p> <p>“I have an idea of where I’d love for the story to go after this,” Nelson told <em>Variety</em>. “It’s not really [in] my hands, whether or not it’s where Horror Inc. and Jason Universe end up going with it. But if I was given the opportunity…Holy crap, dude. I would snatch it up in a heartbeat. ”</p> <p>This short, its classic slasher feel, and Jason’s new look have me excited for a future <em>Friday the 13th</em> movie. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jason-universe-horror-inc-announces-multi-platform-expansion-of-friday-the-13th-franchise?">We know there’s a full “Jason Universe” initiative</a> by the franchise’s owners, with plans to make lots of new <em>F13</em> stuff. Now, let’s just hope fans don’t have to wait another 16 years for any of it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>After a </span><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ballsmusical/balls-the-monster-catchin-musical-comedy"><span>successful Kickstarter campaign</span></a><span>, a solidified venue, and a few rehearsals under its belt, </span><i><span>Balls: The Monster-Catchin’ Musical </span></i><span>ran into a problem back in March: its lead actor had to drop out of the production. The </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> parody show was three weeks away from opening night at Caveat, a comedy theater on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The Professor, a clear homage to the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet-sada-turo-professors-1849001912"><span>Pokémon Professor</span></a><span> who greets players in most games and gives them their first monster, had to embody a nostalgic presence in theatergoers’ minds, and with only weeks to go before opening, co-creators Brandon Zelman and Harrison Bryan had a wild idea. What if they got Stuart Zagnit, the original voice actor of Professor Oak, the iconic scientist who opens the original Game Boy games and serves as Ash Ketchum’s mentor in the animated series?</span></p> <p><span>“Brandon and I sort of like, locked ourselves in a room and said like, ‘What do we do?’” Bryan tells </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “What’s the biggest Hail Mary we can throw right now? Getting the original voice of the actual professor that we grew up with seemed like the most insane possible route, but we had known that Stuart was a musical theater performer for much of his career, and we had connected previously a few years ago.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000617783" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617783"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617783">© Photo by Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>It’s true. While most </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans will know him as Samuel Oak, the goofy but heartfelt professor who can’t remember his grandson’s name, Zagnit’s Broadway career goes back decades, with the veteran actor having played iconic roles like Seymour in </span><i><span>Little Shop of Horrors</span></i><span> and the Mayor of Whoville in the first run of </span><i><span>Suessical</span></i><span>. Would a prestigious actor who had long since hung up his lab coat be willing to don it once more to spoof his old character in an off-Broadway musical? Especially with such a short window between seeing the script and his first performance? Hell yeah, actually.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Zagnit tells me that his first impression of </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>was that its combination of slapstick, crude humor, and a surprisingly pithy commentary on the culture of the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games jumped off the page upon his initial read-through. However, it was when he heard the show’s original music that he was especially taken aback by the group’s songwriting chops.</span></p> <p><span>“There’s development in there, there’s variety, and there’s jokes within the music,” Zagnit said. “It’s kind of a full meal of entertainment. You’ve got the musicality for people who like original musicals. It walks that line of being a little naughty. It’s not for kids, really. It’s for former kids who grew up in this world.”</span></p> <p><span>Along with getting a chance to throw on a lab coat again, Zagnit says that one of the most rewarding parts of </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>is getting to explore new sides of the archetype he didn’t in his stint as Professor Oak.</span></p>

 <p><span>“[The show] has made me think about the character in new ways because they’ve added dimensions to his backstory, which was something that even when I was doing the series, we never investigated or discussed,” Zagnit says. “We’d just go and read the words every week and whenever they called us. So it’s, it actually took me back into it and then [I could] sort of revisit it with a whole new lens.”</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="BALLS: The Sizzler" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kI4UVxb4Z_A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Much of that new introspection has come from the satirical basis of </span><i><span>Balls</span></i><span>. While the entire production is legally distinct from </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> and stars 151 original “Collectabuddies,” the show still parodies a lot of the original games’ concepts, including some that were based solely within video game mechanics rather than meant to be interrogated as actual parts of the fiction or world-building. Zagnit stars as The Professor, who, alongside his “piece of shit” grandson (named by an audience member), created the capture devices to put monsters in, largely due to his own fear of these creatures, rather than a desire to befriend and study them. With the premise of capturing monsters in balls put under a microscope, </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>spends much of its run-time picking apart the logistics of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world for the gags. There’s an entire segment dedicated to unpacking the mental toll a monster might feel after being left in a PC box for too long. A player can only carry six critters on their belt at a time, and any excess captures end up in a storage system until they’re either added to the team or released back into the wild. But more often than not, Pokémon live the rest of their lives in these boxes, and in </span><i><span>Balls</span></i><span>, those little guys are depicted as having lost their minds.</span></p>

 <p><span>“There’s something very fun about when you investigate around the corners of things that were not created to be really investigated,” Zelman said. “It’s like if you really dig deeper into a fairy tale and you try to pick apart those pieces, or if you’re looking at an early Bible verse or something and you’re trying to piece it together. It’s like, well, maybe an allegory is meant to just be what it is. This is something that we’ve been commenting on. A franchise that’s been around for almost 30 years now and a story that has to be sustained over that amount of time across different kinds of platforms and mediums, obviously it’s grown so, so big, how could all of it hold without one part of it bursting?”</span></p> <p><span>Some of the topics </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>touches on, such as the ethics of keeping monsters in balls or what someone does in this culturally hegemonic world if they aren’t trying to be the very best like no one ever was, have been explored in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games themselves as the franchise has grown, but never with this sharp of an edge. Ultimately, however, the show’s use of over-the-top shock humor serves to harken back to the series’ original lessons.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We found that as we kept developing the piece and as we brought in actors and composers to ask us these deeper questions about what kind of story we’re telling, the whole notion of not holding ourselves to the label that others or society puts on us was why we fell in love with these games to begin with,” Bryan says.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000617782" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617782"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617782">Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure>  <p><span>But how do you engage with these ideas when Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are notorious for squashing fan projects and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124"><span>even competitors</span></a><span> that get a little too close to Pikachu for their liking? Very carefully.</span></p>

 <p><span>A big part of that is the creation of 151 new monsters that aren’t direct retreads of the Pokémon people know and love. In fact, most of these critters are crude sketches that Zelman says are meant to be representative of the “juvenile and silly” time in our lives when we would nickname a Pokémon something like “fartmouth.” So you will likely not see anything resembling these guys in a Pokédex. Though there are some clear homages to characters like Snorlax’s road-blocking ass, the mischievous Squirtle Squad, and even some deep cuts like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemons-famous-missingno-glitch-explained-1653929141"><span>Missingno</span></a><span> glitch, Zelman and Bryan say it was important that the visuals of the show be “nostalgic or evocative,” but not using any trademarked imagery or language. As such, </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>falls under parody and satire protections, and the pair hopes that it can exist alongside other big parody musicals like </span><i><span>Puffs </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Stranger Sings</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>“We have all those protections and freedom of speech as well, as long as we continue to comment on the material and not actually utilize any of it, I think we’re okay,” Bryan says.</span></p> <p><span>With all the legal hoops jumped through and probably the best man for the job in the leading role, </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>played a few shows at Caveat with Zagnit as its leading man. However, getting to the point where he was willing to engage with the role again after he stopped playing Professor Oak was a difficult process for him. He originated Oak in the English dub and went on to play him for over 400 episodes before he and most of the English cast were unceremoniously recast in 2006 when production changed hands from 4Kids to The Pokémon Company itself. While </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-james-carther-cathcart-dies-meowth-gary-oak-1851786041"><span>some actors stayed on the project</span></a><span>, several others, including Zagnit and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>original Ash Ketchum</span></a><span> voice actor Veronica Taylor, were replaced for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-and-pikachu-new-season-liko-roy-1849903499"><span>remainder of the series’ run</span></a><span>. Though he hasn’t officially played Oak in nearly 20 years, he says that in all the time he spent playing the guy, he has “bonded completely” with the character, and they are still “a part” of one another.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I was like, really angry and bitter and sat around grousing all the time,” Zagnit says. “Little by little, I began to understand that my fellow original voice actors were starting to turn up at these anime conventions, and I said, ‘Oh, maybe there is a life after the series.’ The fans haven’t forgotten us, but the fans grew up with us. That really changed my whole feeling about it and really brought me back to it.”</span></p>   <p><span>Even though most members of the original cast have long hung up their Poké Ball belts, Zagnit and Taylor still frequent anime conventions and have fans who know them from their original roles. While Taylor isn’t in </span><i><span>Balls</span></i><span>’ main cast, she did perform in one of the New York performances as one of the audience volunteers, playing the “10-year-old kid” who takes part in the opening number. She has also signed merchandise that’s on sale at the show’s booth, and will host its newly announced New York Comic-Con panel in October. Bryan says that they hope the panel, which will function as a “bonus level” to the show with its own sketches and splash zone, and other events that the cast has attended alongside Zagnit, will help them recruit more former actors into its extended family, whether that be by being involved in the show or helping to spread the word.&nbsp;</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>The question is, will familiar voices be enough to bring non-musical fans into the fold? Even with runaway successes like the </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>movie, musicals are still a hard sell to some of </span><i><span>Balls</span></i><span>’ intended audience. Zelman says that musicals have somehow become a “dirty word,” as evidenced by the 2024 </span><i><span>Mean Girls </span></i><span>film obfuscating that it’s even a musical in its promotion. To some extent, Zelman understands the hesitation some audiences might feel about musicals because they’ve been “burned” by bad ones.</span></p> <p><span>“I get pretty frustrated with theater when it feels like it’s just serving theater makers,” Zelman says. “It feels too circular, right? We shouldn’t just be making this for each other. We should be, like, offering something to other people.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Several </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans who have little to no experience with musicals have shown up to see </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>and enjoyed themselves, so Bryan hopes that the shared love of the material being affectionately spoofed can help get people who have historically been musical-averse into seats at the Caveat and beyond.</span></p> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> being the number one IP on the planet [means it] has such a spectrum of fans, and many of them are super introverted and not very social and I think they would like this show a lot if they trusted the idea of, like, seeing a live performance event. And it’s just not in their vocabulary,” Bryan says. “I’m not concerned that the material won’t connect. I’m eager to find out how we can help bridge the gap between people who wouldn’t necessarily do something like this. How do we gain trust from the less social or the less extroverted of the fandom of the community?”</span></p>

 <p><span>For now, much like everything else about </span><i><span>Balls</span></i><span>, it’s a “word of mouth” game. The Comic-Con panel, however, is one of the biggest stages the show has ever had, and it’s in front of a lot of New York locals. But what about the rest of the world? If </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>is localized to New York City, is its audience not inherently pretty limited? Well, Bryan and Zelman have thought about that and hope to use their growing social media reach to emulate something like how StarKid Productions hosts </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmwM_AKeMCk&amp;list=PLC76BE906C9D83A3A"><span>entire video versions of its parody musicals online</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>“We have filmed all of these performances and we’re hoping to—in pieces—start presenting the material and hopefully getting some virality in that way,” Bryan says.</span></p>

 <p><span>For now, </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>will return to the Caveat after a brief break, but Zelman and Bryan are “flirting” with the idea of a traveling show, and hopefully Professor Oak himself is on board. Zelman and Bryan have grand hopes that </span><i><span>Balls </span></i><span>can carve its own space in the pantheon of musical parodies, and they hope that Zagnit will stay on board as long as he’s willing and able. The character description for the Professor says he’s a “spry 100 years old,” so they have plenty of time. Zagnit says as long as he’s mobile and enthusiastic, the show “keeps [him] young.”</span></p> <p><span>“We are Stuart’s children and he’s our child,” Zelman says. “We’re all each other’s children. We love each other dearly. I would love for </span><i><span>Balls</span></i><span> to remain part of his incredible legacy, and we’d love to have him as part of this project for as long as he is willing and able to do so. So, yes, please, forever.”</span></p> <p><span>To keep track of </span><i><span>Balls: The Monster-Catchin’ Musical</span></i><span>’s upcoming dates and developments, you can </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ballsmusical/?hl=en"><span>check out the show on Instagram</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>Embracer is, well, embracing more AI use moving forward as part of the company’s future. </p>



<p>In statements made during it’s latest earnings report, CEO Phil Rogers called AI an “increasingly supportive force”. He said that AI use, “smarter collaboration” and “increased streamlining” will “be key to unlocking value and expanding margins.”</p>



<p><strong>“Our ambition is simple and focused: lead with distinctive IP; deliver with clarity and discipline; and realize our full potential,”</strong> he said. <strong>“The choices we make now will determine not just what we achieve, but who we become.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding streamlining, Embracer, as it moves forward to becoming Fellowship Entertainment, <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q1-april-june-2025-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-75-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">says that its focus will remain</a> on <strong>“continuous improvement as well as targeted cost initiatives.”</strong></p>



<p>These initiatives will target underperforming businesses that will allow them to <strong>“free up capital to deploy with better returns.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“These initiatives could potentially include divestments,”</strong> Rogers said without mentioning if it also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-let-go-nearly-2000-employees-in-the-last-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">means more layoffs</a> could come.</p>



<p>Right now, Rogers said, the company is facing what he calls a <strong>“pivotal moment”</strong> where Embracer needs to “sharpen [its] focus”. He said that the company will “double down” on what he believes is its greatest strength: <strong>“empowering talented teams to deliver unforgettable experiences based on globally loved IP.”</strong></p>



<p>Those IP include franchises like The Lord of the Rings,&nbsp;Tomb Raider,&nbsp;Kingdom Come Deliverance,&nbsp;Metro, and Dead Island, to name a few. Rogers says that the company is “laying the groundwork” for a better development environment for its titles that he believes is <strong>“one of the most exciting IP portfolios in the industry.”</strong></p>



<p>Embracer has nine AAA games in development and set for release without counting any projects financed by partners. A couple of those games, however, might slip into fiscal year 2028/29.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Embracer/Fellowship Entertainment, especially when it comes to AI use and these “targeted cost initiatives”? Let us know in the comments down below.</p>
