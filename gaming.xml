            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware has announced&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a multiplayer-focused Switch 2-exclusive PvPvE game with more than a hint of the creator's other franchises about it.</p>

<p><em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>was revealed as part of today's Nintendo Direct presentation, alongside the likes of Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch lineup game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, which is coming in July.</p>

<p>The debut trailer for the game looks suitably&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>-esque, with a lot of Victorian-era architecture looming over imposing-looking backstreets, although the arrival of a futuristic-looking train does throw the usual FromSoftware vibe off a little (in a good way!).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-duskbloods-switch-2-fromsoftware-moon.jpg?itok=RjvN1WrO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-duskbloods-switch-2-fromsoftware-moon.jpg?itok=pDjlOX4k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yup, that looks like a FromSoftware creation alright.</figcaption></figure><p>There's plenty of classic FromSoftware imagery and music in the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>. Whether it's an imposing-looking cathedral with a massive stained-glass window or a horrific monster crawling towards the camera in an underground lair, it looks like you'll get your money's worth from this one.</p>

<p>While this trailer does show off some of the gameplay you can expect from&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, it's a typically elliptical FromSoftware creation, so it's not giving too much away. You'll see brief moments of gameplay rather than extended sequences.</p>

<p>Indeed, not much about the game is given away at all in its initial announcement; it'll revolve around something called "moontears", and blood appears to be a prominent theme in&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, but we'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p><em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>is one of many games coming to the Switch 2 in the next year or so; others include ports of games like&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, as well as a new&nbsp;<em>Hyrule Warriors&nbsp;</em>game and many more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>when it launches exclusively for Switch 2 sometime next year. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo never considered making the Switch 2 a piece of "high-performance hardware" aimed at consumers who wanted more-powerful tech. Takuhiro Dohta from Nintendo's Entertainment Planning and Development Department made the comments in part of the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lengthy Q&amp;A session</a> following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">A Nintendo representative asked Dohta and Kouichi Kawamoto, also from the Entertainment Planning and Development Department, why the team decided to call the system the Switch 2. Kawamoto said the team toyed with the idea of calling it the Super Nintendo Switch, but in addition to Nintendo already having a system with "Super" as a descriptor--Super Nintendo--the team didn't want people to focus on the console's specifications.</p><p dir="ltr">"Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we'd like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo," Kawamoto said. "So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2."</p><p dir="ltr">Dohta expanded on Kawamoto's comments and suggested that focusing on the Switch 2's hardware improvements over the original system might alienate people who just want to play more Nintendo games.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the beginning of development, we wanted Switch 2 to be a system that can be enjoyed by a wide variety of players," Dohta said. "I also wanted to create an experience that as many players as possible could enjoy, rather than an experience made specially for those who prefer high-performance hardware. So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest system."</p><p dir="ltr">That said, Nintendo did build the Switch 2 with more power than its predecessor. During the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, Nintendo said the console will support 60fps for games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/">Metroid Prime 4</a> and includes HDR even in handheld mode. That's in addition to improved speakers and support for 3D audio.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025</a>, for $450.

Switch 2 was almost called the Super Nintendo Switch, but Nintendo felt it "didn't feel right" to use the same naming convention as the SNES due to Switch 2's backwards compatibility.
</p>
<p>
In a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/">Ask The Developer discussion</a>, Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto discussed how the team landed on the right name for the new console.
</p>
<p>
"There were a lot of ideas for the name, and we really struggled to find the right one," he said. "We even considered ideas like 'Super Nintendo Switch'. However, Super NES, which came out after the NES, couldn't play NES games. Since Switch 2 can play Switch games, it didn't feel right to use the same naming convention as Super NES. Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we'd like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo."

<p>
He added: "So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2."
</p>
<p>Does that mean we can expect a Nintendo Switch 3 in the future?</p>
<p>
Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta continued: "From the beginning of development, we wanted Switch 2 to be a system that can be enjoyed by a wide variety of players. This hasn't changed from Switch to Switch 2. I also wanted to create an experience that as many players as possible could enjoy, rather than an experience made specially for those who prefer high-performance hardware. So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest system."
</p>
<p>
Surmised Tetsuya Sasaki, from the Technology Development Division: "I thought the name was simple and easy to understand, since development began with the idea that Switch 2 would be a proper successor to Switch."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the interview, Dohta also confirmed the Switch 2's eShop will be improved.
</p>
<p>
"Thanks to the system's performance capabilities, Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 has been improved and runs smoothly even when displaying a large number of games," said Dohta. "We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience."

            <p>While the Switch 2 is backwards compatible with original Switch games - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">some are even receiving an upgrade</a> - there are still a number of games with compatibility issues on the new console, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo has released details on compatible games, with 122 Nintendo games and over 15,000 third-party games playable on the new console. This is shown in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/">Steam Deck-esque system on the Nintendo website</a>.</p>
<p>Only one game is completely incompatible with Switch 2 and that's the Labo VR Kit, as the Switch 2 console cannot be inserted into the Toy-Con VR Googles. Sorry cardboard fans.</p>

<p>However, there remain a number of third-party games that either have start up issues on Switch 2, or are playable but have in-game compatibility issues. While those specific issues are unknown, they are all being investigated.</p>
<p>The biggest game with start up issues is Fortnite, though a specific Switch 2 version of the game is planned - it's unknown when this will be released, but at least one of the biggest games in the world will eventually be playable on Nintendo's new console.</p>

<p>As for games with <a href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-launchable_compatibility_issues_EN.pdf?_gl=1*xvm77x*_gcl_au*MTY1ODE0OTE3NC4xNzQxNjA5OTkx*_ga*MTQ5ODE5NDYyNS4xNzQzNjAzNDkx*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*MTc0MzYwNzMyNi4xNy4xLjE3NDM2MDgyNjIuMC4wLjA.">in-game compatibility issues</a>, there are 47. That includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a>, Fall Guys, Harvestella, and Overcooked! All You Can Eat.</p>
<p>In addition, there are a number of games that are playable on Switch 2 but require an original Switch Joy-Con to play - these are mostly motion-controlled games.</p>
<p>For instance, the Joy-Con 2 won't fit in the Ring Fit Adventure Ring-Con; they don't include an IR Motion Camera for 1-2-Switch, WarioWare: Move It! or Game Builder Garage; Everybody 1-2-Switch will be more difficult as the force feedback of vibrations has been reduced in Joy-Con 2; Joy-Con 2 don't fit in the leg strap for the soccer mode of Nintendo Switch Sports.</p>
<p>There are also compatibility issues with the Labo Variety Kit, Robot Kit, and Vehicle Kit.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza-is-dks-first-3d-platformer-in-26-years.1152813/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>series and the beloved ape's first 3D platformer since 1999's&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong 64</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed during today's Switch 2 Direct show,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will launch exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th, so it'll just miss the console's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">launch date of June 5th</a>&nbsp;and won't be included as part of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 launch lineup</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>game, the story of&nbsp;<em>Bananza&nbsp;</em>revolves around DK uncovering a treasure trove of golden bananas, only for them to be stolen away by the nefarious VoidCo, causing him to set out on a quest to retrieve his hoard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-minecart.jpg?itok=5qnpfEqb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-minecart.jpg?itok=4kX4NB7v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is DK's first 3D platforming outing in many years.</figcaption></figure><p>Donkey Kong sports a design inspired by his old-school arcade self in&nbsp;<em>Bananza</em>, and I think it's pretty cute. He's got a rather expressive face that lends itself well to the world in which he finds himself for this adventure.</p>

<p>The trailer shows DK platforming his way around a few open-looking environments, as well as burrowing down into the ground to explore the level below the surface.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It isn't clear to what extent you'll be able to seamlessly transition between above-ground levels and underground stages, but I'd expect that given the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">still-relatively-modest tech specs</a>, that's not going to be the case.</p>

<p>In any case, you can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, which shows off a fair bit of gameplay and DK's endearing redesign, right here.</p>




<p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of games coming to the Switch 2. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, which is coming at launch alongside new versions of&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as games like EA's hugely successful&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>when it <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/donkey-kong-bananza/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launches for Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>

His coverage areas include audio (Sonos, Apple, Bose, Sony, etc.), home theater, smartphones, photography, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At numerous points during today’s Nintendo Switch 2 event stream, fine print at the bottom of the screen directed viewers to Nintendo’s website for the full details on which original Switch titles will be supported by the new console.</p><p>As it turns out, the company has put together a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftransfer-guide%2Fcompatible-games%2F" rel="sponsored">surprisingly detailed resource page</a> that goes over all the titles it has tested thus far — both from Nintendo itself and third-party developers. And the chart below really tells the story: more often than not, last-gen games should run without any problems when the Switch 2 hits shelves on June 5th.</p><p>Even titles that we assumed might be fully incompatible — <em>Ring Fit Adventure, 1-2-Switch</em>, and the various <em>Labo</em> kit assembly games — are supported to some extent on the Switch 2 if you stick to original Joy-Cons or use other workaround methods that Nintendo spells out. At least for the time being, there’s only one game that just plain won’t work, and that’s the VR <em>Labo</em> kit. I don’t think anyone can really fault Nintendo for that.</p><p>The company also divides “games with startup issues” — <em>Doom Eternal, Rocket League, NBA 2K25,</em> and <em>Warframe</em> are among these — and “games that are playable, but have some in-game compatibility issues” into separate lists. “Nintendo is continuing to improve compatibility, including by working with publishing and developing partners,” the company notes on the site. That work will no doubt continue right up until the console’s release in early June.</p><p>Separately, Nintendo <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftransfer-guide%2Fgames-with-free-updates%2F" rel="sponsored">has also revealed</a> which original Switch titles will be getting upgrades via future patches.

Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The Duskbloods</em>, a new game by FromSoftware, is coming exclusively to the Nintendo Switch 2. The teaser trailer debuted during Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct video presentation, where it was revealed that it’s set to launch in 2026 with famed <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Dark Souls </em>director Hidetaka Miyazaki at the helm. No other details were provided.</p><p>The trailer and name are very evocative of <em>Bloodborne</em>, the cult classic title that’s remained exclusive to Sony’s PlayStation consoles. But according to <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1907432474759569770">a post by Nintendo of America on X</a> and <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/article/250402_1.html"><em>The Duskbloods</em> website</a>, the new title differs in that it’s a player vs player vs enemies (PvPvE) format multiplayer game. FromSoftware may be known for single-player focused epics (with limited co-op) like the <em>Dark Souls</em> series and <em>Elden Ring</em>, but well before <em>Duskbloods </em>launches we’ll be getting its first multiplayer-only game in the form of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em>.</p><p>Nintendo teased that more will be revealed about <em>The Duskbloods</em> in a Creator’s Voice article with Miyazaki, set to publish on the official Nintendo website on April 4th. That should be helpful, considering the trailer goes heavier on style and flair than it does on details. There’s definitely a <em>Bloodborne</em>-y vibe with its gothic setting, and there seem to be vampiric Twilight Blood Clan characters. And it’s FromSoftware, so there’s of course some excellent looking enemies, monster designs, and fashion for days.</p><p>The moment that hangs on the vast expanse of The Duskbloods’ world may even indicate an open-world of some kind, but I’ll leave it up to the FromSoftware lore experts to go hard on their deep-dives and dissections of the three-and-a-half minute trailer.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> is getting a Tarnished Edition on Switch 2, but you are an enlightened individual who cares not for Switchery - why else would you be reading RPS, a website dedicated to PCs, the very best console of all? Are you some kind of Nintendo fan-enthusiast-zealot, here to gloat about the fact that the Tarnished Edition is a Switch 2 exclusive? 
</p>
<p>
Is that what you think? Well if that <em>is</em> what you think, I've got something to tell you. Something that may shock and discredit you. And that thing is as follows: I'm not wearing a tie at all! I mean, the Tarnished Edition's new stuff is almost guaranteed to turf up on PC at some stage.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Catch the trailer for the Tarnished Edition below. It's out on the Switchbox in 2025, and includes the original open world action-RPG and last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> expansion, which Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">described</a> as "basically a sequel" and "a knotty, dense expansion that's home to some of the best moments in Elden Ring, but also some of its most frustrating."

You should notice a few new pieces of armour and equipment. There's one that resembles Lucatiel of Mirrah's gear from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>. The biggest addition, so far, is a new customisation feature for Torrent, your summonable spectral steed. The trailer treats us to a few glimpses of a saddle with flapping red banners.</p>
<p>According to a press release from publisher Bandai Namco, "the additional content in the title will also be available on other platforms". I know, it doesn't specifically mention PC, but come on. Why would PC not be included among "other platforms". Denying us this would be like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">denying us a spiritual Bloodborne sequel</a>, before we've even got a PC port of the first game.</p>
<p>I will keep my eyes peeled for Steam updates. In the meantime, you might want to check out <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, a co-op multiplayer spin-off in which three players farm maps for upgrades in order to fight a series of bosses.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enter-the-gungeon">Enter the Gungeon</a> feels like one of those quintessential indie games right? It came out almost a decade ago way back in 2016, which felt like the peak "indie games are here and they can go toe to toe with the big boys" era. It had all the hallmarks, like throwback pixel art, quirky designs, easy to pick up and put down. So it feels a bit funny to see that a sequel, quite aptly titled Enter the Gungeon 2, was revealed during a presentation for, what was it called now, the Nintendo Switch 2? Something like that, doesn't matter, point is: Dodge Roll are making a sequel, and yes, it is coming to PC too, don't you worry.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
I think its first, very short trailer (seriously, only 30 seconds, can't blame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> for not wanting to cough up cash for a longer one) is a bit funny too, in that the game is 3D now. This isn't a knock on how the game looks, I think the style has been translated very well between dimensions, that giant enemy made up of tinier lil bullet guys speaks to me. But it really does show you how much the industry has changed in a decade when an iconic indie like Enter the Gungeon makes a switch like this.

<p>
The trailer didn't reveal all that much honestly, it really does look like the game but in 3D, and it is still a bullet hell, action, roguelike game. Over on Steam it says that you'll "battle through areas familiar and unknown", and that there'll be an "expanding roster of Gungeoneers full of both familiar and new faces as you rescue and extract marooned heroes from the depths of the Gungeon." 
</p>
<p>
There's no release date to be found just yet, so another classic case of "this exists, we'll see you when we see you." Fair enough! Anyway, congrats Enter the Gungeon fans, you're doing better than the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">Bloodborne for PC crowd</a>.

But the wording used was a bit vague and left some wiggle-room for not everything working or some games having issues. So it’s not surprising that, following Wednesday’s big Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo published two new lists containing over 100 games that won’t properly work on Switch 2. </p><p>The two lists are named: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-launchable_compatibility_issues_EN.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-launchable_compatibility_issues_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Nintendo Switch games that start up on Nintendo Switch 2, but include some in-game compatibility issues</strong></a></span><strong> </strong></li><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> Nintendo Switch games with start up issues on Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a></span></li></ul><p>The wording here is a bit vague and I’ve reached out to Nintendo for clarification. The first list seems to imply that some OG Switch games on the new console will start but will have “in-game compatibility issues,” while the second suggests many more games have “start up issues,” which sounds like they won’t boot up at all? And unfortunately, the longer list is the one featuring games with start up issues.</p><p>Some games on the “start up issues” list include&nbsp;<em>Another Crab’s Treasure, Darksiders Genesis, DOOM: Eternal, Final Fantasy, Pizza Tower, Rocket League, Super Mega Baseball 3, Warframe, </em>and <em>Trove. </em>It seems all first-party Nintendo games will at least boot up and play on Switch 2. </p><p>Some good news! All of the games listed that won’t work properly or even start up on Switch 2, with one exception, are currently “being investigated.” So hopefully before Switch 2's launch or shortly after, many of these games will be updated and will work on the new console. We’ll see about that. </p><p>The one exception, by the way, is <em>Fortnite</em>, which according to Nintendo has some “start up issues” on Switch 2. But Epic isn’t going to fix those, apparently, and instead is planning to launch a Switch 2 version of the free-to-play shooter. </p><hr><p><em>You’re reading part of </em>Kotaku’s <em>ongoing coverage of the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*lqzwhi*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5ODc5My4yODEuMS4xNzQzNjA5MDcwLjU0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*lqzwhi*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5ODc5My4yODEuMS4xNzQzNjA5MDcwLjU0LjAuMA.." target="_blank"><em>Check our roundup</em></a></span><em> for more news from the showcase </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200" target="_blank"><em>including launch games</em></a></span><em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502" target="_blank"><em>pricing information, release date, pre-order information</em></a></span><em>, and </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209" target="_blank"><em>what that mysterious C button Nintendo keeps teasing actually does</em></a></span><em>.</em></p><p><em>We’ll be continuing to update stories with news and analysis throughout the day as Nintendo pulls back the curtain on its most anticipated console launch ever.

In addition to giving fans a closer look at the hardware itself, Nintendo confirmed that Switch 1 owners will be able to transfer their system data over to the upcoming console.</p><p>According to the company, you can move your data from the original Switch to the Switch 2 by logging in to your Nintendo Account and using the System Transfer feature.

Nintendo will also release paid updates for some titles like Super Mario Party Jamboree and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, adding new features and functionality to the games when played on Switch 2.</p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5 and retails for $450 USD. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Preorders</a> for the system will begin on April 9.

                <p>During the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</a>, Deltarune was revealed as one of the upcoming titles for Nintendo's next-gen console. Deltarune has historically been released chapter by chapter, and this is the first time we've heard about Chapters 3 and 4.</p><p>Deltarune Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 will launch with the Switch 2. Even though they were announced during the Switch 2 Direct, Chapters 3 and 4 aren't exclusives for the new Switch. Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4 will also be available for the standard Switch, Steam, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDzgiGdekas" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yDzgiGdekas" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Deltarune, the turn-based RPG by Undertale creator Toby Fox, features a parallel universe similar to the world of Undertale. The main character Kris stars as the protagonist, surrounded by strong personalities like the bully-turned-friend Susie and mild-mannered mage, Ralsei. It launched on October 31, 2018 with a free demo of Chapter 1. Then, on September 17, 2021, Toby surprised us with Chapter 2.</p><p>"The world has been really tough for everybody recently. So I decided to release DELTARUNE Chapter 2 for free," reads the <a href="https://deltarune.com/update-092021/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deltarune September 2021 update</a>. Toby published the last Deltarune update about one year after that in September 2022.</p><p>Deltarune is an unfinished game, but fans have praised the storytelling and gameplay so far. Chapter 2 marked the discovery of an alternate route dubbed the "Snowgrave Route." Right now, it's unclear if there are more than two routes, but Chapter 3 and 4 are a great way to find out.</p><p>Deltarune will be available on June 5, 2025 as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza, a new entry in the series starring one of Nintendo's most iconic characters besides Mario, is launching in a few months on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>The new 3D platformer will be released on July 17th, a little over a month after the next-generation Nintendo console debuts worldwide on June 5th. While not a lot of information is currently available on the game, the trailer shown during today's Nintendo Direct provided a decent overview of what to expect, including a new design for Donkey Kong clearly inspired by the successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie, a colorful and lively experience that looks heavily inspired by Super Mario Odyssey.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mIddsPkdX9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>With the announcement of Donkey Kong Bananza, 2025 is looking increasingly like the year of Donkey Kong. Back in January, Nintendo brought one of the best entries in the series, Donkey Kong Country Returns, to Nintendo Switch, complete with improved visuals that make it a worthwhile purchase for those who have never experienced the game before, as highlighted by Nathan in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD still delivers its share of scintillating simian escapades, but aside from a visual spit shine, not much has been added to the game to keep it competitive with the many excellent 2D platformers that have hit the scene since 2010, including its own sequel. DK completionists and newbies looking for a surprisingly stiff "Nintendo hard" challenge will be happy with this package, but others might want to wait until the big ape has something truly new to beat his chest about.</em></p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th worldwide.</p>

"Slowly asphyxiating to death in an unforgiving alien wasteland has never been so joyful", wrote he, reminding me of the over air-fried chicken nugget I got stuck in my throat last week. The original Astroneer will keep receiving updates for "years" to come, say developers System Era Softworks. As for Starseeker, it's aiming to be a different kettle of space entirely.</p>

<p>It's doing that through the power of mates, chiefly. Not just a few mates, but many. Mates squared. "Exploring deep space on the ESS Starseeker, players will need to work together with the entire crew of the space station," say System Era, "to complete planet-wide objectives across a multitude of star systems using cutting edge technology". Alec called the original's tone more "Vengaboys than 65daysofstatic" (them what did music for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>), and it definitely all seems far more bubbly and chipper than your garden variety forage-for-dysentry-berries-or-die-in-poverty 'em up. Labour's new fifteen point berries-or-poverty plan being what it is, I'm thankful for the escapism.</p>
<p>A "focus on discovery, cooperative expeditions, and camaraderie" is the vibe here. "Players will have an advanced set of tools at their disposal to tackle expeditions while they face off with the unknown perils of space- - fascinating creatures, hazardous flora, and mysterious forces that await them".</p>
<p>This'll all be done from your space station, the titular ESS Starseeker - "an ever-evolving space station where players get together to plan expeditions, upgrade their capabilities, and even hang out with other players".</p>
<p>The devs promise livestreams, vlogs, a limited beta, and a more in-depth gameplay trailer all over the coming months. You can find Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1454370/STARSEEKER_Astroneer_Expeditions/">on Steam here</a>, and it's due for release 2026. I'm actually not being glib when I say I hope there's a way to talk to these monsters, they look ace.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But they’re uh, pretty restrictive, to the point where even the most dedicated Nintendo fan might not be able to buy directly from the company.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196143,196447" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Right now, if you want to purchase a Switch 2 through Nintendo in the U.S., you have to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">register interest on the company’s website</a></span> for either the standard $450 system or the $500 <em>Mario Kart World </em>bundle. Nintendo will send the first round of purchase invites on May 8, almost a month after pre-orders go live elsewhere on April 9. The company will roll out more invites before its official pre-orders open to the general public, and if you receive one you’ll have 72 hours to make a purchase. But what makes you eligible? That’s where things get tricky. The priority requirements as listed on Nintendo’s site are:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“As of 4/2/2025, (i) you must have been the one who purchased any Nintendo Switch Online membership, (ii) you must have had any paid Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months, and (iii) you must have opted in to share gameplay data and have at least 50 hours total gameplay hours.”</p></blockquote><p>Luckily for me, I’ve had an ongoing Nintendo Switch Online membership because I was really into <em>Pokémon Unite </em>for a year then never canceled. But a lot of people are single-player sickos, or primarily play multiplayer games on other platforms, and have no incentive to pay for an online membership. Also, who remembers if they opted to share gameplay data with Nintendo. I probably made that decision years ago and forgot about it? If this is what makes it difficult for me to get my hands on Switch 2 in a timely manner, that’s some bullshit.</p><p>You might have more luck pre-ordering at another store. My one pro tip from years of pre-order consoles is that, if you’re not in a big city, you can probably manage to get an in-store pre-order at your local shop. One of the only things I miss about living in the middle of nowhere is that I was guaranteed a console pre-order if I got to my local GameStop the day pre-orders went live. Good luck to everybody else, I guess. May the odds be ever in your favor.</p><hr><p><em> You’re reading part of </em>Kotaku<em>’s ongoing coverage of the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*d7g2e6*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5NzQwNy42Ni4xLjE3NDM2MDU5OTAuNTQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*d7g2e6*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5NzQwNy42Ni4xLjE3NDM2MDU5OTAuNTQuMC4w" target="_blank"><em>Check our roundup</em></a></span><em> for more news from the showcase </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200" target="_blank"><em>including launch games</em></a></span><em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502" target="_blank"><em>pricing information, release date, pre-order information</em></a></span><em>, and </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209" target="_blank"><em>what that mysterious C button Nintendo keeps teasing actually does</em></a></span><em>.</em><br><em>We’ll be continuing to update stories with news and analysis throughout the day as Nintendo pulls back the curtain on its most anticipated console launch ever.
