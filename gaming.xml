		<p>SEGA and RGG Studios has announced that it will be hosting a Like A Dragon Direct on January 9th, and the main focus of the direct will be Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.

<p>First washing up on Rich Island, the adventure will also take Majima to Madlantis, the secret island where criminal organisation co-exist and the home of the Pirate’s Coliseum. There’s also Nele Island, which features the holy site of Palenka, and you’ll get to revisit Hawaii and Honolulu City, which was a key location for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. The events of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii take place after the story of Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth concludes.</p>
<p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will have ship to ship combat out in the open sea and in a large coliseum, ship boarding with combat, and ship customisation. Within the Pirate Coliseum players will take part in the Tournament of Captains, as well as other events including Quick Skirmish, Madlantis Mania, and Swashbuckler Showdown.</p>

<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio previously confirmed a new release date for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, with the game now set to be released on February 21st, 2025, bringing the release date forward by a week from the original date. It will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

			<p>Today, Marvel Games and NetEase Games officially announced the details for the first season of Marvel Rivals. The season is titled Eternal Night Falls and will be adding some familiar faces to the ever-expanding roster of heroes and villains from the Marvel universe. The first season for this new Hero-Shooter will begin on January 10 at 9 AM UTC, where the Fantastic Four will be introduced to the game as playable heroes. Thus far, the title has <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/">been incredibly successful</a>.</p>
<p>The season will span over three months and will be divided into two halves. In the first half of the season, Invisible Woman and Mister Fantastic will be released. For those wanting Human Torch and The Thing, you'll have to wait until the second half of the season. Season 1 of Marvel Rivals is doing more than just adding superheroes to the game, as there will be three new maps for players to explore and learn when playing.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls, make sure to check out the trailer below to get a glimpse of some of the action you will be diving into, as well as the cosmetics you can get your mitts on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Season 1: Eternal Night Falls Official Trailer | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zATLJ6Cqt0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to new heroes and maps, there will be some special events for players to dive into, including a new Doom Match game mode. Like many free-to-play titles with live service elements, there will be a Battle Pass for players to dive into. Compared to Season 0, this Battle Pass has over double the amount of content and rewards to get. These rewards consist of 10 costumes, sprays, and emotes to get your hands on to add some extra flair for the battleground. To purchase the Season 1 Luxury Battle Pass for Marvel Rivals, it will cost you 990 Lattice, where you will then get 600 Lattices and 600 Units as a reward for completing the Season 1 Battle Pass.</p>
<p>Compared to other games on the market right now, the team developing this title has made it so that the Luxury Battle Passes will never expire, with Tokens purchased with Lattice being retained under specific conditions. For those interested in what these terms and conditions consist of, the developers have created both a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20241225/40954_1202068.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Diary</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNiYrOSLYD4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Vision</a>, where you can read about it or watch a video that explains it.</p>

Personally, that’s part of the appeal, having 20+ ways to play, and not all of them rely on twitch reflexes and precise aim. But still, there are folks who are going to bounce off of all 20 of those playstyles, and just have to watch their friends play and laugh and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">bitch about Jeff</a></span> from a distance. But don’t worry. It’s not like those folks are starved for options. Here’s a few options for those folks who want to make theirs Marvel, without all that pesky K/D ratio talk. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-recommend-id="image://d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel and Capcom characters are arranged in a hero image." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Marvel and Capcom characters are arranged in a hero image." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-recommend-id="image://d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel and Capcom characters are arranged in a hero image." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ll grant, this is mostly just trading one labyrinthine set of mechanics for another that’s even more likely to result in you getting pieced up in infinite combos by someone who hasn’t seen the touch of a gentle hand or the light of the day star since Obama was in office. But the magic of the <em>VS</em> titles is just how much can be had just randomly screwing around with characters and team builds, and wacky moves without ever having to take the games online. Seeing Magneto, M. Bison, and Dr. Doom get absolutely destroyed by a team composed of a Little Red Riding Hood, a Japanese schoolgirl, and The Mad Titan Thanos is just one of those innate charms that never gets old, solo or with friends. Best of all, there’s now three different flavors of experience to be had, with the announcement that some absolute maniacs have spent a preposterous amount of time and energy into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXorZjVETFQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXorZjVETFQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revamping the reviled <em>Marvel vs Capcom Infinite</em> into a respectable game</a></span>. <br></p></div><div><p>Nothing about <em>Midnight Suns</em> is my jam on paper. Card-based/deck-builder games just don’t click with my brain, <em>Balatro </em>notwithstanding, and <em>Rivals </em>aside, real talk, there’s a lot of licensed Marvel trash floating out there to be avoided at all costs. And that’s to say nothing of the fact that I was around when the <em>Midnight Sons</em> arc started back in the early 90s, trying to cash in on the dark, and edgy undercurrent running through all comics, which was the style at the time. Even being the exact age when edgy comics should’ve hit my teenage brain like a wrecking ball, these guys just didn’t do it for me.</p><p>So when I tell you that I fell head-over-heels in love with <em>Midnight Suns</em>, you know how hard that game is working to get me to care. It helps that it’s from developer Firaxis, bringing its A-game to the strategic aspects of gameplay. But there’s also some absolutely delightful deep cut Marvel lore and character work going on there between the strategy. Fighting Lillith and whatnot? Sure, I guess. Making sure Blade and Carol Danvers hook up? I will MOVE MOUNTAINS. <em>Midnight Suns</em> was apparently a huge flop for Firaxis, but it’s never too late to get more people on that deeply underrated bandwagon. </p></div><div><p>Speaking of deeply underrated. It’s hard to blame anyone for giving Crystal Dynamics’ <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> game the side-eye after Square Enix’s <em>Avengers</em> debacle poisoned the well. Anyone who’s actually spent time playing it, however, knows the truth. <em>Guardians</em> is just a damn fine third-person action title that really puts in some serious work making the <em>Guardians</em> feel like a caring-but-dysfunctional family that Star-Lord has to manage. It helps, too, that Star-Lord is an infinitely more likable, thoughtful scoundrel than Chris Pratt who, even when faced with a crucial, branching choice, finds a way to keep his family together. It helps even more that he doesn’t get himself in a scenario where all he has to do is wait till the goddamn Gauntlet is off and then he can combo up Thanos all he wants but <em>nooooo, </em>he has to get his smackdown on while everybody else is trying to save the goddamn universe from being snapped, and because of him it fails, and it’s his fault, and he is scum and you know what, I may still have anger issues about that. Let me make note of that for my therapist.</p></div><div><p> It feels like all the rizz has gone out of this one since <em>Balatro</em> took its place as the de facto card game in everyone’s hearts this year. But make no mistake, the mobile card-battler is still going strong with constant updates, and is still just as fun as it’s ever been. In fact, the game’s current season includes a crossover with <em>Rivals</em>, bringing some of that game’s character art to the deck, as well as introducing Galacta into the mix. Sure, you’ll be bitching about balancing issues here too, but it’s hard to stay mad at a game you can be done with during the fifth time that accursed Wegovy commercial they keep running on a loop on Hulu plays out. <br></p></div><div><p>Of course, if you’re looking to cross enemy lines to DC, you’ve played all the <em>Arkham</em> games, and you value your time and dignity too much to play <em>Gotham Knights</em> and <em>Suicide Squad</em>, you can actually try something a little different that won’t demand much aside from time and commitment. <em>DC Universe</em> is one of the few survivors of that time when every studio wanted their own <em>World of Warcraft</em> instead of their own <em>Overwatch</em>. No game survives this long without having something going for it, and in this case, with <em>City of Heroes</em> effectively a ghost, superhero MMOs a dying breed altogether, and the price being right–as in, <em>free</em>–to fool around in a big expansive superhero universe that, while it does have the usual MMO grind problems, does understand its assignment as a DC superhero simulator.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, they didn’t.

This is a real image from Acer and it makes me laugh every single time I look at it. Sure, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nitro Blaze 11</a></span> has two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm audio jack, a USB- A port (nice!), and a microSD card slot. It also includes solid internal specs with an AMD Ryzen 7 8840 chip, Radeon 780M graphics, 16GB of RAM and up to 2TB of SSD storage. </p><p>But come on, <em>look </em>at that image above. This might be a powerful gaming device, but it’s not portable. I mean, I guess if your definition of portable is simply “You can technically carry it around by yourself,” then sure, the Nitro Blaze 11 counts as a portable PC. Still, I’m not sold on the idea that many people will want a Steam Deck-like device that’s bigger than a cat. It goes against one of the biggest selling points with these things: You can take them anywhere and play all your games easily. </p><p>Acer seems to understand that this is probably not a product for everyone and will also offer smaller, more Steam Deck-sized portable PCs. The Nitro Blaze 8 features similar specs but with an 8-inch screen and will be priced at $900. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-its-first-handheld-gaming-pc-the-nitro-blaze-7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-its-first-handheld-gaming-pc-the-nitro-blaze-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A slightly smaller and less powerful Blaze 7</a></span> will also be available later this year for $800. </p><p>And for those of you out there who want to lug around a desktop PC crammed into a medium-sized container, the Acer Nitro Blaze 11 and its comically massive screen will be available for $1,100. At that point, you might just want to buy an actual gaming laptop.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This apparent round of layoffs follows Rocksteady's first round back in September, which was also reported by Eurogamer, and saw the reduction of 33 team members down to 15 due to the poor sales of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/zuckerberg-meta-policy-changes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced changes to his company’s platforms this morning, all of which basically amount to toddling along like a desperate duckling after Elon Musk and Donald Trump. Honestly, I’m disappointed that he can’t even make his terrible platforms worse in an original way, instead choosing to copy Musk’s moves and parrot Trump’s talking points.</p><p>Declaring that “the recent elections… feel like a cultural tipping point toward once again prioritizing speech,” Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1525382954801931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed</a> that the company will do away with <a href="https://x.com/AngieHolan/status/1876649209081839847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-party fact checking</a> in favor of community notes, a la Twitter. “The fact-checkers have just become too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they created, especially in the US,” he said. <strong>(Update 1:40pm--</strong><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/metas-fact-checking-partners-blindsided/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a> reports that fact-checking organizations didn't know Zuckerberg intended to end their partnerships.<strong>)</strong></p><p>As part of addressing this supposed bias, Meta will also be moving its trust and safety and content teams from California to Texas, with Zuckerberg saying that “I think [this move] will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams.” Elon Musk has also <a href="https://www.chron.com/culture/article/x-twitter-hq-texas-musk-19777426.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved his companies</a> to Texas, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1813290895334383820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">citing</a> political reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta will also remove restrictions around topics like immigration and gender, with Zuckerberg echoing every right-wing pundit ever in saying, “What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it’s gone too far.” In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corporate blog</a>, Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334432/meta-trump-friendly-policy-chief-joel-kaplan-nick-clegg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joel Kaplan</a> was a bit more obvious about who Meta is following here, writing (emphasis mine),</p><blockquote><p>We’re getting rid of a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate.<strong> It’s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms.</strong>&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>In line with this, Zuckerberg also said the platforms will <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/26/1240737627/meta-limit-political-content-instagram-facebook-opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring back</a> political content, saying, “It feels like we’re in a new era now, and we’re getting feedback that people want to see [political] content again,” which he says Meta will phase back in “while working to keep the communities friendly and positive.” This might ring your memory bells; <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1875355425601999255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Musk has also claimed</a> changes are coming to Twitter to highlight more of whatever it is he considers positive given his inability to feel human joy.&nbsp;</p><p>In closing, Zuckerberg went on about global governments censoring free speech and “making it hard to build anything innovative,” noting that “it’s been so difficult over the past four years when even the US government has pushed for censorship… But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I am excited to take it.”</p><p>Zuckerberg, like other <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/13/nx-s1-5227874/trump-bezos-zuckerberg-amazon-facebook-open-ai-meta-inauguration-fund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tech industry heads</a>, has donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. Hearing his mentions of “cultural tipping point[s],” bias and censorship, foreign government interference, and being in “a new era” after “the past four years,” it feels obvious whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">narrative</a> he, and by extension his platforms, wants to take up. His <a href="https://www.404media.co/facebook-deletes-internal-employee-criticism-of-new-board-member-dana-white/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent appointment of UFC CEO Dana White</a> to Meta’s board certainly drives that home.&nbsp;</p><p>None of this is new or surprising from him, but it’s so uncreatively depressing. At least Meta’s <a href="https://www.404media.co/instagram-begins-randomly-showing-users-ai-generated-images-of-themselves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent</a><a href="https://www.404media.co/metas-ai-profiles-are-indistinguishable-from-terrible-spam-that-took-over-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> debacles</a> over <a href="https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI</a> felt like uniquely Meta fuckups, leveraging Zuckerberg’s careless obsession with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66913551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest tech fads</a> and the user-driven nature of his platforms to bring his own twist to the <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-internet-is-full-of-ai-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">degradation</a> of the internet. This is just so nakedly the party line, so obviously an attempt to curry favor, that I almost feel bad for him as I watch him swim in his oversized tshirt in front of Silicon Valley’s characterless impression of wood, reciting whatever bullshit he thinks will make the big boys like him. It’s going to be such a stupid next four years. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck"><h3>Too Big</h3></a><p>Unless you are a giant</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A ton of major games still don’t have specific release dates, and some of the biggest potential releases—a new 3D <em>Mario </em>from Nintendo, for example— haven’t even been officially announced yet.

A lot has happened in RPGs since, and some of the things that made the first two <em>Fable </em>games so notable have become outdated relics of a time long gone. </p><p><em>Fable </em>is dragging the realm of Albion into the era of open-world RPGs, but will it also modernize the dated good/evil morality system that <em>Fable III</em> tried to add a bit of nuance to? How will new developer Playground Games balance drawing from the groundwork Lionhead laid and keeping pace with all the other influential RPGs that have come since? I’m excited to see what the team has been cooking when <em>Fable </em>comes to PC and Xbox Series X/S. - Kenneth Shepard </p></div><div><p>More games should also be rhythm games. Full stop.

It looks stylish as all get out, the music you’ll be playing sounds like a collection of eclectic earworms, and its marriage of genres feels primed to tell a compelling story of passionate people trying to get by in a world hellbent on keeping them down. It’s coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S later this year. - Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p> Sucker Punch’s follow-up to 2020’s action-adventure <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> is a sure-fire bet for a 2025 Sony success, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-protagonist-atsu-wolf-ps5-1851657667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-protagonist-atsu-wolf-ps5-1851657667">the PS5-only sequel</a></span> taking its samurai protagonist on a journey of vengeance.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-2025-new-agents-more-map-variety-ranked-protections/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot has confirmed that the VALORANT 2025 season, the first official “season” now that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-ditches-episodes-for-yearly-season-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the developers are pivoting away from episodes</a>, will be primarily focused on improvement. There will definitely be new content across the six acts planned for 2025, but the priority will be getting the the game into “its best shape ever,” according to the most recent dev diary.</p>



<p>What does this mean for VALORANT in 2025? It means balancing some of the most powerful and weak agents, improving the ranked experience, keeping the map rotation fresh, and saying hello to two new mystery agents.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-valorant-2025-agent-changes">VALORANT 2025 Agent Changes</h2>



<p>Agents continue to be the primary focus for VALORANT in 2025, as the unique cast of characters is what sets the game apart from other tactical shooters. After several balancing changes in 2024, more are set for 2025.</p>



<p>Iso, the recipient of a massive buff to his Double Tap shield in <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-811/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patch 8.11</a>, will receive some “power budget redistribution.” The agent team for VALORANT was hesitant to commit to changes to Neon though. They will revisit her “if they need to” after her drastic but necessary <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-9-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patch 9.11</a> nerfs.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="What’s New for Season 2025 // Dev Updates - VALORANT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpNsGFd74fk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The team did commit to improving two of the least popular and least powerful agents: Deadlock and Harbor. With Deadlock, the team says they are aiming to make Sound Sensors more valuable, and to give her more aggressive potential. With Harbor, they want to make him “more satisfying” to play as.</p>



<h2 id="h-ranked-and-map-pool-changes">Ranked and Map Pool Changes</h2>



<p>With six acts planned for the VALORANT 2025 season, Riot has committed to changing the active map pool each act. At the start of each act, Riot will rotate in two maps and swap two out, but have said the number “might change” throughout the year.</p>



<p>As for the VALORANT’s competitive mode, which is now the official entry point into the esports ecosystem, two crucial changes should make the climb easier. Players will now be granted a “rank shield” that protects them from dropping <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-valorant-ranks-how-to-get-radiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">between skill rank divisions</a> right away. This shield gives you one more opportunity to win before falling from Gold I to Silver III, for example. Finally, rank rating rollbacks (or refunds) will be added in 2025. If If a player is banned for cheating, you get refunded the RR you lost playing against them.</p>

After thinking about how to properly depict these idols’ pursuit of their dreams, we came to the conclusion that offering the game on a platform other than mobile would be the best approach.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In the original story, a talented manager works behind the scenes to help the idols’ dreams come true, but in this game, players will take on the role of someone who works both behind the scenes and in the spotlight to help the idols achieve their dreams. Whether their dreams come true or not will depend entirely on the player’s thoughts and decisions. We are putting all our efforts into creating something that everyone will enjoy.</p><p>That said, in order to avoid sharing uncertain information and letting everyone down, we will announce the specific platform(s) and game content, along with the release timing, at a later date. You will have to wait a little longer, but we hope to provide as many details as possible when we are able to share more.

          <p>Here at Ars, we're judicious about which of the many, many Switch 2 rumors we decide to highlight on this page. For every report on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/what-do-we-know-about-the-switch-2s-hardware-power/">hardware power</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/report-switch-2-joy-cons-will-attach-via-magnets/">magnetic Joy-Cons</a> that we share, there are probably five others we see and decide are too lightly sourced, too unlikely, or just too plain obscure to spread here.</p>
<p>But when we started hearing reports that the Switch 2's Joy-Cons could be cradled on their sides and manipulated like a full-fledged gaming mouse, we knew the concept was one you'd want to hear about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Rumor: More images of Switch 2 Joy-Cons have immerged from China.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://t.co/MplOUwKhRi">https://t.co/MplOUwKhRi</a> <a href="https://t.co/5ZdFmVlggl">pic.twitter.com/5ZdFmVlggl</a></p>

<p>The rumors of mouse-like functionality on the Switch 2's included controllers got supercharged over the weekend when a Reddit poster <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hu3rte/new_joycon_photos_from_chinese_sns/">shared detailed photos of purported Switch 2 Joy-Cons</a>, sourced from an unnamed Chinese social media user. In between the longer shoulder buttons along the Joy-Con's inner edge (SL and SR) and a new central connector port, eagle-eyed viewers noticed what looks suspiciously like the optical sensor that sits on the bottom of practically every mouse these days.</p>
<p>That could suggest a mode where you stand the controller up vertically against a hard surface and slide it around like a mouse. The layout would even allow a user to put a thumb on the face buttons and an index finger on the shoulder buttons for various "click" functions.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/former-annapurna-staff-form-new-company-to-inherit-private-division-franchises/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-annapurna-staff-form-new-company-to-inherit-private-division-franchises.1076337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/former-annapurna-staff-form-new-company-to-inherit-private-division-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new company comprised of members from Annapurna is set to take over games and franchises that were previously owned by Private Division, a<a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-sells-private-division-gta-vi-on-track-for-release/"> studio owned by Take-Two Interactive</a>. The staff that are creating the team are those who resigned last summer after it was said that there was a significant power struggle that led to the staff resigning. Now, they are taking over the portfolio that belonged to Private Division.</p>
<p>At the moment, the company that will be inheriting the Private Division franchises doesn't yet have a name, but it will gain access to the games and franchises created by Private Division.</p>
<p>The first information came from Take-Two Interactive in November 2024, where they announced that they had sold Private Division to an unnamed buyer for an undisclosed price. In the report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Bloomberg</a>, it seems that private equity firm Haveli Investments was the "unnamed buyer" of the company, with Haveli then going on to make a deal with the Annapurna staff, which gave them the power to take care of the acquired franchises.&nbsp; According to the Bloomberg report, a spokesperson for Haveli was contacted, but they stated that "the firm did not immediately have comment."</p>
<p>Private Division was responsible for creating franchises and games such as Kerbal Space Program, Tales of the Shire, No Rest for the Wicked, and the untitled action-adventure game made in collaboration with Game Freak, which is currently codenamed Project Bloom. No Rest for the Wicked has been confirmed to continue getting support and updates, despite the uncertainty of Private Division at current. Tales of the Shire is the next game to be released, with it set to release on March 25. This game is highly anticipated by many, as it combines the farming game genre with The Lord of the Rings franchise for a cozy experience.</p>
<p>As Haveli acquired the company, they also inherited approximately 20 employees who were working at Private Division. Unfortunately, some of the staff that they've inherited will be laid off as the company gets settled and rearranged. The specifics of this arrangement have not been finalized, and staff have been told to explore their options regarding employment and instability in the company.</p>
<p>Private Division was founded in 2017 as a publisher of mid-sized indie titles. They've published games such as The Outer Worlds, Hades, and Rollerdrome.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-2-beta-preview-new-gods-new-modes-same-moba</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we-got-to-learn-about-smite-2s-new-gods-and-new-modes-ahead-of-jan-7ths-beta-release.1076334/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-2-beta-preview-new-gods-new-modes-same-moba<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a minute since we last caught up with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/smite-2-preview-next-generation-of-moba" rel="nofollow"><em>Smite 2</em></a>. Announced a year ago, the MOBA sequel has seen its alpha test take flight during 2024 and is now nearing a beta period along with a wealth of new information. We had the chance to sit in on a presentation with all the details on what’s to come during Smite 2’s beta, including the scoop on a massive update.</p>

<p><em>Smite 2</em> is being primed to add five new gods as one of the biggest pieces of this update – including Aladdin, Geb, Ullr, Agni, and Mulan, along with three new modes including Joust, Duel, and Assault (which were popular modes in the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-celebrates-hitting-20-million-players-milestone" rel="nofollow"><em>Smite</em></a>). The team at Titan Forge will also be overhauling the core of Conquest mode, and adding 20 new aspects, which are game-changing play style twists for 20 gods.</p>

<p>There will also be several new items, performance optimizations, text chat, and more.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, <em>Smite 2</em>’s alpha test began eight months ago with only 14 gods available, with one mode, rough performance, and many systems lacking in depth. Since then, the development team has worked together with the community to improve the game by adding 45 gods, six modes, which lead to increased reviews and additional player feedback.</p>


<h2>How <em>Smite 2</em> Evolves The Original's Formula</h2>

<p>For those who aren’t familiar with <em>Smite 2</em>, the core starting goals shared by the team include capturing the magic of the original <em>Smite</em> and its third-person MOBA formula. They also include making targeted improvements to refine a decade-old game for a new generation of gamers, and to respect and honor the community in the process.</p>

<p>In honoring the community, that meant having to over-deliver following the alpha testing weekends. What that means is that fixes were being shipped frequently to keep progress flowing, and focusing on favorite gods to add into <em>Smite 2</em>.</p>

<p>This also included three weekly live streams dedicated to covering player questions and providing a look behind the scenes.</p>

<p>This has culminated in several milestones for <em>Smite 2</em>. The game has 45 gods, increased from the original 14, six modes instead of one, a complete art overhaul, core combat improvements and FX readability improvements, a new HUD, a new conquest map layout, big changes to monetization, collaborations such as Lord of the Rings, and much more.</p>

<p>As <em>Smite 2</em> moves into its beta phase, there’s a lot to cover in terms of what is next. One of the biggest additions will be with the new god, Aladdin, who will arrive on January 14 as part of the new pantheon Tales of Arabia.</p>

<p>Aladdin, The Sultan, is a Magical Assassin who can use the ability Three Wishes – each with powerful effects but can only be used once for came. These include coming back to life instantly, earn bonus Gold, or resetting all cooldowns. Aladdin can also run on walls, which is a new piece of tech for Smite 2. His Ultimate can trap enemies in his magic lamp to fight them, and anyone can join, which allows Aladdin to split up a fight in his own unique way.</p>

For example, Ullr’s stance swapping is further enhanced, while Mulan can plant a Consumable banner that increases XP and grants allies Movement Speed.</p>

<p>New modes will be available including Joust, which is a 3v3 match including one lane and jungle camps. Teleporters have been added for easier traversal, and stealth grass for surprise engagements. The same map is available for the new 1v1 Duel mode.</p>

<p>The Conquest mode is also being updated, which is the premiere mode for <em>Smite</em>’s esports scene. There’s some layout changes (different pathing), new jungle camps, new vision-focused camps, new jungle boss pickups like the Obsidian Dagger (which deals 500 true damage to the user but grants 20% more damage and attack speed for six seconds) from the Fire Giant, and breakables like Healing Wisps in the jungle.</p>

<p>The Aspects mode will offer a new playable twist for gods in <em>Smite 2</em>. In the lobby, players will be able to play the god normally or Aspect enabled. With 20 of the 45 available gods enabled, more will be added over time. An example of this mode is with Athena, who can no longer teleport to allies, but instead to enemies and weaken them. So those types of trade-offs are in play.</p>

There’s also updates to auto builds, role guides for all roles, role filters in the item shop, UI features like PC text chat, balance passes to improve STR and Active items, ranked reset and matchmaking improvements, as well as performance optimizations and more.</p>

<p>As for when players will be able to get their hands on <em>Smite 2</em>’s beta – starting January 7 most of the content described in this article (aside from Aladdin on January 14) will be available, alongside a developer live stream, which will also discuss everything further detail and how 2025 will certainly be a major year for the game and its evolving community.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features a rejig of the series' usual controls due to the addition of being able to go prone.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4TA6gKaTvtOC1mOjZIxCZd">blog</a> published today that goes into detail on Shadows' parkour system, developer Ubisoft noted that the Assassin's Creed franchise's typical crouch and dodge buttons have been swapped. 
</p>
<p>
This change is due to the mapping of the prone ability to the same button as crouch, which now sits on the X button on a standard Xbox controller. Tapping X now makes your character crouch, while holding X will make you go prone. 
</p>
<p>
The ability to dodge, roll, and drop down while parkouring is now mapped to the B button instead.
</p>
<p>
"In Shadows, dodge has been merged with parkour down mechanics, which unlocks a whole bunch of new parkour moves," Shadows' associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois said. 
</p>
<p>
"This new mapping also disconnects stance-switch (eg. standing, crouching, prone) from parkour, ensuring you can use any stances without accidentally going down a rooftop when you don't want to."
</p>
<p>
Many traditional Assassin's Creed parkour moves return as expected, including the ability to perform a recovery roll to reduce impact and noise when landing from height. 
</p>
<p>
The ability to climb down has been augmented by another, flashier, option to perform a directional dodge over a ledge, meanwhile:

<p>
If you're high enough to take fall damage, an additional prompt when parkouring downwards will be required. Of course, the franchise's handy hay bales are still present to cushion your fall in certain spots.

Finally, here's a look at Shadows protagonist Naoe demonstrating the new prone position. You can, of course, assassinate enemies while prone. Thus:

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTuL0Ob2EnU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
One other big change within Shadows is that only some surfaces will be climbable. This is a change to how various recent Assassin's Creed entries have let you scamper all over cliffs and up sheer rock faces, influenced in part by the Shadows' addition of a grappling hook. In short, it means you'll need to look more carefully for surfaces that have physical handholds.
</p><p>
"This is a pretty big deal for us," Lemay-Comtois says. "This means we had to be more thoughtful about creating interesting parkour highways and afforded us more control about where Naoe can go, and where Yasuke can't, making our two playstyles even more contrasted."
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows will finally arrive on 14th February after last year's high-profile delay. We recently learnt that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-naoe-has-her-own-speedy-naruto-run">Naoe has a "Naruto run"</a> and that the game will have a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-story-option-without-narrative-choices">"canon" story option for players who don't like making narrative choices</a>.

            <p>
Former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> staff - who departed the acclaimed video game publisher last September as part of a "mass exodus" - have reportedly established a new company and will be taking over indie label Private Division's portfolio, which was sold by Take-Two last year.
</p>
<p>
Annapurna's entire video game division - responsible for publishing the celebrated likes of Cocoon, Outer Wilds, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sayonara-wild-hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">departed the company late last year</a>, reportedly following a dispute with owner Megan Ellison. At the time, there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurnas-mass-exodus-of-staff-a-baffler-says-company-spokesperson">suggestion</a> all 25 former employees might reunite under a new name, Verset, which was originally intended to be an Annapurna Interactive spin-off before negotiations broke down.
</p>
<p>
And now, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division">reports</a> former Annapurna Interactive staff are indeed working together again, as part of a still-unnamed new company, which is said to have inherited the games and franchises of Private Division - the indie-focused label behind the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-sells-private-division-label-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-world-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">sold by Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two Interactive</a> in November.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Take-Two said it had made the decision to sell the label so it could focus its resources on "growing our core and mobile businesses for the long-term", and that the unnamed buyer had purchased the rights to "substantially all" of Private Division's live and unreleased titles - with the exception of Moon Studios' No Rest for the Wicked.
</p><p>
According to Bloomberg's latest report - which cites "people familiar" with the matter - Private Division's buyer was Texas-based private equity firm Haveli Investments. Haveli reportedly then struck a deal with ex-Annapurna employees to fund their new company and place them in charge of distributing the former Private Division titles. These are include the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> series, upcoming Lord of the Rings farming game Tales of the Shire, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-studio-game-freak-creating-new-action-adventure-ip-with-private-division">Pokémon developer Game Freak's new action-adventure IP</a>.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg adds the new arrangement will likely result in a number of layoffs among the approximately 20 Private Division employees Haveli inherited as part of its purchase,  although specifics are reportedly still to be finalised.
</p>
<p>
As for what remains of Annapurna Interactive, the publisher previously said it was hiring to fill vacancies left following last year's mass exodus, and that it was "focused on moving forward". Annapurna's future projects - which all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-rush-to-reassure-players-of-forthcoming-releases-following-annapurna-interactive-mass-exodus">appear to be unaffected</a> despite last September's events - include the likes of Mixtape from Beethoven and Dinosaur, Wanderstop from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> creator Davey Wreden, and No Code's Silent Hill: Townfall.
</p>
<p>
Annapurna Interactive's first in-house title, Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, seemingly faces more significant challenges, however. Game director Chelsea Hash and all other full-time members of the development team reportedly left amid last year's departures, but the company said work would continue despite these setbacks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady Studios was apparently hit by yet more layoffs at the close of last year, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, which cites "half a dozen staff impacted by the redundancies", several Rocksteady staff lost their jobs at the end of 2024, although the report doesn't state exactly how many employees were let go.</p>

<p>According to the report, Rocksteady's "programming and artist teams" were affected by the layoffs, and yet more QA staff also lost their jobs after a round of layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad" rel="nofollow">hit that very same department back in September</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-2024-harley-quinn.jpg?itok=izD__q8B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-2024-harley-quinn.jpg?itok=T-w-2p5E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady has been hit by yet more layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>Eurogamer says it contacted Warner Bros. for a response but didn't receive one, which probably shouldn't come as a surprise; neither this round of layoffs nor the previous round in September were officially announced by the company.</p>

<p>Sadly, these layoffs also probably shouldn't be a shock, sad as they are. Back in December, Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">announced that it would end content updates</a> for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>&nbsp;following the game's fourth season and that it would implement the offline mode it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-offline" rel="nofollow">promised in December 2023</a>.</p>

<p>That news came after Warner Bros. declared&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">to be a financial disappointment</a> in February last year, with the game representing an embarrassing $200 million loss for the company's gaming division. There's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">only so much&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>can do</a> to offset a loss like that.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report" rel="nofollow">a report in June</a>, Rocksteady employees are helping to develop a Director's Cut version of that very same wizarding RPG, although no such project has been officially announced by Warner Bros (are you sensing a theme emerging here?).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-wand.jpg?itok=aJMqi2vz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-wand.jpg?itok=a_uyAz-j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rocksteady is reportedly working on a Director's Cut for&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>That same report also claimed that Rocksteady is preparing to pitch a single-player game that would be closer to its&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>roots than the live-service experiment of&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</p>

<p>It isn't clear whether these recent layoffs will affect the studio's ability to successfully make that pitch, but I can't imagine it's easy being at Rocksteady right now. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

<p>Rocksteady has been hit by another round of layoffs. As support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-updates-will-end-with-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes to an end</a> with the final season, the studio has seen a number of employees let go across various departments.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> was the first to report on the layoffs after “half a dozen staff” who were part of the layoffs confirmed to the outlet that they took place. According to the report, employees in QA, programming, and art have been let go.</p>



<p>An exact number impacted or when the layoffs actually happened is currently unknown. Insider Gaming has reached out to Warner Bros. Games and Rocksteady for comment on the layoffs. As of publishing, however, no response has been received.</p>







<p>The latest layoffs mark the second in a handful of months as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QA team saw staff reduced</a> by over 50% in September. Last May, during the company’s Q1 FY2025 earnings call, Warner Bros. revealed that Suicide Squad <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost the company $200 million</a> in revenue due after a “disappointing” release. During its last earnings call, the company said that, moving forward, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’ll put more of a focus</a> on “strong” game franchises like Batman, Mortal Kombat, and Hogwarts Legacy.</p>

            <p>A new report from People Make Games has detailed disturbing allegations of abuse towards employees at Indonesian studio Brandoville, a company used for art and animation support in games such as Age of Empires 4 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>In 2021, People Make Games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7KUE1Kwts">reported on crunch culture and the industry's reliance on outsourcing</a> to external developers in order to meet deadlines. Brandoville Studios was one such developer. Little has changed in the industry since that report, but Brandoville's closure a few months ago has lead its employees to now share further stories of their experiences at the studio.</p>
<p>At the centre of this report is Christa Sydney, who worked at the company from 2019 until 2024 and says she was subjected to mental and physical abuse by commissioner Kwan Cherry Lai, wife of Brandoville CEO Ken Lai, who ran day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>The full report can be watched in the below video, though please note it contains some incredibly harrowing content and footage.</p>

<p>Sydney describes how Cherry Lai took her under her wing following a dispute early in her career, but how this led to toxic abuse. Initially, Lai imposed a strict working schedule on employees and would purposefully divide employees through gossip and demeaning words, Sydney said.</p>
<p>Sydney was actually part of People Make Games' previous report, but says she was later forced by Lai to film a statement in support of Brandoville against her will. Other employees felt she was being brainwashed, it's reported.</p>
<p>Sydney now says she was then continuously abused by Lai, including during a work trip to the XDS '22 conference where Lai micromanaged her time and only allowed her to sleep for a few minutes over the course of four days leading up to the event. Further abuse included imposing daily Christian worship, forcing Sydney to write lines like a schoolchild, daily check-ins over WhatsApp of her outfits as part of "quality control", and humiliating her in front of colleagues.</p>
<p>Eventually Lai's abuse became physical, forcing Sydney to film herself slapping her face 100 times as punishment, or hitting her head against a door frame until she was concussed before forcing an apology.</p>
<p>Another employee, Caesarion Balthazar, had an arrangement with Lai where she would take part of his salary to assist with his spending habits. This led to her, in Balthazar's words, stealing an amount of money equivalent to a month's salary. Additionally, Balthazar says he was told he owed money for expensive training programmes he hadn't yet taken when he tried to leave the company.</p><p>A third employee, Syifana Afiati, also says she was abused by Lai during her time at Brandoville from 2019 to 2024. Afiati fell pregnant, but was repeatedly overworked by Lai. At one point during the pregnancy Afiati says she was taken to hospital due to an issue, but was still asked to come into the office and work - to which she declined. Afiati's son was born two months prematurely and sadly died four months later in intensive care, however Lai still expected her to work and provided no sympathy or support from the company.</p>
<p>In August 2024, Brandoville Studios went into liquidation, though Cherry and Ken Lai convinced a handful of employees to stay and begin a new company: LaiLai Studios. Sydney was one such employee, but says she was subsequently subjected to direct physical violence from Cherry Lai on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Sydney eventually escaped and compiled evidence against Lai. Media reports in Indonesia went viral, which finally lead to police investigations. This was required due to the local phrase "no viral, no justice", stemming from mistrust in the police and justice system.</p>
<p>In response to the allegations, Cherry Lai issued a statement to People Make Games, bizarrely stating: "To me my part of the story is not important, as long as my team are good and safe now." However, further discussion was declined.</p><p>Other employees claimed Ken Lai was Cherry's "biggest enabler" and should've done more to stop this abuse. Sydney and others however say they believe Ken is yet another victim of Cherry's abuse and his silence comes from a place of fear.</p>
<p>The report concludes by noting how the treatment of outsourced workers goes largely unnoticed and unremarked upon by the video games industry due to its discomfort discussing outsourced work, despite it being a crucial part of game development. Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft and Ubisoft for comment on their connections to Brandoville.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
