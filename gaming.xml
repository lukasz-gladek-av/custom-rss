            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> has reached another sales milestone, years after its initial release.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/">developer</a>, as of December last year, the farming sim has sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales.</p>

<p>This latest sales figure means that Stardew Valley has sold a further 11m copies in less than a year.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1762195335936627147">February of last year</a>, creator  Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone revealed his game had moved more than 30m copies since launch. Even then, that number was impressive, but clearly the appeal of pixelated chickens and crops is still enough to entice even more players to take to the farm.</p><p>It is worth noting that last year, Barone also released Stardew Valley's bumper 1.6 update, which essentially boosted the game to an almost 2.0 status. This update introduced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-will-soon-let-players-drink-mayonnaise">ability for players to drink mayonnaise</a>, among a vast number of other features such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">new NPC dialogues, home renovations and turtle pets</a>. This update was released on PC first, before becoming available across all platforms.</p>
<p>As for the future, Barone is also working on his next game: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>. In May of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, stating, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p>
<p>In the meantime, if it is more Stardew Valley you are after, a new concert <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-symphony-of-seasons-concert-tour-announced-coming-to-the-uk-in-2026">known as Symphony of Seasons</a> was announced in November. The concert tour will be coming to the UK in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The yearly speedrunning superstream <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/awesome-games-done-quick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a> is starting this weekend, and it's set to be a musical one. The events will include a player who will beat a set of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> boss battles using a saxophone as a controller, and 16 minutes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a> with a live backing band rocking out as the driver collects their fares. Other notable events will see two players storming through The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild while sharing a single joypad, and an amorous attempt to clear "all romances" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> within 30 minutes - wait, there are romance options in New Vegas?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ah, I totally forgot there are <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Fallout:_New_Vegas_sleeping_partners">eight named characters</a> in Bethesda's radioactive wasteland with which you can do the horizontal hip hooray. Including one robot called "Fisto". Well, you can look forward to that on Thursday. The festival of nippy nonsense starts on Sunday 5th and runs until Sunday 12th. A whole week of saxy shennanigans. You can see the full schedule <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/52">on the Games Done Quick website</a>.</p>
<p>The appearance of Crazy Taxi during the speedrunning fest might be inspired by news of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-crazy-taxi-reboot-will-apparently-be-a-triple-a-game">an upcoming reboot</a>. And the musical accompaniment may include some old favourites from the original soundtrack. Long-toothed taxi drivers will remember the Dreamcast and arcade versions had a punk rock OST with lots of Offspring and Bad Religion, but those songs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbla-psn-crazy-taxi-drops-soundtrack">got removed in later editions</a> of the game due to licensing rights. </p>
<p>However! You can see how the band scheduled for Awesome Games Done Quick performs the Offspring track "Way Down The Line" in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1sjLtAk3EU">this submission video</a>, which they performed alongside a playthrough from a player's previous speedrun. They even change some of the lyrics to jokily reference speedrunning. And I enjoy the way they cut off abruptly every time the game timer runs out and the menu pops up. </p><p>As for the jazzy side of things, you might have already seen the saxophonist "Dr Doot" completing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAhTPRQkHdE">a no-hits run of Elden Ring</a> on his own time. This time he'll face a "controlled" set of bosses. It is very satisfying to hear the brassy doots and swoots as he calmly rolls away from danger.</p>
<p>Some newer games are also on the roster. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windblown">Windblown</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake will all see speedruns of various kinds. Some ambitious folks are also planning to nip through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ufo-50">UFO 50</a>, with the organisers allocating 50 minutes to the retro collection. Does that mean they'll spend one minute on each game? Or maybe they're planning to complete as many games in the compilation as possible? I don't know. But it could be an interesting one. </p>
<p>The Games Done Quick organisers regularly raise <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gdq-founder-steps-down-after-13-years-and-more-than-41-million-raised">millions of dollars for charity</a> in their bi-annual events. This year they're once again supporting the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Last year's Summer Games Done Quick (the beshorted beachy brother of the classic January event) saw a Sekiro player interrupted during a speedrun by that most baffling of Windows interruptions - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-sticky-keys-cant-stop-sekiro-master-and-other-speedrunners-from-raising-25-million-for-summer-games-done-quick">sticky keys</a>. But it didn't stop the shinobi slashing from tipping the event over the $2.5 million mark.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>How would a younger me react to the concept of game seasons? "Leave me alone, please. I‚Äôm busy replaying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suffering">The Suffering</a> 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I‚Äôve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‚Äòmemory card‚Äô to a youthful, broccoli-maned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite </a>enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You‚Äôll be in a home before you know it.</p>
<p>Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they‚Äôre for the exquisite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a>. Season 2 released yesterday alongside <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/669330/view/515196931452962768">patch 1.2</a>, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.</p>

<p>The new unit is the Raiden, a giant flyer that fires three bolts of lightning at once at different targets. It‚Äôs good at fighting medium units. There are also reworks for the Sabertooth (new model, a new tech) and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overlord">Overlord</a>, which is now ‚Äúlarger, stronger, and more expensive‚Äù. Death Knell is a new, scarier version of my beloved large laser boy Melting Point, but is only available in the Brawl and Survival modes, which I don‚Äôt play. An actual, tangible tactical thought I often have in Mechabellum when considering my formation is "it needs more pew!", so I might have to branch out.</p>

<p>But the star of the show is surely the new specialist, mostly because of how utterly haunted he looks from his years of service in the mechanised forever wars. The Intensive Training Expert gets an extra 50 supplies in the first round, plus a free intensive training upgrade. That‚Äôs the one that levels up a unit. In part, Mechabellum is a game of deciding how much time to dedicate catching up and responding to your opponent‚Äôs specific chain of cascading power spikes, so I‚Äôm interested to see how much this deeply troubled war bastard will affect things.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mechabellum-review">my review</a> of Mechabellum, which I slapped a Bestest Best on. Here‚Äôs the paragraph I feel sums the game up best:</p>
<blockquote><p>Its truest joys lie in wanton destruction; so unbelievably tactile for a game in which not a single shell casing is spent without minutes between the locked-in trigger pull and muzzle flare‚Äôs crescendo. Watching for weak spots, applying the thriftiest dash of pressure without overextending, and watching entire flanks crumble as several rounds of planning pay off - planning that might just have looked like panicked flailing to your opponent. Having the merest snack-sized premonition of a hunch vindicated as you scry the patterns in your foe‚Äôs placement, and having already answered their plan with a hearty ‚Äúnot today, fucko‚Äù before they‚Äôve even got close to pulling it off.</p></blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[More People Play PvE in Tarkov Than You‚Äôd Think]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-people-play-pve-in-tarkov-than-you%E2%80%99d-think.1073175/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games introduced PvE to Escape from Tarkov a few months back, and it was a divisive decision that was met with mixed reviews. Many hardcore players claimed it was stripping ‚Äòthe point‚Äô out of Escape from Tarkov, while the more casual players welcomed the change with open arms ‚Äì once they‚Äôd <strong>bought </strong>the mode, of course.</p>



<p>In the Tarkov community, playing PvE is somewhat stigmatised. It‚Äôs often met with jibes from the more skilled players claiming that it‚Äôs ‚Äòthe easy way out‚Äô, or something similar. However, in a recent revelation, Battlestate Games‚Äô Nikita Buyanov highlighted just how many people play PvE ‚Äì and the number will surprise you.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-even-stevens">Even Stevens</h2>



<p>During a recent Tarkov TV stream, Nikita ‚Äì the head of the studio at Battlestate Games ‚Äì got onto the topic of PvE player numbers. It has long been thought that PvE gamers represent the minority in Escape from Tarkov, and while that‚Äôs true sometimes, it was proven by the numbers that things balance out over time.</p>



<p>Nikita said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the start of a wipe, 15 ‚Äì 20% of players choose PvE, and 80% go for PvP. However, as the wipe progresses, the player ratio becomes roughly 50/50%.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the ‚Äòwipe‚Äô hits Tarkov ‚Äì as it did a week ago ‚Äì hundreds of thousands of players come flooding back to see what‚Äôs new and to kickstart an all-new playthrough, taking on the early-game tasks once again. However, the player count dwindles over time, as do other elements like viewership.</p>



<p>It can become stagnant within a month or two, with many players drifting off as the power players become established. Before long, it‚Äôs seen as being ‚Äòtoo late‚Äô to start the wipe, given that you‚Äôd be coming in as a fresh player against high-level opponents with the best weapons and armour.</p>



<p>The endgame loop also gets tiring for those who make it there as quickly as possible. Once the core tasks are completed and all the boxes have been ticked, it‚Äôs an endless grind of daily and weekly challenges and fruitless PvP battles.</p>



<p>The answer? It‚Äôs PvE.</p>



<p>By playing PvE, you access a more balanced playing field ‚Äì perhaps an <strong>easy </strong>playing field. It‚Äôs a great introduction to Escape from Tarkov‚Äôs maps, modes, and mechanics, and in PvE, all you‚Äôre missing is real-world opponents. Aside from that element, everything else is effectively identical.</p>



<p>As the wipe goes on, 50% of Escape from Tarkov‚Äôs players gravitate towards PvE, and that‚Äôs a huge figure. Are you one of them? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs one of the most heart-pounding FPS titles you‚Äôll ever play, and it‚Äôs perfect with friends. It‚Äôs a hyper-realistic WW2 title featuring real theatres of war and iconic battles, and at the heart of the game sits a slew of real-world weapons, items, vehicles, and tactics.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs a trailer for the game to give you an idea of what you‚Äôre getting into:</p>

<p>This is the last giveaway of the festive period for Epic Games, but it‚Äôs not the last giveaway, period. As usual, the platform provider will go on to reward users with free games on a regular rotation, and that‚Äôs where Turmoil comes into play on January 9.</p>



<p>For now, you‚Äôre free to explore Hell Let Loose and all it offers. Fair warning before you invest, though ‚Äì it‚Äôs best played with a microphone for communications, many players treat it way more seriously than your average shooter, and it‚Äôs <strong>hard as nails</strong>. In most cases, you‚Äôll die to a single, unseen shot from a treeline somewhere as you power across the battlefield.</p>



<p>Have fun!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/03/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-45-to-41/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We are back with our next batch of games that we are looking forward to in 2025. Today, it is number 46 to 41, covering a range of tastes and styles. There‚Äôs racing, management, and a whole load of killing. Buckle up!</p>
<h2>45 ‚Äì Kingmakers</h2>
<p><em>PC (Early Access) ‚Äì Q1 2025</em></p>
<p>The Medieval Era was a time of war of much warfare across the world, as different people vied for power and thrones. It would have been brutal and the only thing that would have made medieval warfare more brutal is guns. Kingmakers takes players back 500 years to medieval England, arming them with guns to change the course of history in attempt to stop the apocalypse in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers | Winter Games Expo Trailer - Early Access Release in Q1 2025 AD" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXujvsd9C58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Kingmakers mixes the action with strategy, as you will have a medieval army at your back. You will control where units go to head off enemy forces. To help them you have access to vehicles too, including a truck and an attack helicopter. Kingmakers will also have solo and co-op play too, and it is due out in Q1 2025 for PC.</p>

<h2>44 ‚Äì Football Manager 2025</h2>
<p><em>PC, PS5, XSX|S, NSW, iOS, Android ‚Äì March 2025</em></p>
<p>Football Manager 2025 is a departure for the long running management for a couple of reasons. First, it is actually releasing in the same year as its title, purely down to delays. Second, it is the start of a new era as the series is moving to the Unity engine. That means there are a number of changes coming to the series as a result.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 25 | The New Era | #FM25 Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob06By9TFOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First let‚Äôs talk about changes. The user interface is going to change to be more modern. Goodbye inbox and hello to more messaging instead.Women‚Äôs football is also being added to the game as well. Due to the change in engine, there are some features missing too. International management will not be part of the game, and touchline shouts have also gone, as well as create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. The Premier League license has been acquired though. The game is due out in March.</p>
<h2>43 ‚Äì Killing Floor 3</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC ‚Äì March 2025</em></p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 was announced in 2023, and it is coming nine years after Killing Floor 2. Much like the previous games, players will team up to take on an undead army of Zeds. Killing Floor 3 is set 70 years after Killing Floor 2, and the world is overrun by the Zeds. Players are part of the rebel group known as Nightfall.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Killing Floor 3 - Game Awards Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NE0qVN3ua4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Teams of five will face the relentless waves of Zeds, unlocking skills and weapons to survive the dystopian setting. Some of the classes confirmed are the medic, the sharpshooter, and the ninja, There will be some closed beta tests ahead of Killing Floor 3‚Äôs full launch in March, and you can sign up for your chance to take part on the <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup">Killing Floor 3 website.&nbsp;</a></p>
<h2>42 ‚Äì Assetto Corsa EVO</h2>
<p><em>PC (Early Access) ‚Äì 16th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Much like the name suggests Assetto Corsa EVO is an evolution for the racing simulation franchise, as it will have an open world. This open world is set in the region of the Eifel region of Germany, home to the world famous N√ºrburgring. The map will eventually grow to cover 1600 square kilometers, all of which laser scanned to recreate an accurate portrayal of the region.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assetto Corsa EVO Announcement Trailer [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0uOkigs9hnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Much like its predecessors, Assetto Corsa EVO will feature a range of cars, including road cars, classics, hypercars, and race cars. Each one of these have been recreated digitally using laser scans to make sure all of their details will be captured right down to the smallest.</p>
<h2>41 ‚Äì Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC ‚Äì 28th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap is one of the other earliest games on our release list, coming out later this month. Much like the previous games in the serious, players will be fighting waves and waves of orcs. You are one of the War Mages, each of which have their own skills to master. You can play the game solo or co-op of up to four players.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap - Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y720yo-w24Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Another new addition to the series through Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap are the roguelite build options, meaning no runs will be the same as another. There will be random buffs and debuffs that will impact heroes, traps, weapons, stats, and the levels as well. These will stack too and you will have to decide to keep pushing forward or go back to the castle to improve your character and their stats.</p>
<p><em>Join us next time to look at what games were the first to make the top 40. You can check out our Most Wanted #50 to #46 here.</em></p>

As spotted <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/new-geforce-rtx-50-design-teased-by-nvidia-dual-front-fans-and-led-strip">by <em>VideoCardz</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyM_5r3ApEs">a video</a> for Nvidia‚Äôs upcoming LAN party includes brief look at a shadowy PC that will be given as a prize, and if you brighten up the image, the GPU in the computer appears to be one that‚Äôs a new design.</p><p>See for yourself ‚Äî I‚Äôve included an image of the shadowed version at the top of this post, but here‚Äôs our take at tweaking the image to reveal what‚Äôs hidden:</p><div><p><cite>Image: Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>I‚Äôll admit I am not an expert in GPU designs, but <em>VideoCardz</em> says the design is ‚Äúunfamiliar‚Äù and that an RTX 5080 or 5070 Ti could be ‚Äúamong possible candidates‚Äù of what‚Äôs being shown.</p><p>Leaks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/17/24323555/leak-nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-ti-5070-neural-rendering">last month</a> from Zotac and Acer indicated that Nvidia may reveal as many as five RTX 50 series GPUs very soon, including an RTX 5090, an RTX 5080, and an 5070 Ti. <em>VideoCardz</em> also reported today on a leak of <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-geforce-rtx-5080-gpu-has-been-leaked-16gb-gddr7-and-256-bit-confirmed">an RTX 5080 from MSI</a> featuring 16GB of GDDR7 memory.</p><p>And Nvidia isn‚Äôt being particularly secretive about the potentially imminent launch of the RTX 50-series GPUs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-wins-igns-2024-peoples-choice-tournament<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The tournament started with 64 entries and crowned one fan-voted champion.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There were some incredible games released this year, and we wanted to know which you thought was the best of the best. So with our partners at Truth, we picked 64 of 2024‚Äôs best games, put them in a head-to-head tournament, and gave you the power to vote for your favorites. After six rounds of voting and more than 1 million votes in all, one game reigned supreme as champion: Black Myth: Wukong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An action game from developer Game Science, Black Myth: Wukong is inspired by the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. You play as the Destined One, an anthropomorphic monkey based on Sun Wukong from the novel. You wield a staff with different stances, have access to several magic spells, and can transform into enemies after defeating them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc"><u>IGN‚Äôs review</u></a>, we cited its fantastic combat, beautiful environments, and well-designed bosses as the areas where it shines. While it may not be a soulslike, its combat can be quite challenging and forces you to weave together quick reflexes, smart resource management, and versatile attacks to take down its many bosses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Myth: Wukong‚Äôs popularity was obvious from the very start of our fan-voted tournament. It had a dominant run, culminating in a win over Marvel Rivals in the final with 59% of the vote. Before that, it had to get through Harry Potter: Quidditch Championship, Star Wars Outlaws, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, Stellar Blade, and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, beating all of them with at least 67% of the vote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals‚Äô run to the final was more contested, with it barely beating out the Silent Hill 2 remake in the semifinals and Astro Bot in the quarterfinals, which was one of the closest matchups of the whole tournament. There were more than 50,000 votes cast in that matchup, and Marvel Rivals won by only 960. Before those close calls, it had to get through some stiff competition in World of Warcraft: The War Within, Batman: Arkham Shadow, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN‚Äôs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2024"><u>pick for Best Game of 2024</u></a> went to Metaphor: ReFantazio, but it didn‚Äôt make it out of the first round of the People‚Äôs Choice Tournament. Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership took it down before falling to Black Myth: Wukong in its path to the title. Indie darling Balatro, one of IGN‚Äôs runners-up for Best Game of 2024 and winner of our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-game-of-2024"><u>Best PC Game of 2024 Award</u></a>, also had a surprisingly short run. After narrowly defeating Still Wakes the Deep in the first round, it got only 26% of the vote in Round 2 against Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 had a very impressive run overall, taking down multiple big names on its way to the Final Four. In addition to its resounding win over Balatro, it also defeated Sons of the Forest, Dragon‚Äôs Dogma 2, and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, another of IGN‚Äôs runners-up for Best Game of 2024. The other member of the Final Four was Silent Hill 2, which won the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-horror-game-of-2024"><u>IGN Award for Best Horror Game of 2024</u></a>. It got to the semifinals by going through Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, Helldivers 2, Luigi‚Äôs Mansion 2 HD, and Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thank you to the many people who logged votes in this year‚Äôs People‚Äôs Choice Tournament. Let us know in the comments below what you think of the outcome. If you disagree with the winner, which game would you have chosen?

          <p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/these-are-the-lasting-things-that-half-life-2-gave-us-besides-headcrabs-and-crowbars/">more than two decades since <em>Half-Life 2</em></a>'s release have been filled with plenty of rumors and hints about <em>Half-Life 3</em>, ranging from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/valve-secrets-spill-over-including-half-life-3-in-new-steam-documentary-app/">official</a>-<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/valve-half-life-alyx-is-not-the-end-of-the-franchise/">ish</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/half-life-3-totally-absolutely-confirmed-by-hidden-dota-2-update-file/">thin</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/mysterious-black-mesa-website-says-its-not-secretly-working-on-half-life-3/">downright</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/valve-registers-european-trademark-for-half-life-3/">misleading</a>. As we head into 2025, though, we're approaching something close to a critical mass of rumors and leaks suggesting that <em>Half-Life 3</em> is really in the works this time, and could be officially announced in the coming months.</p>
<p>The latest tease came just before the end of 2024 via <a href="https://x.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922">a New Year's Eve social media video</a> from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788587/">G-Man voice actor Mike Shapiro</a>. In the voice of the mysterious in-game bureaucrat, Shapiro expresses hopes that "the next quarter century [will] deliver as many <em>unexpected surprises</em> as did the millennium's first (emphasis added)... See you in the new year."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="und"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Valve?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Valve</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Halflife?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Halflife</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GMan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GMan</a> #2025 <a href="https://t.co/mdT5hlxKJT">pic.twitter.com/mdT5hlxKJT</a></p>
<p>‚Äî Mike Shapiro (@mikeshapiroland) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The post is all the more notable because it's Shapiro's first in over four years, when he concluded a flurry of promotional posts surrounding the release of <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> (many of which were in-character as G-Man). And in 2020, just after <em>Alyx</em>'s release, Shapiro <a href="https://www.vg247.com/mike-shapiro-voice-of-the-g-man-says-the-next-game-hes-in-will-be-like-seeing-an-old-friend-again">told USGamer</a> that he had recently worked on a "blast from the past" project that he would "announce... on my Twitter feed when I'm allowed to" (no such announcement has been forthcoming for any other game).</p>
<p>"I was working on that game for quite a while before I knew [what it was]," Shapiro said at the time of the unannounced project. "There was a rehearsal and some recordings, and after one of the recording sessions I was having a drink with the director. He told me what the game was, and nobody knows that this is coming.</p>
<p>"This is going to be such a mindblowing re-up from what people have come to know," Shapiro continued in 2020. "It's going to really... it's going to make people have a complete re-understanding of what they thought they knew about the story in the game prior to it, and I don't even know if people are expecting it."</p>
<h2>Raised HLX-pectations</h2>
<p>On its own, a single in-character post from a voice actor would probably be a bit too cryptic to excite <em>Half-Life</em> fans who have seen their sequel hopes dashed so often over the last two decades. But the unexpected tease comes amid a wave of leaks and rumors surrounding "HLX," an internal Valve project that has been referenced in a number of other Source 2 engine game files recently.</p>

<p>Betting in Counter-Strike has been a major factor of the game‚Äôs incredible growth, especially since the introduction of skins to CS:GO. The betting scene in Counter-Strike has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gone through many changes</a>, but there‚Äôs still plenty of opportunities available to those (of legal age) who want to play.</p>



<p>These tips for betting on Counter-Strike aren‚Äôt going to tell you the teams or players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-bet-on-counter-strike-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can reliably bet on</a>. Instead, these tips will go over the best practices for betting on Counter-Strike, so that you can play safely and responsibly.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-tips-for-betting-on-counter-strike">Best tips for betting on Counter-Strike</h2>



<h3 id="h-bet-responsibly">Bet responsibly</h3>



<p>Playing responsibly when betting on Counter-Strike should be considered a rule instead of a tip. Gambling and betting can be fun, but it can also be addictive and costly if you don‚Äôt play smart. </p>



<p>Here are some essential guidelines for betting responsibly on Counter-Strike, or any game.</p>



<p><strong>Never bet more than you‚Äôre comfortable losing.</strong> This is the golden rule of betting. Placing large wagers that promise large payouts can be tempting, but if things don‚Äôt go your way, you could end up losing too much.</p>



<p><strong>Learn proper bet unit size.</strong> Knowing how much to bet is crucial to playing responsibly and sustainably. To do this, you‚Äôll need to establish your bankroll.</p>



<ul>
<li>A bankroll is the amount of money you set aside to bet with for a specific amount of time. This can either be for a season, a month, or even a year.</li>



<li>Your bankroll determines your unit size, which is how much you bet with. For example, if you have a $100 bankroll set aside for a month, your unit size should be $1 or $2.</li>
</ul>



<p>The type of bet you place will influence the unit size you use. On a relatively safe bet with lower odds, you should bet one or two units. But for more higher risk wagers, like multi-leg parlays or longshot bets, you should be betting fractions of a unit.</p>



<h3 id="h-take-advantage-of-all-the-sites-available">Take advantage of all the sites available</h3>



<p>There are a number of websites that offer the opportunity to bet on Counter-Strike. These sites consist primarily of esports-focused sites where you can bet on professional match outcomes, and skin gambling sites. </p>



<p>Regardless of which kind of betting you‚Äôre more interested in, here are some tips for making the most out of all the sites available.</p>



<ul>
<li>Compare sites to find the best odds. When betting on Counter-Strike matches, differing sites may offer better or worse odds for the outcome you‚Äôre betting on. Taking the extra time to find the site with the best odds is worth the reward if your be hits.</li>



<li>Take advantage of sign-up/deposit bonuses. If you‚Äôre just getting into Counter-Strike betting now, there are number of sites that will offer bonuses for signing up or placing your first deposit (sometimes you‚Äôll need a promo code). Make sure you read the full details before depositing, but taking advantage of a bonus should reward you with some additional funds.</li>
</ul>



<p>With any site though, make sure it‚Äôs a reputable, trustworthy site before you sign up or do anything else. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/someone-made-a-captcha-where-you-play-doom-on-nightmare-difficulty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>It's a WebAssembly application, but it was made via a human language, prompt-driven web development tool called <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0</a> that's part of a suite of features offered as part of Vercel, a cloud-based developer tool service, of which Rauch is the CEO. You can see the LLM bot chat history with the <a href="https://v0.dev/chat/4X85A52Dzde#vZBwKTIde4ZPopW5ExYEzIi38oM6vJzm">series of prompts</a> that produced this CAPTCHA game on the v0 website.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, there has been a past attempt at making a <em>Doom</em> CAPTCHA. In 2021, developer Miquel Camps Orteza made <a href="https://vivirenremoto.github.io/doomcaptcha/">an approximation of one</a>‚Äîthough not all the assets matched <em>Doom</em>, and it was more <em>Doom</em>-adjacent. That one was made directly by hand, and its source code is available on GitHub. Its developer noted that it's not secure; it's just for fun.</p>
<p>Rauch's attempt is no more serious as a CAPTCHA, but it at least resembles <em>Doom</em> more closely.</p>
<p>Don't expect to be playing this to verify at real websites anytime soon, though. It's not secure, and its legality is fuzzy at best. While the <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM">code</a> for <em>Doom</em> is open source, the assets from the game like enemy sprites and environment textures‚Äîwhich feature prominently in this application‚Äîare not.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/games-workshop-announces-new-rules-for-the-golden-demon-2025-mini-painting-tournament.1073016/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-announces-new-rules-for-golden-demon-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced Golden Demon 2025. The official <em>Warhammer</em> miniature painting competition will return this year with changes to its various categories and awards.</p>

<h2>The Golden Demon 2025 Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/6vp4sdtr/golden-demon-2025-the-prestigious-painting-competition-returns-to-adepticon-with-a-new-category-and-new-awards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer-Community</a> post, the first leg of Golden Demon 2025 will happen at this year's AdeptiCon, which will be held in the United States at the Baird Centre in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on March 26.</p>

<p>The post continues to describe changes to the competition's different categories. Duel will return as its own category, allowing entrants to showcase fierce battles between two opponents. Furthermore, both <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcry-briar-and-bone-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warcry</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-grandfathers-gardeners-and-jaws-of-itzl-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em></a> entries will be entered under the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> Unit umbrella category.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/golden-demon-2025-category-list.jpg?itok=FZTjEdZe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/golden-demon-2025-category-list.jpg?itok=ImAmsy5X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Otherwise, all other categories of Golden Demon 2025 are unchanged. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, the <em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-old-world-core-boxes-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer The Old World</em></a>, <em>Warhammer The Horus Heresy</em>, <em>Necromunda</em>, and <em>Blood Bowl</em> are all unchanged.</p>

<p>As for awards, Games Workshop adds some new achievements below the podium. In addition to the Gold, Silver, and Bronze awards, there are Finalist, Commended, and Notable awards. The latter three positions are for entries that have caught the judges' attention. It is a welcome consolation for entries that go that extra mile.</p>

<p>Games Workshop's changes to the Golden Demon continues their active support alongside listening to constructive fan feedback. This includes their update to Golden Demon 2024 entries <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-imposes-golden-demon-ai-ban-preventing-its-use-in-miniature-painting" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">banning AI-generated</a> materials in any submitted entry. This may have been caused by the use of an AI-generated backdrop by 12-time winner Neil Hollis.</p>

<p>Games Workshop will be providing more Golden Demon 2025 details in the lead-up to AdeptiCon. In the meantime, if you have an idea for an entry to submit, the sign-up form is the same as last year on the official <a href="https://citadelcolour.com/golden-demon-2025/" rel="nofollow">Golden Demon</a> website. Potential US winners, you have three months to start assembling and painting.</p>

That sort of pain is enough to make anyone rethink their career. </p><p>As one of the most important superhero actors of a generation nears the age of 30, it might be a good time to binge your favorite Holland films before there‚Äôs no more to go around. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Marvel Universe as we know it started in 1961 with the debut of the Fantastic Four, so it's only fitting that the first post-launch heroes for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-coming-to-consoles-ps5-beta-and-exclusive-spidey-costume-confirmed/1100-6523816/" data-ref-id="1100-6523816">Marvel Rivals</a> are coming from the first family of superheroes. NetEase Games has dropped a teaser image for the Fantastic Four with an announcement that a new trailer is coming on Monday, January 6.</p><p>As with the previous heroes introduced in the game, Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and the Thing have been slightly redesigned to fit in with Marvel Rivals' aesthetic. For example, Mr. Fantastic looks considerably younger and more buff than his comic-book counterpart. Intriguingly, the FF's helper robot, H.E.R.B.I.E., is also prominently featured in the promo art. That's prompted speculation that he could also be a playable character, similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-hero-guide/2900-6053/" data-ref-id="2900-6053">Jeff the Land Shark</a>.</p><p>One of the reasons why the FF are getting such a prominent push is that 2025 will mark the team's return to cinemas 10 years after the much-maligned 2015 Fantastic Four reboot. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-fantastic-four-movie-receives-new-subtitle/1100-6525360/" data-ref-id="1100-6525360">The Fantastic Four: First Steps</a> will be the team's MCU debut after alternate versions of Mr. Fantastic and Human Torch had cameos in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-review-dimension-hopping-horrors/1900-6417872/" data-ref-id="1900-6417872">Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deadpool-and-wolverine-review-status-quo/1900-6418260/" data-ref-id="1900-6418260">Deadpool and Wolverine</a>, respectively.</p><p>Through January 10, NetEase is giving away a free in-game gift of a chibi version of Galactica <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-celebrating-another-milestone-with-a-free-limited-time-reward/1100-6528532/" data-ref-id="1100-6528532">to celebrate hitting 20 million players</a>.

                <p>Veteran game developer Ken Levine has shared his thoughts on generative AI, his latest game and it having high stakes, and why he believes we still don't really know what video games are.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-future-of-storytelling-with-ken-levine" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, Levine said he believes generative AI is a "very powerful" tool that he doesn't want to underestimate. But he said it has many limitations in its current state, including persistence.</p><p>"You look at Sora, the ChatGPT video generator, you see a woman walking down the street and the street scene is beautiful--but if she were to turn around and walk backwards, it wouldn't remember where she has been," he said. "It doesn't currently understand persistence, although that may change."</p><p>Many are concerned about AI taking jobs from humans, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-boss-explains-why-ai-will-be-good-for-gaming/1100-6518421/" data-ref-id="1100-6518421">video game executive Andrew Wilson of EA believes that will happen</a>, but Levine said AI still has a ways to go as it relates to creative storytelling.</p><p>"So for all the concerns about AI, have you seen it write a good 20-page movie yet? Scene-to-scene? It doesn't know how to do that," he said.</p><p>For now, the useful parts of AI for game development are focused more on technical elements, Levine said. "For instance, training your bug database to query how many bugs you have in certain situations. But what it can't do is tell me a really compelling story that has a three-act structure, or even tell me multiple scenes. It gets extremely confused," he said.</p><p>Levine said no generative AI was used in the development of his newest game, Judas, outside of advancements to bug databases.</p><p>"Right now I'm not overly impressed when it comes to game development. I'm sure there will be more to it [in future] but I'm not super worried about it yet in a, 'It's coming to take everybody's jobs' perspective," he said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2086165271"

interview, Levine discussed how the story in Judas has incredibly high stakes.</p><p>"We've actually never made a game before really where the stakes were this high and that's for a specific reason," he said. "This is the problem with Marvel movies: every f**king five minutes, the universe is about to end and eventually that stake can become sort of meaningless. I prefer to avoid that because a player will feel rushed--you want to keep the stakes dramatically high, but you also want to make them feel like they can do what they want to do and explore the environment down to every square inch."</p><p>He added that the story and scope of Judas was "much smaller" when development began, but it grew as the team's ambitions grew. Judas has been in the works for more than a half-decade, and Levine said one of the reasons for the lengthy development period came down to its setup in being a game that's responsive to player choices.</p><p>"That's a really hard problem, and that's why you don't see a ton of it [in games]," he said.</p><p>Levine also spent time during the interview talking about how he believes that video game developers are still trying to find out what a video game is and can be.</p><p>"Our industry is over 50 years old and we still don't really know what it is, what games are. By the time movies were 50 years old, they were making Citizen Kane. It's changed somewhat [since then], styles have changed, but they had it pretty well figured out by the 1940s--we haven't," he said.</p><p>Judas is in development for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, though a release date has not yet been announced. For lots more, check out GameSpot's video feature above that explains what Judas, a narrative-focused FPS, is all about.</p>

			<p>The multiplayer games category is always a bit harder to assess for a very simple reason: your online experience may vary greatly from that of your fellow gamer due to many factors, such as connection, random matchmaking, and even your choice of friends.</p>
<p>With that caveat out of the way, there's another useful meter to gauge how any multiplayer game is doing - the healthiness of its community. As such, we have picked some of the most popular cooperative and competitive games released in 2024.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2024-hop-skip-jump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platformer</a></em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/palworld_ConceptArt_01-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Palworld</h2>
<p>PocketPair's game easily wins the crown of the most surprising debut of 2024. The first game developed by the Japanese studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-has-sold-7-million-units-on-steam-alone-is-outselling-pokemon-legends-arceus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke several records</a> when it launched last January. By combining survival, monster taming, and the Pok√©mon-like Pals, Palworld created a new mix that proved irresistible for so many players around the world. Last we heard, the game had surpassed 25 million units sold, and that was before its <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-trailer-still-gets-showcased-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch on PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>Like with Helldivers 2, the game experienced a drop in popularity as the developers were simply unequipped with the amount of new content requested by a large and voracious fanbase. However, the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-to-get-massive-new-island-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> appears to have renewed interest in Palworld. PocketPair still has a massive issue to deal with, though: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit with Nintendo</a>, which threatens to undo everything for the studio.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/helldivers-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Helldivers II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The first Helldivers game was successful enough to warrant a sequel, but no one, not even Arrowhead itself, could have predicted the popularity attained by Helldivers II. Moving from top-down to full-fledged 3D was a gamble that paid off in spades, turning this sequel into the fastest-selling new game ever published by PlayStation (it <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> twelve million units in the first twelve weeks on the market), an achievement that speaks for itself. Granted, there were a few ups and downs during the live service phase, as a few patches were not well received by fans. However, Arrowhead managed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-patch-released-playercount-triples-as-a-result/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bounce back with the September update</a>, and they continued picking up steam.</p>
<p>If you're into liberating the galaxy and destroying aliens at any cost (even killing your own friends as 'collateral damage'), there's no better game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10/10</a>)</h2>
<p>FromSoftware did not make any specific changes to Elden Ring's online component with Shadow of the Erdtree. However, there is at least one very pressing incentive to seek help more often than in the base game: the expansion is far more challenging. As such, having friends to back you up can prove simply invaluable when going through Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-6.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Activision has had the multiplayer games market in its pocket for years with Call of Duty. Sure, there were the survival and Battle Royale waves, but the shooter franchise largely maintained its position. However, Modern Warfare II and Modern Warfare III lost ground, and Activision simply could not afford a third consecutive disappointing release. Thankfully, Treyarch's Black Ops 6 was a resounding success both with fans and the market, becoming the biggest Call of Duty launch ever in terms of played matches and hours spent in-game. Kai Tatsumoto wrote:</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents a proper return to form, with Treyarch taking the helm in development once more. This is probably as definitive a Call of Duty title has been in years, with a package that executes well across all three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Marvel-Rivals-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Marvel Rivals</h2>
<p>It wasn't a great year for new free-to-play releases or hero shooters. However, right at the tail end of 2024, NetEase buckled the trend with Marvel Rivals. Many (including us) have been tempted to dismiss it as an Overwatch clone ahead of its December release, assuming we might be in for another live service failure after <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a>, but that wasn't the case at all. Marvel Rivals quickly found its user base and a very large one, to boot, having already been played by over 20 million users and securing a spot <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the US's top three most played games</a> across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X in the week ahead of Christmas.</p>
<p>That's just the beginning. NetEase has no doubt a lot more content on the way, starting with the Fantastic Four joining the playable cast, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-is-reportedly-getting-the-fantastic-four-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the latest leak</a>.</p>
