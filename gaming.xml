We've been a few years removed from all of AAA just having to focus on realism in graphics, and the results of that have been awesome. The art direction from those big and small has been stellar, with 2024 being no different.</p>

<p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2024 Best Visual Design for outstanding, cohesive aesthetic.</p>

<ul><li>Astro Bot</li>
	<li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li>
	<li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Neva</h2>



<p>Developer: Nomada Studio | Release Date: October 15th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Otton</p>

<p>To this day, <em>Gris </em>remains one of the most beautiful games ever made (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/2018-techraptor-awards-best-visuals-award" rel="nofollow">winning this award in 2018</a>), so it's no surprise to see the next game from Nomada Studio on this list either.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Neva </em>is full of beautiful hand-drawn art and animations that place you in a fantastical world inspired in large part by Studio Ghibli works. It is striking, evocative, and uses clean lines and clear flat images to make it easy to see exactly what's on the screen.</p>

<p>It feels cliche to make this statement, but every frame of <em>Neva </em>feels like its own piece of unique, gorgeous art. That is an incredible feat, as when that phrase is used for something like film, the creator controls the camera. Here, we get to shift focus and move around at will. So it's quite the testament that Nomada was able to make every piece of <em>Neva </em>so enrapturing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Second Place - Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h2>



<p>Developer: Square Enix | Release Date: February 29th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> set the stage for an incredible retelling of a legendary JRPG, dutifully recreating Midgard in amazing detail. However, everyone knew the next steps beyond Midgard would be vast; would <em>Rebirth </em>be able to to live up to the hype?</p>

<p>Square Enix delivered, bringing its world to life in stunning beauty, lush colors, and vibrant environments. Green plains, rocky canyons, dusty deserts, all populated with lived-in towns that dot the landscape. And if you've entered and explored Gold Saucer, I don't need to tell just how breathtaking and overwhelming that place is.</p>

<p>The character models are also worth noting here. Cloud and the rest of the party, along with Sephiroth, all look and feel as iconic as they did in the '90s, but with modern-day details and flourishes. They have flair, and their character models are easily among the best in this semi-realistic animated style.</p>

<h2>Winner - Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>



<p>Developer: Atlus | Release Date: October 11th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Austin Suther</p>

<p>Is<em> Metaphor: Refantazio</em> a graphically impressive game? No, not particularly. So why, then, did it win best visual design? Running on the same engine as <em>Persona 5 </em>and <em>Catherine</em>, it’s a dated engine, no doubt. It’s what Studio Zero does with those limitations that’s impressive.</p>

<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is a masterclass in UI design. It has a visual flair to it that only Atlus games seem to capture. Its Renaissance-esque style fits its vibrant and magical setting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Character portraits are another highlight; they are incredibly well-drawn and bring<em> Metaphor</em>’s cast of characters to life, making up for what the graphics lack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take a look at some of <em>Metaphor’</em>s “Human” designs, too, and you’ll see inspiration from Hieronymus Bosch, a real-life painter. The designs translate wonderfully into the game and create an unmatched and undeniably distinguished style.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We've been fans of Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying games for a while, and you can read our preview of the full <em>Soulbound</em> rulebook <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-soulbound-preview" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and our review of the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game</em> core rulebook <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-4th-edition-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=COMeKS3b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=BZgOEtTN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The core of the <em>Soulbound</em> Starter Set is split between 2 books, the rule and adventure in Faltering Light, and the full detail of the city to flesh out your adventure in the Brightspear City Guide.</figcaption></figure><h2>Toto, I've A Feeling We're Not In The Old World Anymore</h2>

<p>Before we get into <em>Age of Sigmar Soulbound</em>, it's worth noting the difference between <em>Age of Sigmar (AoS)</em>, and <em>Warhammer</em> (now known as <em>Warhammer the Old World</em> in Games Workshop's latest tabletop iteration). The original <em>Warhammer</em> was Games Workshop's fantasy wargaming system.</p>

<p>In 2015 (a decade this year and we're still having this conversation) Games Workshop had a narrative event called the End Times, which ended the Old World and started the new <em>Age of Sigmar</em> system, along with moving the narrative completely away and into a new fantasy setting (with many of the same elements, but also a lot of changes). Games Workshop has also since re-released (in January 2024) the <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> game, which you can read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>I mention the above because Cubicle 7 publishes 2 <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying systems. <em>Age of Sigmar Soubound</em>, for which we are reviewing the Starter Set here, is set in Games Workshop's premier fantasy setting, and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP)</em>, which is set in Games Workshop's original fantasy system. <em>WFRP</em> also persevered throughout the removal of <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> from Games Workshop's wargaming range throughout the 2015-2024 gap.</p>

<p>We'll go into details of both settings in our coverage of the systems, but a quick summary is that <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> is set in a more traditional fantasy setting, with the races of humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and Skaven (ratmen) all battling over the map of the Old World, and&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em> sees the different races fighting across 8 different Mortal Realms, 8 unique planes of existence, connected through realm gates. A lot of the classic races are included, but they have a unique Games Workshop twist in <em>AoS</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=8ow_ZpnD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=YlDpgsu1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Along with the books, the <em>Soulbound</em> Starter Set has everything else 5 players need to play the adventure.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Starting Adventure</h2>

<p>Most roleplaying products start with a single book, either a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween" rel="nofollow">Core Rulebook</a>, which contains everything players and Games Masters (GM) need to run the games,&nbsp;or a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow">Players Handbook</a>, which focuses on the core mechanics and player options, expanding into other books for the Games Master&nbsp;(which we see historically in <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> by Wizards of the Coast). <em>Soulbound</em> has a Core Rulebook available, but also to make it even easier, the <em>Soulbound</em> Starter Set has everything 5 players plus a GM need to play their first few games in one easy package, with no printing or other products required.</p>

<p>This <em>Soulbound</em> starter set contains extremely well-produced, visually engaging, and coordinated components that allow players to get going easily, with an experienced GM. The GM gets 2 books, Faltering Light, which is the adventure and rules for running <em>Soulbound</em> out of the Starter Set, and the Brightspear City Guide, which fleshes out the city that the adventure is set in with details and adventure hooks (and stats for other enemies) for continuing your campaign in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Faltering Light acts as a tutorial, guiding players through the rules whist exploring the adventure, and it works for someone who might be new to running roleplaying games as a GM too, but they will need to do some preparation beforehand. Reading through the whole adventure, making notes, and getting the hang of the rules, as they will be the one guiding the players through their first games. This preparation will set you up for your future career as a GM running games, as you don't have the player's luxury of just turning up on game night to play, most GMs do a lot of background work in preparing the adventure for the players.</p>

<p>The players can get going pretty quickly with <em>Soulbound</em> out of the Starter Set, as the character sheets are very well produced, starting with a full-color image of the character on the back, along with character details including a fantastic 'why play' section on the front. The sheets open up to show all the stats, talents, and equipment, as well as a quick rules breakdown for the character sheet elements so you don't need to keep grabbing the rulebook. They also have a character background section, where you can pick goals, connections, and secrets to add depth and your own spin on the character.</p>

<p>The final starter set components are dice (a set of 8 custom 6-sided dice, but it's helpful if all players have their own set of 4 to 8 dice), an introductory leaflet, that doubles as the party details sheet on the back, some quick reference rules sheets a double-sied Brightspear map for the players. The box is also dual use, and the GM can use as a screen to keep his notes and rolls secret, and handily has its own map and quick reference sheets printed on the inside.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=gRs-_xJJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=ajSHljr_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Soulbound</em> Starter Set includes 5 detailed foldout character sheets with pre-generated characters.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Soulbound Answer The Call</h2>

<p>The <em>Soulbound</em> Starter Set player experience begins with selecting a character. The <em>Soulbound</em> Core Rulebook has an impressive 23 character types to choose from, and the Starter Set has 5 pre-generated characters from those, taking a traditional roleplaying party of classes and races with the <em>Age of Sigmar </em>spin on it. Each character has a unique feel and party role, but will also feel comfortable to those who might be new to roleplaying. For example, Vel Arturious is a Stormcast Eternal, one of Sigmar's immortal fighters who like to go toe to toe with the enemy and Imren Sealgaire is an Idoneth Deepkin Tidecaster, a sea-elf magic user.</p>

<p>The other members of the party include Xan Bemyr, a human war priest, Malgra Dainsson, a dwarven engineer, and Darach a walking tree ranger (think a cross between Aragorn from <em>The&nbsp;Lord of the Rings</em> and Groot from <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=2CY8UReJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=j8mWBxA0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The inside of the <em>Soulbound</em> Starter Set box handily doubles as a screen for the Games Master, with some useful details printed on the inside.</figcaption></figure><h2>Chaos Everywhere!</h2>

<p>The core <em>Soulbound</em> system is slightly different from what you might have experienced in other systems, and it has some interesting complexity that provides a lot of flexibility in what is an epicly heroic system. As with any system, <em>Soulbound</em> requires a player to roll a dice and beat a number set by the difficulty of the task. The number of dice the player rolls comes from 1 of 3 core stats, Body, Mind, and Soul. Additional dice are added for skills that the character may have that apply to the test.</p>

<p>The flexibility comes with the combination of the target number required to roll, most tests require a 4 but this is raised and lowered depending on how difficult the test is. The number of successes required can also change depending on the circumstances. This system allows flexibility beyond single-roll systems, allowing the GM to flex between difficulty and complexity. Finding a specific sentence in an unknown book in a library would require a lot of low successes, picking a lock might require a single high success, and picking the lock on the greatest safe ever made, would require a lot of high successes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The system flows very well and is introduced as you progress through the adventure, which is intriguing, but very focused on a specific aspect of Chaos, which would be my only criticism of the adventure. It gives a great first impression, but not a very rounded one to someone who might be brand new to the setting. It would of course be difficult to give a fully rounded impression of the whole setting, as it's taken Cubicle 7 years and multiple supplements to cover all of it, but an introduction to some of the races and all of the Chaos gods would have been nice to see (and obviously a lot more work for a less experienced GM, or an experienced GM new to the setting).</p>

<h2>Age Of Sigmar Soulbound Starter Set Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Age of Sigmar Soulbound</em> Starter Set is a great package, incredibly well-produced with great-looking components. The characters give a rounded first introduction to the setting, with awesome character sheets full of detail. The 2 books for the Games Master do a great job of introducing the setting and system and also allowing the GM to expand without buying further products if they want to test beyond the initial adventure with their players. The system itself is fun and engaging, fitting well with the heroic nature of the setting.</p>

However, in light of the actions of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24319728/unitedhealthcare-luigi-mangione-brian-thompson-reaction">Luigi Mangione</a>, the man charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, the gaming community’s love for Luigi has taken on a different significance. That significance was on full display during AGDQ 2025 where his name popped up early and often.</p><p>During the charity speedrunning marathon, there were frequent opportunities for viewers to have their donations fund bidding wars for things like the player completing a specific task during the run or for naming rights to a character. For example, during the <em>Pokémon: Let’s Go Eevee</em> run, viewers could donate for the privilege of naming the trainer, and they picked Luigi. Throughout the marathon viewers submitted Luigi for almost every naming-based bid war, and it won quite often.</p><p>Luigi was the character name in <a href="https://youtu.be/HtUKlxIbUK8?si=ZZBeIPgbgSLhJ4Ek"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/u4RzOF9e850?si=dfqAo6effNtqh52B"><em>Skyrim</em></a>. He was the name for the warrior in <a href="https://youtu.be/OL3F-RryYT0?si=UJet1zlLk187DBus"><em>Guantlet IV</em></a> and it was the file name in <a href="https://youtu.be/GbR_QqEGBcM?si=GhC9hb8nse2LThzB"><em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em></a>. And of the four named characters in <a href="https://youtu.be/qdkLgOEKsOs?si=Hv3unZXT1ajt0H8K"><em>Final Fantasy Legend 2</em></a>, “Lugi” was three of them (as the game only supports four-letter names). Overall, all of the bids for Luigi — not just those that ultimately won — earned over $18,000.</p><p>Games Done Quick has a reputation for its inclusiveness and social consciousness — once <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23341082/awesome-games-done-quick-2023-online-event-florida-ron-desantis">cancelling a live event in Florida in 2023</a> over the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law and lax COVID-19 policies. So while it’s impossible to know for sure whether or not the preponderance of Luigi was due to typical gamer memeing or if it represented some kind of tacit statement of support for Luigi Mangione’s actions, it’s probably easy to say it was a little bit of both.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“We totally fucked up here,” said game director Jonathan Rogers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjxzTAcJqAM">a podcast with GhazzyTV</a>, explaining how the hack began with a compromised Steam account linked to an administrative account on the game's website - effectively giving the hacker the same access as customer service, said Rogers. This allowed the hacker to reset passwords and log in as other players.</p>
<p>The next bit involves the sort of granular detail 404 Media are obviously much better at explaining than me, so I'm just going to quote them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ordinarily, whenever a member of Path of Exile 2’s support staff makes a change, that event is added to a list for potential later auditing. But when it came to resetting passwords, a bug meant that change was saved as a “note” and not an event, Rogers said. The hacker was then able to delete the note saying a password had been changed, an apparent attempt by the hacker to cover their tracks too. Because of this, it wasn’t immediately obvious to GGG what was happening with these account compromises, Rogers said.</p>
<p>“66 notes were deleted, so that would imply that 66 accounts were compromised,” Rogers said, although caveated that GGG only keeps logs for 30 days. Interestingly, the compromise “was all prelaunch of POE2,” Rogers said, meaning that the hacker gained access before the game was even available to the public.</p></blockquote>
<p>404 mention these incidents echo other reports of items being stolen in December, but it does sound like it's all been caught and sorted now, with Rogers considering introducing two-factor authentication to player accounts after rolling it out for support accounts in the wake of the incident.</p><p>I've personally been really enjoying POE 2, although I'm playing it very slowly, soaking up the vivid horror and wonderful soundtrack before I inevitably become numb to it all and turn into a loot goblin. "Even incomplete, this huge early access ARPG is a gem," wrote Sophie Glass in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">her review</a>, "with a unique and flexible skill system and compelling world".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A new report has thrown fuel on the fire labelled "Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake". Don't ask me why people have started labelling fires. It's probably a rite to summon a Daedra, or something. Anyway, a new version of Bethesda's somewhat scorned 2006 RPG is allegedly in the works at Singapore-based Virtuos. If rumour speak true, it's being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The peddler of this particular leak is <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details">MP1st</a>, who I cherish for their minute attention to things like multiplayer shooter update changelogs, but don't especially know as a spreader of inside gossip. As such, I was wary of writing this up yesterday. But on reflection, there is a paper trail: an Oblivion remake is mentioned (among many other things) on the 2020 planning document Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">accidentally shared as part of FTC court proceedings back in 2023</a>. So here I am playing Journo Come Lately.
</p>
<p>
MP1st attribute their information to the website of a "former Virtuos employee" who worked on the game from 2023 to 2024. They'd rather not say who or link to the website in question because they want to protect the user's privacy, which I'm sure has nothing to do with wanting other sites to link to them so they can rank highly on Google for the term "Oblivion remake".</p>
<p>My sibling journalists, if that's the actual thinking here, I am not judging. When I was OXM's online editor I had a whole network of speculative <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> DLC pieces that daisy-chained to each other in a slow-mo SEO centrifuge of surgically imagined Dwemer fan fiction. Given that everything lives in the cloud, now, I'm pretty sure current Bethesda developers struggle to distinguish my Tamrielic Google-stew from the official lore bible. They're probably training AIs with it. I suspect it's a core component of the plot of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-6-release-date-news-exclusivity-races-setting">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>.
</p><p>
Anyway, the former Virtuos employee supposedly cited by MP1st claims that Oblivion is being "fully remade" using Epic's ubiquitous Unreal tools, rather than Bethesda's Creation Engine (a descendant of the Gamebryo engine originally used for Oblivion). Apparently, the project makes changes to six particular aspects of the 2006 game: in MP1st's paraphrase, "Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and HUD".
</p>
<p>
As regards blocking, the remake developers have apparently taken inspiration from Soulslikes, because the old system was too "boring" and "frustrating". The presentation of sneaking has allegedly been freshened up with highlighted icons, and damage calculation has been reworked. The remake's handling of stamina is said to be more forgiving - it's harder to get knocked down when you run out of juice. The HUD has been revamped for younger players, and they've added hit reactions for the player and NPCs to make combat more readable. Archery, finally, now has a selection of third and first-person viewpoints.
</p>
<p>
All of which sounds plausible enough, in that I could use approximately this combination of ideas to describe any number of remakes of games from the mid-aughts.
</p>
<p>
Let's briefly return to that leaked 2020 Microsoft planning document. It had the Oblivion remaster down for release in fiscal year 2022. I'm pretty sure that didn't happen? If it did, our standing with Bethesda PR is even worse than I thought. Perhaps the 2020 planning document was actually an AI-generated descendant of my network of articles on the doings of the Dwemer. I am reporting upon a hell of my own creation!</p><p>It can't be, though, because the document also made mention of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> remaster and, perhaps most excitingly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-is-the-only-exciting-thing-on-bethesdas-leaked-5-year-plan-and-im-worried">Dishonored 3</a>. We'll hopefully get closure on all this at <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/09/xbox-developer-direct-2025/">the next Xbox Developer Direct</a> on 23rd January. There's a "brand new game" in the offing.</p>
<p>Oblivion is perhaps the least-loved of the Elder Scrolls, or the least trendy, anyway. It's sort of a big green lobby area parked between the oddness of Morrowind and the grandness of Skyrim. Still, it made a splash as the first proper Elder Scrolls game for consoles, and I'm intrigued by the notion that it might be considered hip again. After all, it's hip to like things other people hate. I’m off to write another load of SEO-teasing fan fiction about the tragedy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6hVmn9FM7o">Fithragaer</a>, the most absent-minded battlemage in Cyrodiil.

So you might be able to pull out that old Xbox or PlayStation guitar from the closet and hook it up and jam together with players using controllers.</p><p>Now there are some restrictions on <em>Festival </em>local play. A small one is that this co-op mode is only available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles.  The bigger restriction is that each player needs to have an Epic Games account and be signed into the console and <em>Fortnite</em>. Epic specifically says you can’t use guest accounts on either console. That’s annoying, but to get around this you could just create a few free Epic Game accounts and tie them to some free PSN or Xbox accounts. Then, when people come over to jam, just log each controller into those dummy accounts before playing.</p><p> Sadly, <em>Fortnite </em>has yet to add plastic drum support or the ability to use a microphone, so it ain’t quite a full <em>Rock Band</em> replacement yet. But hey, we’re getting there!</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO Announcement Images</p>		</div><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We love a good MMO here at TSA, and NCSoft love them doubly so. As the team behind Guild Wars, Lineage and most recently Throne &amp; Liberty, their next step is to draw on their MMO past, revisiting and revitalising the original Blade &amp; Soul MMO in the shape of Blade &amp; Soul NEO. In as timely a way as possible, they’ve fired up a brand-new trailer showcasing the game’s iconic combat and the remastered visuals that players can expect to see when it launches later this year for PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blade &amp; Soul NEO: Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mrCz6XhEqKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Blade &amp; Soul remains one of the biggest Korean MMOs of all time, and despite the fact that the sequel arrived five years ago, it’s a beloved property that players continue to return to 12 years after its original release. Blade &amp; Soul NEO will see players transported back to the Wuxia-themed fantastical world, so that they can experience the story and gameplay once more with modernised graphics and improved systems.</p>
<p>A free-to-play MMO set in a world of Asian mythology, combat has always been the star of Blade &amp; Soul, and it looks to be carefully reinterpreted here in the updated Unreal Engine 4. There’s new combat techniques to learn, and the fighting system, which has more in common with fighting games than it does with most RPGs, has gained even more depth, which will be perfect for returning players. It certainly looks beautiful, and if you check out the new trailer you can see the side-by-side comparisons between the original and the NEO version.</p>


<p>One of the most requested features has been the inclusion of Infinite Windwalk, an ability that was originally limited by your character’s stamina meter. Now you can take to the skies, and you’ll be able to get around the world with your party of players in a much more efficient and enjoyable length of time.</p>
<p>The renewed character customisation options also take advantage of the enhanced visuals, with player characters now more visually impressive than ever before. You can even download and share your character template for other players to use, and this is a great feature if you see a design you simply must have.</p>

<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO is set to launch later in 2025. Players can <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/opt-in">sign up now and receive a special pre-registration package</a> of in-game rewards, including unique skins and additional currency. We’ll definitely be keeping an eye out for the release date, and we’ll let you know as soon as we have it.</p>

			<p>Today, NC America (the US publishing division of NCSoft) announced Blade &amp; Soul NEO, an Unreal Engine 4 remaster of the classic Wuxia-themed MMORPG originally released in 2016. The game will be released soon in Europe and North America via NCSoft's PURPLE platform, with pre-registration already open <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/opt-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>. As an incentive, pre-registration provides access to a visually enhanced character outfit, some in-game currency, and other perks.</p>
<p>Here are the official features as they were shared in the press release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remastered Graphics and Animations</strong> - NCSOFT’s graphic overhaul of the original MMORPG highlights enhanced textures and lighting, improved animations, and more environmental details and atmosphere. The team took full advantage of Unreal Engine 4’s took kit, faithfully retaining the original game’s stylized visual details and distinct charm that attracted players in the original.</li>
<li><strong>New Feature: Infinite Windwalk + Limitless Exploration</strong> - Obtainable from the start of the game, “Windwalk”, once limited to a stamina bar, is now infinite and can be used as a new mode of long-form transportation. Players will be able to reach high speeds, jump higher, and even perform dynamic acrobatics.</li>
<li><strong>New Feature: New Skill Customization -</strong> This new system enables players to enhance combat customization with more ways to expand their own distinct fighting style. Through gameplay, players earn Skill Books with unique benefits that can be applied to build custom combat techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Action-Based Combat</strong> - Blade &amp; Soul NEO's action-based combat enables players to truly feel like a martial artist, with ability combos, counters, and flexible party roles. Likened to some of the combat systems traditionally found in fighting games, Blade &amp; Soul NEO offers a real skill-based combat system. With fluid movements and stunning effects, one can prove their martial prowess through mastery of their timing and split-second reactions to their enemies’ attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Competitive PvP</strong> - Players can engage in numerous different PVP activities, ranging from Field Combat and Faction Combat to organized 6v6 Battlegrounds.<br>
• Field Combat: There are designated areas on the World Map where, once entered, everyone but your Party Members are flagged for PVP.<br>
• Faction Combat: Early in the game, players choose one of two factions. During the campaign, if players are wearing their Faction Costume, they can kill players of the opposing faction. This is PvP mode is opt-in.<br>
• 6v6 Battleground: Organized PVP played at pre-set hours.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Blade &amp; Soul NEO: Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mrCz6XhEqKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO also features an extensive and highly customizable character creation tool where players can stylize their hair, facial structures, eye color, height, and body, among many other options. Their character template can then be exported and shared with friends.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the game was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/blade-and-soul-unreal-engine-4-update-lands-on-september-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated to Unreal Engine 4</a> some three years ago, but this remaster does add some other features. Whether that will be enough to reignite interest in the MMORPG remains to be seen.</p>

The tales of the Straw Hat Pirates are beloved all over the world, and now One Piece: Luffy’s Bento Panic, a new board game from Kess Entertainment, brings the crew to your tabletop! This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party game</a> is fun for even those that haven’t hopped on the pirate ship themselves.</p><div catalogid="6332a546-d9b7-4a5a-ad95-a0d24c88b981" id="214114"><div id="214114" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>One Piece: Luffy’s Bento Panic</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Designed by Anthony Thorp, three to nine players take on the roles of crew of the Straw Hats, returning after a successful adventure. In typical fashion, Luffy and his crew decide to celebrate the only way they know how – with a giant feast full of the crew's favorite delicacies. What follows is a mad rush as each person tries to eat as much as they can before Luffy devours everything and the party's over. The goal of Bento Panic is to amass the most points (finished piles of food) by the time the bag of food is empty or Luffy wakes up the third time. This is a fast game where a full session, even at larger player counts, won't take you very long, making it perfect for parties.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each turn is fairly straightforward, with each player being able to take one of five possible actions: grab food from the bag, eat piles of food that are in front of them, try to steal your neighbor's food, block someone trying to steal yours, or use your character's special ability. Each action is associated with a simple one-handed gesture that each player performs two at a time. Stealing, for example requires you to point at one or both of the players to your left or right while grabbing food tokens from the bag requires you to simply reach out towards the bag. It makes for a silly time, and it's the fact that everyone performs the actions together that makes the game so quick to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I first saw the player count of Bento Panic could go up to nine people, my immediate concern was that this game would quickly spiral into chaos. Few games manage player counts so high, but luckily I never found this to be the case here, because you really only need to worry about the people on your immediate left and right. It's only your neighbors that you have to worry about attempting to steal from you, so regardless if you are playing with only three of you or the full roster of nine, your risk of being stolen from never increases beyond those two people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the ways the game can end is when Luffy wakes up for the third time. In the grab bag that contains all of the food tokens (a nice fabric drawstring bag adorned with the iconic Straw Hat pirate logo no less) are special "juicy meat" ones that move Luffy down his sleep track. Once that track hits zero, Luffy wakes up and will steal all the food that hasn't been eaten yet from whomever has the biggest pile of meat in front of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of One Piece know just how "on-brand" it is that Luffy would lose control when meat is involved. This mechanic also provides the game with a good "push your luck" feeling, where you have to risk waking up Luffy and losing your piles of uneaten food, or do you play it safe and try to eat a smaller pile or two first, and have others take the risk? </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a fast game where a full session, even at larger player counts, won't take you very long.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect to take into account when making your choice of actions are the special abilities that your other opponents have at their disposal. Each Straw Hat has an ability that can be activated by striking a dramatic pose as your action, with abilities like Jinbe’s “Fishman Karate” that cancels out any steal actions being taken against you while letting you then take a food pile from any pirate that attempted to steal your food. Once these are used, they can’t be used again until you've been stolen from, which means sometimes you <em>want</em> someone to steal from you. Using these skills is completely optional, and the game is fun with or without them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bento Panic can still offer up a good time for folks who may not be into One Piece and can't tell one Straw Hat from the other. At its heart, this is a set collection game mixed with reading other players' intentions. It's fun, but it doesn't offer much depth. However, it also never overstays its welcome, which makes it great as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party board game</a>, or as a palate cleanser between other complex games. Bento Panic gets better with more people playing it – in my play sessions, even at the max player count of nine, everyone was still having fun, which a lot of other games can't say.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAbO5j?object_uuid=89bf2c1e-15d7-43c1-9bc2-34cb8452cd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXNZw?object_uuid=89bf2c1e-15d7-43c1-9bc2-34cb8452cd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Barnes &amp; Noble</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX26ZB?object_uuid=89bf2c1e-15d7-43c1-9bc2-34cb8452cd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Target</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5Xdb?object_uuid=89bf2c1e-15d7-43c1-9bc2-34cb8452cd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 14, 2025 4:03 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Luffy's Bento Panic is a fast-paced game that would find itself home at any party, or especially, any anime convention. I don't count myself a big fan of One Piece, but I still had a good time playing it with friends. This is a light-weight game I would happily bring out during a party, but not necessarily one I would play on game night with my board game crew. Still, I think there is value in having a solid collection of those party-only games in a collection and One Piece: Luffy's Bento Panic is an easy recommendation for that list. Just be sure you and your friends aren’t hungry when you play, because if you aren’t when you start, you probably will be by the time you finish.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-could-be-playstations-big-movie-win-if-it-stays-faithful-to-the-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Uncharted’s 2022 cinematic outing and The Last of Us’ hit HBO show, it was only a matter of time until <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-film-confirmed">Sony announced that Horizon was coming to the silver screen</a>. PlayStation Studios and Columbia Pictures recently formally confirmed that a movie adaptation of Horizon Zero Dawn is in the works, which will bring to life both Aloy’s origin story and the video game’s vibrant, machine-filled world. And while development of the movie is only in the early stages, I’m already pretty confident that it could be Sony’s first major video game win at the box office… if it stays true to the games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last few years have seen several video game success stories grace both the small and big screens. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review">The Super Mario Brothers</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-review-3">Sonic films</a>, both skewed for family audiences, are the gold standard in terms of both critical reception and box office numbers. On TV, Sony’s own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-1-review">The Last of Us show</a> sits alongside the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arcane-season-1-review-league-of-legends">Netflix’s Arcane</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-1-review-amazon-prime-video">Amazon Prime’s Fallout</a> as fan favourites. And even adaptations that have had more middling reviews from fans and critics have been able to come out on top at the box office; the Tom Holland-led <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-movie-review">Uncharted movie</a> grossed more than $400 million. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while it’s true that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-video-game-adaptation-curse-is-a-myth">the days of the “video game curse” are mostly long gone</a>, there are still issues that persist in this field. Uncharted may have found its audience, but it is not the faithful adaptation of the original games fans were hoping for. More recently, we have seen poor critical and box office performance for the likes of last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-kevin-hart-jack-black">Borderlands film</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video">Amazon’s Like a Dragon: Yakuza series</a>. Both seemed completely uninterested in staying faithful to the storylines, lore, or even simply the tone of the games they were built upon. They simply did not accurately depict the world of the games that fans fell in love with. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/14/horizon-zero-dawn-bird-bow-1736866650308.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Horizon's unique robotic ecosystems would be incredible to witness on the big screen.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While such failures can occur in video game adaptations, they are part of a wider issue with adaptations in general. Netflix's The Witcher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-producer-says-some-witcher-book-changes-are-necessary-but-painful-for-us-too">has taken considerable liberties with its source material</a>, significantly changing the original books’ events and characters, plus shifting the overall tone. While adaptations often need to make changes to fit their new medium, these examples feel like they have become different things entirely. And for fans of the original texts – the pre-baked audience that should be the first in line to watch a new adaptation – this can be not just incredibly disappointing, but also signal the project’s eventual downfall.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings us back to Horizon. The recently announced movie isn’t actually the first attempt at bringing Horizon to screens. Back in 2022 Netflix announced it was developing a series based on the game, and <a href="https://gamerant.com/horizon-zero-dawn-netflix-show-title-setting/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumours began to circulate about a “Horizon 2074” project</a> that was to be set during the pre-apocalypse period, perhaps trying to fill in some of the backstory the games touch upon and skirt around. This direction, while ultimately never confirmed by Netflix, certainly proved polarising for the game's fanbase, who are clamouring for a story that is faithful to the one that made the original game such a resounding success. Plus, of course, they want to see huge robot animals, which a pre-apocalypse setting would naturally not feature.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, such fans need not worry: whatever the plans were for that show, the project is no longer in development at Netflix and Horizon is now being reworked into a cinema release. Given the heavy CGI effects that any Horizon adaptation would need to realise its iconic visuals, this is a smart move, as the increased budget of a Hollywood movie is one of the keys to realising the story and world’s potential and make them shine on the big screen.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If Horizon is given the same kind of treatment afforded to The Last of Us on the small screen, there is no reason it can’t be PlayStation’s first big cinema win. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s much more to Horizon than its incredible robotic creatures. Consider the success of Fallout, Arcane and The Last of Us in the past few years. These adaptations were praised for being worthy extensions of their source material and for their faithfulness to not just the visuals, but also the tone and stories of their original game franchises. Gamers care about adaptations having an authentic story. The Last of Us did, of course, craft new storylines that deviated from its source material, but most of the show stayed true to the narrative structure of the games. The result was a show that sailed on the proven strength of the game, which resonated with both fans and newcomers. And so if Horizon is given the same kind of treatment afforded to The Last of Us, Arcane and Fallout on the small screen, there is no reason it can’t be PlayStation’s first big cinema win. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remaining faithful to the original game isn’t something to do just for the sake of fan expectation, though. Horizon Zero Dawn received the Best Narrative award at the The Game Awards in 2017, as well as the Outstanding Achievement in Story award at the 2018 DICE awards, which shows how highly regarded the game’s story is. It is a tale worth staying faithful to. Set in 31st century North America, it follows Aloy, a member of the Nora Tribe, as she explores the mystery surrounding her origins and how they link to an old-world scientist, Elisabet Sobeck, who is Aloy’s perfect doppelganger. These characters and the world they exist in are captivating: Aloy in particular is a brilliant anchor, and her allies Erend and Varl are easy to root for thanks to relationships that are massively fleshed out across Horizon Zero Dawn and its sequel, Forbidden West. Further depth is added through the examination of how attempts were made to save Earth’s climate, with a rogue AI expanding to create the creatures that now populate so much of the Earth. Complimenting this is the mysterious Sylens, a constant presence and an enigma we want to get to the root of. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/14/horizon-zero-dawn-town-1736866719609.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The unique cultures of Horizon's world could prove as compelling as Avatar's Na'vi tribes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The intricacy of each community and settlement Aloy uncovers along her journey makes for an expansive, immersive world that feels completely unique. This worldbuilding is fuel for a compelling film franchise. Much like how James Cameron’s Avatar series has explored the culture and traditions of Na’vi tribes, a Horizon film could dig into the ways tribes like the Nora protect themselves from Earth’s robotic hunters. The unique combat encounters are a highlight of both Horizon games, and with the likes of the saber tooth tiger-like Sawtooths, the towering Tallnecks, and sky-bound Stormbirds, there’s the potential to litter the landscapes with impressive visuals. Alongside rival tribes and those loyal to the rogue AI Hades, these creatures ensure the games are full of action and suspense. Those same elements would provide interesting challenges for Aloy and her allies in a movie adaptation, too. All combined, Horizon is a rich source of creative and visually-rich storytelling that needs very few changes to suit the current cinematic landscape.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horizon’s story is compelling from the offset, and if followed faithfully, I believe its film adaptation could be, too. What makes Horizon stand out from other would-be franchises is the diligence in its story, crafting a world that is unique, timely, and fresh with an aesthetic that feels distinctly cinematic. There are so many nuances to the world and the storytelling that it is easy to imagine a Horizon adaptation being a resounding success both critically and at the box office. And with the more expansive story of Forbidden West, there is a huge canvas for the franchise as a whole to work with – if adapted carefully, this could be a long-term proposition for Sony. There is a huge opportunity to make a film franchise that can match the success of its source material, which has proven to be tremendous success across the last two generations of PlayStation consoles, captivating gamers worldwide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the film can take the ingredients that have made the game such a success and keep them intact, then the basics are in place for a compelling adaptation. And with more Sony titles set to become film and TV franchises, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-from-john-wick-director-in-development">Ghost of Tsushima</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-helldivers-2-film-in-production">Helldivers 2</a>, such an approach would set PlayStation up for success in an entirely new medium. But forgetting what made Horizon great in the first place – or, even worse, purposefully diverging away from it – could put Sony not only in the firing line of negative fan feedback, but also the same kind of financial difficulties suffered by Borderlands. Bad adaptations have been overwhelmingly rejected by fans, and as a result often audiences as a whole. Let’s hope that Sony (plus the writers and directors it chooses) recognise what they have on their hands and do right by Horizon.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Connor is a coffee and whisky driven culture wordsmith, with work published at NME, Radio Times, Yahoo, and others.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's certainly unusual for a studio head to announce it's happening to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The most demanding period of game development — both physically and mentally — commonly known as 'crunch time,'" Kojima said. "On top of mixing and Japanese voice recording, there’s an inevitable pile of other tasks: writing comments, explanations, essays, interviews, discussions, and non-game-related work. It’s incredibly tough."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Kojima failed to mention Death Stranding 2 specifically, and Kojima Productions does have a number of games in development, it's the most likely candidate for being in the crunch phase as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-2-tgs">it's due out in 2025</a> and crunch usually arrives towards the end of development. The studio's other two projects, the mysterious OD and Physint, both appear to be much earlier in development and lack release windows.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The most demanding period of game development—both physically and mentally—commonly known as “crunch time.” On top of mixing and Japanese voice recording, there’s an inevitable pile of other tasks: writing comments, explanations, essays, interviews, discussions, and… <a href="https://t.co/FrXRgaS748" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/FrXRgaS748</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1877861699409391835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn't appear to be this crunch period in particular that's prompted Kojima to think about his eventual retirement, despite his comments that it's "incredibly tough." Instead, his purchase of a Ridley Scott biography appears to have spurred a reflection on his own career.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At this age, I can't help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative,'" <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1878722221058986139" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 61-year-old Kojima said</a>. "I want to keep going for the rest of my life, but is it 10 more years? 20? Every day feels like I’m racing against the clock. Even now, at 87, Ridley Scott is still active. And back when he was past 60 — my current stage in life — he created the masterpiece Gladiator."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Kojima's games therefore don't need to be too worried about him retiring anytime soon, as he's still determined to keep going despite almost four decades in the video game business already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-footage-shows-super-weird-photo-mode-dancing-puppet-men-and-george-miller">A</a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-footage-shows-super-weird-photo-mode-dancing-puppet-men-and-george-miller">n extended look at Death Stranding 2 gameplay arrived in September</a> and proved just as bizarre as fans would expect.

Microsoft declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Mp1st, Virtuos has remade Bethesda’s much-loved open world role-playing game using Unreal Engine 5, which suggests a significant rework rather than a more straightforward remaster. Gameplay changes were also allegedly detailed, including tweaks to Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and the heads-up display (HUD).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by Mp1st, Blocking was changed with action games and Soulslikes in mind because the original system was too “boring” and “frustrating.” Sneak icons are now allegedly highlighted, with damage calculation revamped. The knockdown that comes from Stamina being depleted is reportedly harder to trigger. And the HUD was redesigned to make it easier to understand. Elsewhere, hit reactions were added to make response clearer, and Archery was reportedly modernized in both first and third-person perspectives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">Word of an Oblivion remaster emerged in 2023</a> when documents published as part of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) versus Microsoft trial over the buyout of Activision Blizzard revealed a number of unannounced Bethesda games set for release in the years ahead. The list, put together in July 2020 ahead of Microsoft’s March 2021 purchase of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media, included the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial year 2022:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Oblivion Remaster</li><li>Indiana Jones game</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial year 2023</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Doom Year Zero and DLC</li><li>Project Kestrel</li><li>Project Platinum</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial year 2024</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Elder Scrolls 6</li><li>Project Kestrel: Expansion</li><li>Licensed IP Game</li><li>Fallout 3 Remaster</li><li>Ghostwire: Tokyo Sequel</li><li>Dishonored 3</li><li>DOOM Year Zero DLC</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously a number of these games were either delayed or outright canceled. Doom Year Zero is now Doom: The Dark Ages and set for launch this year. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle didn’t launch until December 2024. And The Elder Scrolls 6 got nowhere near financial year 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That Oblivion remaster is what we’re concerned about now, though. And it’s worth noting it was called a <em>remaster</em> in the Microsoft document. Perhaps the scope of the project changed and Bethesda went big on a remake. We'll find out when the company finally unveils what has become one of the worst-kept secrets in all video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, which platforms will the Oblivion remake launch on? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-finally-looks-set-to-make-the-jump-to-playstation-this-year">Microsoft is all-in on multiplatform releases now</a>, and with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-games-reportedly-set-for-release-on-nintendo-switch-2">the Nintendo Switch 2 waiting in the wings</a>, Oblivion may open its gates to more than just PC, Xbox, and PlayStation players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaker NateTheHate, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-release-date-reportedly-leaked-online-alongside-release-window">who this week reported on the alleged release date of Nintendo’s Switch 2 reveal</a>, has said <a href="https://youtu.be/AIhoTirZxlk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Oblivion remake is set to launch this June</a>.

In the game's announcement trailer below, a human makes the mistake of accidentally damaging a tree, which invites immediate retaliation from the plants.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pok1Rvuv1k4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pok1Rvuv1k4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Forest Reigns is a first-person shooter that is being developed by VG Entertainment Studio--the Ukrainian developer behind Survarium and Fear the Wolves. The new game takes place in Paris after the City of Light has been reclaimed by nature and transformed into a jungle. Even the wildlife seem to have evolved, as the errant gunshot in the video above ricocheted off the skull of a mutated warthog. If that's any indication of how the other animals have changed, then humanity may be in some serious trouble.</p><p>However, nature is the great equalizer in this game. It can turn against you if you harm it, but nature can also be harnessed against your enemies if you set them up for it. Regardless, it would be a mistake to let your guard down, as nature can just as easily turn against the player if they make the wrong move. The player's choices will also determine the events of the story.</p><p>"We've always had a passion for creating system-driven games, where the player's freedom of action could shape the story and provide unique playthrough experiences," said VG Entertainment's Ruslan Didenko via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forest-reigns-announced-for-pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "After years of multiplayer online production, we are now ‘back to the roots' with creating Forest Reigns–a solid single-player FPS with a twisted story, exploration, survival, role-playing elements, and on top of all that, the interactive environment! This is the most daring concept we've ever explored. With Forest Reigns, we aim to bring something cool and fresh to the genre."</p><p>Forest Reigns is coming to PC and it's available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3325070/Forest_Reigns/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>.

                <p>If you were hoping to see more Guitar Hero-inspired boss encounters, you're in luck. Everhood 2, a trippy RPG inspired by rhythm games and the likes of Undertale, is releasing on March 4 for PC and Switch.</p><p>First announced in 2024, the sequel tells a new story in the existing universe. You'll play as a hero who is guided by a mysterious figure beyond the river of death, with the task of confronting the Mind Dragon. In order to achieve this, you'll once again take part in rhythm game battles, in which you dodge and counterattack music notes, as if you were a small character on a Guitar Hero grid.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzGP9Itd1M8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mzGP9Itd1M8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There'll be over 100 songs available in the game, although not all of them will be for battles--developer Foreign Gnomes estimates an 8-to-10-hour playthrough. Combat is also being revamped with the option to upgrade weapons.</p><p>"We wanted to expand Everhood’s most eclectic aspects with our sequel," said Foreign Gnomes co-founder Chris Nordgren in a press release. "You can still subdue evil carrot mages, time cops, robust slime creatures, and all that good stuff to the dulcet tones of Electronic Psychedelic Power Rock, but there’s quite a lot more discovery here."</p><p>The PC requirements for Everhood are listed on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1984020/Everhood_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> page, and they're extremely modest. The original Everhood sold over 600,000 units, according to a press release. It also received a DLC with the Eternity Edition, released on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, which included custom tracks made by community members. As of now, the songs aren't available on the PC or Switch releases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will reportedly be revealed this week with a trailer that will focus on the hardware, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>, well-known insider Nate the Hate revealed that the next-generation Nintendo system will be revealed this Thursday, January 16th, with a trailer that will focus on the hardware. To see the games, however, we will have to wait a few more weeks, as a software presentation is reportedly scheduled for February or March. Unfortunately, there's the chance that we may not learn when the Nintendo Switch 2 will launch or how much it will cost in a few days, as the leaker is not sure this information will be included in the reveal trailer.</p>
<p>As for the launch lineup, Nate the Hate doesn't possess any concrete info, and the discussion is mostly based on speculation. One thing that could get confirmed, on the other hand, is the massive support from third-party developers the Nintendo Switch 2 will see. Square Enix, for example, will supposedly port Final Fantasy VII Remake this year and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth in 2026. Ubisoft also seems to be betting a lot on the console, as ports of Assassin's Creed Mirage and Assassin's Creed Shadows are in the works, and the publisher is also looking into porting more titles. According to French News TV Channel <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/switch-2-assassin-s-creed-mirage-et-shadows-sortiront-sur-la-prochaine-console-de-nintendo_AV-202501140567.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BFM TV</a>, these ports are real, are not being developed by the original studios, are ambitious, and will take advantage of the console's power. The Shadows port, however, will not be released until the end of the year to polish the experience as much as possible.</p>
<p>Square Enix and Ubisoft aren't the only <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">third-party developers and publishers</a> that will support the Nintendo Switch 2. According to Nate the Hate, Konami is working on a Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater port, which could release day and date on the Nintendo console. The insider also heard rumblings of an Elden Ring port, but couldn't say for sure if it is indeed happening or not. Still, it seems like third-party developers are eager to port their games to the console, which wasn't exactly the case with the original Switch, which started seeing some high-profile ports only some time after the system launched.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo 2025 Predictions: When Switch 2 Will be Revealed &amp; Major 3rd Party Support; 3D Mario &amp; More" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RWifbMkXe_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but thankfully, the wait could be almost over. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forest-reigns-ex-stalker-devs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-stalker-devs-announce-single-player-survival-fps-forest-reigns.1081986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forest-reigns-ex-stalker-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher VG Entertainment, formerly known as Vostok Games, has announced&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, a narrative-driven survival FPS set in the ruins of an alt-future post-pandemic Paris.</p>

<p>In the game's world, Paris has been "transformed by nature's fury" into a lush, verdant, and hostile paradise. You'll be able to see "iconic landmarks" (and I'm sure you can guess which ones) transformed by nature retaking the city as you explore and scavenge resources to survive.</p>

<p>Vostok Games says that in&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, as the title suggests, the forest itself will play a major role. It's effectively being treated as "an intelligence" rather than a backdrop; attacking it will cause it to respond with hostility, but approaching it with "caution" could see it aid you as your ally.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forest-reigns-announced-paris.jpg?itok=L8ielTaQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forest-reigns-announced-paris.jpg?itok=Lj-I5Hvp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Forest Reigns&nbsp;</em>will let you loose in the ruins of post-apocalyptic Paris.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Forest Reigns&nbsp;</em>will apparently also feature "realistic weapon handling" and plenty of "customizable gear" so that you can build your own distinctive arsenal as you traverse the overgrown streets of Paris.</p>

<p>As befits a game developed by ex-<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>luminaries, you can also look forward to a "non-linear story" with plenty of missions to complete, many of which will put you in touch with one of the city's four factions. Each one has a "unique vision" for how humanity should proceed after the apocalypse.</p>

<p>Studio head Ruslan Didenko says&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns&nbsp;</em>represents "the most daring concept" the studio has ever explored, and that his team is returning to its "roots" by creating a single-player FPS with a narrative focus.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, which should give you a good idea of what kind of art style the game is going for, right here.</p>




<p>You might know VG Entertainment better as Vostok Games, the studio behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-stalker-devs-fear-wolves-to-enter-early-access-next-week" rel="nofollow">battle royale title&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-stalker-devs-fear-wolves-to-enter-early-access-next-week" rel="nofollow">Fear the Wolves</a>&nbsp;</em>and free-to-play FPS&nbsp;<em>Survivarium</em>, both of which have now shut down.</p>

<p>Given that it's a single-player title, the same fate is unlikely to befall&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, so let's hope it gets finished in a timely fashion. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3325070/Forest_Reigns/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it right now on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

<p>What’s Marvel Rivals Esports going to look like is a question that every player has been asking, and the game director of the hero shooter has just revealed their approach towards the competitive aspect of the title. &nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, Marvel Rivals game director Guangyun Chen was asked about Netease’s esports aspirations for the game. Chen responded that Marvel Rivals esports is something they have been thinking about “on a broader scale, looking at the picture as a whole.” Their approach aims to cater to both competitive and casual players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chen added that the team hopes their competitive modes or tournaments can “coexist” with their quick-play mode. The developers have observed several games managing healthy competitive and quick-play environments simultaneously. They will use references from these titles to help “both player pools thrive.” The director didn’t reveal any upcoming esports tournaments for Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Apart from their competitive plans for Marvel Rivals, the director also spoke about new additions to the roster during this interview. Players can expect new heroes to be added every three months; <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here are more details</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals have figured out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-bots-are-being-sniffed-out-by-invisible-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to locate bots</a> with the help of Invisible Woman’s ability. Also, five more heroes are reportedly arriving for the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-professor-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including X-Men’s Professor X</a>. What are your thoughts on the game director’s approach towards Marvel Rivals esports?

<p>Marvel Rivals fans won’t have to wait too long to see the game’s roster of heroes expand moving forward. In a new interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, game director Guangyun Chen gave an update on developer NetEase’s plans for new characters in the game.</p>



<p>Chen says that everything will revolve around the game’s seasons. A season in Marvel Rivals will last three months, but will be broken into two halves. During that time, players will get a new hero every half season. That means one hero every month-and-a-half for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>“We just eventually want to continue to enhance the experience, and, you know, keep everyone excited in our community,” Chen said while adding that, in addition to new heroes, each season will include seasonal stories and new maps.</p>



<p>As far as which heroes will be added and when, Chen says that it’ll be “guided by the overall gameplay experience or theme that we want to create for each season.”</p>







<p>“So it’ll revolve around the season and right now, at post-launch, we have eight Vanguards and seven Strategists at launch,” he said. “The team believes that it gives the players a solid variety for tactical match-ups or team composition. Having more Duelists at the moment will definitely enhance the Duelist experience, letting players dive a little bit deeper into that aspect.”</p>



<p>Lastly, Chen thanked the community for feedback on heroes and say that the feedback will be used in making decisions on when to release certain heroes as well.</p>



<p>“[We] want to make sure that everyone feels heard and excited,” he said.</p>

Truth is an illusion, paranoia is constant, and your humanity is an oddity.</p><p>You awake to find yourself a prisoner within a living nightmare. Your name, your past: gone, but not the record of your misdeeds. Your crimes: beyond comprehension. Your conviction: incontestable. Your sentence: eternal. The need to escape and set things right: undeniable.</p><p>Fight your way out of a living, twisting labyrinth. Hone your skills as you take on dynamic combat encounters and absurd puzzles. Meet the Cosmic Engine’s most disturbing and grotesque inhabitants, all with unique and nonsensical personalities, who are just as likely to aid in your quest as they are to deceive you.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Mix and match to find the build that best suits your playstyle.</li><li><strong>Puzzling Paranoia</strong> – Test your resolve with a myriad of environmental and logic puzzles. In a world devoid of sense and reason, you’ll have to stoop to your lowest if it means moving forward. Solve puzzles by drinking blood, forcing regurgitation, and digging through viscera.

            <p>Frontier has detailed its update roadmap for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a>, with new features on the way from February until May.</p>
<p>The theme park sim sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2s-first-paid-dlc-releases-today-alongside-major-update">received its first major free update back in December</a>, alongside its first paid DLC.</p>
<p>The next update will arrive in February, bringing new features like custom video billboards, custom speakers, synchronised coasters, and interchangeable coaster cars.</p>

<p>As for new rides, there will be new stock coasters as well as the return of flat ride Pathos III. Other adjustments will include enhanced guest navigation; ongoing guest, economy and management enhancements; and ongoing stability and performance enhancements.</p>
<p>The third update will arrive a month later, which will allow guests to jettison off flumes (ouch) and add round-bottomed flumes and inflatable deformation. Water rides are a major part of the sequel, which Frontier is continuing to tweak post-release.</p>
<p>Other additions include making career maps available in sandbox mode as starting layouts, more stock coasters, and another returning ride.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Two more updates will then take place in April and May, although these remain under construction.</p>
<p>While an image of the roadmap has been shared, Frontier noted it is non-exhaustive and the developer is continuing to investigate crash and bug reports. Each update will bring a full list of changes.</p>
<p>Lastly, the developer is also looking to bring back some of the themes from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a> game, with more to share in future.</p>
<p>"Planet Coaster 2's flexible creation tools are as compulsive as ever, but the fun butts up against an exhausting UI, uninspired management gameplay, and conspicuous content gaps that feel like cynical spaces for DLC," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-review">Eurogamer Planet Coaster 2 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
