Plus, Dune: Awakening is currently the top-selling game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>, with the entry cost being $50.

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For context, Dune: Awakening is proving much more popular than Dune: Spice Wars, which is a strategy title. The latter topped out with 8,397 concurrent players on Valve's storefront, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1605220/charts/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. As such, Dune: Awakening appears to be the biggest game ever for the Dune franchise--with four other games based on the sci-fi series coming out between 1992 and 2001.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Funcom has confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/">Dune: Awakening will arrive on home consoles in 2026</a>. That said, the studio hasn't stated exactly which systems will get the game, though PS5 and Xbox Series X|S would make the most sense. As for Switch 2, that seems more up in the air.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-multiplayer-guide-how-to-party-up-with-friends/1100-6532181/">Dune: Awakening guide for partying up with friends</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2-is-now-nintendos-fastest-selling-console-worldwide.1215474/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that the Switch 2 has become the gaming giant's fastest-selling console worldwide, having reached a major milestone in just four days.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1932620051955270127" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Nintendo says the Switch 2 sold 3.5 million copies within the first four days of its release, thus making it the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware ever" around the world.</p>

<p>The console has also set records for Nintendo in specific regions of the globe; earlier this week, it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-console-in-uk-history-but-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-launches-were-bigger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Switch 2 is Nintendo's fastest-selling machine in the UK, although it hasn't pipped the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S to the post as the country's fastest-selling games console ever.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-multiple-consoles.jpg?itok=WxQygTUk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-multiple-consoles.jpg?itok=9C0bqQLP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch 2 has become the fastest-selling Nintendo console around the world.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've somehow missed out on the Switch 2's launch, it's Nintendo's newest console. Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">on June 5th</a>, the console packs more powerful internals than its predecessor, as well as a larger screen, magnetic Joy-Cons, and various other improvements.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launched with&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>as its main draw, but it also has a number of last-gen and current-gen ports under its belt, and a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">original Switch games</a> have received either free or paid upgrades to enhance their performance on the new console.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether the console will go on to fulfil Nintendo's expectations. The company said last month that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year" rel="nofollow">expects to sell 15 million</a> Switch 2 units in its first year, and a Bloomberg report earlier this year suggested that Nintendo is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">preparing to manufacture 20 million units</a> for sale in the same time period.</p>

<p>This is a strong start for the Switch 2, though, and even if it hasn't beaten the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo will be happy that the new machine appears to have outsold the original Switch, at least in terms of the first four days.</p>




<p>You can grab a Switch 2 right now from any number of retailers (assuming the console is in stock at the time you're reading this, of course).</p>

Every expansion in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>has changed how the game plays so much that very few cards from the base Genetic Apex set see use today. Still, some cards have held their ground despite the power creep, and you’ll undoubtedly sow fear into the eyes of your foes by bringing them into battle. Here are five monsters that are well worth bringing into your deck.</p><h2 id="h80"><a id="1"></a>Rampardos</h2><p><strong>Set</strong>: Space-Time Smackdown: Dialga</p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Rampardos is so strong that you could be tricked into thinking it’s an ex card. Its damage potential is on par with Giratina, and you only need a <em>single energy </em>for it to attack. Additionally, it packs respectable survivability at 150 HP. 50 damage recoil <em>does </em>admittedly sting, but since this only triggers on a KO, Rampardos can still headbutt way above its weight class against bulky opponents.</p><figure id="" data-id="057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-recommend-id="image://057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-recommend-id="image://057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This monster was already good when it debuted in the Space-Time Smackdown expansion, and the introduction of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rare Candy</a></span> has only made it better. Nearly every Fighting-type deck is built around this monster as of writing, and it’s easy to see why.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Cards that evolve from fossils are always risky, and Rampardos is no exception. You can’t use a Pokéball to get a fossil in your hand, and it’s vulnerable to a quick KO via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/225&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sabrina</a></span> if you have nothing else on your bench.

Given the overwhelming prevalence of Supporter cards in the average <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>deck, boosting that 50 damage to 100 damage is remarkably easy. And since it only needs two colorless energy to attack, it can slot into any deck that needs a secondary attacker. Want to pair the overwhelming power of Rampardos with Sivally? You can, and many players do!</p><figure id="" data-id="4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-recommend-id="image://4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-recommend-id="image://4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On top of all these perks, Silvally is only a Stage-1 evolution too. That is to say, it can get on the field relatively fast and won’t compete with any Rare Candy users. Even its pre-evolutionary form <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/60&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/60" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Type: Null</a></span> packs respectable bulk while outputting acceptable damage in the early game.

Its colorless typing also means it won’t ever hit any enemy weaknesses.</p><hr><h2 id="h82"><a id="3"></a>Magnezone</h2><p><strong>Set</strong>: Space-Time Smackdown (both sets)</p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-magnezone-deck-guide-1851769937&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-magnezone-deck-guide-1851769937">Magnezone was a meta-shifting force upon release</a></span>, and it’s still incredibly strong now. <strong>It pairs best with </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/98&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/98" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Magneton</strong></a></span><strong> from the launch Genetic Apex set</strong>, as it can charge Lightning Energy on the bench while you simultaneously apply Energy to an attacker on the front line. <strong>110 </strong>damage is also a <em>lot </em>of damage, putting it more in line with a monster like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solgaleo ex</a></span> than most of its non-ex contemporaries.</p><figure id="" data-id="81dca8f8692338ab4ed7ff1b12606289" data-recommend-id="image://81dca8f8692338ab4ed7ff1b12606289" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Magnezone card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Magnezone card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="81dca8f8692338ab4ed7ff1b12606289" data-recommend-id="image://81dca8f8692338ab4ed7ff1b12606289" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Magnezone card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Magnezone is one of the best pairings with </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/66&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/66" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Oricorio</strong></a></span><strong>, whose Safeguard ability has single-handedly changed the way everyone must build their deck</strong>. These two monsters are far from invincible together, especially if your opponent gets their strongest attackers on the front lines early on. But just putting Oricorio on the field will force your opponent to change their playstyle, which can net you wins if they don’t have an established gameplan for dealing with the bird.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Magnezone is the rare Stage-2 monster that does <em>not </em>want to use Rare Candy, so it’s slower to get up and running than other meta-dominant evolutions. Spending an extra turn to evolve might not seem like a big deal, but <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>is so fast-paced now that you want to build momentum in your favor as soon as you can. Further, just placing Magneton on the field may compel your opponent to use cards that make you shuffle your deck, potentially tossing Magnezone out of your hand right as you were counting on playing it.</p><hr><h2 id="h83"><a id="4"></a>Meowscarada</h2><p><strong>Set</strong>: Shining Revelry</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>One of the best ex-counters in the game so far.

This is fine for picking off basic Pokémon before they can evolve into Stage-2 forms, and two-shotting Pokémon like Oricorio isn’t bad. However, this still leaves room for your opponent to chip away at Meowscarada before finally bringing in an ex Pokémon to blast it away.</p><p>Mewoscarada typically pairs with other grass-type attackers like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/12&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decidueye ex</a></span> who can cover the cat’s weaknesses and greatly benefit from its strengths.

Of course, what you’re really bringing the ninja frog along for is its <strong>Water Shuriken </strong>ability. This lets Greninja attack <em>any </em>of your opponent’s Pokémon, even as it sits safely on the bench.

Its base form <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/87&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/87" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Froakie</a></span> is mostly a liability until it evolves, and 120 HP after evolution is low enough for most leading damage dealers to one-shot it. Greninja can pick off foes in a pinch in the active slot, but otherwise you’ll want this frog’s big tongue parked on a stacked bench where it’s safe from a surprise Sabrina switch-in.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If he's referring to the length of the game, however, <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/34716" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Long to Beat?</a> has the average Stardew Valley playtime listed as over 50 hours for just the main story, and around 168 hours for a completionist run. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, these 10 words sent a ripple of excitement through his fan communities, with one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hauntedchocolatier/comments/1l8mvvb/comment/mx62e32/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>exclaiming</u></a>: "[Concerned Ape] STOP TEASING. I MEAN- DONT STOP TEASING. I MEAN- IDK IM SO EXCITED BUT I DONT WANT U TO RUSH TAKE UR SWEET ASS TIME WE LOVE U."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Barone admitted that he "didn't want to just be the Stardew Valley guy," explaining that was why he's currently working on Haunted Chocolatier. We shouldn't expect a release date anytime soon, though — there's "still a lot to be done," Barone recently admitted, particularly as he feels it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-says-he-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2-but-its-so-much-easier-to-add-more-stuff-to-stardew-valley-than-make-a-new-game-from-scratch"><u>"got to be better" than Stardew Valley</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, he also suggested that he may <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-says-he-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2-but-its-so-much-easier-to-add-more-stuff-to-stardew-valley-than-make-a-new-game-from-scratch"><u>"eventually make a Stardew Valley 2."</u></a> Before you get too excited, however, the developer also said it's "so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's all the systems — all the major systems — are already all done. That’s the stuff that’s not fun to do. When I make an update [for Stardew Valley now], it’s like, you know, oh, throw in this, throw in that.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launch-helps-street-fighter-6-hit-5-million-sales-2-years-after-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> has now sold over 5 million copies, Capcom has announced. That’s up from the 4 million reported in September 2024. The latest sales milestone was helped by the fighting game’s launch on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom said it aimed to “maximize the game’s userbase” by bringing Street Fighter 6, now two years old, to the Switch 2 at launch. The Switch 2 version has exclusive modes designed for the console, and new gameplay features that utilize the gyro functionality of the Joy-Con 2. It’s worth noting the Switch 2 version has crossplay, maximising the pool of players available for matchmaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These initiatives have contributed to Street Fighter 6’s wide appeal, expanded global sales and resulted in the title achieving the milestone of 5 million units sold,” Capcom said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-punches-through-3-million-copies-sold"><u>Street Fighter 6 hit 3 million copies sold back in January</u></a> 2024, seven months after launch. Capcom has said Street Fighter 6 is “generally progressing in line with our expectations,” but before launch it revealed it had aimed for the sequel to outsell Street Fighter 5, targeting over 10 million copies sold over the course of its lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we do not communicate specific figures for internal budgets, we look to outperform the title’s predecessor, Street Fighter 5, and are aiming for more than 10 million units over the life of the title,” Capcom said. Street Fighter 6, then, still has a long way to go before it beats Street Fighter 5’s sales total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put Street Fighter 6’s sales into context, 1993 SNES hit Street Fighter 2 Turbo sold 4.1 million copies, the seminal Street Fighter 2 sold 6.30 million, and Street Fighter 5 has sold 7.8 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another interesting comparison is with fighting game rival <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1"><u>Mortal Kombat 1</u></a>, which has also sold 5 million copies since going on sale in September 2023. Mortal Kombat is typically the best-selling fighting game franchise, outselling the likes of Street Fighter and Tekken by some margin. But Mortal Kombat 1 is seen as a sales disappointment, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-mortal-kombat-1-wont-get-any-more-dlc-characters-or-story-chapters-as-netherrealm-needs-to-shift-focus-to-the-next-project">developer NetherRealm recently confirmed it had left it behind to work on its next project</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom, meanhwile, continues to support Street Fighter 6 into its third year, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-confirms-year-3-roster-for-street-fighter-6">recently announced a set of four brand new DLC characters</a>: Sagat is out this summer; C. Viper this fall; Alex early spring 2026; and finally, Ingrid late spring 2026. The announcement was made in a trailer starring pro wrestler Kenny Omega, who dressed up as each DLC character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-review">Street Fighter 6 review</a> returned a 9/10. We said: "Street Fighter 6 is the most feature-rich a Street Fighter has ever been at launch, but even beyond that, it's roster of 18 characters is excellent, the new mechanics revitalize the one-on-one fighting formula, and it absolutely nails all of the little things that make for a stellar fighting game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<figure><a title="Joy-Con 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/64b5e14804dbd/joy-con-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A few days back, the online repair community iFixit <a href="https://x.com/iFixit/status/1930781813770727437">posted a brief teardown</a> of the new Switch 2 Joy-Con and confirmed that the sticks are nearly identical to the Switch 1 in terms of how they've been built.</p>
<p>Naturally, then, this has caused a bit of kerfuffle with fans; many of which are understandably concerned that Joy-Con drift will continue to be a major issue for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>So much so, in fact, that GuliKit – a company that specialises in the production of hall effect and TMR joysticks – has confirmed it is hard at work on producing replacement sticks for the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Stick drift had plagued the original Switch during its (ongoing) lifespan, with Nintendo facing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/05/switch-joy-con-drift-class-action-lawsuit-dismissed-after-five-years">numerous lawsuits over the issue</a>. Here at Nintendo Life, we've had staff members burn through several Joy-Con controllers thanks to drifting, so it's definitely a pretty widespread issue.</p>
<p>With the Switch 2 still in its infancy, it's hard to know at this stage whether Joy-Con drift will continue to be a major problem, but it's one we'll be keeping a close eye on in the coming months and years.</p>

            <p>Mindseye, the game from ex-Rockstar president Leslie Benzies-helmed studio Build a Rocket Boy, has arrived. Its launch has gone, er, a bit glitchily, currently landing the game at a mixed reception on Steam. That said, the studio have at least confirmed an update designed to improve Mindseye's performance is on the way.
</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, the sort of GTA-ish/Cyberpunk-ish game's road to release had been plenty weird prior to it breaking cover. Build a Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard had seemingly <a href="https://www.vg247.com/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-concerted-effort-against-it">suggested on the game's Discord server</a> that he believed people were being paid to say negative things about Mindseye, and two other high-profile execs had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-week-before-launch-two-mindseye-studio-executives-have-left-the-company-which-im-sure-is-a-positive-sign">departed the studio</a> not long before release.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's now debuted to mixed Steam reviews and plenty of clips on the socials of players <a href="https://x.com/ItsJesseGomez/status/1932524274700480613">running into glitches</a> or citing issues. The one that's caught my eye in particular is <a href="https://x.com/SlashLP89/status/1932517088280957096">multiple</a> <a href="https://x.com/viktorlindn/status/1932508112407445708">folks</a> failing a mission because they've nudged an NPC named Seb with their ATV and he's responded by bursting into a spaghettified mess of elongated limbs.</p>
<p>To be fair, being hit by a vehicle moving at speed is generally known to make your body contort in painful-looking ways that it isn't supposed to, but I've yet to see any real life car accidents result into someone's neck, arms and legs all instantly growing the giraffe length as they roll across the ground.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a> also mention issues getting the game to run at a decent clip, with some citing the likes of stuttering, FPS drops, textures flickering, and also enemy corpses which "twitch like ragdoll puppets".</p>
<p>In response to the day one performance issues, Build a Rocket Boy have said they've got a third patch for the game in the works, with a community manager writing the following in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1l8acbd/update_on_performance/">a post</a> on the game's subreddit:</p>
<blockquote><p>We understand that the current minimum spec requirements are very high, but our engineering team are working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles by integrating the performance improvements in Unreal Engine V5.6. We will provide patch 3 update timing, including these improvements, within the next 24 hours.</p></blockquote>
<p>They also asked for feedback on the game's main campaign, and its map editory "Build.Mindseye" mode. I'll give them a 10/10 solely in the NPC spaghettification department.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And to be abundantly clear, <strong>ex Pokémon are still prevalent in the game’s strongest decks</strong>. The difference now is how you incorporate them into your deck, as many launch-day strategies are virtually obsolete now. Let’s break it down.</p><h2 id="h676266"><a id="1"></a>The ex-killer cards are on the loose</h2><p>In the current meta, ex Pokémon have to contend with several cards that exist <em>specifically </em>to defeat them. In past expansions, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2a/36&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2a/36" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sudowoodo</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/71&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red</a></span> were common staples in competitive decks. They’ve gone down in usage as of writing, but they’re still threats you need to watch out for. The 20 extra damage Red grants against ex Pokémon can turn otherwise survivable attacks into lethal damage, so you’ll always have to consider the possibility that your opponent could play that card during their next turn.</p><p>Meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meowscarada</a></span> is still seeing use in the competitive landscape. 60 damage for two Grass Energy on a Stage-2 monster wouldn’t normally be impressive, but<strong> its attack gets a massive bump up to 130 damage when facing ex opponents</strong>. Its Grass-typing is also dangerous, as it can make use of type-specific healing cards such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/219&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erika</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/147&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leaf Cape</a></span> to keep it on the field longer.

The safeguard ability nullifies damage from ex Pokémon, which can potentially trap you into an unwinnable state if you aren’t careful. It’s not <em>invincible </em>against ex Pokémon, as Oricorio can still take indirect damage. For example, Darkrai can still inflict chip damage via Nightmare Aura, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/33&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incineroar ex</a></span> can damage Oricorio by using Fire Fang to inflict burn. Still, <strong>considering ex Pokemon can inflict up to 200 damage in a single turn, cutting their maximum potential damage down to 20 is a serious nerf</strong>. Even if Oricorio isn’t <em>meta </em>at any point, its sheer presence in the game means you have to plan a counter for it in the event it shows up.</p><p>Combine all the above factors with the fact that ex Pokémon award two points upon defeat, and you get an environment where these monsters are way riskier to use than before. Decks consisting solely of ex Pokemon can still work, but they now need to be built with the above threats in mind to avoid completely unwinnable matchups.</p><h2 id="h676267"><a id="2"></a>How to incorporate ex Pokémon into your deck</h2><p>In previous expansions, the most prevalent non-ex Pokémon played supporting roles. For example, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/22&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaymin</a></span> would stay on the bench to heal, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1a/56&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1a/56" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Druddigon</a></span> would take the lead on the front line while you stacked Energy on your heavy hitter. Now, it’s much wiser to pair a strong ex-Pokémon with a capable non-ex attacker. For example, players using <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solgaleo ex</a></span> will typically bring <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/111&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skarmory</a></span> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/27&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiinotic</a></span> to inflict damage in the early game and take out any ex killers that could stop them later. You will find yourself praying for a good starting hand that doesn’t force you to deploy your late-game cards off the bat, but that’s practically unavoidable no matter which deck you run.</p><p>Alternatively, you can run a pure ex-deck as long as you have contingency plans in mind against your toughest matchups. For example, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515">Darkrai ex</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/35&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giratina ex</a></span> are still very strong together despite the shifting meta. Darkrai’s Nightmare Aura ability paired with tools like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/146&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poison Barb</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/148&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rocky Helmet</a></span> can counter Oricorio, and Giratina’s huge burst damage potential can bring down Meowscarada. It’s not a consistently successful strategy, but no deck ever is. You just need a strategy that works at least as often as it doesn’t.</p><h2 id="h676268"><a id="3"></a>In the end, you need luck and skill to win</h2><p>While ex Pokémon have huge obstacles they need to watch out for, many previously reliable Pokémon are also struggling because of how aggressive the game has become. Rare Candy is a huge culprit here: a player can now get a powerful Stage 2 monster on the field as early as turn three or four and begin a sweep that only a perfect hand can counter. Meanwhile, you could face the same deck and get the easiest win of your life just because your opponent’s candies are at the bottom of their deck. Cards like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/P-A/6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/P-A/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Card</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/155&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mars</a></span> have spiked in popularity strictly to keep strong monsters off the field as much as possible.</p><p>The competitive landscape of <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> has seen huge changes with every expansion introduced so far, so all the strategies listed here could become obsolete in a month’s time.

                <p>In less than a week, the new Switch 2 console has become the "fastest-selling" hardware globally for Nintendo, as the company reported 3.5 million units were sold in just four days.</p><p>"Fans around the world are showing their enthusiasm for Nintendo Switch 2 as an upgraded way to play at home and on the go,” Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said in a press statement following the announcement of the sales milestone. "We are thankful for their response and happy to see the fun they are already having with Nintendo Switch 2 as they explore new features and games that bring friends and family together in new ways."</p><p>This makes for one of the biggest console launches in history, thanks in part to Nintendo ensuring that it had enough stock available to meet the high demand for the device. In fact, according to industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/zhugeex/status/1932624211878818015?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Daniel Ahmad</a>, the number would make the Switch 2 launch <em>the </em>biggest in home-console history. </p><p>In comparison, the Switch reached 2.74 million units sold in its first month and Sony reported that it had shipped--not sold--3.4 million PS5 consoles during the first month that it was available to purchase. It is worth noting that stock shortages were a major problem for Sony at the time. due to various issues like the global semiconductor shortage.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/">Nintendo is predicting that it will sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles</a> during its current business year--ending in March 2026--and it has been reported that this figure might increase to 20 million as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reportedly-using-samsung-chips-as-nintendo-tries-to-meet-demand/1100-6531666/">Samsung is rumored to be manufacturing chips for the device</a>. Overall, it looks like the Switch 2 is off to a strong start, and it'll be interesting to see if it reaches--or surpasses--the current lifetime sales total of the Switch, which stand at 152 million units sold as of February 2025.</p>

                <p>In just under two months since its release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has emerged as one of the most unexpected hits of 2025, with <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1927364988219383892" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 3.3 million copies</a> sold since late April. Now, developer Sandfall Interactive has shared a new patch for the game that gives players another chance to fight Simon, one of the most difficult bosses in the game.</p><p>Simon is an optional boss who can be found in The Abyss, and he has very few weaknesses. As part of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/499449376025873686?curator_clanid=3693985" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the 1.3.0 patch</a>, players can now get a rematch with Simon after beating him the first time. Assuming they can beat him, of course. It's not an easy fight by any stretch, and this undead warrior is a challenge even for veteran players.</p><p>Sandfall notes that the current patch addresses nearly 300 bugs that were found in the game, although it only lists a handful in the notes. According to the devs, a "general polish" was added across collisions, terrain, and scripting. The cutscenes should also scale properly across non-standard resolutions after this patch.</p><p>There aren't any new features in the current update, but the developers have acknowledged multiple <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-address-potential-photo-mode-and-more/1100-6531932/" data-ref-id="1100-6531932">requests for a photo mode</a>, even from other members of the team. According to Sandfall, the developers are "investigating mouse sensitivity issues" after this patch. Sandfall has also added a handful of digital items to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop/app/1903340" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clair Obscur's Steam points shop</a>.</p><p>Sandfall is already preparing to start working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unsurprisingly-another-game-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-is-coming/1100-6531816/" data-ref-id="1100-6531816">on its next game</a>, but the team will also continue to tweak Clair Obscur to solve any lingering issues.

For instance, we know that the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-shipped-45-million-units-in-2020-matches-ps4s-launch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-shipped-45-million-units-in-2020-matches-ps4s-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS5 sold 4.5 million units</a></span> in total by the end of 2020, which works out to across about seven weeks, and rather importantly included the holidays. (Despite being a launch beset by nightmares, from covid to supply chain disasters, it still pretty much matched sales for the PS4 in 2013.) Even more usefully, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ps5-is-biggest-console-launch-in-history&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ps5-is-biggest-console-launch-in-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we also know that the PS5 had outsold the PS4's 2.1 million units in its first two weeks</a></span>, although without a specific number. That was described at the time as the “biggest console launch in history,” and given the Switch 2 massively beat that figure in less than a week, it’s safe to say the mantle has been passed on.</p><p>Nintendo stops short of the full boast, but observes this makes the Switch 2 it’s own fastest-selling device. The original Switch was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/27/15449380/nintendo-switch-worldwide-sales-march&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/27/15449380/nintendo-switch-worldwide-sales-march" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by Nintendo</a></span> as having sold 2.74 million units in its first month, which it then described as it’s fastest seller, meaning the Switch 2 has absolutely walloped it so far.  (It’s fun to note that the Wii U sold a total of 3.5 million units over its first six months.)</p><p>Of course, initial sales are not a guaranteed predictor of long-term forecasts, but they do tend to bode well. Nintendo has rather modestly set its predicted sales for the year at 15 million, presumably trying to keep investors within reasonable expectations against <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">a bemusing market</a></span> that could be flipped upside-down at any point with the latest of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/sea-of-idiocy-economists-say-trump-tariffs-will-raise-price-of-switch-2-and-everything-else/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/sea-of-idiocy-economists-say-trump-tariffs-will-raise-price-of-switch-2-and-everything-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump’s mercurial tariff idiocy</a></span>.</p><p>Either way, it’s good times for Nintendo, and a good sign for a gaming industry that is having the shit beaten out of it of late. While the prices <em>aren’t</em> the same around the world, at the U.S.’s $450, that would mean sales of over $1.5 billion in less than a week. Now if only there was a new <em>Super Mario</em> game to play on it.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dune: Awakening has seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/" data-ref-id="1100-6532326">big numbers</a> on Steam so far--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-lot-of-people-are-playing-dune-awakening-despite-being-in-premium-early-access/1100-6532178/" data-ref-id="1100-6532178">even in its paid early-access</a> period. At the time of writing, now that the game is officially released for all players, Awakening is the 10th-most-played game on the <a href="https://steamdb.info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a>, with a 24-hour peak of 142,000 players. The game also has very positive reviews on Steam, though even the positive reviews note a bit of wonkiness with the game's current state, especially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-settings-fodune-awakening-to-remove-stutters-and-improve-fps/1100-6532153/" data-ref-id="1100-6532153">when it comes to performance</a>.</p><p>Without the extensive early-access period <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-isnt-early-access-but-will-let-you-pay-to-play-early/1100-6530320/" data-ref-id="1100-6530320">often used</a> for this kind of online survival-crafting game, Funcom has been using the paid earl- access period to rapidly patch issues as they arise--including <a href="https://x.com/DuneAwakening/status/1931366318730625479" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">adding new servers</a> as they become necessary.</p><p>The 1.1.0.11 patch notes can be found in full below, but it seems likely Funcom will continue to regularly patch the game as issues arise in its early lifespan.

                <p>During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest</a>, Microsoft opened the final day with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a> that threw the spotlight on titles coming to Xbox Series X|S either this year or next. Following the presentation, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer briefly addressed the challenges of "running a good business" while remaining accountable to Microsoft's expectations for the division.</p><p>"Our jobs inside the company is to run a good business," said Spencer during his appearance on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/phil-spencer-xbox-games-showcase-interview-the-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Xbox podcast</a>. "We're accountable to Microsoft for running a good business--a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line. That's kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we're doing. It does mean we have to make tradeoffs through the year on things that we're going to invest more in. [And] things that we're not going to invest as much in, because we are the business that we are. But the business is having really good success."</p><p>Spencer touted Game Pass as "having an amazing year" and praised Xbox's first-party games for their performance in 2025. It's worth noting that Spencer has used similar language about running "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">a sustainable business</a>" to explain the closures of studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks.</a> The latter was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-saved-by-pubg-publisher-krafton-hi-fi-rush-rights-also-acquired/1100-6525702/" data-ref-id="1100-6525702">successfully revived by its new owner</a>, Krafton, but other studios weren't as lucky and numerous devs lost their jobs.</p><p>Additionally, Spencer has explained repeatedly that the decision to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and other former Xbox-exclusive titles to PlayStation was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-discusses-bringing-indiana-jones-to-ps5-we-run-a-business/1100-6526011/" data-ref-id="1100-6526011">a business call</a>. That proved to be a fortuitous choice for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-releases-in-april/1100-6529770/" data-ref-id="1100-6529770">Forza Horizon 5</a>, both of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">topped PSN charts in April</a>.</p><p>During his podcast appearance, Spencer said that watching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keeper-is-the-new-double-fine-adventure-and-it-looks-wild/1100-6532262/" data-ref-id="1100-6532262">Keeper</a> come together for the Xbox Games Showcase "reignited my Double Fine love."

                <p>Gamers may have noticed a recent email about instructions for getting their share of a legal settlement with GameStop. While people are right to be suspicious about emails promising money, this settlement is legitimate. And if you've purchased something online from GameStop in the last five years, then the company may owe you some money.</p><p>Following <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Settlement%20Agreement.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a class-action settlement</a> filed earlier this year, GameStop <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Notice.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has put forth $4.5 million</a> to resolve the issue of whether the company improperly disclosed customers' personal information to Facebook via the Facebook Tracking Pixel (now Meta Pixel) without their permission.</p><h3>Who can file a claim for their share of the settlement?</h3><p>There are two primary criteria for getting a share this settlement. Recipients are only eligible if they purchased a video game from GameStop's site between August 18, 2020 and April 17, 2025. Players also need to have maintained a public Facebook profile with their real names at the time the purchase was made.</p><h3>What's the settlement amount per person?</h3><p>GameStop customers who qualify for the settlement can choose between a cash payment of up to $5 in cash or up to $10 as a voucher that can be used on GameStop's site. Players who opt for the former can receive payments through Paypal, Venmo, and Zelle. Those who opt for the voucher will receive the credit through their GameStop account. The voucher will expire one year after it is received.</p><h3>How can a claim be filed?</h3><p>There are two options to file a claim. Customers can either <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Home/SubmitClaim" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fill out this online form</a> or print out <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Claim%20Form.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this PDF form</a>, complete the requested information, and mail it to the following address:</p><p>GameStop VPPA Settlement Administrator</p><p>P.O. Box 4129</p><p>Portland, OR 97208-4129</p><h3>What's the deadline to file a claim?</h3><p>The deadline to file a claim or to object to the class settlement is August 15, 2025. The date of the final approval hearing is September 18, 2025. All payments and vouchers are expected to be distributed 55 days after the final approval of the deal and the conclusion of any appeals.</p>

			<p>I’ve been a huge fan of Keita Takahashi’s work for years. As a kid,&nbsp;Katamari Damacy&nbsp;was a weird and wacky sandbox that was so much fun to pick up and play. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/12/17/katamari-damacy-reroll-review/">Returning to it years later</a> helped me appreciate not only the touching story of togetherness that the game culminates in, but the effort that was put into making the simple act of play so perfectly satisfying.The blending of lofty themes with intertwined gameplay didn’t just elevate the themes, but is still fun as heck to play in it’s own way. I had high hopes that To a T would take this further. The game does have a poignant and heartwarming message behind it, but the lack of any kind of satisfying or consistent gameplay to go along with it makes this more of a mixed bag than gaming bliss.</p>
<p><iframe title="TO A T | Coming to PC, PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S May 28" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-QlrrC4vFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In To a T, you play as a young child who’s inexplicably stuck in a permanent T-pose. It isn’t clear why, but you’re used to it – it’s a part of your everyday life at this point. Despite some low moments like dealing with bullies who make fun of your predicament, you’ve got a loving dog companion and a bunch of anthropomorphic animal townsfolk who support and cheer you on each day. Before the game has barely even gotten started, its message was already clear, yet the game wastes no time driving it home with a repeating theme song sung by the characters every chapter about how “you are the perfect shape.”</p>


<p>It’s beautiful, but it’s simple, and it also never goes much further from there through the games eight chapters. As you spend each day visiting a talking giraffe who makes you sandwiches, heading to your quaint Japanese middle school, and exploring your bustling suburban town, there’s little in the way of conflict and nothing new layered onto the initial message of the game by the time you reach that final act. I feel like a young child or someone struggling with their own self-conscious worries will connect with the game and learn a lot from it, I just wish there were more going on with the subtext, or the characters, or the story as a whole to make the destination as worthwhile as the journey.</p>


<p>My bigger issue is that you aren’t really doing anything specific or particular throughout To a T. There is no consistent or focused gameplay besides the act of running around town and, sometimes, collecting floating pink coins you can exchange for new outfits. Every story scene you trigger in the game leads to a bespoke minigame where the thesis is always “do a very normal thing, except it’s really hard because you’re T-posing!” It’s charming at first, but not forever. And since each of these scene’s are different from the last and over before you know it, there’s no evolving of gameplay concepts or increasing difficulty. These minigames never reach the rage-bait level of Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy, but they also never reach the endless trance mode of Katamari Damacy.</p>
<p>I wanted to love To a T a lot more than I do, but between the basic story and the unfocused gameplay, by the time my four hours with the game were over, I just felt like, “Huh, okay then.” It isn’t a bad game by any means, and I think a certain audience will absolutely connect with it in a really impactful way, but after so many years, it just isn’t what I was hoping for as the next game from Keita Takahashi.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		To a T is a cute game about acceptance and community, but it doesn't do enough to keep it's concept fresh or engaging for the duration of the game, and there's a major lack of enjoyable gameplay to pair with it.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/663130/nintendo-switch-2-sales-forecast-15-million">was expecting </a>the Switch 2 would be just as successful as the original, and it’s already become the fastest-selling game console of all time after a strong launch. Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250611.html">revealed today</a> that it has sold more than 3.5 million Switch 2 units in the console’s first four days, surpassing records for any of Nintendo’s hardware within the same launch period. But the record is more significant than that.</p><p>Daniel Ahmad, director of research and insights at Niko Partners, points out <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1932624211878818015">on X</a> that the Switch 2 is “the fastest selling home video game console of all time.” It took Sony 16 days to sell 2.1 million PS4 consoles, and six weeks to reach 4.2 million units. The Switch 2 has also comfortably beaten the PS5 launch, which debuted during the pandemic and associated chip supply constraints. It took seven weeks for Sony to sell-through 4.4 million PS5 units.</p><p>It’s clear that Nintendo was able to meet pent-up demand for a Switch successor by having ample inventory on hand in key markets. Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655361/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sold-out-walmart-gamestop-target">preorders sold out</a> across major retailers in the US ahead of the launch, but there was still some limited stock on launch day for those willing to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/680294/switch-2-gamestop-launch-event-nintendo-america-ceo">line up at midnight</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/680417/they-just-sold-me-a-switch-2">take a chance</a> in the morning. The threat of price increases from tariffs likely helped goose initial demand, too.</p><p>While the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk">isn’t the biggest</a> UK console launch of all time and it seemed relatively <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680251/its-easy-to-buy-a-nintendo-switch-2-in-the-uk">easy for Brits to buy one</a> on launch day, it’s still the fourth best-selling console in the UK according to data from NielsenIQ.</p><p>Analysts had widely predicted strong Switch 2 launch sales, despite a lack of launch titles for Nintendo’s latest console. Nintendo’s record-breaking Switch 2 sales are thanks to a lot of pent-up demand waiting on this new hardware, and Nintendo using that time to build enough units to meet demand.</p><div><p>The real question now is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/677301/the-switch-2s-promising-start-hides-an-uncertain-future">whether Nintendo can keep up this sales pace</a>, and if tariffs and handheld alternatives could slow down sales. Nintendo is aiming to hit its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/663130/nintendo-switch-2-sales-forecast-15-million">goal of 15 million Switch 2 console</a> sales by the end of March 2026, and it’s already off to a good start with 3.5 million in four days.</p></div><p>The original Switch launched in March 2017 and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/historical_data/index.html">sold 17.79 million units</a> in its first 13 months on sale — more than Nintendo’s own estimates at the time. The Switch has now sold more than 150 million units over its lifetime, pushing it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">close to overtaking the DS</a> as Nintendo’s best-selling console.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That understated showing extended to the actual “Play Days” show floor in Los Angeles, where developers gave press and content creators a chance to try out new games. What made the show so odd on a smaller scale was that I was the only person on-site covering the show for <em>Kotaku</em>. </p><p>I’ve been to Play Days the past three years, and for reasons outside of our control, fewer <em>Kotaku</em> writers have been sent to the biggest American games event with each trip around the sun. As just one person, I was only able to see a handful of games during the event. This means <em>Kotaku</em> unfortunately missed out on a ton of really cool projects, games that I was only able to look at longingly as I passed by them at the show.</p><p>I hope things are different in 2026, but for now, here are the games I played and saw at Summer Game Fest 2025. </p><p><strong><em>This article will be updated periodically as embargoes lift.</em></strong></p></div></div><div><p>I know <em>Mario Kart World </em>is the kart racer to beat right now, and while I can’t say definitively if Sega’s latest <em>Sonic Racing</em> game clears that high bar, I can say what I’ve played of <em>Crossworlds </em>is a blast. The big headliners from the show were the crossover characters announced at the showcase, but I didn’t play as Hatsune Miku, Joker, or Ichiban; I was focused squarely on getting behind the wheel as my guy Shadow the Hedgehog. <em>Crossworlds </em>definitely feels a bit lighter and floatier than other kart racers, but what it lacks in weight, it makes up for in a surprisingly deep customization system that lets you create builds for your vehicles tailored to your playstyle. I was able to add perks like starting races with a specific item to give me an edge at the beginning of a lap, reducing damage when I was on the wrong end of an incoming attack, or even using aggressive gameplay to my advantage by granting myself a boost if I collided with an enemy racer. I’m interested to see what the meta turns out to be when <em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds </em>launches on Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on September 25.</p></div><div><p><em>Guacamelee </em>developer Drinkbox Studios’ latest game, <em>Blighted</em>, is unlike anything the studio’s done before. In the brief time I spent with the action RPG, I was most captivated by its world, in which people can gain memories of the dead by eating their brains. This desecrated land is overrun by horrifying creatures that stand between you and a monster who has begun feasting on the brains of the living and blighted the rest of this world. The game feels reminiscent of <em>Hades</em>’ frantic but strategic combat with an isometric view. Its enemy design is its greatest strength, with several of the monsters I faced requiring me to change up my play style and adapt to the moment. </p><p><em>Blighted </em>is launching in 2026.</p></div><div><p><em>Dosa Divas </em>is the next game from Outerloop Studios, the team behind <em>Thirsty Suitors</em>, one of 2023’s most delightful surprises. Though I only got to play about 30 minutes of the turn-based RPG, I was already drawn in by its cheeky, timely satire. The game follows siblings Samara and Amani as they face a third sister, who has created a fast food empire so pervasive that it has essentially turned the culture of cooking into a bygone era. The people in <em>Dosa Divas </em>have become so accustomed to convenience that good food created with love and intention is dying out in favor of meaningless slop. That sure does sound like, well, every creative medium right now in the wake of AI-generated garbage and America’s attempts to eject entire cultures from its borders. A quick and easy approximation of something is no replacement for the potential of the original when it’s made with heart and soul. This cathartic premise is enough to grab my interest, but its simple yet engaging turn-based combat is also a fun vehicle to ride as I watch this sibling rivalry play out.</p></div><div><p><em>Snap &amp; Grab </em>is one of the more interesting takes on a heist game that I’ve seen. Rather than executing the crime of a lifetime on your own, the game<em> </em>has you scope out a location to plan a course of action for someone else to take in your stead. As world-renowned photographer Nifty Nevada, I was able to freely take photos at a fancy rich people party, yet instead of merely capturing the festivities, I was actually taking photos of the penthouse to chart out a plan for one of my goons to come in and steal a priceless artifact for me. I had access to most places in the home, so I was able to take photos of where guards would be posted and note potential distractions or weaknesses in the security system. If I could account for all those pitfalls, it’d be a quick grab and dash for my accomplices. As I walked through the penthouse, I noted several other potential setups that I missed in previous runs, so <em>Snap &amp; Grab </em>seems to give you a lot of freedom to chart your own course. I hope it has more surprises in store when it launches next year.</p></div><div><p>Leading up to my appointment, <em>Mixtape </em>was far and away one of the most talked-about games at Summer Game Fest, and I wasn’t disappointed. Beethoven and Dinosaur’s adventure game stars a group of teenagers in the ‘90s creating a playlist for their final night together. Each song on the mixtape is accompanied by what is essentially a playable music video animated in a distinct, <em>Spider-Verse</em>-like, stop-motion-esque art style. Every segment is as unique and memorable as the song that accompanies it. The songs are attached to flashbacks of the group’s high school antics, and in just the short time I played, each segment was a rolicking good time full of that kind of “us-against-the-world” hope you feel when you’re a teen who hasn’t had that optimism beaten out of you yet. I want it now, but I’ll have to wait until the full game is released later this year.</p></div><div><p><em>Absolum </em>was probably my biggest surprise of the show. I went in with no real knowledge, and was kinda disappointed when I had to stop playing it for another appointment. Developed by the team behind <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, <em>Absolum </em>marries those same pitch-perfect beat-em-up stylings with roguelite runs. It’s frenetic, stylish, challenging, and has a gorgeous 2D animation style that’s lovely to look at. I played as an agile character whose base kit prioritized quick, vicious combos, and a grappling hook that let me close distance and tear through enemies with reckless abandon. But <em>Absolum </em>has multiple playable characters with different playstyles that you customize throughout each roguelite run. What I played felt deep, demanding, and rewarding, and I can’t wait to play more when the game launches on PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch.</p></div><div><p>The old-school <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>games were a blind spot for me for a long time. I played a little of the 3D action titles on the original Xbox and my fair share of <em>Dead or Alive</em>, but as far as the tough-as-nails sidescrollers that started it all, I never saw Ryu Hayabusa’s origins. Ryu isn’t the main character in <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>, but his apprentice Kenji is taking the lessons he’s learned from the OG out into the field with him. <em>Ragebound </em>is a pretty tough and unforgiving sidescroller that can lay you out in a second if you’re not careful. Its combat is one pillar of that challenge. But its platforming, in which you scale walls, hang from ceilings, and overall use every surface to your advantage in one way or another, tests your spacial awareness while half a dozen enemies are pestering you (or just one enemy you can’t even damage under normal circumstance is menacingly charging up an attack, preparing to take you out in an instant). It feels like a faithful throwback, and your mileage may vary on whether you’re up for the task.</p></div><div><p>If you’ve ever played something from Supermassive Games, you probably have some idea what you’re getting into with <em>Directive 8020</em>. The narrative horror team is delving into sci-fi for the latest entry in <em>The Dark Pictures Anthology</em>, and while I spent probably the least amount of time with it of all the games I checked out (roughly 15 minutes), I did see enough to know Supermassive is still doing what it does best: riffing on different horror genres with difficult choices and consequences for your actions. <em>Directive 8020 </em>shows a space station crew turning against each other in paranoia as an alien force that can transform into anyone infiltrates their group, sowing distrust between them as they try to survive. My time with the game was short but sweet.</p></div><div><p>Vermila Studios’ horror shooter <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>wears its OG <em>Bioshock </em>influence on its sleeve. But rather than a sunken city, it takes place in a worn-down version of Spain haunted by twisted puppets and mannequins that can only be destroyed by bullets powered by your own blood. It’s unnerving and atmospheric, and its use of your health bar as your blood-fueled ammo means you have to make every shot count, lest you die while fighting for your life.</p></div><div><p>The farming sim genre can feel a bit oversaturated these days, as everyone chases <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s success. To stand out in 2025, you’ve gotta have some kind of twist that keeps things fresh. <em>Grave Seasons </em>illustrated that to me in just 30 minutes. The moment that made it click for me was when I was pulling crops out of my garden and found a severed human hand buried in the dirt alongside them. Farming sims are often viewed as a cozy getaway, so <em>Grave Seasons </em>using it as a stage to explore a supernatural murder mystery is the kind of subversive take that carves out space in a crowded market.</p></div><div><p>&nbsp;<em>Relooted </em>was another interesting spin on a heist game that I played in LA, with its bite-sized robberies feeling like brain-teasing puzzles about meticulously planning one swift run from entrance to exit. The game follows an African crew reclaiming stolen artifacts from Western museums, with each member having a skill that makes them crucial to getting these items back where they belong. Your job as the field agent is to assign your team to different stations, so when you grab an item, you’ve cleared a path for yourself to book it once the alarms start blaring. Arranging a perfect getaway feels satisfying, and it helps that <em>Relooted</em>’s sidescrolling parkour is smooth as hell. I played a few early heists, so I can only imagine how much more elaborate later heists can get, and how crafty I’ll have to be to see them through.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Next year will be the 25th anniversary of the original Xbox, the system that marked Microsoft's entrance into the console wars.

            <p>Nintendo has provided a solution to an issue causing the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>'s battery indicator to display incorrectly.</p>
<p>While some have criticised the new console for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-battery-life-revealed">having a poor battery life</a>, it turns out in some instances the indicator is actually just not showing the correct percentage.</p>
<p>But, there's a fix! <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68272/~/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo">Nintendo has provided steps</a> "for when the battery amount displayed and the actual remaining battery use don't match". It's easy enough, but does require you to access the console's Recovery Mode.</p>

<p>The steps from Nintendo are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm you're using an adequately powerful AC adapter to charge your console (while the original Switch adapter can be used to charge a Switch 2 directly, it is not powerful enough to charge the Switch 2 when docked)</li>
<li>Confirm that your console has the latest system update</li>
<li>Power off the console</li>
<li>Press and hold down the volume up (+) and volume down (-) buttons, press the POWER Button once to turn the system on.</li>
<li>Keep holding down the volume buttons until the menu for Recovery Mode appears. Navigating to this menu should reset the battery level meter.</li>
<li>Power off the console again by pressing and holding the POWER Button until it turns off.</li>
<li>Power the console back on and monitor the situation</li>
</ol>
<p>Nintendo notes further that if following these steps multiple times does not resolve the battery indicator issue, the console will need to be sent in for service.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MetroidFREAK21/status/1932218979956691244">One user on X</a> noted their battery jumped from 85 percent to 91 percent after following these steps, so it's worth double checking on your own console if the battery appears to be lower than expected.</p>
<p>For more details on the console's battery, we've got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-battery-life-charge-time">guide on the Switch 2 battery</a> explaining more on its life expectancy.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Nintendo revealed it has sold 3.5m Switch 2 consoles</a> in its first four days on sale, becoming the fastest-selling piece of Nintendo hardware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>MindsEye, the game developed by Build a Rocket Boy which launched this week on PC and consoles, is another Unreal Engine 5-powered game that can only hit 60 FPS at 4K resolution using NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation on one of the most powerful GPUs on the market.</p>
<p>A new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> takes a look at how the game developed by the studio founded by former Rockstar North president Leslie Benzies runs on an RTX 5080 at 4K and 1440p resolution, two resolutions the GPU should be able to handle well in most titles. Unfortunately, the game is another Unreal Engine 5 GPU destroyer, as, at 4K resolution, MindsEye barely hits the 60 FPS mark only with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode and Frame Generation, and it's only with Multi Frame Generation that a sort of high refresh rate experience is achievable at that resolution. Things fare only marginally better at 1440p resolution, but seeing the game running only at around the 60 FPS mark at native resolution suggests how no other GPU on the market besides the beast that is the RTX 5090 can properly handle the game in its current state.</p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Another UE5 GPU Destroyer | RTX 5080 4K, 1440p DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIxNsAQh_8k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>No one who followed MindsEye until its release should be surprised to see that the game is launching with plenty of issues. Right before launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">two Build a Rocket Boy chief executives left the studio</a>, and it was widely reported by those who got early copies on consoles that the game was in a very rough state, which the <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">major day one patch</a> improves only marginally.</p>
<p>MindsEye is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

Many of the negative reviews focus on MindsEye’s performance problems, which appear to be hitting PC gamers hard. There are also reports on various bugs, glitches, and NPC behavior oddities.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">My second combat encounter in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MindsEye?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MindsEye</a>...

Patch 3 will be revealed soon, it added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>Thank you kindly to all of you who joined us as pioneers on day one! We understand that the current minimum spec requirements are very high, but our engineering team are working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles by integrating the performance improvements in Unreal Engine V5.6. We will provide patch 3 update timing, including these improvements, within the next 24 hours. In addition to the main campaign, we would also value your thoughts on Build.Mindseye.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye, led by former Rockstar North chief Leslie Benzies, has endured a tumultuous run-up to release. Last week, Build A Rocket Boy said fans should wait for MindsEye’s official launch rather than play it before its street date, after early copies made their way into the hands of players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want everyone to experience the story the same way at the same time on day one, without bias," Build A Rocket Boy said in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-calls-on-fans-to-wait-for-official-launch-after-street-date-breaks-a-week-early-confirms-major-day-one-update-for-physical-copies"><u>statement issued in response to early copies being played</u></a>. "This means waiting until the official release date to play through the game firsthand."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mention of bias in the studio's statement sparked speculation that the company was referring back to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments"><u>comments made by its co-CEO Mark Gerhard</u></a>, who suggested there had been a "concerted effort" to "trash the game and the studio" with negative social media posts from paid accounts or bots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye"><u>IGN subsequently put this claim to Hakan Abrak, boss of Hitman developer IO Interactive</u></a>, the company which is publishing MindsEye. His response: "I don't know. I don't believe that. I don't believe that. I just think the game should speak for itself on June the 10th."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Physical copies of MindsEye also needed a “major” update for “key improvements to ensure MindsEye plays as we intended and to meet all the characters at their best.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And just days before MindsEye’s launch, Build a Rocket Boy’s Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>confirmed they had left the company</u></a>, sparking concern from the studio’s fledgling community.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam concurrents do not tell the whole story, of course. MindsEye launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S as well as PC, so its true concurrent player count will be higher than that reported on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye carries a $59.99 price tag. At launch, there is a “tightly crafted linear story campaign,” and what’s called “single-player free roam,” but there are also a number of missions: a horde mode mission called “Destruction Site Shootout,” and two combat missions (“Honor Amongst Thieves” and “Friendly Fire”). Also at launch are six races, six checkpoint races, and three drone races. If you get the premium pass, you get an extra horde mode mission and an exotic cosmetics pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following launch, Build A Rocket Boy said it will deliver a “constant stream” of fresh premium content monthly, “ensuring MindsEye is a living, ever-expanding player experience.” This includes new missions, challenges, and game assets. “The continuous stream of studio-developed content, combined with the very best of the community’s own beautiful creations, means that MindsEye will continue to surprise and delight its players for decades to come,” Build A Rocket Boy added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy also confirmed its 2025 roadmap of content. In the summer there will be community updates, new missions, in the fall new single-player modes, multiplayer, and new missions, and in the winter free roam updates and new missions. Premium pass owners get extra missions and new packs throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

For the uninitiated, the Horus Heresy is the Space Marine civil war that took place 10,000 years before the current Warhammer 40,000 setting. It is the foundation of 40K’s grimdark universe, and reveals how the carrion Emperor ended up on the Golden Throne.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege of Terra: End of Ruin is a hugely exciting release for 40K lore fans (the standard edition is available to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgGjJ?object_uuid=741aa9ae-3a67-4217-a1c4-bdda8e62b07f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder on Amazon</a>), but its special edition is even more enticing. It features a leather-effect cover with gold foil details, gilt page edges, and a metal emblem of a ruined Imperial eagle.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/preorders-jun07-bl-01-eraofruinltd-nkuyovjdyk-1749632718756.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The special edition of Siege of Terra: End of Ruin.

It also told fans it planned to use a queue system “to ensure fair distribution.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this queue system caused chaos, with fans desperate to pre-order the book unable to make progress. Amid frantic messages of complaint across social media, Discords, and subreddits, Warhammer.com suddenly… stopped. It was offline, and no-one knew why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anger grew as those who had carved out time to be there for the pre-order launch were left empty handed. Eventually, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WarhammerOfficial/posts/pfbid0NGLkvUafYjdsmFoK6n22Am1hjz3pYwiHczUHdvvT6dXDcF6TPqwzifqyMb2FudFBl?locale=en_GB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Games Workshop issued a statement</a> on the debacle — a rare event in of itself — to say it had brought Warhammer.com offline because it had noticed scalpers were bypassing its systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Scalpers attempted to use bots to bypass our normal safeguards,” Games Workshop said. “Our eagle-eyed Tech Priests caught this happening in real-time, so we pulled Warhammer.com offline.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/60040181337-blsiegeofterraeraofruin-1749632804963.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Siege of Terra: Era of Ruin hardback remains available. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is that the special edition of Siege of Terra: End of Ruin is currently unavailable on Warhammer.com. In its place is a page asking for an email for a notification. Games Workshop said the special edition is still coming, “we’re just absolutely determined that real fans get it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All erroneous orders are being purged,” Games Workshop continued. “This is our number one priority. Please forgive us for a delay as we sort it all out.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/gw-1749633025785.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Games Workshop's statement. Image credit: Games Workshop / Facebook.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement has gone some way to calm angry fans who had hoped for a smoother launch of the special edition. Some are calling Games Workshop’s actions here a “small victory” over the scalpers, although there is a healthy dose of skepticism about the company’s efforts to truly combat the bots. Some suggest Games Workshop to use a raffle system, as other companies do for their high-profile products, or, even better, force interested customers to pass a Horus Heresy test to prove their worth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, Games Workshop has suffered pre-order problems for years now, and special edition book launches are often plagued by scalpers who go on to sell the products at hugely inflated prices. All eyes are on Games Workshop to see how it handles pre-orders for the Siege of Terra: End of Ruin special edition when they’re eventually re-launched.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s remember that Games Workshop is no minnow. In fact, the Nottingham, UK company is doing so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-maker-games-workshop-is-doing-so-well-its-giving-27-million-to-its-staff">it’s handing out £20 million (approx. $27 million) to its staff as a bonus</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop’s main business is the sale of miniatures fans assemble and paint for use in tabletop wargames, such as Warhammer 40,000. But it is increasingly an IP business, with huge revenue from smash hit video games such as last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii"><u>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</u></a>, and animations, such as Amazon’s Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level episode. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years"><u>Games Workshop and Amazon recently finalized a deal for Henry Cavill's Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe</u></a>, which will involve the creation of films and television series. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-iii"><u>Space Marine 3 is also in development.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
