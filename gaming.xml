  <div data-hide-featured-media="0">
<p>We live in a fallen world. Like the barbarians of old, we trample thoughtlessly across the remnants of a once-mighty empire. Perhaps we deserve our benighted existence — perhaps it has been rendered unto us by the spiteful gods. Regardless, we are deprived of the splendor known by those who came before us. We roll around in the dirt with our Steam Decks and our live games, believing ourselves to be kings. Yet the commoner of yesteryear led an existence beyond what our feeble minds could imagine. Ten years ago we had Streetpass, Download Play, and Pictochat. Now we have no streets, no play, and no chat.</p>



<p>We used to throw LAN parties in this country. We used to pile our computers into someone’s living room and promise their mom that we’d be careful around the china cabinet during an all-night <em>Unreal </em>marathon. We didn’t connect to a game’s servers or wait to download updates. We installed spawn copies of <em>Starcraft </em>on everyone’s machines and had direct, wired connections. We did this and it was good, though not without its flaws.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Photo by J Scotty Emerle-Sifuentes, from </em>LAN Party</p>



<p>We were not content to stagnate. We sought to throw off the tyranny of cables: CAT5 cables, Game Boy link cables, coaxial cables. They strangled us, kept us grounded when we knew we were capable of soaring through the skies. Freed of these tethers, we would communicate through the air itself.</p>



<p>Enter the Nintendo DS in 2004, a mutant of a handheld device whose bizarre design led some at the time to call into question Nintendo’s sanity. It seemingly included every gimmick possible at the time, from dual touch screens to a microphone. But more important than those showy features was the handheld’s communication capabilities. The DS was able to communicate with others of its kind wirelessly, an innovation that single handedly allowed the game convention bean bag handheld lounge to come into existence.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It would have been enough to have been able to conduct <em>Pokemon </em>battles without having to be sitting inches away from your opponent. But the DS took things a step further. The Download Play feature allowed players to actually share their games. Your pal wants to play <em>Mario Kart DS </em>but you don’t have a copy? No problem, just connect to their DS — sure, you can only be Shy Guy, but you’re still playing. Download Play, then, was something of an evolution of the traditional concept of console multiplayer in which only one player had to own the title, while also functioning as a kind of trial experience of the game. Dozens of games used this feature, including high profile titles like <em>Tetris DS</em>, <em>Mario Party DS</em>, <em>Advance Wars: Dual Strike</em>, <em>New Super Mario Bros.</em>, and <em>Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!</em></p>



<p>Some games used the wireless features of the DS in more subtle ways. <em>The World Ends With You</em>, for instance, allowed for communication while the handheld was closed (in “sleep mode”). Passing by another player with the game in their DS would grant a bonus of experience points. In 2011, the 3DS iterated on the concept of encouraging passing connections between players with the introduction of Streetpass.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Oh, blessed Streetpass! Oh ye pinnacle of social game design! The 3DS could transmit its user’s Mii and basic information to other systems it passed by on the street in the course of day-to-day life. Upon checking the system, the user would be greeted with a bright green LED to indicate that they’d made such a contact, then could personally greet each Mii they’d encountered on their journeys. These Miis could also assist the player in purpose-built minigames, such as completing jigsaw puzzles of 3DS titles, growing a garden, or exploring a haunted house. 3DS games were also able to use Streetpass for their own distinct mechanics. Players could meet and recruit one another’s avatars in <em>Fire Emblem Awakening</em>, or try to beat each other’s records on courses in <em>New Super Mario Bros. 2.</em></p>



<p>Designed for the dense urban environment of Japan, Streetpass was less useful in the sprawling wilds of the United States. But each connection, each passing contact, was a beautiful thing, a reminder that those around us have names, faces, and dreams. Conventions, meanwhile, became Streetpass bonanzas, flooding 3DS owners with a deluge of visitors from around the world. This was cutting-edge technology in service of whimsy and delight, and as an experience it was so compelling that many still carry their 3DS handhelds with them to gaming events over a decade later.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</em></p>



<p>But it wasn’t just Nintendo that was playing around with the new experiences that local wireless devices were making possible. We hunted the (fire-breathing, half-lizard) mammoth in <em>Monster Hunter </em>titles on the PSP and Vita, playing these games the way they were meant to be played, with other people. And smartphones began to become commonplace, games like <em>Spaceteam </em>took advantage of their features, allowing for chaotic local multiplayer dynamics to emerge.</p>



<p>When Nintendo announced the Switch, a hybrid console/handheld, it wasn’t unreasonable to expect that the features pioneered by the DS family would again be improved upon and incorporated into the new hardware. And yet… and yet. Streetpass is dead. Download Play is a thing of the past. The Switch Lite, one of the most perfect handheld devices ever forged by man, pales in comparison to its dual screened predecessors when it comes to local multiplayer. Sure, we can play <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>and <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate </em>online, but at what cost?</p>



<p>Why have we turned away from the light of local multiplayer and the beauty of fleeting social gaming connections in an era when more people than ever own devices capable of wifi and Bluetooth communication? Perhaps we are afraid of the world we have created, a world where our perpetual connection to our devices no longer represents myriad opportunities for play but rather an avenue for harassment and criminality. When the DS launched with the Pictochat feature that allowed nearby users to chat by writing or drawing with the stylus and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orpgUPNSRPI">tabloid news outlets warned that it could be used by child predators</a> to lure in children, perhaps even while driving alongside them on the highway, we all laughed. Well, in our present-day reality of revenge porn, location-based stalking, and countless other excesses and misuses of communications technologies, perhaps we aren’t laughing quite so much anymore.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>A pedophile could communicate with your child while driving alongside your vehicle on the highway using the Nintendo DS’s “Pictochat” feature. This is what we were worried about in 2007.</em></p>



<p>Maybe we don’t want to be connected to those around us. The pandemic didn’t help, to be certain, but the trend away from the developments of the early 2010s started long before it hit. The Streetpass LED on the 3DS, an early form of notification, was a joyful signal. Today, we’re bombarded with notifications and alerts, and many of us have grown weary of them. In theory, modern smartphones could support apps with Streetpass-like features, and location-based dating apps are somewhat similar. But that experience of delight at connecting with another player likely wouldn’t be there because of how ubiquitous the hardware has become.</p>



<p>Dedicated handhelds from major games companies are now more or less dead anyway. The failure of the Vita took Sony out of contention in the field. The Steam Deck is a little too bulky to be considered a proper handheld, and as essentially a portable computer, it doesn’t support ad hoc wireless play. Meanwhile, the Switch continues to occupy a strange position straddling console and traditional handheld.</p>



<p>Maybe Streetpass, Download Play, and the other local multiplayer features of the DS family were always doomed to disappear into obscurity like the dual-screened design of the consoles themselves. Or maybe the dream was always, like past President of Nintendo Hiroshi Yamauchi once suggested, of people who play RPGs, to sit depressed and alone in our dark rooms. We have Discord and voice chat now, and perhaps that’s enough.</p>



<p>Or maybe it isn’t. When my book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LAN-Party-Inside-Multiplayer-Revolution/dp/0500026955/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=Qo37m&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.35cab78c-35e3-4fc1-aab0-27eaa6c86063%3Aamzn1.symc.e5c80209-769f-4ade-a325-2eaec14b8e0e&amp;pf_rd_p=35cab78c-35e3-4fc1-aab0-27eaa6c86063&amp;pf_rd_r=7MCWN9YAVVE81KH33VDS&amp;pd_rd_wg=5XaOX&amp;pd_rd_r=7c7cf918-4ce7-4bc2-86fa-4f46dd2b146a&amp;ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m"><em>LAN Party</em></a><em> </em>was published earlier this year, I was struck not just by how many people had fond memories of participating in them, but by how many younger people expressed a desire that they could have been around for the era of their heyday. I don’t think this is an uncommon phenomenon — many people are fascinated by the period just before or after they were born, which is one reason for the continued influence of the 1980s in American pop culture — but it seems to speak to a longing for connection among younger people. In this sense, the handheld technologies of the early 2010s were a kind of successor to LAN parties. Software like Pictochat encouraged just hanging out and messing around, while Download Play continued the tradition of PC multiplayer games allowing for installations on multiple machines.</p>



<p>As both millennials who grew up with the internet and watched it transform and zoomers who have only ever known it in its current, centralized and corporatized mode are beginning to reevaluate their relationships to personal technologies, perhaps now is the time to rediscover what has been lost. A renewed interest in retro games has led to the boom of handheld devices running Android and Linux, typically used as emulation machines. And as hobbyist development takes over where corporate interest has declined, these devices can now even be used to play old 8- and 16-bit games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrUac9TIrWo">over ad-hoc connections</a> without wifi. We are rediscovering the old ways. Are we going to go back to sitting around drawing dicks in our local wireless chat rooms anytime soon? Probably not. But it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world if we did.</p>

<article id="post-6263">
  
  <div data-hide-featured-media="0">
<h2>Together we shine</h2>



<p>There’s no bigger act of camaraderie than standing together against impossible odds. Melinoë’s odyssey in <em>Hades II</em> is a living reminder of this sentiment, with peers tagging alongside her to show support, even for a short moment, as she repeatedly plunges through the Underworld’s depths. In a way, witnessing these attempts is a parallel to the experience of playing in Early Access, sharing my feats and frustrations with others. Despite knowing that Melinoë, and us, are currently unable to succeed in her mission, we still choose to support each other.</p>



<p>The queen of the Underworld is tasked with the rescue of her own family, as well as killing the culprit, Chronos, the representation of time itself who’s easily in the top 3 of shitty grandfathers. Her aunts and uncles provide aid in the form of boons, as they did with her brother Zagreus in the first game, granting the occasional ability or buff. But they’re still a <a href="https://unwinnable.com/2020/09/01/hades/">dysfunctional bunch</a> who are yet to learn how to get along. Words of encouragement are often backhanded. Half of the conversations include snark against a fellow relative. It doesn’t take long to realize a pat on the back from Zeus or Poseidon is merely wishful thinking.</p>



<p>Receiving boons is helpful enough in the mechanical sense. Melinoë becomes stronger, more resilient, and damage numbers go up in bright colors. Yet, your interactions with most gods are fleeting. Chances are that, once you’re further enough into a run, you might not even get a conversation blurb when you pick up a boon altogether. Thankfully, there are others who offer actual companionship, showcasing a willingness to experience what Melinoë does from up close.</p>



<p>In <em>Hades</em>, Zagreus can sometimes encounter Thanatos, the personification of death, upon entering a room. Such moments play out as a competition amongst very good friends where you have to take down more enemies than him within a set time. It’s one of the many clever ways in which developer Supergiant Games adds variety to the roguelite structure, while pushing the narrative a bit further each time.</p>







<p>The sequel doubles down on these occasional encounters with characters during runs. Familiar faces like Artemis and new ones like Nemesis, Icarus, and Heracles can appear at random, each with a different behavior. Artemis and Icarus use ranged attacks to weaken or take down enemies as Melinoë fights on the ground. Once the dust settles, they show up to offer a boon or special ability, as well as a friendly conversation afterward. Heracles is closer to Thanatos from a gameplay perspective, forcing a brawl to see who gets to defeat more foes before time runs out. In a way, it’s how he gets to know Melinoë, acting hostile at first before progressively letting his guard down to see her as a peer, not an adversary.</p>



<p>Nemesis, then, is a curious case, as one could argue she encapsulates all of the above, but in a far more erratic manner. She’s prone to offer a competition to defeat enemies, too, while sometimes taking care of an entire room before your arrival instead. When she’s not offering you to trade items in exchange for gold, a boon in your possession, or a percentage of your health, she’s grabbing items at merchant shops and opening doors at her will, robbing you of the choice before you can react.</p>



<p>Despite her antagonistic demeanor, Nemesis also lets her guard down. You can reject her trade offers to avoid penalties or exchanges you’d rather pass on. One time, despite finishing an enemy encounter before I could get to the area, she still gave away an item as compensation. <em>Hades II</em> continues to be a single player game, but Nemesis’ actions create the illusion that she’s simultaneously attempting to kill Chronos, occasionally bumping into Melinoë. These moments play out organically, leading to an illusion that’s easy to believe in.</p>



<p>Such instances, far from being mere elements of surprise, capitalize on the sense of camaraderie that the sequel reinforces. Zagreus received the help of many, but his journey, and task, were more solitary in nature. In <em>Hades II</em>, there’s a common enemy. It’s always comforting to be reminded that Melinoë is not alone in her attempts to beat Chronos when a familiar face shows up to offer aid, in whichever way they know how.</p>







<p>The mutual support isn’t unbeknownst to me, as someone who’s spent over 34 hours playing <em>Hades II</em> since a few days before the Early Access launch. During that time, I’ve been sharing my experience with a few friends and peers via Discord, slowly uncovering everything that Supergiant added in the sequel. It’s gotten to a point where there’s almost a newfound chat etiquette to avoid spoilers — using vague emojis or asking subtle questions like “Have you met S?” — or interrupting a conversation to update the other person of the current progress, such as typing down “sirens brb” when reaching the end of Oceanus, the second area of the Underworld.</p>



<p>It’s interesting to see how some of these interactions are happening with folks I don’t usually talk very often. <em>Helldivers 2</em> was a similar case for me, in which I’d either help a friend during their first few missions or another would unexpectedly join my session for a couple of hours before storming off. Much like my DMs about <em>Hades II</em>, there’s no need for a long catch-up beforehand. We just get straight into the matter at hand, providing guidance or just commiserating about our attempts.</p>



<p>The key difference is that <em>Helldivers 2</em> was originally designed as a co-op experience that encourages you to band together with others. <em>Hades II</em> is not. Instead, the roguelite sparks its communal camaraderie thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/hades/playing-hades-2-in-early-access-is-the-best-way-to-experience-supergiants-evolving-roguelike/">Early Access</a>. The model’s structure, which was already the subject of Supergiant’s narrative-driven touch for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-early-access-journey-has-been-more-important-than-the-destination">first game</a>, is thematically mirroring the protagonist’s journey once more.</p>



<p>Being able to actually finish a run in <em>Hades</em> once the 1.0 launch happened, after dozens of successful attempts prior that didn’t result in an actual victory, gave me an unmatched catharsis that I wouldn’t have had otherwise. The sequel is already on a similar path, albeit with a greater feeling already brewing in place. A <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-steam-player-count-performance-pc-1851460841">lot more people</a> are playing in Early Access this time around — an unsurprising fact considering its predecessor’s <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-hades-i-has-sold-over-1-million-copies-in-under-two-years">resounding success</a> — and sharing their feats and frustrations with one another.</p>



<p>Only time will tell how the story goes for Melinoë, and how Supergiant tries to surprise again. Much like the queen of the Underworld, it’s comforting knowing I’m not alone in my attempts to defeat Chronos, despite the impossible odds. Both familiar and new faces are lending me their support, strengthening our bonds in the process as we take part in a fleeting experience that, one day, will never be the same. Despite only being in Early Access for a few weeks, I can safely say that this newfound sense of camaraderie is teaching me th- wait, sirens, brb.</p>

He explains he isn’t interested in leaving his own mark on many previous FromSoftware IP because series like Kings Field and Enchanted Arms are too connected to the work of other developers.</p><p>“I think a lot of these games are so intertwined with the directors who almost invented that style of game,” he said.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“I don’t think there’s a scenario where I myself would make a King’s Field. The same can be said about Otogi and Enchanted Arms.</p></div><p>Miyazaki continued: “I don’t think there’s a scenario where I myself would make a King’s Field. The same can be said about Otogi and Enchanted Arms."</p><p>The one exception to this rule is the Armored Core series. Miyazaki served as a planner on Armored Core: Last Raven and chipped in for other games in the franchise, too. As a result, he feels equipped to potentially return to that universe.</p><p>"I worked on Armored Core 4 and Armored Core: For Answer," he added. "It enabled me to put my own interpretation on Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon and develop that.”</p><p>We'll have to wait to see if Miyazaki's vision for a traditional JRPG comes to fruition. Meanwhile, FromSoftware is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-times">beginning to roll out substantial Elden Ring DLC in the form of Shadow of the Erdtree</a>. While the studio’s next project remains a mystery, the FromSoftware boss recently revealed that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-still-isnt-the-ideal-fantasy-rpg-in-the-eyes-of-fromsoftwares-hidetaka-miyazaki"><u>the world he co-created with George R.R. Martin isn’t quite his idea of an “ideal fantasy RPG.”</u></a></p><p>"While Elden Ring is not quite it, it's pretty close,” he said at the time. “It's getting close."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>For more, be sure to read up on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-may-consider-beginning-to-end-total-co-op-in-future-fromsoftware-games"><u>how the team might introduce new co-op elements to future titles</u></a>. You can also read <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-interview"><u>our interview with Miyazaki</u></a>, where we learned more about the world of Elden Ring and how the DLC expands on an already fantastic formula.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-dubbing-challenge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday Ubisoft, a company worth <em>billions</em>, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/it-it/game/assassins-creed/news/5JEWsSKwGmJDmlvvM12PpN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced </a>a competition where a fan could win the chance to provide the voice of a non-player character (NPC) in the upcoming <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. They would not be paid for their services.</p><p>In 2018, Ubisoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2s-plan-to-crowdsource-art-from-fa-1826783550" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked fans</a> to provide art and music for the seemingly-doomed <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em>, with only the promise of <em>possible </em>payment.</p><p>In 2019, Ubisoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-invites-fans-to-make-music-for-watch-dogs-legi-1836389136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked fans</a> to provide some music for <em>Watch Dogs 3</em>, only it was under the guise of '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_work#:~:text=Speculative%20work%2C%20also%20known%20as,been%20agreed%20upon%20in%20writing." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spec work</a>', which again carried with it only the possibility of a decent payment relative to the services provided. </p><p>All three decisions were roundly criticised by fans and professionals alike, for fairly obvious reasons.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intel-optane-905p-1-5tb-ssd-fire-sale-available-for-only-299/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Intel's Optane SSDs were one of a kind, using 3DXPoint instead of NAND for storage. They had many advantages over traditional SSDs, amongst which include unusually high endurance ratings and extremely low latency. Even today, Optane SSDs like the 905p provide faster loading times than the best PCI-e 4 and PCI-e 5 SSDs on the market.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons that Optane failed to catch on with enthusiasts was the price. When the 905p was initially released, the 1.5tb model sold for a jaw-dropping $2,199.99 - a price higher than the fastest consumer GPUs on the market!</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Optane-Loading-Times.webp"></a>I recently benchmarked Intel's Optane P5800X and 905p drives in Final Fantasy while paired with an Intel i9-14900K. The "old" Optane 905p still leads over NAND SSDs, beating Kingston's Fury Renegade by 2.27 seconds. Now let's be real - that's not a huge amount of time saved. But when you look at it from a performance perspective, that's an impressive 46% faster than the Fury Renegade's 7.19 seconds.</p>
<p>Optane's production has been discontinued, and as a result prices of the remaining units on the market drop every day. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=jb4H9BKWZ98&amp;mid=44583&amp;murl=https://www.newegg.com/intel-optane-905p-1-5tb/p/N82E16820167505" rel="sponsored noopener">NewEgg currently has a sale for the 1.5tb unit for only $299 USD with promo code SUMMER673.</a> This price is still more expensive than high end NVMe SSDs, but if you want the absolute best loading times nothing on the market beats Optane yet - not even the fastest PCI-e 5 SSDs.</p>

<p data-characters="293" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></em> DLC rolls out to players worldwide, Steam Deck fans have discovered a glitch that makes the game impossible to play. The glitch seemed to arrive alongside <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-v1-12-patch-notes-shadow-of-the-erdtree-weapon-and-skill-adjustments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update 1.12</a> and will seriously halt your game if you leave your Tarnished alone for too long. </p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">Steam Deck users noticed an issue that made the game unresponsive to any inputs. FromSoftware took to Twitter/X to confirm that this occurs if you leave the game running but leave your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes. The developer is working on hotfix for the glitch, but it’s not here yet. To avoid the issue happening to you, it’s important to keep your Tarnished moving.</p> <h2 id="h-don-t-stop-moving-in-elden-ring-if-you-re-playing-on-steam-deck-because-there-s-no-beating-the-inactivity-glitch-boss" data-injectable="false">Don’t stop moving in <em>Elden Ring</em> if you’re playing on Steam Deck because there’s no beating the inactivity glitch boss</h2> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="784" data-injectable="true"><em>Elden Ring</em>‘s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC is one of the most highly-anticipated releases of 2024. Some might be playing right now and, in the middle of their runs, need to put the Steam Deck down and go take care of something. However, doing this without batting a button or joystick every few minutes like an impatient cat will cause the game to lock you out entirely at the moment.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Note: a Steam Deck related issue has been identified and a hotfix is being worked on.</p><p>Leaving your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs.</p><p>We apologize for inconvenience.</p><p>The date and time of the hotfix will be announced separately.</p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true">FromSoftware is working on an update, but hasn’t announced when it will be able to release a patch to fix <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this issue</a>. Thankfully, this error popped up on the day that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> was released, so the developer was likely waiting for error reports. Not all errors are created equal, though. Some take a few hours to be patched, while others can take much longer.</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Since the release of the latest patch, I’ve seen a couple of <a href="https://x.com/BillalNX/status/1803730889387495585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports of errors</a> in <em>Elden Ring</em> on social media. They aren’t common enough that it looks like everyone is affected, but quite a few players have launched the game and have been waiting until the DLC goes live, only to be met with an error screen and an inability to load their perfectly placed Tarnished.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true">If you’re playing the game on Steam Deck, the safest way to do so is to just keep moving. Don’t leave your game for longer than 5 minutes, or you’ll likely need to reboot. Mercifully, <em>Elden Ring</em> runs well on Valve’s handheld device, so this shouldn’t be too much of a problem for loading screens.</p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">My best advice for you is to just be mindful of when you’re taking breaks, and for how long. If you plan on putting the Steam Deck down before the hotfix is out, maybe make sure you’ve saved and quit. We’ll update the piece as soon as FromSoft has a fix online.</p>

Am I overdoing it yet? No matter. Let's press on.</p><!--more-->
<p>Perhaps you've never heard of Elden Ring's Erdtree DLC. Perhaps you've sauntered in here expecting a nice game about looking at antique rings while lying under some shady topiary. Come child, I'll soon birth thee anew. Shadow Of The Erdtree is a lategame Elden Ring add-on which rudely attaches a grotty new region, The Land Of Shadow, to the base game's festering Lands Between. Here you'll find a host of new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-new-weapon-types">weapons</a>, enemies, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-locations">bosses</a> and stories concerning the fate of Miquella, a character who is of huge importance to the main Elden Ring storyline.</p>
<p>Once again: this is a lategame add-on, designed to sizzle the nerves and parboil the synapses of all but the most seasoned and well-equipped Tarnished adventurers, though it does at least have more or less the same <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-system-requirements">system requirements</a> as the main game. Our own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-what-level">recommended Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree starting level</a> is between 120-150, and you'll need to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">reach certain areas and defeat certain bosses</a> before you can enter the Land of Shadow, though you don't need to finish the game. If you're a NG+ player in need of reorientation, we've also written a guide to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-fastest-way-to-reach-shadow-of-the-erdtree">fastest way to reach Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> - 24 steps, each more harrowing than the last. Speaking as a lapsed player who keeps meaning to get back into Elden Ring and failing, I am currently squatting on step 11.5 - "Sob uncontrollably on the bridge of Redmane Castle".</p>
<p>If you're already hip to all these Elden antics, you might be more interested in knowing whether Shadow Of The Erdtree is any good. I don't know for sure, but I know somebody who does: Ed Thorn, aka Starscourge Edders, who went to the trouble of publishing an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree review</a> a few days ago. He was a bit ambivalent, actually, describing the expansion as a "pseudo-sequel" and praising its greater emphasis on crafty exploration, while sternly withholding the Bestest Best badge.</p>
<p>"The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies," Ed wrote. "For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis." Recollection paralysis! I'm pretty sure that's what you get from Basilisks.</p>
<p>Now that Erdtree is out, the insatiable gamer brain promptly turns to what FromSoftware might work on next. President and Dark Souls series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki has already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-hidetaka-miyazaki-reflects-on-how-becoming-a-father-might-influence-his-future-games">offered some wistful ruminations on the experience of fatherhood as an inspiration, if not a direct theme</a>. Personally, I'd like to play a FromSoftware game that gets away from the "corrupted rulers in need of purgation" premise that has broadly defined FromSoftware's output since Demon's Souls. I'm not sure what I want, but I don't want to have to topple another ruined king. A man may tire of destroying or usurping a polluted cosmic order. How about you?</p>

<p id="heqSYs">When you first enter the vicinity of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23944909">Shadow Keep</a>, you’ll be given two mysterious on-screen prompts saying “Somewhere, a great rune has been broken” and “And so too has a powerful charm.”</p>
<p id="77UR1g">This is nothing to be concerned about if you wish to continue exploring the Scadu Atlus region, as what it means that <strong>a new region of the map has unlocked</strong> somewhere in the Realm of Shadow, and <strong>that the charm refers to something which happens to certain characters</strong>.</p>
<p id="XFE1yQ">If you don’t mind spoilers, here is where to find the newly unlocked location...</p>

<p id="kWawK9">If you’ve visited the Cerulean Coast before exploring the Shadow Keep or venturing to the Cathedral of Manus Metyr, you probably spotted a large hole in the southwest section of the map. Drop down the ledges to find<strong> a yellow barrier with Miquella’s symbol</strong>. If you try to interact with the seal before the above prompt, this line will appear on your screen, “Sealed and obscured by Miquella.”</p>
<p id="0ciGt8"><strong>After the seal has been broken</strong>, you can return to the Stone Fissure to learn more about Miquella’s story in the realm of shadow. Without spoiling too much about what is behind the broken seal, you’ll be able to progress in a certain NPC’s questline and face off against a mighty boss.</p>

By now, you would have seen our IGN review for this phenomenal  <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">10/10 masterpiece</a> of a DLC that almost feels like a sequel in its own right. Which, let's be honest, is what you love to hear about a bit of add-on content that's very reasonably priced.
</p><p>Another thing many of us love to hear: a touchstone gaming event like this, that's garnered almost universal praise, has been suitably celebrated with a whizbang edition for diehards. FromSoftware has indeed taken that route with the <strong>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Edition</strong>, a not inexpensive bit of kit that we'll be unboxing and tracking bargains for in a moment. (While stocks last, and hopefully before the scalpers descend, like a horde of head sucking leeches with arms.)
</p><p>And now, without further ado, let's get you sorted for prices on this rock solid contender for GOTY 2024. Or, possibly, DLCOTY 2024.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/leechy-1718857581069.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Pictured: scalpers, sucking the fun out of a normal retail experience.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Best Shadow of the Erdtree Standard Prices</h2><div id="201626"><p><h3>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Ed.</h3></p><div><p>Avaliable on Xbox Series X and PS5.</p></div></div><p>- Buy <strong>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</strong> digital on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> - <strong>$59.95</strong></p><p>- Buy <strong>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Edition</strong> digital on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> - <strong>$119.95</strong></p><h2>Best Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Prices</h2><div id="202224"><p><h3>Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Ed.</h3></p><div><p>Available on Xbox Series X and PS5.</p></div></div><p>- Buy a <strong>PC edition</strong> direct from <a href="https://store.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring-physical-full-game-pc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-collector-edition-e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bandai Namco</a> - <strong>$449.95</strong></p><h2>Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Unboxing</h2><p>Truth be told, I've been all the way through Shadow of the Erdtree already, and I know the subject of this Collector's Edition like the back of my Malenia's Gauntlet. Posterboy of the entire DLC and star of at least one lead-up trailer, Messmer the Impaler, is a foe that is both eye-catching in his design and lifebar-destroying in his merciless onscreen assaults.</p><p>The Elden Ring universe is chock full of memorable boss battles and bad-ass beasties—Messmer deserves his place both at the top of the boss food chain and in that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtrj9h3D8Ug" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pool room</a> display cabinet in your own castle.</p><p>His Poke-ness rests entombed within a Collector's Edition box that's coated in runes and measures 20x27x38 cm. Breaking the seal on this prison reveals a range of items besides Messmer which should be quickly scooped up into your inventory.</p><p>The full list includes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>Shadow of the Erdtree DLC code (no base game)</em></li><li><em>Exclusive hardcover art book</em></li><li><em>Digital soundtrack</em></li><li><em>Preorder Bonus Gesture</em></li></ul><p>With regards to the artbook, it's a high-quality visual odyssey into some parts of the Shadow Realm that I, honestly, still have PTSD from. Wonderful tourist destinations that are <em>to die for</em>, like the Ancient Ruins of Rauh, the Hinterlands, and the always breathtaking Cerulean Coast. They're all locales you'll soon come to fear as well as swoon over.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/1-1718869625472.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Figurine vs in-game appearance.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Speaking of swooning, let's cut to the main event—that 46cm Messmer the Impaler figurine. For reasons unknown (to me at least) Messmer is an especially lanky sort who would always get selected first in a pick up game of Shadow Realms b-ball. Our boy will tower impressively over the 23cm Malenia figure that came with the original Elden Ring Collector's Edition, if you're lucky enough to own that as well.</p><p>The visage on display here is one of tall, dark, and gruesome. Messmer is nothing less than a conversation piece, with topic at hand being <em>Well, How On Earth Does One Kill This Bastard?</em> That information I do in fact know, thanks to many an attempt plus trial and error, but I'll leave you all to discover it yourself.
</p><p>Starting at the head of the snake (so to literally speak), Messmer has an open faced helm that provides more than adequate protection from Fire, Lightning, and other projectiles covered in your average OH&amp;S guide book. I also love the detailing on the snakes that adorn his crown, the dragon-esque winglets on the sides, and those Centurion galea face-guards.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/front-1-1718869692358.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Model: Ciri</figcaption></figure></output><p>When it comes to actual facial detail, this is a more than decent rendering of a fiercely brooding demigod. I particularly like the accurate portrayal of Messmer's unearthly eyes—the same sort of peepers that dragons and runebears have in this universe, which suggests old mate has an ability to Dr. Doolittle with like-minded beasts.
</p><p>Indeed, we're already given that impression with the three slithery sidekicks that wind about our subject. One in particular hangs over his right shoulder, in proximity for a quick parseltongue chit-chat. All of these are recreated from the in-game asset that I'm intimately familiar with—particularly the little winglets that protrude from those little death noodles. I'll not reveal why they're going to be bad news for you...</p><p>When it comes to finery, Mr.' Snake Hips Himself is draped in the imaginatively named Messmer's Armor (which, pro tip: provides especially good damage negation to Lightning and Fire, but isn't the best against Slash). The blood red cloak that furls out dramatically in-game has been recreated quite nicely here in the physical realm. Only Batman rocks a cape with more pizazz than this guy. And when it comes to the fine fur detailing on the cloak edges, John Wayne ain't got nothing on our fringe game.
</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/back-1718869739891.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>"<strong>Doth Mother Know You Weareth</strong> Her Drapes?"</figcaption></figure></output><p>Beneath that battle drape is a finely detailed chainmail curiass with additional material accents around the hips. Incidentally, it's a theme that all the cool kids are wearing in the Shadow Keep this season—you'll soon meet a cadre of Fire Knights, Messmer loyalists who ape their bosses style without exceeding it. Because upstagers probably get impaled in that workplace.</p><p>Moving below the equator, we're hiding our modesty today with the Roman-esque Messmer Greaves. These are essentially wrapped leather shingards that conjoin with a pair of open toe sandals. Every little pig is accounted for and clearly Messmer has gone with open toe as a means to keep cooler—overheating can and will occur when you're a pyromaniac who spews flames and ground-pounding explosions all day long.</p><p>Last but not least, and speaking of flambe, this figurine is dominated by the presence of the Spear of the Impaler. Long enough to be God's own letter-opener and devilishly OP enough to be Satan's favourite pitchfork, this weapon is indeed a 1:1 replica of the in-game stick that jabbed me into a 'You Died' many a time.</p><p>The intricate (faux) metal work that makes up the crossguard is impressive, as is the detailing of the mid-shaft handle that reveals the true nature of this stick. Yep, this Great Spear is just as much a throwable javelin as it is a CQC shanker. The only thing that could have made it more authentic would be a hint of flame at the business end—because this stick can be made to explode if you have the mind to R2 charge it up.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/spear-1718870320360.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>This Great Spear is quite a lot to handle.</figcaption></figure></output><p>At the end of the unbox, what we have here is more authenticity than you can poke a red hot stick at. If you want to adorn your game cave with a stark reminder of how many times you had your butt handed to you by Messmer the Impaler, there is no finer way to do it. (And that includes this Messmer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gqKzZYZz5QA?app=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helmet</a> replica that I feel caters more to the cashed-up cosplay crowd.) 
</p><p>Essentially, I think the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Edition can stand proud and tall alongside FromSoftware's many other premium figurines, like this especially dashing <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dark-souls-3/Collector's_Editions">Dark Souls 3</a> one. 
</p><p>If Hidetaka Miyazaki speaks true, Erdtree might well be the last piece of the Elden universe we'll get to experience. I'm certain, then, in the years to come that my eyes will wander over to this figurine and remember back to the great struggle that was. With a thousand-yard stare. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53FDkWb7Mv4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adagio For Strings</a> plays.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output> <em>Thanks to Bandai Namco AU for providing a unit for photography purposes.</em></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC Review</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Fast and aggressive endgame Spirit Ashes</h2><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-best-spirit-ashes/2900-4094/" data-ref-id="2900-4094">best Spirit Ash summons</a> are more important in Shadow of the Erdtree than they were in The Lands Between, if only to distract bosses while you learn their patterns and figure out when to strike. Pretty much every major enemy in Elden Ring’s DLC is faster and deadlier, so you’ll likely want to leave your tanky summons at home. We’ve selected a few high performers that make life easier and, by the time you start Shadow of the Erdtree, should already be in your inventory.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Mimic Tear</h3><p dir="ltr">From Software might have nerfed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-mimic-tear-where-to-get-this-powerful-spirit-ash-and-why-you-should/1100-6501311/" data-ref-id="1100-6501311">Mimic Tear</a> shortly after Elden Ring launched, but this fantastic Spirit Ash summon is still a valuable asset to bring with you into the Land of Shadow. It copies your build and attacks without fear of taking damage, which is a bit annoying if you need it to survive, but also a handy way to take chunks out of boss HP bars until the Tear dies. It requires HP to summon, instead of FP, so it’s essential for builds that don’t invest much into the Mind stat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322509-elden-ring-best-spirit-ashes-dlc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322509" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322509-elden-ring-best-spirit-ashes-dlc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322509"></a><figcaption>Nerfs can't stop this.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322509-elden-ring-best-spirit-ashes-dlc.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Black Knife Tiche</h3><p dir="ltr">Tiche’s speed is a massive help in Shadow of the Erdtree. She’s much better at avoiding boss attacks than most Spirit Ash summons, and she’s still capable of dishing out a fair amount of damage as well.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Dung Eater Puppet</h3><p dir="ltr">Getting the Dung Eater Puppet locks you out of finishing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-dung-eater-quest-guide/1100-6501519/#:~:text=The%20Dung%20Eater%20shows%20up,the%20Dung%20Eater%20has%20arrived." data-ref-id="1100-6501519">Dung Eater’s quest</a>, but it’s worth it for the summon. He’s aggressive, strong, and can tackle most challenges with comparative ease.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Nightmaiden and Swordstress Puppets</h3><p dir="ltr">These two aren’t quite as powerful as some legendary Ashes, but the point is there <em>are</em> two of them. They’re agile and move a lot, and they make for excellent distractions while you retreat to heal or figure out a strategy.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best Talismans to start Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</h2><p dir="ltr">The Land of Shadow is home to several new talismans, including some that are essential for practically any build. Make sure you’ve obtained every talisman pouch in Elden Ring before touching Miquella’s nasty dead hand and starting the DLC. Some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-talismans-in-elden-ring/1100-6502463/" data-ref-id="1100-6502463">best Talisman choices</a> include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Great-Jar’s Arsenal (increases equip load)</li><li dir="ltr">Carian Filigreed Crest (reduces FP consumption from skill use)</li><li dir="ltr">Godfrey Icon (buffs charged spells and skills, not useful if you don’t use those)</li><li dir="ltr">Radagon Icon (shortens spell casting time, essential for any magic user)</li><li dir="ltr">Moon of Nokstella (increases spell memory slots, also essential for magic casters)</li><li dir="ltr">Erdtree’s Favor (raises HP, FP, and equip load)</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Elemental grease</h2><p dir="ltr">Okay it’s not technically gear, but you’ll want a few grease items before taking on the Land of Shadow’s big challenges, particularly:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fire Grease</li><li dir="ltr">Lightning Grease</li><li dir="ltr">Rot Grease</li><li dir="ltr">Freezing Grease</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Dragonwound Grease is eventually useful as well, but not until the expansion’s back half.</p><p dir="ltr">You didn’t really have to think much about elemental weaknesses in Elden Ring, but exploiting those weaknesses in Shadow of the Erdtree is often one of the only ways to make a tough fight manageable, including boss battles. Spells and specific ailment-inducing weapons are fine, but grease items let you use any weapon to target elemental weaknesses and make life a lot easier than having to respec for a different weapon.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best armor to start Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</h2><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-armor-in-elden-ring/1100-6502489/" data-ref-id="1100-6502489">best Elden Ring armor</a> with high resistance goes a long way toward making Shadow of the Erdtree more manageable in its opening hours. If you haven’t upgraded your outfit in a while, now’s the time to do it.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Light armor</h3><p dir="ltr">Malenia’s set is an excellent choice if you’re running a lighter build thanks to its hefty immunity-boosting stats. Enemies throw status ailments around left and right in the Land of Shadow, and they build up quickly. Good immunity keeps you safe a bit longer so you can retreat and let it die down or use a consumable.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don’t feel up to challenging Malenia, the Black Knife armor is a solid replacement, and it even helps you sneak around more efficiently.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, an option with a bit more resistance built-in is the Ronin Set, which you get from the Mountaintop of the Giants’ Zamor Ruins. It has higher immunity than Malenia’s set and a set of respectable magic resistances as well, much more so than you’d expect from most light armor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322510-elden-ring-best-armor-start-dlc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322510" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322510-elden-ring-best-armor-start-dlc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322510"></a><figcaption>Effective, attractive, and easy to get.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322510-elden-ring-best-armor-start-dlc.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Medium armor</h3><p dir="ltr">D’s set, which you get during Fia’s quest, is hefty, but it offers some of the best physical resistance in the base game and can carry you through the Mohg fight as you start the DLC. The Carian Knight set--dropped from Raya Lucaria’s Carian Knights, as you might expect--is lighter and has comparable resistances, in addition to a strong set of magic resistances as well.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Heavy armor</h3><p dir="ltr">You can’t go wrong with Tree Sentinel Armor if you have the endurance to wear it. Few sets have better physical resistance stats, and it also gives you a substantial immunity and robustness boost. Its lightning and holy resistances are a bit middling, though. Bull-Goat Armor, which you can get by taking Patches out for the Volcano Manor crowd, is slightly less sturdy, but easier to obtain.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Mage armor</h3><p dir="ltr">Magic users who don’t want to run a typical light armor set have a few options. The top picks are Rellana’s set for Intelligence casters and the Haligtree Knight set for Incantation users. Neither is particularly good at deflecting physical attacks, but they boost Intelligence and Faith, respectively.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best weapons to start Shadow of the Erdtree</h2><p dir="ltr">The Land of Shadow has plenty of deadly new toys to experiment with, but you’ll need a trusty weapon in hand to take on some big challenges before you can get your hands on them. Magic users also need weapons for some situations, so don’t skip this section even if Glintstone Pebble is your best friend.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Best Intelligence weapons to start with</h3><p dir="ltr">Intelligence users need a sturdy weapon for some fights, as major bosses, including Rellana at Castle Ensis, have exceptionally high magic defense.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Dark Moon Greatsword (obtain after completing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-ranni-the-witch-quest-guide/1100-6501460/#:~:text=Finding%20Ranni%20the%20Witch&amp;text=Ranni's%20Rise%20is%20in%20the,allowed%20to%20leave%20the%20tower." data-ref-id="1100-6501460">Ranni’s quest</a>)</li><li dir="ltr">Wing of Astel (obtain from Astel’s Remembrance)</li><li dir="ltr">Death’s Poker (scavenged off a Death Rite Bird)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-where-to-get-the-moonveil-katana/1100-6501479/" data-ref-id="1100-6501479">Moonveil Katana</a></li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322511-elden-ring-best-weapons-start-dlc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322511" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322511-elden-ring-best-weapons-start-dlc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322511"></a><figcaption>Bloodhound's Fang is still one of the most useful weapons in the game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322511-elden-ring-best-weapons-start-dlc.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Best Faith weapons to start with</h3><p dir="ltr">Shadow of the Erdtree is loaded with Incantations, but for speed, consider one of these alongside your spells.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Blasphemous Blade (obtain after defeating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-boss-battle-guide-how-to-beat-rykard-lord-of-blasphemy/1100-6501562/" data-ref-id="1100-6501562">Rykard</a>)</li><li dir="ltr">Golden Order Greatsword (obtain from Elden Beast Remembrance)</li><li dir="ltr">Eclipse Shotel (also requires dexterity)</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Best Dexterity weapons to start with</h3><p dir="ltr">Bloodhound’s Fang will see you through most of Shadow of the Erdtree thanks to its special skill, but Rivers of Blood is also just as good as it ever was--which is to say, excellent.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Bloodhound’s Fang</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-how-to-get-the-rivers-of-blood-katana/1100-6501390/" data-ref-id="1100-6501390">Rivers of Blood</a> (also needs 20 Arcane)</li><li dir="ltr">Nagakiba (also needs strength)</li><li dir="ltr">Moonveil Katana</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Best Strength weapons to start with</h3><p dir="ltr">You can brute-force your way through most obstacles with a big hammer, but the Starscourge sword and Prelate’s Crozier add a bit of magic to help deal with foes with strong defense.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Giant Crusher</li><li dir="ltr">Grafted Blade Greatsword</li><li dir="ltr">Starscourge Greatsword (obtain by exchanging Radahn’s Remembrance)</li><li dir="ltr">Prelate’s Inferno Crozier</li></ul><p>For more on Shadow of the Erdtree, don't miss <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-where-to-go-first/2900-5530/" data-ref-id="2900-5530">where to go first</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-world-map-guide/2900-5487/" data-ref-id="2900-5487">full world map</a> for the DLC, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-things-to-know/2900-5484/" data-ref-id="2900-5484">14 things you should know before you play</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="406" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In the massive new <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Elden Ring</em> DLC, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>, you don’t have to actually complete the base game in order to access it. However, you do have to have advanced pretty far, as you need to kill a late-game boss as part of the pre-requisites. Here is how to access the new area, the Shadow Realm, in the <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC and where you can find the entrance to the new area.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-new-area-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc" data-injectable="false">Where to find the new area in <em>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC</h2> <p data-characters="539" data-current-count="839" data-injectable="true">As long as you have defeated Starscourge Radahn at the Redmane Castle in Caelid, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-beat-mohg-lord-of-blood-in-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mohg, Lord of Blood at Mohgwyn Palace</a>, you are eligible to enter the new Shadow Realm area in <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. Once you have defeated those two bosses, head to the Cocoon of the Empyrean Site of Grace as indicated in the screenshot above. This is the Site of Grace that was created after defeating Mohg, Lord of Blood. The Cocoon of the Empyrean is also the <em>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</em> starting point for beginning the DLC content.</p>
 <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">At the Cocoon of the Empyrean, you will see an NPC, a follower of Miquella, to be exact. She tells you that her fellow followers are already inside the Shadow Realm, awaiting your arrival. In order to enter the new area, simply interact with the cracked cocoon nearby with a long withered arm hanging out of it. You will then get the prompt asking if you want to “Head to the realm of shadow?” Select YES and you will enter the new Shadow Realm area in the <em>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC and begin the expansion.</p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">If you attempt to interact with the cocoon but do not get a prompt to enter, it means you either do not have the DLC activated or you have not killed Starscourge Radahn or Mohg, Lord of Blood. Complete these tasks and you will be able to enter the new <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> zone.</p>

In that same vein, if you stream or do basically anything on a computer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-ear_monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IEMs </a>(in-ear monitors) have gotten tremendously good over the last five years, to the point where you should absolutely get a pair.</p><figure><figcaption>These things cost $25 bucks and perform very solidly.

They wrap around your ears with a detachable cable, fit much more snugly, and offer have better audio fidelity than consumer earbuds. IEMs are often used for monitoring and in live performances so the performer can hear the mix clearly. That thing in a musician’s ear at a music festival? That’s an IEM. &nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These things are fantastic and addressed everything I did not like about the original Zeros, which were great but I found “shouty”.

(I have done this for <a href="https://www.crystalguardian.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom earplugs</a> before; the process feels very weird.) But like many things recently, a lot changed as Chinese companies have gone from simply producing audio goods to being major players in the market and now dominating some corners handily.</p><figure><figcaption>Companies like Topping dominate big parts of the amplifier market, even on the high end.

HiFiMAN, based out of Tianjin, has been one of the best values when it comes to <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/hifiman-sundara-review-headphone.22529/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planar magnetic headphones</a> since it was founded in 2005. When it comes to Digital Audio Converters (DACs) and amplifiers, companies like <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/topping-la90-review-integrated-amplifier.33374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Topping</a> and <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/smsl-su-1-stereo-dac-review.44029/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S.M.S.L</a>. regularly knock the competition out of the park at a fraction of the price. And when it comes to a multi-room audio streamer, my money is not on the expensive and proprietary Sonos, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23571271/wiim-mini-multi-room-streamer-chromecast-audio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WiiM</a>: a tiny, versatile puck/box that works with basically every platform you can imagine. WiiM even has their own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/22/23972352/wiim-amp-airplay-2-chromecast-wireless-receiver-vintage-hi-fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">integrated amplifier</a>, and it’s <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/wiim-amp-streaming-amplifier-review.52372/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-loved.</a></p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23571271/wiim-mini-multi-room-streamer-chromecast-audio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I have said it many times</a>, WiiM is just a better deal than Sonos when it comes to multi-room audio. Credit: WiiM</figcaption></figure><p>This shift in a specific nerd market is in no way unique. No matter where you turn, Chinese companies are increasingly dominating more and more niche hobbies under their own company names, from affordable watches and electric vehicles to bike components and fountain pens. And barring some massive geopolitical shift, it’s going to continue to happen for the foreseeable future.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="I can't believe this earphone is $20..." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMy3DJ18ntE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The original video that sold the Moondrop Chus like hotcakes. It has since been replaced by the Chu II, which has a detachable cable. I own those and they're very solid.</figcaption></figure></div><p>When it comes to IEMs, the company that changed everything was Moondrop. The 80 dollar Moondrop Aria, itself a slight refinement of the 129 dollar Moondrop Starfield, impressed people for the money at the time. But nothing could prepare people for the Moondrop Chu. It cost 20 dollars, and although it did not have removable cables, it was EQ’d flat and very well tuned. For the money, a usable pair of earbuds that sounded that good was unheard of. Sure, the lack of removable wires was not ideal, although that would eventually be refined with the <a href="https://shenzhenaudio.com/products/moondrop-chu-2-10mm-dynamic-in-ear-headphone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chu II</a>. And yes, it did have a somewhat embarrassing anime waifu as a mascot (most Chinese IEMs do, it’s kind of a bit). But they cost less than most entrees at Chili's and had an unheard of level of fidelity at that price point.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the market for Chinese IEMs has exploded, in part due to one YouTuber named Crinacle. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@crin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crinacle</a> runs one of the larger single databases of IEMs, <a href="https://crinacle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In-Ear Fidelity</a>. Using his measurements or <a href="https://autoeq.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AutoEQ</a>, along with software like <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Equalizer APO</a> or <a href="https://eqmac.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eqMac</a>, IEMs can be tuned exactly to correct for minor imperfections or to better balance out the monitors to a sound more suited to the taste and purpose of the listener. Crinacle, a charismatic and brashly opinionated personality, went from simply maintaining the database and creating content to becoming involved in the process of tuning and selling IEMs himself. He has since collaborated with <a href="https://crinacle.com/collabs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple IEM producers</a> like TRUTHEAR and 7hz on IEMs like the <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/7hz-x-crinacle-zero-2-iem-review.50534/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7hz Crinacle x Zero:2</a>.&nbsp; I have owned the <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/truthear-hola.41070/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hola</a>, the <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/truthear-x-crinacle-zero-iem-review.37380/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Truthear Zero</a>, which I broke in a very foolish mishap, and the follow up <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/truthear-x-crinacle-zero-red-iem-review.44865/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero:RED</a>, the latter of which was tuned in a way I preferred much more. I did not mind buying it twice because it sounds very good and costs about $47 dollars.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Why you SHOULDN'T trust me" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n69THTIrmWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Crinacle’s video on conflicts of interests.

I bought a pair of the Moondrop <a href="https://shenzhenaudio.com/collections/headphones/products/moondrop-chu-2-10mm-dynamic-in-ear-headphone?_pos=6&amp;_fid=927ebd1d4&amp;_ss=c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chu II</a>s for less than 20 dollars for my girlfriend so she could listen to music on the train. For that price, they sound fantastic, although I was disappointed by the quality control of the cable. Luckily, high quality replacement IEM cables have also gotten very affordable as well, and I bought her an upgrade pair of purple cables from Linsoul.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wanted some earbuds for my GF and got the Moondrop Chu II, a follow up to the original.

Whenever I stream and I don’t want my ears to get too hot under bright lights, my IEMs are a no-brainer. As a backup in case I ever lose my earbuds, a pair of IEMs plus the 9 dollar Apple USB-C dongle will always do me right. And at my desk, they sound so good that I end up leaving them plugged into my audio interface more often than not. If you’re even remotely interested in buying some new headphones for less than $50 bucks, you’re in luck, because thanks to the many new companies out there, it’s tremendously hard to screw that up.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With one hand FromSoftware giveth (a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-big-new-patch-finally-lets-you-summon-torrent-to-fight-the-elden-beast">goat-horse in a more opportune location</a>, for instance) and with the other it taketh away; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s newly released 1.12 update has introduced a bug that can break things on Steam Deck - but FromSoftware says it's investigating.
</p>
<p>
As detailed on the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427">developer's social media feed</a>, leaving Elden Ring inactive for too long on Steam Deck renders the game unplayable in some instances - something you'll probably want to be mindful of if you need to wander off and punch something, or have a little cry.
</p>
<p>
"A Steam Deck related issue has been identified and a hotfix is being worked on," the studio wrote on X. "Leaving your Steam Deck inactive for more than five minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs. We apologise for inconvenience." For what it's worth, I left Elden Ring running for multiple five-minute windows in the interests of science and had no problem resuming each time - so it's possible this isn't an especially widespread issue.

<p>
As for when a fix is likely, that's currently unclear, with FromSoftware only saying, "The date and time of the hotfix will be announced separately." Replies to the developer's post also include multiple reports of Steam Deck users being blocked from playing online after receiving the message, "Inappropriate activity detected". FromSoftware is yet to acknowledge these reports, but hopefully concerned player will have more news soon. 
</p>
<p>
In other Elden Ring news, its hugely anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is currently approximately 23 minute away from releasing. I'm now going to close my laptop, sit on the sofa, and stare at Steam until it arrives. Goodbye!
