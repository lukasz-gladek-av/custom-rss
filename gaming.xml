            <p>
Days after announcing a "tentative agreement" had been reached with key video game companies, US actors union SAG-AFTRA has called off its nearly year-long strike, instructing members to return work on productions that fall under its Interactive Media Agreement.
</p>
<p>
The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which represents around 160,000 members, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">announced a strike</a> affecting all work under its Interactive Media Agreement - which includes video game voice acting and other roles - last July. The move came after the union failed to reach an agreement with major video game companies as it renegotiated the terms of the contract, despite more than 18 months of discussions.
</p>
<p>
While SAG-AFTRA had successfully managed to negotiate on a variety of critical issues - including wages in-line with inflation, and job safety - sufficient protections against the exploitative use of AI remained a key sticking point. Back in March, eight months after the strike began, SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-applauds-tenacity-and-persistence-of-sag-aftra-members-as-tentative-agreement-over-ai-reached">said</a> proposals from video game companies were still filled with "alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse".
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, however, SAG-AFTRA announced it had <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national">finally reached a "tentative agreement" with companies</a> including Activision, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>, and Warner Bros. that included the "necessary AI guardrails" it had been pushing for. And now, following that news, SAG-AFTRA national executive director &amp; chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland has <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-video-game-strike-suspended-noon-pt-today">officially suspended the strike</a> against the companies signatory to the Interactive Media Agreement, as of noon PT today.
</p>
<p>
"All SAG-AFTRA members are instructed to return to work on productions under the IMA," the union wrote in its announcement, "including work promoting or publicising projects produced under the IMA. The SAG-AFTRA National Board will meet in special session tomorrow, 12th June, 2025, to consider the tentative agreement. If approved, it will be sent out for ratification by the union's membership in accordance with established policy."
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, UK actors' union Equity <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-applauds-tenacity-and-persistence-of-sag-aftra-members-as-tentative-agreement-over-ai-reached">applauded the "tenacity and persistence" of SAG-AFTRA members</a> after news of the tentative agreement broke. Equity <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actors-union-stages-baftas-protest-seeking-improved-conditions-for-performers">protested outside the BAFTA Games Awards in April</a>, calling on the games industry to improve conditions for performers, including better pay and terms and conditions for their work, as well as AI protections.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-how-long-to-beat-open-world-campaign-1851784366<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The<em> Mario Kart </em>franchise has been entertaining us all for decades—even with sibling fights and fits of rage over losing a race from a blue shell at the last second—but <em>Mario Kart World</em> is the first game to go open world. There hasn’t been a truly new entry in the series since 2014's <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, so being stoked to dive into this exciting adventure is perfectly reasonable. Equally reasonable, especially given the game’s controversial price tag, is to wonder how long it’ll take to beat and what type of replayability it offers. Let’s talk about it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,196599,195519" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h304"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>Mario Kart World</em>?</h2><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> is a racing game first and foremost, so that’s what you can expect to spend a lot of time doing. But if your goal is simply to tackle all of the game’s races and call it quits, <strong>you can complete every Grand Prix cup in just a few hours of playtime</strong>. You’ll probably find the experience lacking, though, as that’s only a small part of what Nintendo’s newest entry in the franchise serves up. </p><p><em>Mario Kart </em>games are known for having an extremely long lifespan due to their seemingly endless replayability. If you thoroughly enjoy racing in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, you can continue to replay its tracks as many times as you’d like via time trials or offline tournaments by yourself or via split-screen multiplayer.</p><p>Alternatively, you can head online to race up to 24 players in a standard Grand Prix or Knockout Mode, the latter of which is a brand-new elimination-based showdown. If you’re feeling feisty, you may want to take to the Battle Mode to fight your pals in a silly arena fight to see who can defeat each other with items. With all of this to do with friends (or strangers, if you’re so inclined), <strong><em>Mario Kart World</em> will likely keep you busy for many months, or even years, after release. </strong></p><p>If you’re more interested in exploring the game’s open world, you can do so entirely alone, or you can team up with your pals in a free roam session to explore it together. You’ll be able to round up plenty of collectibles or engage in dozens and dozens of short-but-sweet P-Switch missions—though it’s worth noting that the latter is strangely absent in cooperative free roam, so you’ll have to do those all by yourself. Sorry!</p><p>If this new kart racing outing sounds like fun to you,<em> Mario Kart World</em> is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But I’ve been taking a look at some Nintendo Switch 2 controllers, and I think these three are the best choices in order from most to least expensive. Maybe there’s one here that will tickle your fancy. </p><h2 id="h5617"><a id="1"></a>The king reigns supreme: Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</h2><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller may be pricey as hell, but it is hands down the best controller you can buy for your Nintendo Switch 2 right now. For its high asking price, you can rest assured that it has every feature needed to make the most of your gameplay experience on your new console. So, if you’ve got the dough, it’s definitely worth the investment.</p><figure id="" data-id="c8d0b5c046c34a9fe1d3fd071660950a" data-recommend-id="image://c8d0b5c046c34a9fe1d3fd071660950a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1705" data-height="946" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Switch 2 Pro Controller." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 Pro Controller." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8d0b5c046c34a9fe1d3fd071660950a" data-recommend-id="image://c8d0b5c046c34a9fe1d3fd071660950a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1705" data-height="946" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Switch 2 Pro Controller." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller comes with mappable back buttons, HD Rumble 2, gyro controls, amiibo support, and a dedicated C button for GameChat. It’s a complete feature set that third-party controllers can’t always lay claim to. But most of all, it’s likely the most comfortable controller I’ve ever held. I adore how smooth the sticks move, how clicky the buttons are, and how the two back buttons rest at just the right spot where they’re easily accessible without making me feel like I might click them accidentally. The controller borders on perfection.</p><p>If I had any real complaint about Nintendo’s newest controller, though, it wouldn’t be about anything functional. Instead, I simply wish the company would offer more colorways than black. Nintendo has frequently embraced quirky, colorful hardware, so I’m hoping we’ll eventually see some unique colors pop up down the line. </p><h2 id="h5618"><a id="2"></a>Let’s get fashionable: Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller</h2><p>My favorite third-party Nintendo Switch 2 controller to use has been the Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller. Officially licensed by Nintendo, this controller comes sporting basically all of the things I want in a controller, and at a lower price than the Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p><figure id="" data-id="d34d157438e3b52f971865e8d8efc59f" data-recommend-id="image://d34d157438e3b52f971865e8d8efc59f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2308" data-height="1183" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wireless controller has Mario on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wireless controller has Mario on it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Turtle Beach</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d34d157438e3b52f971865e8d8efc59f" data-recommend-id="image://d34d157438e3b52f971865e8d8efc59f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2308" data-height="1183" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wireless controller has Mario on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You get up to 40 hours of playtime on a charge, built-in gyro controls, mappable back buttons, and satisfyingly grippy thumbsticks. It’s just killer all-around, honestly, and feels wonderful in the hands. Even more, it’s a hell of a looker with some neat aesthetic flair. Whether you choose the Invincible Mario (pictured above) or the Super Mario Star version, you’re getting a visually fun controller that also glows in the damn dark! And look, I know I’m almost 40, but don’t judge me for embracing some childlike wonder to offset the doom and gloom in the world these days.</p><p>Unfortunately, because it was initially designed for the original Nintendo Switch,<strong> the Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller lacks a dedicated C button for GameChat</strong>, so you’ll need to access that feature from the UI instead. I also wish it provided amiibo support, but that’s life.</p><h2 id="h5619"><a id="3"></a>Rippin’ on a budget: PowerA Advantage Wired Controller</h2><p>Whether you’re on a budget or simply prefer wired controllers, the PowerA Advantage Wired Controller is a beast at only $40. It comes packing Nintendo Switch 2-specific features like programmable back buttons and a C button for accessing GameChat. And its 10ft wire is plenty long enough that you should be able to kick back on the couch and relax while playing your favorite games.</p><figure id="" data-id="f5623d3e6674091e82b7bacea76edca4" data-recommend-id="image://f5623d3e6674091e82b7bacea76edca4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1562" data-height="967" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wired controller with Mario on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wired controller with Mario on it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->PowerA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5623d3e6674091e82b7bacea76edca4" data-recommend-id="image://f5623d3e6674091e82b7bacea76edca4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1562" data-height="967" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wired controller with Mario on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The disadvantages of the PowerA Advantage Wired Controller are that it’s missing HD Rumble, motion controls, and amiibo support. If any of that is a dealbreaker for you, you’re probably better off saving up for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, I reckon.</p><p>The PowerA Advantage Wired Controller comes in a few different neat versions, including a sleek all-black edition and two Nintendo-themed versions that really stand out. I dig the Mario Time controller in the picture above, but I’d say it’s nice to have options.</p><p>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Code Vein married that Souls gameplay with its penchant for anime aesthetics to manifest a world of vampires and tough-as-nails action. Now, years later, the team behind that freshman effort is returning with an expanded sequel that will give fans of the sleek anime souls-like more to chew on.</p><p dir="ltr">Keita Iizuka, producer of Code Vein and its sequel, acknowledges that the genre has changed since Code Vein released, but sees it as a challenge to rise to. “Yes, games like Elden Ring are very praised,” Iizuka starts with a glint in his eye, “But I like to consider those games our rivals.”</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> CODE VEIN 2 — Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/code-vein-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-681504">Code Vein 2</a> started development just after the first game wrapped, it is clear that the developers have tried to anticipate where souls-likes might go. While the first title was a bit like souls-likes at the time in structure--which is to say, the non-linear freedom to get lost but not much choice in where to go--Code Vein II looks to rectify this. This time around, the game is expanding around the edges, letting players look for bosses and dungeons in an open environment. The player-character, once again custom-made, even has a slick motorcycle to help facilitate exploration.</p><p dir="ltr">And explore you must, even if you have played the first title. Code Vein 2’s world has no connection to the first game in terms of narrative, IIzuka says.</p><p dir="ltr">“It is a new world, new characters, and a new story,” he explains. This does mean that Code Vein’s ending cliffhanger, which implied a connection to the God Eater series but still left fans desperate to know more, will not be followed up on with the sequel. Those hoping for some resolution to the harsh cut-to-black tease from Code Vein’s ending will not find it in this sequel, at least as far as Iizuka is willing to admit right now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511994-ss_f53df962d8bd99bd5afab9b3d424fcd64b13fffb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511994" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511994-ss_f53df962d8bd99bd5afab9b3d424fcd64b13fffb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511994"></a><figcaption>Code Vein 2 does not follow up on the first game's cliffhanger ending.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511994-ss_f53df962d8bd99bd5afab9b3d424fcd64b13fffb.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Instead, Code Vein’s narrative tells the story of a world where humans and revenants, the series’ name for vampires, must join forces to stave off a world-destroying force that threatens them both. To do so, you as a revenant hunter must travel between the past and the present to better the world. This is also the driving force behind Code Vein 2’s other major improvement: a time-travel mechanic where actions and quests in the past affect the future.</p><p dir="ltr">When pressed for examples, Iizuka mentioned that saving a bridge repairman in the past gives the player access to a dungeon they otherwise might not have been able to reach in the present. If an NPC has a life goal of creating a specific tool, that character may not have survived into the present, but helping them achieve their goal likely means that tool is waiting for you to use years later.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond those new mechanics, Code Vein 2 is not looking to reinvent the wheel. Iizuka is clear-eyed on his vision: marrying sleek anime-style characters and action with the more thoughtful and pensive gameplay of a souls-like. As such, players will find aspects of Code Vein have been expanded, like a brand-new agile dual-wielding weapon type to attack enemies while looking cool doing it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511995-ss_3857481b5d7fe1d4c7664383536fe0793f6e0075.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511995" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511995-ss_3857481b5d7fe1d4c7664383536fe0793f6e0075.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511995"></a><figcaption>Like the first game, partner NPCs play a crucial role in combat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511995-ss_3857481b5d7fe1d4c7664383536fe0793f6e0075.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Partners also once again play a major role, which Iizuka believes sets the Code Vein series apart from other games. With it, players encounter and recruit NPCs to go through dungeons and beat bosses with them. The decision of who to take with you is a strategic one, but even characters who may not make sense strategically could be a player’s favorite or have story implications. Iizuka wants players to have to think hard about who has their back.</p><p dir="ltr">“That sense of overcoming trials and achieving victory creates a unique sense of enjoyment,” he explains. “Because [Code Vein 2] takes place in a different world with new characters, even if you have played [Code Vein], I think you will fall in love with these new characters.”</p><p dir="ltr">Code Vein 2 is releasing in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

You’ve probably traveled to this area while hunting either monster, as they’ll commonly move to this nest once they’ve taken enough damage.</p><h2 id="h694829"><a id=""></a>How to Deliver Wyvern Eggs</h2><figure id="" data-id="e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-recommend-id="image://e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter carries a Wyvern Egg through a colorful forest and towards a red pop-up camp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hunter carries a Wyvern Egg through a colorful forest and towards a red pop-up camp." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-recommend-id="image://e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter carries a Wyvern Egg through a colorful forest and towards a red pop-up camp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Collecting eggs has its fair share of obstacles. For example, your movement is while carrying these things. You’re also unable to jump from most ledges or roll. Trying to do any of these will break the egg. As if that wasn’t inconvenient enough, <strong>picking up a Wyvern Egg can instantly aggro any Rathian or Rathalos on the map</strong>. They’ll fly right towards you and begin their assault, which will likely result in them breaking the egg you’re carrying.</p><p>Luckily for you, the right tools and planning will make this a trivial matter. Here’s what you need to pull off a Wyvern Egg heist:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Ghillie Mantle</strong>: Equipping this will prevent any monsters from seeing you during the trek back to camp. More importantly, it also prevents any large dragons from being alerted by your theft. Keep in mind that they will begin hunting you as soon as the Mantle stops working</li><li><strong>Outdoorsman Skill</strong>: Although its description only vaguely mentions improving transportation, this cancels out most of the movement drawbacks. You’ll have faster movement, dodging/rolling available, and jumping off a ledge will no longer break the egg. The Ranger Jewel decoration is the easiest way to apply this skill. Otherwise, you’ll either need to collect Gajau fish to forge Gajau Boots or complete Alma’s glasses sidequest to forge Square Glasses</li><li><strong>Area 12: Northeast Pop-up Camp</strong>: One welcomed improvement in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is that Wyvern Eggs don’t need to be delivered to your main camp. This is arguably the closest pop-up camp with the relatively safest conditions. Area 7: Bower of the Great Tree is another option, but it frequently has monsters nearby</li></ul><p>You can take out any Rathian or Rathalos on the map first if you want the absolute safest egg trip. I suggest checking the map’s Environment Overview Forecast beforehand to make sure you’ll have enough time before another one spawns in.</p><p>Before we start, you’re going to want to set up a waypoint to the nearest Pop-up Camp. This will help if you’re not as familiar with the map or accidentally get lost moving through this giant forest. Holding L1/LB for about a second will cause your scoutflies to head towards the waypoint, leaving a visible trail for you to follow.</p><p>Once you’re in the nest, equip the Ghillie Mantle and pick up the Wyvern Egg. Head north where a long set of vines lead down to another tree top. You might need to be walking straight towards it to slowly climb down these, which is a common reason players get stuck up here. If you have the Outdoorsman Skill in your build, feel free to just run right off. Your hunter will safely land with the egg intact. Keep moving forward to find an even longer set of vines you can climb or jump off from.</p><p>Now that you’re on the ground, you’ll want to turn right and move towards the giant mess of mossy rocks. Follow the water that goes around the left of this, and you’ll see the Pop-up Camp as soon as you round the corner. You’ll successfully deliver the egg once you approach the camp and see an animation of you placing the egg down.</p><p>Your reward is 50 Guild Points, which admittedly isn’t a lot. Previous entries had special egg delivery quests, so it makes sense that the rewards aren’t great without anything like that. Fingers crossed they add some in the future to give incentive for doing this. For now, it’s more or less a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> easter egg.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They also announced that pre-registration has opened for all regions as momentum builds to its release window later this year.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/10/250529-sdo-press-en-1749585781087.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is being made by the same team that created 2019’s The Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross and tells an original story set in Brittania, the same world as The Seven Deadly Sins anime and manga series. That series has sold 55 million copies and Grand Cross reached 70 million downloads globally, so it’s fair to say there’s a huge fanbase that’s been anticipating the latest installment. It stars Tristan, son of series main characters Meliodas and Elizabeth, in a multiverse narrative that dives into parallel timelines and alternate character arcs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all begins with the Book of Stars, a pendant that lay dormant in a cave beneath a lake. It has the power to record and connect timelines, and it chooses Tristan to be its next guardian. That moment sets Tristan on his course to explore the world and save it from turmoil and chaos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new trailers provide a glimpse into the game’s central narrative, a deeper look at its expansive world, and show off the eye-catching art style that emulates the anime, powered by Unreal Engine. The first trailer, revealed on Friday during Summer Game Fest, begins with Tristan’s discovery of the Book of Stars. It seemingly sets off an explosion of power before settling into a celestial orb in the middle of the pendant.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We then see some of the game’s large and varied environments, including open fields, canyons, lakeside docks, a desert oasis, and an underwater area. You can fly or go diving to fully explore some of these regions, and you can take part in other activities as you explore, like fishing and cooking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We get a look at the flashy and fast-paced real-time combat system, showing several different characters and their abilities. At one point, two characters attack at the same time, hinting at the ability to strategically combine characters’ unique skills and weapons to create combos. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a variety of enemies featured, including spiders, golems, aggressive plants, and a horned monster that falls out of a flaming hole in the sky. And that’s on top of two hulking monstrosities that tower above the trees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second trailer, shown during the Future Games Show on Saturday, expands on the showdown with one of those monstrosities. We see that it’s not just a cutscene, it’s an actual boss fight where the controllable character has to dodge fireballs before climbing up the body of the massive creature.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That trailer also expanded on the environments, showing a deep forest, a cavern beneath the sand, the inside of a town, and a rain-drenched grassland. You can also see Tristan magically moving blocks into empty holes in a door or wall, possibly indicating that there will be environmental puzzles you need to solve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two trailers combined to give us our deepest dive into The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin yet, and they clearly have fans excited, since they gathered more than a million views on YouTube in just two days. Origin will be available on PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile, with crossplay available across all platforms.

                <p>After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-strike-may-be-over-soon-after-tentative-deal/1100-6532302/" data-ref-id="1100-6532302">reaching a tentative agreement</a> with video game companies to end the 11-month video game actor strike, SAG-AFTRA has now officially confirmed that the strike ends today, June 11, at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.</p><p>All SAG-AFTRA members are now <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-video-game-strike-suspended-noon-pt-today" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cleared to go back to work</a>, including promotional work. The union said it will convene a special meeting on June 12 to "consider the tentative agreement." If approved, the agreement will then be sent for ratification by the union's members. This is also when the full terms of the agreement will be published.</p><p>The video game companies released a statement regarding the strike coming to an end, with spokesperson Audrey Cooling saying the companies are "pleased to have reached a tentative contract agreement that reflects the important contributions of SAG-AFTRA-represented performers in video games."</p><p>The statement goes on: "This agreement builds on three decades of successful partnership between the interactive entertainment industry and the union. It delivers historic wage increases of over 24% for performers, enhanced health and safety protections, and industry-leading AI provisions requiring transparency, consent and compensation for the use of digital replicas in games. We look forward to continuing to work with performers to create new and engaging entertainment experiences for billions of players throughout the world."</p><p>The strike began in July 2024. The union and video game companies agreed to terms on a number of points in negotiations, but a sticking point was the matter of AI. As such, it'll be interesting to see the terms of the agreement and how it all shakes out with regards to protections against AI.</p><p>In May, Master Chief voice actor Steve Downes spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-voice-of-master-chief-asks-halo-fans-to-stand-up-for-voice-actors-on-strike/1100-6531524/" data-ref-id="1100-6531524">the importance of getting a deal</a> that offers performers assurances that their voices can't be used by AI duplicates without their permission.</p><p>The video game companies were reported to have made what was characterized as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-companies-make-key-ai-concession-in-latest-offer-to-end-actors-strike/1100-6531513/" data-ref-id="1100-6531513">a key concession</a>" on AI, but it remains to be seen what this might be. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>This wasn't the first SAG-AFTRA video game actor strike. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-video-game-voice-actor-strike-is-ending/1100-6453577/" data-ref-id="1100-6453577">2016-2017 video game actor strike also ran for about 11 months</a>, with performers winning benefits including $100+/hour pay rates, bonus, and more.</p>

In case you hadn't noticed, what with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>'s launch and the annual Summer Geoffs causing all sorts of distractions, June is well and truly upon us. And Sony is marking the occasion - much as it does every month - with a fresh batch of additions to its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogue, which this time include Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
Sony's latest catalogue refresh takes place next Tuesday, 17th June, bringing a total of eight new games for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, alongside one further addition exclusive to the latter tier. You'll find the full list of June's titles below:
</p>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra:</h3>
<ul>
<li>FBC: Firebreak (PS5)</li>
<li>Battlefield 2042 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>theHunter: Call of the Wild (PS4)</li>
<li>We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Train Sim World 5 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Endless Dungeon (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deus Ex: The Conspiracy (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<p>
So there're some decent arrivals, then, with highlights including Alan Wake developer Remedy Entertainment's promising co-op Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, and the ever-delightful We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie. RPG fans, meanwhile, might get a kick out of Suikoden spiritual successor Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes, and Amplitude's tower defence roguelike Endless Dungeon is also a good old time.
</p>
<p>
As for those forking out for Sony's top-tier membership, June's retro addition comes in the form of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a>: The Conspiracy - the PlayStation 2 adaptation of developer Ion Storm's cyberpunk immersive sim classic Deux Ex, which first hit the console back in 2002.
</p>
<p>
And that's your lot! All the above don't arrive until next Tuesday, 17th June, meaning you've still got some time to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-ps-plus-catalogue-additions-for-may">last month's PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra additions</a> before your attention is yanked elsewhere.

<figure><a title="Age of Calamity" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7aab1096cbe2/age-of-calamity.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One pleasant surprise of the Switch 2 launch, beyond the advertised upgrades — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">free and otherwise</a> — to various Switch games, has been seeing how <em>some</em> Switch games that once struggled to hit their frame rate targets have gotten a nice boost on the new console.</p>
<p>It seems that Switch 1 games with unlocked frame rates are getting a largely untouted bump in the performance department, with games like the nigh-on unplayable <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> — which we called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/batman-arkham-knight">"one of the worst ports we've ever played"</a> — now becoming a viable option on Switch 2. Loads times have also shot down for some titles. Result!</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Here, we've collected 13 examples which have impressed us. Some were fairly miraculous on Switch to begin with, but Switch 2 is making a bunch of the bad ones good (or at least playably stable!) and some of the great ones shine brighter than ever. Let's jump in, in no particular order...</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disaster_report_4_summer_memories">Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories (Switch)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disaster_report_4_summer_memories">Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories!</a> My god, I love this game. However, it was a bit of a mess, a bit of a *bunch of swear words* if i'm being honest, on Switch 1.</p>
<p>Back at the release, our review said, <em>"From a technical perspective, the Switch port of Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories is an absolute mess. Narratively and artistically, however, it’s one of the most fascinating games in recent memory."</em> Correct.</p>
<p>Now, though, thanks to Switch 2, from what I can see, the game runs flawlessly. And you need to play it. Now, I'm not gonna pretend I know exactly what the numbers are here, but if I had to guess, I'd say we're looking at an uncapped frame rate that's lifted the action right up to around the 60 mark. It feels great. It also looks much clearer. I think a replay is unavoidable. Sorry. <em><strong>- PJ</strong></em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>I fired <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> up and dove into one of the EX missions and...blimey. Essentially, it now has the performance you always wanted from the game. I played a mission and tried out the two-player splitscreen and didn't note a single dropped frame.</p>
<p>Granted, its original state, while hitchy, didn't massively affect my enjoyment of the game. Of course, I saw it — you couldn't miss it — but I still very much enjoyed my time with it (RSI notwithstanding).</p>
<p>Now, I'm not going to play through the entire thing hunting frame rate dips, but after firing it up again for the first time in several years, I'd absolutely consider it if the backlog didn't just have two dozen Switch 2 games piled on it! <strong>- <em>GL</em></strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3 (Switch)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a> is an incredibly ambitious, bombastic game that definitely struggled in places on Switch 1 as a result. It looks fuzzy when playing handheld and the accompanying frame rate rarely hits its 60fps target.</p>
<p>Moving over to Switch 2, the game still kind of looks like arse in handheld mode, and it'll likely take a proper 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' upgrade to change this. The frame rate, however, is now buttery-smooth throughout. There's not a single drop below 60fps, from what I've played, even during the busiest set pieces.</p>
<p>For me, the last mainline entry in PlatinumGames' flagship series has its downsides, but if performance was one of them for you, then you can feel comforted in the knowledge that this has been completely rectified for Switch 2. Oh, and load times are now much zippier, too. Nice. <strong>- OR</strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Batman: Arkham Knight (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Booting this horiffic mess up for this article,...I'm now impressed? Sort of.</p>
<p>There's no doubting that the move to Switch 2 has benefitted <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Arkham Knight</a> immensely with regards to its frame rate, which is now super smooth — even whilst driving Batman's car. I can't remember what it's called...the Bat Car? Anyway, you can barrel through the streets now and it's all good.</p>
<p>And so it goes in combat. It now feels very smooth, and even spinning the camera around Gotham City as you glide through the sky causes no stutters or anything. Miraculous. Or it would be if they could fix the resolution, which is rough in places.</p>
<p>However, if you only have this one way to play Arkham Knight — or it came in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/batman_arkham_trilogy">Arkham Trilogy</a> and you abandoned it — it's good to know this version now runs well enough, besides some fuzzy visuals. <strong><em>- PJ</em></strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bakeru">BAKERU (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>Oh, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bakeru">BAKERU</a> is so lovely. If you haven't played this delightful little 3D platformer yet, then now is the perfect time to do so.</p>
<p>On Switch 1, Bakeru's frame rate was kind of all over the place at times. You could tell it was gunning for that 60fps sweet spot, but it never even came close to hitting it. On the Switch 2, it's a completely different story.</p>
<p>I felt like I was playing a remaster when I booted it up for the first time on Nintendo's new console. The frame rate is absolutely spot on, and it really helps elevate the incredible art design and animations. This is up there with some of Nintendo's best. Get on it. <em><strong>- OR</strong></em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>I'm gonna be blunt now. I hated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3</a> on Switch. I know, I know...it was a miracle port. Whatever. I couldn't handle the muddiness, the sluggishness, and the draw distance that gave me a headache outside of towns. It just wasn't viable for me. I'm a pig.</p>
<p>And so, I'm very pleased to announce that, having taken so poorly to The Switcher, the very same game on Switch 2 is one I'd happily go on a date with. I might even pay for the food. Switch 2 makes the game look night and day different. It's really crisp and clear and, even with all the graphical excisions, manages to look quite purdy, especially while galloping (unfettered by flailing frames) across the game's glorious countryside.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpn5-Ifk27k">Yep, the frame rate feels slick as hell now, too.</a> The Witcher has gone from struggling to run, to feeling as though it needs a bespoke patch to unleash its full powers on a machine that can handle it. For now, though, it's a bloody nice, free little boost. Ta. <strong><em>- PJ</em></strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bloodstained_ritual_of_the_night">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>I was super-hyped for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bloodstained_ritual_of_the_night">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</a> on Switch (massive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/castlevania">Castlevania</a> fan detected) and even decided to make that my platform of choice for the game.</p>
<p>Whilst it was okay, in a pinch, there was a big loss in terms of visual fidelity, and frame times were all over the place, leading to juddery, unsatisfying play. It just wasn't a <em>grea</em>t version of what is a great game, put simply. However, on Switch 2, any frame time issues have been sorted, with a fully solid lock to 30fps (yes it's not 60, but it's smooth and maybe we'll get a patch).</p>
<p>It's also just a much nicer game to sit down with, thanks to more responsive menu navigation and loading times that have been squashed right down to a breezy minimum. If the game had arrived on Switch like this, I probably wouldn't have double-dipped. Not bad! <em><strong>- OR</strong></em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>Compared to other series entries, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> wasn't quite as rage-inducingly bad in the performance department, but as highlighted by Alex in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/rwJk2nz_xcA?si=Mqsb70rP8ZKf9sbp&amp;t=1071">a recent live stream</a>, the game is now rock-solid, stable 30fps for anybody playing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Now, that's not to say that Arceus is some bastion of graphical prowess or anything, but if the frame rate drops bothered you before, they've been zapped on Switch 2. The Pokémon Company let everyone know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> were getting an update, but don't forget this winner, too. <em><strong>- GL</strong></em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium: The Final Cut (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a>, despite being utterly incredible, definitely had its drawbacks on the Switch 1. Load times were pretty dire, and even just heading into the pause menu would yield some unsavoury slowdown.</p>
<p>Not so on the Switch 2. Here, everything is as slick as you could possible hope for. Transitions from one area to the next are pretty close to instantaneous, and heading into the pause menu now has absolutely no slowdown whatesoever.</p>
<p>These hardly sound like the most enthralling improvements ever, I know, but with some like Disco Elysium — a game that utterly demands you to pay attention — seeing all these little improvements add up makes for a much more enjoyable experience. <strong><em>- OR</em></strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xcom_2_collection">XCOM 2 Collection (Switch)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xcom_2_collection">XCOM 2 Collection</a> is a game that I awarded an 8/10 to when it released on Switch, and I stand by that score, as bringing a game of this depth and size to a dinky little console, and in a form that played well enough, was very obviously a huge undertaking. And Firaxis managed it - albeit with some big concessions.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, while the graphics remain downgraded (for now), the game now runs buttery smooth, meaning that it's now a viable way, <em>a fully enjoyable way</em>, to play this timeless collection of strategy classics in portable mode. Get in. <strong><em>- PJ</em></strong></p>

						<h5>Lies of P: Overture</h5><p><span>June 6th, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Since the Souls series formula has become popular among players, countless games have tried to recapture what makes FromSoftware's hardcore action role-playing games so engaging, but only a few have managed to even get close. Among these is NEOWIZ and Round8 Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/">Lies of P</a>, which still stands, a few years since its release, as the game that got the closest to recapturing the haunting atmosphere of the beloved Bloodborne.</p>
<p>Launching almost two years after the base game's release, the Lies of P: Overture DLC promised, before its release, to provide more of the same solid experience players have been enjoying since late 2023. Those who didn't expect anything else will find the expansion a worthy addition to the experience, but those who expected something more will inevitably be disappointed to see how the expansion doesn't push the formula past the boundaries set by the base game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lies-of-P_20250609121253-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Lies of P: Overture expansion is set in the past, in a time before Krat was overrun and then destroyed by the terrible Puppet Frenzy Outbreak that players deal with in the base game. Starting with the Krat Zoo, which was burned down in the main timeline, players get to explore a slew of different locations which are no longer standing in the post-outbreak Krat, get to meet characters who are only briefly mentioned in the main adventure, and fight tons of powerful enemies to learn more about the world's lore and the chain of events that led to the Outbreak.</p>
<p>When it comes to the story, there's no doubt that Lies of P: Overture fully delivers. The main characters of the expansion may be fewer compared to the base game, but they are endearing enough and add quite a bit to the experience. Same with the new information on the world, which better fleshes out the story of the city of Krat. If you wanted to learn more about the setting, then the DLC is definitely a worthy purchase, even if you aren't too keen on dealing with high difficulty, thanks to the two new easier difficulty settings that have been added to the entirety of the experience with the free update that added support for the Overture DLC.</p>
<p>Even if you pick the easiest difficulty setting, however, you should be aware that the Lies of P: Overture DLC expansion is not a walk in the park, and you won't be able to mash your way to victory. As the expansion can only be accessed after reaching the end of Chapter IX, it is meant to be a late-game experience that expects players to possess a certain degree of skill, properly upgraded weapons, and effective builds. As such, the expansion is challenging from the get-go.</p>
<p>Possibly a little too much: enemy HP pools are generally high, as is the damage they can deal at the base difficulty, so expect to die a lot as you get reacquainted with the experience and some of its quirks, such as perfect blocking, which is more important than ever before to leave the enemies open to powerful critical attacks, if you haven't played the game in a while like myself. The difficulty of the expansion is so high that even the developer has promised to look into balance changes down the line. If you are coming to the expansion straight from the base game, you will likely have far less trouble, but you will still need to be on your toes, as it's not just the enemy stats that make them challenging, but also their placement, which, at times, gets really, really unfair. The enemy placements, alongside some locations that resemble each other a little too much, somewhat impact level design, though they are minor issues that most of those who liked the base game will have no trouble looking past. For the rest, expect to explore some fairly intricate locations, unlock shortcuts, and discover all sorts of secrets, including some new gear.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lies-of-P_20250609170050-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though the Lies of P: Overture experience is the same Souls series-inspired action RPG experience seen in the base game, the expansion offers plenty of new tools to play with. Some really change the way the game is approached, such as the Royal Horn Bow, which provides a solid ranged combat option, but the other weapons are similarly well designed and can really shake up how combat is approached. The Pale Knight greatsword, inspired by Final Fantasy VIII's gunblades, is a persona favorite of mine, but every other new weapon and Talisman in the expansion is a worthy addition to the experience.</p>
<p>With these new tools at the player's disposal, it's no surprise to see enemy design take them into account to prevent some options from being too powerful. Some of the new enemies, for example, are quite aggressive, so don't expect, for example, to be able to use the Royal HornBow from afar too much. Other than this, however, enemy design isn't too different from the base game. Bosses, on the other hand, are the highlight of the experience, and are rather well designed, except for a couple that are, in my opinion, more frustrating than fun. Even this, however, is entirely in line with what is seen in the base game, so if you have spent 40 hours going through the streets of Krat already, you will feel right at home spending 20 more in the Krat of the past.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Lies of P: Overture is an expansion in the true sense of the word. Opting to deliver more of the same, Round8 Studio plays to the game’s strengths, offering an experience every bit as enjoyable as the base game, even with some unfair difficulty that will likely get toned down in time. As such, the DLC is a worthy purchase for those who loved the original and still want more. Those who feel they’ve had their fill or struggled with the game’s quirks the first time around won’t find much to change their minds here, however. For better or worse, it’s more Lies of P.</p>

				<p>While it doesn't add anything substantially new to the experience, Lies of P: Overture expansion is a more than worthy expansion, delivering an engaging story delving deeper into the base game's lore, featuring some of the best bosses in the entire game, and adding new weapons that can significantly shake up combat. Its lack of innovation and unfair difficulty may turn off a few players, but all those who loved every second of the base game will have no trouble falling in love again with one of the best Soulslikes of the past few years.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bethesdas-update-1-1-for-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-now-available-on-all-platforms/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda%E2%80%99s-update-1-1-for-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-now-available-on-all-platforms.1215930/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bethesdas-update-1-1-for-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-now-available-on-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda's new update for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, <a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/article/6KFC705KG7qmVTfEfG7Txl/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-steam-beta-update-1-1">update 1.1</a>, is now available on all platforms, after initially being available only for Steam Beta users when it launched on June 5.</p>
<p>The update addresses several issues, from bugs that were causing the game to crash or freeze at different points, to VFX and gameplay animation issues. Notably, it also fixes a number of quest issues that would have soft-locked players from being able to complete the quests and progress further.</p>
<p>This is the first of two major patches that Bethesda is working on for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, the second of which will also be out first through Steam Beta, before being made available on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles. There's currently no word from Bethesda as to when the next update will arrive, with the studio simply saying in the patch notes that it will be live "<em>in the coming weeks</em>."</p>
<p>While Oblivion Remastered launched with <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/">significant performance issues</a>, that hasn't stopped it from being a top seller since it launched. It was part of Xbox's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/">US game sales dominance in April 2025</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/">according to Newzoo, Oblivion IV Remastered is</a> "<em>a benchmark for how to execute a remaster effectively</em>."</p>
<p>Though, if you disagree with Newzoo, and Bethesda isn't fixing the issues you're having with Oblivion Remastered fast enough, plenty of modders are already putting in the work to try and <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-anti-stutter-improvement/">fix the game's problems themselves, with varying degrees of success.</a></p>
<p>Barring performance issues, returning to Oblivion has been a treat for many fans of The Elder Scrolls series. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo scored the remaster very highly</a> when it was shadow-dropped earlier this year, and praised Bethesda for bringing the game into the modern gaming landscape in all the best ways.</p>
<p>"<em>Enhancing the original where it mattered most while preserving what made it truly unique, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered stands as the definitive way to experience Bethesda's classic. Although the shift in atmosphere and noticeable performance issues will put some players off, as will the dated gameplay, the game couldn't have debuted on current gaming platforms in a better way</em>."</p>

                <p>Another chapter in China's struggle with video games and their impact on society made international news this week.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a> has surpassed&nbsp;<strong>5 million copies sold</strong>, Capcom announced in a <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1932603814827180338">post on the game's official X account</a>.</p>
<p>The milestone comes two years after the latest entry into Capcom's long-running fighting series launched. It's almost two years to the date since Street Fighter 6 launched on June 2, 2023.</p>
<p>"<em>Street Fighter 6 has now sold over 5 million copies! What a way to celebrate our 2nd anniversary! Thanks to all our fans out there around the world and to all the prospective fans in the future!</em>" Capcom wrote announcing the news.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This is the latest event in Capcom's continued stellar performance in recent years, and it's also less than a year since Street Fighter 6 reached its last major sales milestone of <a href="https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-sales-reach-four-million-globally/">4 million units sold.</a></p>
<p>Hitting 5 million in just two years also puts SF6 perfectly in position to be the best-selling game in the entire Street Fighter series. The current top spot is held by Street Fighter 5, which is sitting at over <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-street-fighter-v-i-sold-7-million-copies-in-7-years">7 million copies</a> sold since it launched in 2016. It could be the case that Capcom is celebrating SF6's three year anniversary with the news that it's also now the best-selling game in the entire franchise.</p>
<p>Capcom also recently <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1931118961846038736">announced</a> the Year 3 roster of fighters that'll be joining Street Fighter 6 between this summer and spring 2026. At some point this summer, Sagat will join the roster, followed by C. Viper joining in fall 2025, then Alex joining in early spring 2026, and Ingrid shortly after in late spring 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pragmata Preview - Capcom's Next Hit IP?]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pragmata-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pragmata-preview-capcoms-next-hit-ip.1215888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pragmata-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I love it when Capcom makes games that aren't from an established franchise. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and others as much as everyone else, but completely new IPs are also fun.</p><p>
After several years of silence since its initial reveal, <em>Pragmata </em>was a game shrouded in mystery. A new IP from Capcom is sure to catch anyone's attention, so who wouldn't be curious about it?</p><p>
We got hands-on gameplay of Pragmata at Summer Game Fest 2025, so join us as we unravel the mystery behind this title.</p></div>



<h2>Two Makes a Team</h2>

<p>Although we were able to play through 20 or so minutes of gameplay, the story of&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>remains enigmatic. There isn't much in the way of dialogue, other than that we control two characters simultaneously.</p>

<p>One character is this burly man clad in a utilitarian space suit -- his name is Hugh. The other is an android, Diana, that takes the form of a little girl. One might think that this is an escort mission, then, but as it turns out, Diana is quite capable.</p>



<p>Gameplay takes place within this clean, sterile space station. Something's happened, and we're essentially exploring to find a way out. The station is manned by these creepy, humanoid-like robots that are hellbent on taking you out.</p>

<p>Combat largely comprises two components: shooting and hacking. Hugh can shoot various firearms to destroy the robots, and Diana can hack them to make them vulnerable. Just shooting robots without hacking them first means they are near invincible.</p>



<h2>Hack and Shoot to Victory</h2>

<p>Players have to frantically hack these robots to make them vulnerable. On the upper right portion of the screen, there's a small grid that players use to hack. You have to guide your way to a green node to open a robot's vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>There are also blue nodes that will make them vulnerable for longer, so you have a bit of a high risk, high reward type of situation: hit some (or all) of those blue nodes before the exit, or just go straight for the finish?</p>

<p>Later on in the demo, we pick up an upgrade that unlocks shield nodes on the hacking grid. Hitting those nodes on your path to the seem to make robots take more damage.</p>



<p>The gist of combat is, then, to hack and then shoot. Hacking is succinct and easy enough to handle, though it remains to be seen if the complexity of this system will increase over the course of&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>.</p>

<p>Gunplay, by the way, feels pretty tight on controller. If I'm playing a shooter, first-person or, in&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>'s case, third-person, then I'd prefer a mouse and keyboard. During my demo, I actually forgot I was playing with a controller, so it all felt very natural to control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Outside of combat, Hugh explores the station while Diana clings to his back. There are light puzzle and platforming elements, but nothing complex, so it's hard to gauge if puzzles are even the focus of&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>.</p>

<h2><em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>While I did enjoy my time with&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>, I couldn't help but wonder how Capcom would continue to keep gameplay feeling fresh. I found three out of what appeared to be four total weapons, so I'm hoping there's more than it appears.</p>

<p>Other than weapons, the hacking might not feel stale after 10 or so hours, but I could see myself finding it a nuisance if&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>&nbsp;doesn't constantly introduce new mechanics to keep things fresh.</p>

<p>I'm optimistic, though, because&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>is a gorgeous game, and the dynamic between Hugh and Diana has potential to be very heartwarming -- or even tragic. We'll have to find out in 2026, which looks to be a big year for Capcom.</p>

Midjourney’s conduct misappropriates Disney’s and Universal’s intellectual property and threatens to upend the bedrock incentives of U.S. copyright law that drive American leadership in movies, television, and other creative arts.” </p><p>This is the highest-profile legal attack yet on a generative-AI company, following lawsuits by <em>The New York Times</em> and others against companies like OpenAI for copying written work. The outcome in court would have major consequences for the viability of a technology that companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta are investing billions in. Without the ability to essentially copy the internet for free, the entire business model behind a lot of generative-AI and large language algorithms falls part. </p><p> “Midjourney’s bootlegging business model and defiance of U.S copyright law<br>are not only an attack on Disney, Universal, and the hard-working creative community that brings the magic of movies to life, but are also a broader threat to the American motion picture industry which has created millions of jobs and contributed more than $260 billion to the nation’s economy,” the companies claim in their lawsuit. “This case is not a ‘close call’ under well-settled copyright law.”   </p><p>  .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
