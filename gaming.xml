<p>It was recently claimed that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was banned in Saudi Arabia due to “unskippable gay scenes” in the game; however, the writer of the game, Daniel Vávra, has just provided clarification on the situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vávra is a Czech video game writer who has worked on several popular franchises, such as Mafia and Kingdom Come Deliverance. Vávra recently took to <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1881081082612944935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to address the claims about “unskippable gay scenes” <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-banned-saudi-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and the game being banned in Saudi Arabia</a>. However, his clarification included some spoilers for the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vávra’s clarification started by confirming that there are “no unskippable scenes” in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and that they haven’t been banned in any country, to their knowledge. Vávra added that he doesn’t like “forced diversity,” and neither are they forced to do anything nor force anyone to do specific things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Vávra spoke about the fact that gay characters were already part of the original Kingdom Come Deliverance, and it’s not new for KCD 2. Also, KCD 2 is an RPG so players can choose “a same-sex adventure” or not. Vávra confirmed that “All affairs are (and were in KCD1) purely optional”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vávra’s clarification on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 claims also included some story points and the upcoming game’s setting, which comes with some spoilers. He explained that KCD 2 “takes place in one of the richest cities in Europe, which was besieged by a massive foreign army,” so players might see the city life “as more diverse” compared to the previous game set in villages. If you want more context about KCD 2’s story, check out Vávra’s entire thread <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1881081082612944935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has the most extensive<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> script in gaming history</a>. Also, check whether you must play the original title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-deliverance-before-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before jumping into the sequel</a>.

Katsuhiro Harada, the boss of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a>, has moved to reassure fans of the series who spotted him post on LinkedIn that he was now open to new job oppurtunities. 
</p>
<p>
Harada's LinkedIn page still lists him as executive game director, chief producer and general manager at Bandai Namco, where he has served for 30 years and become the face of the Tekken franchise.
</p>
<p>
But Harada has also set his profile to "open to work" status and in a short <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7286913589884465152/">post</a> wrote: "I would like to broaden my horizons by connecting with more people as I look toward the future. I'm interested in roles such as executive producer, executive game director, vice president, business development, business development executive, and marketing."

<p>
"Oh, don't worry about this," Harada <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1881164805060567212">wrote</a> on X in response to fans questioning whether he was leaving Bandai Namco and the Tekken series behind. "I meet a lot of people on a regular basis (but I don't actually have that many friends in my private world LOL), I just want to meet more people and expand my horizons in the future. 
</p>
<p>
"I can talk to a lot of people when I turn this option on," he concluded. "Just that."
</p>
<p>
It's now been 12 months since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> launched for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January 2024. The game has since been kept updated with new characters, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16s-clive-coming-to-tekken-8-as-first-seasons-final-dlc-character">including Final Fantasy 16's Clive</a>, with a second season pass announced for 2025.
</p>
<p>
"A marked improvement over <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-7">Tekken 7</a> and a perfectly executed balancing act," Lewis Parker wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-review">Eurogamer's Tekken 8 review</a>, "keeping older players happy while revealing its trademark freedom to newcomers".
</p>
<p>Late last year, we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-asked-kfc-to-let-colonel-sanders-join-the-games-roster">Harada had once asked KFC to let Colonel Sanders join the Tekken series' roster</a> - a suggestion that was turned down with a disapproving look.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Team Cherry's Matthew 'Leth' Griffin, in charge of PR and marketing, has stated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is "real, progressing and will release".</p>
<p>Multiple rumours have been circulating about the game, sparked by co-creator William Pellen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-fans-believe-creators-switch-2-hint-points-to-april-announcement-and-its-all-thanks-to-a-slice-of-cake">switching his social media profile picture to a cake</a>, which led to fans speculating about an ARG to lead towards a release date.</p>
<p>Sadly, this has now been debunked as a "nothingburger".</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/the-hollow-knight-silksong-arg-turned-out-to-be-us-clutching-at-straws-but-dev-says-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release/">GamesRadar</a> reported, YouTuber <a href="https://x.com/fireb0rn/status/1880411907552911626">fireb0rn posted</a>: "Leth reached out to me to confirm there was no Silksong ARG and that the changes to William's account and the tweet were a nothingburger. Apologies to have misled everyone. The cake was a lie."</p>
<p>Griffin himself then followed up to confirm the game is still in development.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yes the game is real, progressing and will release. &lt;3</p>— Matthew Griffin (@griffinmatta) <a href="https://twitter.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>

<p>So what was that supposed ARG? Last week, Pellen changed his social media handle and switched his profile picture to a slice of chocolate cake. Eager <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> fans reverse image searched the picture to discover it was from a recipe page posted on 2nd April 2024 - a year ahead of the newly announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>Coupled with Pellen's post ahead of last week's Switch 2 reveal - "something big is coming" - and fans were riled up with anticipation. It seems that was all for nothing, despite the game still being on the way.</p>
<p>Silksong is the hugely anticipated follow up to popular Metroidvania Hollow Knight. It was first announced in 2019 - and Eurogamer went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-the-fast-paced-and-fluid-sequel-hollow-knight-deserves">hands-on with a Silksong demo</a> - but after multiple delays the game is still yet to be released.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Marking the first anniversary of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/palworld">Palworld’s</a> early access release, developer Pocketpair has released a roadmap of what to expect in future updates through 2025. Most exciting are major new features including co-op crossplay, world transfers for Pals, and a World Tree ending scenario</p>
<p>It’s less of a roadmap, and more of a to-do list, to be honest, as there’s no timeline to go with the list of features and content that Pocketpair has outlines. We’ve no idea when to expect crossplay, for example. Still, it’s great to see the team targeting some rather key features for the game.</p>


<p>The future Palworld roadmap includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-op Crossplay</li>
<li>World Transfers for Pals</li>
<li>World Tree / Ending Scenario</li>
<li>Further ways to strengthen and improve Pals</li>
<li>Various new content such as new Pals and technologies</li>
<li>Game Collaborations (Including Terraria)</li>
<li>Improvements to world object placement</li>
<li>Improvements to base Pals</li>
<li>Improvements to optimization</li>
<li>Improvements to UX</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the game roadmap, Pocketpair has also marked the first anniversary by putting the game’s soundtrack on YouTube with 28 tracks included.</p>

<p>Palworld is available across PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/palworld-is-out-today-on-ps5/">since last September</a>, across PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. December saw <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/palworld-december-update-new-island/">a major new update for the game that added a whole new island region</a> for players to explore.</p>
<p>Palworld has enjoyed a huge amount of success, its meme-worthy blend of Pokémon-like monsters, base building, crafting and guns proving to be an immediate hit last January.&nbsp;That success, however, has brought a lot of scrutiny. Back in September,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/nintendo-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-maker/">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced a lawsuit against the indie developer</a>, seemingly for infringing a recently acquired patent for capturing and summoning monsters in battle. <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16">Pocketpair promised to fight this lawsuit</a>, and it feels like Nintendo’s case could be a little bit shaky and tenuous… though we don’t really know how Japanese courts will view the case.</p>

			<p>The sci-fi future of Freedom Wars Remastered makes George Orwell’s 1984 look like a holiday brochure. Forget worrying about the government tracking you, or whether what you read is the truth, in Freedom Wars you’re born with a 1,000,000 year prison sentence. One. Million. Years. From birth. This dystopian vision of the future is so ruthless, you have to earn the right to lie down. What happens if you forget? That’s a crime, and you’ll find another batch of years being added to your sentence.</p>
<p>This brutality paves the way for Sinners like you to work in indentured servitude to your Panopticon – a prison city – earning your right to essential things like lying down, or frivolities like running for more than five seconds. Each contribution to the greater good knocks a few years off your sentence, hopefully moving things in the right direction. Unless, of course, you callously go for a little run. Then it’s going back up again.</p>
<p><iframe title="FREEDOM WARS REMASTERED — Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AmbyQrgqFeE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/10/freedom-wars-review/">Freedom Wars</a> was originally a PS Vita exclusive, and it’s remained one of the most talked about and sought-after titles in the handheld’s catalogue. Arriving here in Remastered form, there are minimal quality of life changes, but the key thing is that the game is here to experience across a raft of modern platforms. That’s well worth celebrating, but it’s a shame that the team at Dimps didn’t take the chance to bring us a more modern interpretation of the game’s iconic gameplay to go alongside it.</p>
<p>Freedom Wars belongs to the Monster Hunter branch of the action-RPG genre’s family tree, its combat centring on taking down huge foes called Abductors with a team of other players – either real-life allies or AI controlled. You follow that up by collecting various parts and components from that fallen foe, and using them to upgrade and improve your weaponry, or turning them in to your Panopticon in a bid to bring that sentence further down.</p>


<p>In 2024, Freedom Wars Remastered is showing its age and its portable origins. While the technical improvements bring the game up to a 4K resolution and 60fps refresh rate, they don’t do anything for the clunky gameplay, and it feels incredibly stilted when you compare it to modern genre entries like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/23/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch/">Monster Hunter Rise</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/16/wild-hearts-review-ps5-pc-xbox-series-x/">Wild Hearts</a>, paling before the imminent arrival of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> next month.</p>
<p>While the use of your Thorn – a binding device that lets you pull enemies to their knees or climb up them to attack – still feels fun, it’s not as fluid as you’d want it to be, and though you can swap between two weapons on the fly – an idea that Monster Hunter is only just cribbing from – there are various annoying limitations like the questionable hit detection that wear on you the longer you spend with the game.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that Freedom Wars isn’t enjoyable. The far-flung future setting is one of Freedom Wars greatest strengths, and I love the overarching ideas and themes that push you to improve your character’s loadout, and their position within the Panopticon. The gameplay remains as solid as it was at release, and if you’re looking for a timesink while you wait for Monster Hunter Wilds, there are flashes of greatness through the game’s runtime that make it worth picking up.</p>
<p>It is a case of missed opportunity, though. The PC port has launched in an awful state, and while the first patches have improved things considerably, I wouldn’t expect to be experiencing any level of frame skipping in a basic remaster of a ten-year-old game. On top of that, the different graphical options are extremely limited, and you can’t make any changes to the frame rate whatsoever – surely this is a game that could run at 120Hz without breaking a sweat?</p>

<p>There is one addition that the remastering team have added, but it’s not necessarily an improvement. The original Japanese release of the game used text to speech for some of its AI-driven characters, as it made sense thematically, and was an impressive inclusion in a handheld title at the time. They’ve added that to the English dub this time around as well, and it’s fair to say that its decade-old synthesised speech will be an acquired taste for many. Various words are mispronounced in every single conversation with your Accessory or the Panopticon’s AI, and confusingly, you can’t even escape it by setting the voices to Japanese as these characters speak in English regardless.</p>

            <p>Superhero card game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> has been taken offline in the USA as part of the US government's ban-or-divest policy towards ByteDance, the Chinese company best known for owning and operating shortform video-streaming service TikTok.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347034/marvel-snap-banned-tiktok-bytedance">The Verge</a>, mobile players in the US lost access to the Marvel Snap app without warning last Saturday, 18th January. The game is still listed on Steam, but people are reporting that they can't log in. California-based developers Second Dinner have promised, however, that it'll be playable again in the States within 24 hours.</p>
<p>To briefly fill in the background, the US government have a bone to pick with ByteDance because they think the company's various online services are a national security risk. TikTok is, of course, a mammoth international hit, used by 170 million people in the USA alone. The US Senate and other lawmakers argue that the platform is a means for the Chinese state to harvest details about US citizens, while using TikTok's algorithms to influence their views. TikTok insist that they harbour no such agenda, arguing that they only store US user data outside China in Singapore.</p>
<p>In a bill passed by the US Congress back in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/13/house-passes-bill-that-could-lead-to-a-tiktok-ban-fight-shifts-to-the-senate.html">March 2024</a>, representatives finally ordered ByteDance to sell TikTok to a US-based company this month, or lose access to the entire US market. ByteDance have refused, taken the US government to court, and now suspended access to TikTok after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/17/tiktok-ban-upheld-users-lose-access-starting-sunday-22383788/">their appeal was denied by the Senate</a>. As part of that, Marvel Snap - whose publisher Nuverse is owned by ByteDance - has been given the cosh. This appears to be a more fleeting interruption, however.</p>
<p>"In a surprise to Second Dinner and our publisher Nuverse, MARVEL SNAP was affected by the takedown of TikTok late on Saturday, January 18th," reads <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821">a tweet from this Sunday</a>. </p>
<p>"We've been working around the clock to bring MARVEL SNAP back up in the U.S. and hope to have it back online within 24 hours," <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881154403333521795">reads another tweet from about eight hours ago</a>. "We'll update you once it's back up. In the meantime, global players should be able to continue to play with no issues."</p><p>Confusingly, other Nuverse games such as Ragnarok X: 3rd Anniversary and Earth: Revival - Deep Underground are still available on the US App Store, according to the Verge. I'm not sure whether Second Dinner or Nuverse will need to wrangle with the US government to resurrect Marvel Snap. Perhaps it's more of an accidental, administrative knock-on effect from the TikTok ban.</p>
<p>While the TikTok outage doesn't affect the games industry directly, it's obviously significant news for tech in general and a nasty blow for video game streamers. People have been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/treyq.bsky.social/post/3lfwv2f5vus2s">sorrowfully uploading</a> their best TikTok clips to other platforms.</p>
<p>Here's hoping you Marvel Snappers can resume snapping marvellously very soon. We've never reviewed the Steam edition, but Matt Cox (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-snap-will-speed-up-card-progression-on-january-31st">is/was a fan</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-6-xbox-series-s-x/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new ESRB rating suggests that Resident Evil 6 may soon be coming to current-generation consoles.</p>



<p>Spotted by X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/the_marmolade/status/1881276390076789246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Andrew Marmo</a>, the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40367/resident-evil-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ESRB rating</a> rates Resident Evil 6 for the Xbox Series S|X, with fans speculating that the game could come to the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>The rating reads, “This is a survival-horror game in which players assume the roles of several characters attempting to stop a viral outbreak. From a third-person perspective, players explore environments, solve puzzles, and battle zombies and mutated creatures. Players use pistols, machine guns, knives, and explosives to kill enemies. Combat is highlighted by cries of pain, realistic gunfire, and large blood-splatter effects. Some attacks result in dismemberment and/or decapitation.”</p>



<p>It continues, “Cutscenes depict further instances of violence and/or blood and gore: a zombie shot in the head, exposing bits of brain; a zombie stabbed in the head, close-up; characters killed by rotating fan blades and chainsaw-like blades. One mutated female boss is depicted nude, though without any discernible details (i.e., no nipples or genitalia). During the boss battle, this character can be seen caressing her breasts, gyrating and straddling another character. The word “f**k” appears in the game.”</p>



<p>Despite a rocky start to sales when the game first launched in 2012 due to a mixed reception, Resident Evil 6 has sold 13.8 million units as of September 2024. </p>



<p>As for when the next mainline entry into the Resident Evil franchise releases remains to be seen, but the last mainline entry was Resident Evil Village in 2021. </p>

<p>The App Store has been a great home for TikTok and many other apps over the years. However, TikTok users, and newcomers, are having difficulty with the social media platform on their phones. Let’s clear up any questions you have.</p>



<p>TikTok’s consistent and never-ending success will go down as one of the great stories. The social media platform has accrued billions (probably trillions) of views and continues to be downloaded every day. Its success is being tested by Joe Biden though. The 46th President of the United States <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/president-joe-biden-signs-bill-to-ban-tiktok-in-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed a bill to ban TikTok in the United States</a>.</p>



<p>It’s left TikTok and App Store users confused and could have dire consequences for the platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-download-tiktok-from-the-app-store-in-the-us">Can You Download TikTok From The App Store in the US?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Seems like a lifetime ago. Credit to TikTok</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>TikTok cannot be downloaded from the App Store in the US as Apple has pulled the platform from its storefront.</strong></p>



<p>Even though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-tiktok-back-up-who-brought-it-back-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok is back up</a>, you can only access it if <strong>you previously have it installed</strong>. Otherwise, United States-based Apple and Android users who don’t have TikTok installed can’t download it.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-tiktok-will-be-back-in-the-app-store">Do We Know When TikTok Will Be Back in The App Store?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, we don’t know when TikTok is coming back to the App Store as neither Apple, Donald Trump nor owner ByteDance has given a timeframe for its possible return.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re outside of the US, you’re fine, and TikTok is working as normal. I’m sorry to say that if you’re based in the US, you can’t download TikTok until something is done to remedy the situation. <strong>Donald Trump’s new tenure as president may include a partnership with TikTok, so there’s a possibility it won’t be gone from the store forever</strong>.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates on TikTok’s status in the App Store.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-tiktok-in-the-app-store">Why Isn’t TikTok in The App Store?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-tiktok-be-banned-us-and-when/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok was officially banned in the US</a> on January 19—<strong>this meant Apple had to pull the app from its App Store.</strong></p>



<p>It didn’t take long for the social media app to come back online. But despite Donald Trump’s best intentions to resume TikTok access, the legal regulations of Biden’s bill mean companies have to obey until further notice.</p>



<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apple’s support page</a> has a full rundown of why this is, and why they’ve pulled it.</p>



<p>“TikTok and ByteDance Ltd. apps are no longer available in the United States, and visitors to the United States might have limited access to features,” says Apple on their page, and explains, “Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including <strong>TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025</strong>.”</p>



<p>You’ll have to make do with Facebook, X, Instagram, Snapchat, and other social media apps for now. Again, work is going on to fully restore TikTok, and bring it back to all storefronts. We’ll keep you updated as we learn more.</p>



<hr>



<p>Did you have the foresight to keep TikTok installed on your phone? Or are you one of the unlucky ones locked out of TikTok for good?</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Snap has also been banned</a> due to the TikTok legislature. Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bytedance-ban-takedown-mobile-legends-bang-bang/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</a> fans are furious as it’s also succumbed to the bill as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-price-many-in-the-video-game-industry-hope-for-80-if-not-100-analyst-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There is “hope” among some within the video game industry that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will be priced between $80 and $100, one analyst has said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a wide-ranging presentation on the state of gaming in 2025</a>, Epyllion CEO Matthew Ball said Rockstar’s guaranteed mega-hit “could re-establish packed video game prices after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6, due out fall 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, is the long-awaited follow-up to 2013’s record-breaking GTA 5. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-projected-to-make-over-3-billion-in-its-first-year-on-sale">Analysts have projected it will make an eye-watering $3 billion in its first year on sale</a>, with $1 billion in pre-orders before it even launches. It seems likely that GTA 6 will be the biggest entertainment launch in history, with revenue ahead of any film.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how much will GTA 6 cost the gamer? Most triple-A video games cost $70 as standard after a $10 price hike that kicked in with the current generation of consoles in 2020. Could Rockstar and its parent company Take-Two use GTA 6 as an opportunity to go higher five years later?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In his report, Ball reported that “some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80 to $100, breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to do $70, $70 to $80 etc.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this price hike would certainly raise eyebrows with the video game audience, Ball argued that a $70 GTA 6 would be the “cheapest” GTA game ever released, in real terms. That is, when taking inflation into account. In real terms, $91 would be average, Ball said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Packaged game prices have never been lower in real terms than they are today — even though budgets are at all-time highs and player growth is stalled,” Ball said in the report. “GTA 6 could re-establish packed video game prices after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ball’s report has sparked a discussion about the value of video games and the likelihood that Rockstar would actually go through with an $80 to $100 price range for GTA 6. Reacting to Ball’s comment, Michael Douse, publishing director at Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1881030119793299652" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>: “You’re not supposed to say this out loud!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “A good company raises salaries in-line with inflation so that their staff don’t die or something, but games prices haven’t risen with inflation. This isn’t the reason the industry is in the shit for now, but it is an uncomfortable truth. On the other hand, the responsibility for a game developer is to make sure that the game they show lives up to that promise, and that investment from the player.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of burning questions when it comes to GTA 6, including how exactly Rockstar will package the release. With GTA 5, Rockstar threw in its mega money-spinner GTA Online for free. Will it do so again with GTA 6? Could the single-player portion of GTA 6 be sold for the standard $70, but if you want GTA Online as well it will cost you more? And what about the inevitable microtransactions? Will pricing for those in the new GTA Online rise as well?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/ballmatthew/status/1881068551265825001" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taking to social media to follow-up on his report</a>, Ball said he doesn’t actually think Rockstar will go to $100 with GTA 6, betting instead it will stick with $70 or at a push go for $80. “What I said is many in the market hope for $80 if not $99.99,” he clarified.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Might a price hike spark a backlash, though? “Can't really speculate on a game that is barely even revealed,” <a href="https://x.com/ballmatthew/status/1881071892557410389" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ball continued</a>. “But the $70 bump from $60 in 2020 (which bought under three years of inflation control) was pretty without issue.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever price GTA 6 ends up selling for, its huge projected revenue is up against similarly huge development costs, estimated from the high hundreds of millions to as much as $2 billion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-lot-riding-on-gta-6-and-not-just-for-rockstar-and-take-two"><u>There’s a lot riding on GTA 6, then, but not just for Take-Two and Rockstar</u></a>. In March last year, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella predicted Rockstar’s surefire hit would spark “renewed interest” in video games, before going one step further: “There's probably never been a more important thing to ever release in the industry, so no pressure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is the kind of game that will sell consoles, too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-likely-out-later-in-2024-analysts-say"><u>Sony’s PS5 Pro</u></a> will no doubt benefit greatly from interest in GTA 6, too. Let’s remember: GTA 6 is not coming out on PC at launch; to play you must own a PlayStation or an Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The almost guaranteed success of GTA 6 comes amid one of the toughest periods for the video game industry in recent memory. More than 33,000 people have lost their jobs since 2022, with huge layoffs at the likes of Microsoft and Sony. Indeed, Take-Two itself has suffered layoffs and studio closures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on Rockstar for a firm GTA 6 release date, or, as some are predicting, a delay into 2026. While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, the boss of Take-Two's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>It has been a year and a day since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> - a game that the internet dubbed 'Pokémon with guns' ahead of its early access release - burst onto the scene.</p>
<p>Pocketpair's creature catching survival game quickly became the first big mega-hit of 2024, surpassing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">2m concurrent players on Steam back in January</a>. It was only the second game to ever achieve this, the other being PUBG.</p>
<p>Now, as Palworld turns one, the team has outlined its plans for the game's second year, with a roadmap which includes co-op crossplay and an "ending scenario".</p>

<p>"We've been updating the game since the start of Early Access, and we'll continue to update Palworld as we prepare for the official release," Pocketpair shared in an update on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/596264277969469557">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>It then highlighted the following points heading to Palworld in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-op Crossplay</li>
<li>World Transfers for Pals</li>
<li>World Tree / Ending Scenario</li>
<li>Further ways to strengthen and improve Pals</li>
<li>Various new content such as new Pals and technologies</li>
<li>Game Collaborations (Including Terraria)</li>
<li>Improvements to world object placement</li>
<li>Improvements to base Pals</li>
<li>Improvements to optimisation</li>
<li>Improvements to UX</li>
</ul>
<p>"We look forward to your continued support for Palworld in its second year," the developer wrote, adding that the game's soundtrack is now available for free on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-ywFLxwu-k">Pocketpair YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>Following its monumental debut, Palworld's developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-signs-sony-deal-to-expand-franchise-beyond-video-games">founded a new company known as Palworld Entertainment</a> last year. This company is designed to "accelerate the multifaceted global development" of the game and the brand's further expansion.</p>
<p>It hasn't all been plain sailing for the Palworld team, however. Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a> back in September, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit is targeting three patents in particular. As part of an update in December, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As much as I'd like to dredge up an old RPS tradition and write "Severance is back!" repeatedly for 500 words, I'll resist the urge and instead just slide a nice free game over to your side of the table, hidden underneath an inconspicuous pile of photocopies. <a href="https://tydes.itch.io/lumon">Lumon by Mark Gomersall</a> is a free number clicker based the fourth best television show ever made (Succession, Hannibal, Scavenger's Reign, discuss). It's not a rip-roaring videogame time or anything, but it is cute. More importantly, it's topical. <em>More</em> importantly, it means I get to write "Severance is back!" a bunch. It's back! It is!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The idea here is that you colour match floating numbers with your mouse cursor before exporting them. It's neither challenging or exciting, but it is mildly meditative in the way that all highly repetitive drudgery is, and I imagine that's the point. The show's own macrodata refinement is itself a play on gamified busywork, complete with addictive-looking animated flourishes like a magnifying glass cursor and a satisfying crate-opening action. It's the archetypal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">bullshit job</a>, but with a lingering mystery to whether the data is actually significant in some way.</p>
<p>Lumon is the only game I've found that's a direct tribute to Severance, although there are a few others either inspired by the show or that inspired it directly.<a href="https://unnamedgamecompany.itch.io/fractured"> Fractured</a>, for one, is a TTRPG with a very similar concept. Creator Dan Erickson has also <a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/severance-apple-tv-plus-interview-dan-erickson-ben-stiller-adam-scott">spoken about</a> the direct influence of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> on the show. There are also approximately a scary number's worth of games based on creepypasta-adjacent Severance influence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms">The Backrooms</a>.</p>
<p>As for the show, I need to sit with the latest episode a bit more, but I did enjoy it. There's a fun echo of the idea of capitalism subsuming critique in Lumon making the team's uprising part of its own corporate legend. Also, the camera work was immaculate.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PocketPair is celebrating the first anniversary of its critter-based adventure, Palworld, and the developers have just released a new roadmap as part of the celebration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palword’s future roadmap has much to offer players, with new features like co-op cross-play and world transfers for pals coming soon. The developers also plan to introduce new final boss and ending scenarios and new ways to strengthen and enhance the existing pals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Palworld’s new roadmap also teases new collaborations and content. Players should expect more collaborations with other games in the future, along with their already-announced partnership with Terraria. The developers also aim to introduce new pals and technologies for players to try.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Palworld roadmap will focus on several different improvements. Players can expect improvements in world object placement, base Pals, optimisation, and UX.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the roadmap, Palworld developers have also released two more things. First is the <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1880978523315191821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">original soundtrack</a>, which can now be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-ywFLxwu-k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. Second, they are hosting a global popularity poll for Pals. Players can <span>now visit their&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.pocketpair.jp/en/202501" target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;to vote for their favourite among 180 pals and&nbsp;</span>their favourite faction leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pocketpair recently released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-developer-releases-overdungeon-for-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overdungeon on the Switch</a>. Also, learn more about their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-feybreak-update-introduces-meowmeow-from-terraria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terraria collaboration</a>, which was added during the Feybreak update. What are your thoughts on Palworld’s new roadmap?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

			<p>It's been a long time since we last covered Wuchang: Fallen Feathers. Chinese developer Lenzee Games&nbsp;has been largely quiet since its <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-beautiful-chinese-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 announcement</a> of the Soulslike action RPG, but the release date is finally approaching, and Chinese media and streamers have just published some new promising gameplay footage captured at 4K@60FPS.</p>
<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is set in the land of Shu during the late Ming Dynasty, during a time of war that is only worsened by a mysterious disease that spawns monstrous creatures. Players will become the titular Wuchang, a skilled pirate warrior stricken with amnesia who must explore this perilous land while suffering from the terrifying Feathering Disease.</p>
<p>During the game, players will upgrade Wuchang's arsenal and master new skills gathered from fallen enemies. The fighting style can be enhanced by sacrificing the elusive Red Mercury and developing new techniques picked up during the journey. Powerful enchantments to the weapons in Wuchang's arsenal can be added as well to tailor the player's favored combat style.</p>
<p>She'll go through forgotten temples, overgrown ruins and the like to face against grotesque abominations that draw on ancient Chinese lore. As the player and Wuchang piece together her lost memories, the choices will reportedly lead you to one of several endings, in a major change from usual Asian titles. The endings will be based on the decisions made, the secrets uncovered, and the allies chosen.</p>

<p>Leenzee Games, whose only prior project is the relatively unknown cyberpunk sci-fi VR interactive movie <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1523370/AD_2047/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A.D. 2047</a>, is promising a rich storyline, dynamic combat system, and stunning visuals, making for an unforgettable adventure.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, but Wuchang: Fallen Feathers should launch on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 5 later this year, published by 505 Games. It will also be available through Game Pass from day one.</p>

<p>TikTok’s final days in the US were counting down to zero. Long ago, it was announced the popular social media phenomenon was set to be banned in the United States. However, a last-minute change allows TikTok to work in the US again, and we know why.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/president-joe-biden-signs-bill-to-ban-tiktok-in-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Joe Biden signed a bill in April 2024</a> that would end TikTok’s usability in the US. January 19 saw the ban finally take effect, and as Biden planned, TikTok was no longer allowed in the US. The change would impact millions of users, and content creators, and make wholesale changes to the social media landscape.</p>



<p>This was the plan until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-is-already-starting-to-come-back-online-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok quickly came back online in the US</a>. Many wonder how the app is online despite President Biden’s decree, so let’s explain.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-brought-tiktok-back-in-the-us">Who Brought TikTok Back in The US?</h2>



<p><strong>Future president Donald Trump is the reason TikTok is back in the United States.</strong></p>



<p>The former—and now forthcoming American leader—has made his TikTok thoughts clear. He doesn’t feel it should be banned and feels its profitability is too valuable to lose.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-tiktok-working-again">Why is TikTok Working Again?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>People need their quick-clip fix. Credit to TikTok</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>On January 19, Donald Trump indicated he would declare an executive order on Monday, January 20, to “extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect.”</strong></p>



<p>Trump posted a stern statement on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Truth Social</a>, asking companies to “not let TikTok stay dark!” He also made clear his intentions for Tikok, and how the <strong>social media platform’s existence in the US would be saved</strong>.</p>



<p>“I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security. The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113855616848696050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said Trump in his post</a>.</p>



<p>He adds that he wants the “United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.”&nbsp;This will “save TikTok” and “keep it in good hands.” Trump has proposed a joint venture between the US and TikTok and believes it’s “worth hundreds of billions of dollars – maybe trillions,” to the US.</p>



<p>Donald Trump officially becomes president again on January 20, and if the figure has his way, TikTok will likely remain online in the US for good. A joint venture allowing the US to benefit from TikTok seems to be better than no TikTok at all, and the turnaround could be a shrewd move and win over some of the United States public.</p>



<hr>



<p>Is TikTok being active in the US a good thing? Or were you relieved to see the social media platform be taken offline? Drop some comments down below to have your say on TikTok in the US.</p>



<p>It’s not only TikTok that’s been hit by the ban. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Snap was also down due to the TikTok Ban</a>, along with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bytedance-ban-takedown-mobile-legends-bang-bang/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</a>.</p>

            <p>
An annual report into the state of video games has raised eyebrows for suggesting Rockstar will sell the long-awaited behemoth that is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> for $100 - around £80.
</p>
<p>
The amount could be justified by the game's enormous budget and would fit with a similar move by GTA publisher Take-Two back at the start of the current console generation, when it helped lead the charge in raising game prices previously.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">report</a> - published by Matthew Ball of Epyllion - suggests there is "hope" within the wider video game industry that prices do rise closer to an average £80/$100 price point to reflect rising development costs.

In 2020, the launch of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S saw the average boxed game release shift upwards to around £70 here in the UK. Numerous big budget releases also offer premium editions priced even higher, with added in-game content, or early access dangled as an incentive.
</p><p>
But will it happen? Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad has offered another view, which is that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> has - and continues to - earn so much recurring revenue through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> that a higher price to play the game upfront isn't necessary.
</p>
<p>
"I'd be surprised if this happens," Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1881049643221746005">wrote</a> on X. "If anything Take-Two could afford to lower the price (they won't) to get more people in given how much they earn via GTA Online.
</p>
<p>
"Besides, you don't need to raise prices when a good chunk of pre-orders will be for a $100 SKU with bonuses anyway."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-comes-a-time-when-we-all-declare-the-war-is-over-former-playstation-studios-boss-shawn-layden-on-the-future-of-video-game-consoles">Eurogamer spoke with Shawn Layden, former chairman of PlayStation Worldwide Studios</a>, on the issue of ballooning game costs and what he believes should be done to bring prices down. 
</p>
<p>
"I'm afraid we've built AAA gaming into a kind of cathedral business, and it just can't grow any further," Layden said. "In fact, it's probably grown too far already."

		<p>The setting of a solar system war is a familiar setting, that’s been explored in various stories. Stories From Sol: The Gun Dog is a visual novel set in a universe where such a war has concluded. The allied front of the Martian Territories and the Jovian Unified Colony Fleet has defeated the oppressive Earth-based Solar Federation. Your character is a Jovian, meant to take part in a battle during the final days of the war, but your mech had engineering issues. Those issues lead to almost all of your squadron getting killed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stories from Sol: The Gun-Dog - Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4D9LXfAyAVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Stories From Sol: The Gun Dog opens aboard the Jovian Carrier JFS Kalyke. Your character, who you can name, is a fresh conscript who is trained as a pilot, but training has all been done in simulations and not in real-world situations. In this opening, your frame, aka mech, does not disengage from the Kalyke, leading to the aforementioned squadron wipe out. The game moves on from this opening to four years after the war, where your character is made a lieutenant following years of doing security detail, and is transferred to the JFS Gun Dog, a very small ship with a small crew.</p>


<p>Before you meet the crew you familiarise yourself with the gameplay screen, which has five options on the right hand side. Those options are move, use, look, talk and item. Look lets you observe surroundings and gain information about locations, use is for interacting with things in the rooms, item lets you see and use the items you are carrying. The talk button brings up who is available to talk and interact with. Later on, a function button is made available that gives access to your task list, a map of the ship allowing fast travel, and an info tab which gives background about items and the game’s lore. What I found a great design choice here was that when you clicked on a button there was a hefty clunk sound, providing satisfying feedback and playing into the retro design feel of Stories from Sol: The Gun Dog.</p>
<p>Stories from Sol: The Gun Dog looks green throughout, with the graphics fundamentally being different tones of that shade. It evokes the sense of playing on a retro handhold, and it mostly looks great. The function screen could be a bit better since the words on the options are blurred. Understandably, it is done to maintain that retro feel, but a modern touch here wouldn’t take away from the overall impact of the game’s look. Music is very good and maintains a retro feel that the game is going for. It has that sci-fi feel to it, while also feeding into that classic old-school gaming setup, while the music matches each scene I played through very well.</p>


<p>The crew of the Gun Dog include Cassandra, love interest of the main character who has also been assigned to the same ship after some playing around with admin. She is described as someone who jokes around a lot, and this is the reason why she doesn’t have her own ship command, though she is high-ranking in the hierarchy. Captain Bartermews, captain of the Gun Dog, appears to be quite laid back and you later find she has a bit of a drinking problem. Mackenzie Cathays, &nbsp;is the Chief Engineer and will go into lectures and tangents about various engineering theories and terms.</p>
<p>Dylan is the gunner, who spends much of his time in the gunner room, listening to albums. Seifer Rosarium is the ship doctor who doesn’t care much for patient confidentiality, while Cadet Dalton Grange is the junior engineer based in the hangar. There’s also Haru Rumney, pilot, and Hansen Crwys, only other survivor of the Kalyke squadron that was killed and former squadmate of your player character, who blames your character for that failed mission. The relationships and how they evolve will depend on your actions and decisions. Throughout Stories from Sol: The Gun Dog, you will face various decisions and choices, from how you deal with interpersonal conflict to bigger choices that will impact the whole crew.</p>

<p>What's interesting here though is the developer TeamKill Media's reasoning for keeping their game away from your desktop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/henry-cavills-good-but-hes-got-nothing-on-these-five-celebrity-pc-builds?view=comments">thinking telly</a>. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/01/code-violet-takes-aim-at-dinosaur-horror-in-june-on-ps5">Pushsquare</a>, Here's their <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1880780993813987541">post in full</a>:</p>
<p>"For those asking us about a PC version of Code Violet… the reason we are not bringing it to PC is we do not want anyone modding vulgar versions of the main character as well as other characters in the game. We hold our voice actresses and actors with high regard, as well as our artistic vision for the game and story and reject any form of destroying that with sexual mods. Making a joke out of our art and possibly tarnishing the reputation of our voice actresses and actors is not worth the extra money we can make."</p><p>I…don't know what to make of it, honestly. As far as reasoning goes, it isn't unprecedented. The talent agency for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judgment">Judgement</a> star Takuya Kimura <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-judgment-series-is-ending-over-pc-version-disag-1847271300">got in a tangle with SEGA</a> over not wanting to have the series ported to PC for similar reasons. In 2021,<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/cdpr-shuts-down-cyberpunk-mod-that-let-players-have-sex-with-keanu-reeves/"> CD Projekt shut down</a> a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077 </a>mod that reskinned a boneable joytoy to look like Keanu Reeves ("It's always nice when it's nice" was Reeves' own response.)</p>
<p>So, the wording of the tweet focusing on the actors might suggest a similar case of talent agency reticence to that of Judgement. And, hey, if this is genuinely a case of a developer sticking to their guns about their vision for their work to the point where it excludes an entire massive market, then fair play. They <em>probably</em> could have worded in such a way that doesn't suggest the entire PC owning market is a bunch of slavering boob goblins. But then again, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-mod-jimbos-big-naturals-is-a-lot-funnier-and-safer-for-work-than-it-sounds">Jimbo's Big Naturals</a> suggests otherwise.</p>
<p>Teamkill previously released dino FPS <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3200540/Son_and_Bone/">Son and Bone</a> to Steam. The only mod I could find was <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/sonandbone?tab=latest">this one</a>, which removes the splash screen. Maybe they're just really, really proud of Code Violet's splash screen?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This weekend’s round of Call of Duty League matches unfolded in a typical fashion, with the teams that you’d expect walking away with their heads held high. Toronto Ultra is the only organisation to remain unbeaten during the Major I qualifiers, and Atlanta FaZe is still trying to claw its way up the standings after a miserable season opening.</p>



<p>One team that shone this weekend was OpTic Texas, which now sits on a 5-1 record for the stage after punishing LA Thieves and the Vegas Falcons this weekend. The match against LAT was something special.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-record-you-want">Not The Record You Want</h2>



<p>The OpTic Texas v. LA Thieves fixture was nothing short of chaotic, opening with OpTic 100-clubbing LAT in a round of Hardpoint on Hacienda. During this match, LAT’s Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst secured a record he’s probably not too proud of. He became the first player in Call of Duty League history to land less than 1000 damage on a single round of HP.</p>



<p>By the time the dust had settled, he’d produced a kill-death ratio of 6 – 19, marking his place in history with one of the worst performances since the CDL debuted in 2020. </p>



<p>He took it in jest, though:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Map 1. 6 kills, 750 dmg. 10 miles ran.</span></p></article></div>







<p>As the match unfolded, it looked as though the LA Thieves found their footing and secured wins in the first round of Search and the game of Control, but OpTic Texas held firm. The second Hardpoint, which took place on Skyline, was a relatively easy win for OpTic, and during game five, something monumental occurred.</p>



<p>From a 5 – 1 lead, LAT crumbled, being reverse-swept by OpTic Texas. In the final round, Kenny clutched a 1v2 finish that was nothing short of spectacular, netting the win and the much-needed COD points that almost guarantee a top seed for the team at Major I.</p>



<p>We’ve got one more regular weekend of CDL action before Major I arrives. It’s the first CDL Major to take place in Europe, and it’ll unravel in Madrid from January 30 to February 2.</p>



<p>I’ll be on location for the whole weekend with Insider Gaming – so keep an eye open for the hottest coverage from the CDL.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-series-of-warzone-players-haven%E2%80%99t-received-their-winnings-four-months-later.1086687/</guid>

<p>The World Series of Warzone Global Finals unravelled in Las Vegas in September 2024, with hundreds of thousands of people tuning in to catch the battle royale action unfold. As the biggest tournament in the Warzone space, it naturally attracts the most prolific competitors, and it bears a $950,000 prize pool.</p>



<p>Recently, a claim surfaced on social media from Biffle, the Team Falcons player who was part of the trio that won the Global Finals. The group scooped a $300,000 prize, but according to Biffle, ‘around 20 people’ (including him) still haven’t been paid more than four months later.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-debt-owed">A Debt Owed</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/DiazBiffle/status/1881038922114879847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Biffle wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Its been 4 months since WSOW and there is probably around 20 people that haven’t been paid out that I know of (including my $100,000). No one is answering the email that was provided to us for WSOW support. Completely unacceptable and unprofessional.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Biffle, Soka, and Shifty claimed the $300,000 prize at the World Series of Warzone Global Finals just two months after winning the top prize in the Warzone category at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>For a while, there have been concerns regarding Activision’s stance on battle royale-based esports events, and for a few months, it has seemed like the scene is wavering and perhaps preparing to fade away. Presently, nobody has any idea what this year’s competitive ecosystem looks like for the World Series of Warzone.</p>



<p>Biffle has gone public with his concerns, and rightly so. To be missing out on a $100,000 payment is ludicrous, and it shows a lack of integrity that could forever mar Activision’s competitive Warzone ecosystem.</p>



<p>In a follow-up comment, UnRationaL, who secured the second-place spot behind Biffle’s team, said that he’s still waiting on a $53,000 payment.</p>



<p>There are no indications that the Call of Duty League teams have their payments held for so long when they win a Major or COD Champs, so why is Warzone being forgotten about by Activision and Microsoft?</p>

After a series of events during spring break, Yuri meets Kikuramikami no Hime, the guardian of a mystical relic in the woods near his school. She explains the strained history between humans and the Tayutai, a mythical race sealed within the relic due to their potential threat to humanity.

            <title><![CDATA[What A Stupid Journey That Was]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/tiktok-ban-trump-bytedance</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-a-stupid-journey-that-was.1086576/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tiktok-ban-trump-bytedance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’ve had better things to do than follow internet drama on a Saturday night, let me catch you up: TikTok went offline Saturday evening, with parent company ByteDance praising Trump. This afternoon, it came back, with parent company ByteDance praising Trump. This is how embarrassing things are going to be for the next four years.</p><p>On Saturday, TikTok users were met with an in-app <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/herbscribner.bsky.social/post/3lg2x5nmdrc2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">message</a> announcing that the app was unavailable and reading in part, “We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned.” Users didn’t have to stay tuned long, or even wait for Trump to actually take office; today, the company <a href="https://x.com/TikTokPolicy/status/1881030712188346459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>,</p><blockquote><p>In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><strong>(Update 4:10pm-- </strong>Users are also seeing Trump thanked in their now-functioning app, with a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/phillewis.bsky.social/post/3lg4k6ulsos2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">message</a> reading "As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.! You can continue to create, share, and discover all the things you love on TikTok."<strong>)</strong></p><p>While Google and Apple did in fact remove TikTok from their stores (alongside, to many players’ surprise, mobile game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/511299/marvel-snap-down-bytedance-tiktok-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Marvel Snap</em></a>, which is published by a ByteDance subsidiary), no one seemed particularly keen on enforcing the rule, which required ByteDance to shut TikTok down in the US when it didn’t find a US buyer for the app by January 19. A White House <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-administration-trump-implement-tiktok-ban-rcna188155" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> on Friday noted that “actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration.” On <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tiktok-ban-sunday-what-to-know-rcna188256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saturday</a>, the White House added that “We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday;” Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-likely-give-tiktok-90-day-extension-avoid-ban-rcna188258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that day that he would likely issue a 90-day extension on the sale deadline once he took office. The initial idea to ban TikTok was actually <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-technology-foreign-policy-politics-business-1f636191b0b9e28c7041fb64fb547801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump’s idea </a>back in 2020, though some Republicans seem to be doing their best to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/numb.comfortab.ly/post/3lg4lnplmg226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memory-hole</a> all that.</p><p>Basically, no one really had to do anything here, and yet a lot of things happened, or felt like they happened. It’s the perfect situation for Trump: a lot of chaos and high emotion, with lots of fingers to point and credit to claim. Regular people faced losing something that matters to them; those who haven’t been closely following the whole <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-timeline-ban-biden-india-d3219a32de913f8083612e71ecf1f428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long journey</a> to this moment might be easily convinced that it’s the cruel fault of Biden and the Democrats, who can be cast as out-of-touch elites who have been consistently letting them down. (It doesn’t help that this is, to some extent, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/188333/democrats-break-status-quo-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">true</a>.) Trump could throw around bombastic rhetoric and big promises, aided by companies <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/18/trump-washington-return-inauguration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kissing his ring</a> and parroting his talking points. Neither Trump nor ByteDance did this for the good of everyday TikTok users, but it could <em>feel</em> like a win for them; they get to go back to finding <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/19/tiktok-ban-important-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community</a> and making dance videos, while Trump gets to boost his image and ByteDance, like every other big company, gets to curry favor with his administration. Trump has even been able to tie his inauguration proceedings into TikTok’s return, writing on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113855616848696050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TruthSocial</a> that “Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations.”</p><p>The only thing more embarrassing than having to live through all this is if it actually works, if Trump comes out of this weekend having tricked even one more regular person into thinking he's on their side. I understand why some people would <em>want</em> to believe this narrative, and I understand why the last four years might make them susceptible to it. But hopefully even more people will see it as a warning for how much more bullshit is headed our way, a reminder of how clear-eyed we'll need to be to resist politicians and companies punting us around in their self-serving football game.&nbsp;</p><p>Republicans are<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-johnson-2-gop-senators-break-trump-tiktok-extension-rcna188307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> already bickering</a> over it all, with Speaker Johnson claiming he’ll uphold the ban and several Republicans praising “Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft for following the law.” Maybe we’ll at least get some funny TikToks out of whatever happens next.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-hamlet-review"><h3>Grand Theft Hamlet Is A Funny, Touching Take On Shakespeare</h3></a><p>‘We’re putting on a play inside a game, but the game is a kind of play, because we’re playing’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-elon-musk-asmongold-twitch-path-of-exile"><h3>Elon Musk Has Once Again Revealed That He’s A Fraud, This Time By Beefing With A Twitch Streamer</h3></a><p>"He needs to believe, for his own sake, that it’s possible for him to jump into the deep end of anything and excel"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-trump"><h3>What Games Journalism Can Do Now</h3></a><p>Readers, and fellow journalists, are going to need what games journalists know in the face of the upcoming administration</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A Sims fan reckons they've stumbled upon evidence of unannounced MySims games.</p>
<p>According to redditor OyeDiego, pages for the MySims Action Bundle and MySims Beacon Bay briefly popped up on the EA app over the weekend, although neither bundle has been previously confirmed by publisher EA.</p>
<p>To bolster the claim, the poster included a screen recording of what they saw.</p>

<p>"It did not leave [sic] me pre-order them, so I saved them to my wish list. Today I couldn't find the games by searching for them, but they were still in my list. But Beacon Bay was causing the app to break. However, the Action Bundle was still intact.</p>
<p>"When I completely restarted the app, both games disappeared from my wishlist and I couldn't find them anymore."</p>

</span></p><p>Whilst the OP was unable to assuage all cynics that the video was genuinely taken of the EA App, one poster <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/comments/1i3u3op/comment/m7q85zx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> in their defence: "I work as a developer. It would be a lot of work to create an EA app clone just to provide both unfinished pages and 500 error codes. Like, it would take a lot to mimic the UI and setup of the app just for bait.</p>
<p>"I don't see any reason as to why this wouldn’t be real - and the hypothetical response of removing the post kind of pushes people away from wanting to post here over Twitter."</p>
<p>Other fans hypothesise that the action bundle reads as though it's Agents and Skyheroes, whilst <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Beacon_Bay">Beacon Bay</a> is a throwback that only players of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a> on Nintendo DS may remember, and could well be a brand-new MySims game.</p><p>Is the video real? Who knows. But with TheSims' 25th anniversary coming up, it's certainly plausible that a bundle of older and fan-favourite games could be on the way. We've reached out to EA and will let you know as and when we know more.</p>
<p>Talking of the 25th anniversary, all that kicks off on 4th February with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-marking-series-25th-anniversary-with-huge-free-update-adding-70-new-items">"huge" free The Sims 4 update introducing over 70+ new items</a> spanning both Create a Sim and Build Buy modes. There's talk of turtlenecks and bodysuits, bike shorts, accessories, and hairdos. New furnishings, meanwhile, include "stylish" windows and doors, wood finishes for kitchen cabinets, and even a new playground pirate ship.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>At CES 2025, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyxXRXDtcPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Bryan Catanzaro, VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, about the announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a> and&nbsp;its many improvements to Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Frame Generation.</p>
<p>Catanzaro talked about the new transformer models that are replacing CNN (convolutional neural networks) for Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction. These are simply much smarter, can be trained on larger datasets and make better choices as a result, improving historic NVIDIA DLSS shortcomings like shimmering or ghosting. The new Super Resolution model, for instance, has four times more compute compared to the previous one. Catanzaro didn't provide an estimate on how much more rendering time it will cost, but he did say NVIDIA believes it's the best way to play on the new Blackwell-powered GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards that are launching later this month.</p>
<p>Frame Generation is also being overhauled, abandoning the previous model based on the Optical Flow hardware accelerator for an entirely AI-powered solution. Here's why NVIDIA is doing that:</p>
<p><em>When we built NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation, we absolutely needed hardware acceleration to compute Optical Flow. We didn't have enough Tensor Cores and we didn't have an Optical Flow algorithm that was good enough. We hadn't developed a real-time Optical Flow algorithm that ran on Tensor Cores that could fit our compute budget. We had the Optical Flow accelerator, which NVIDIA had been building for years as an evolution of our video encoder technology, and it's also been a part of our automotive computer vision acceleration for self-driving cars.</em></p>
<p><em>It made sense for us to use that for NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation. But the difficult part about any sort of hardware implementation of an algorithm like Optical Flow is that it's really difficult to improve it. It is kind of what it is and the failures that arose from that hardware Optical Flow, we couldn't undo them with a smarter neural network until we decided to just replace it and go with a fully AI-based solution, so that's what we've done for Frame Generation in DLSS 4.</em></p>
<p>The new Frame Generation model is heavier on Tensor Cores, but it uses less VRAM, offers improved image quality (which Catanzaro deemed critical, especially for the new Multi Frame Generation available on the new RTX 50 GPUs), and is also more efficient as the cost has been amortized over multiple frames.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>DF's Alex Battaglia asked then whether the new model could be ported to older hardware like the GeForce RTX 30 Series, and the head of NVIDIA DLSS didn't close that door.</p>
<p><em>I think this is primarily a question of optimization and also engineering and then the ultimate user experience. We're launching this Frame Generation, the best Multi Frame Generation technology, with the 50 Series, and we'll see what we're able to squeeze out of older hardware in the future.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, when NVIDIA introduced Frame Generation with the GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards, Catanzaro himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-engineer-says-dlss-3-on-older-rtx-gpus-could-theoretically-happen-teases-rtx-i-o-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that the feature was exclusive to then-new GPUs because they had a much improved Optical Flow hardware accelerator than the RTX 30 Series. Back then, he also said it was theoretically possible to port it to older hardware, although it probably wouldn't be as beneficial.</p>
<p>With the new model removing the Optical Flow hardware accelerator, it seems like the door might be open for that to happen. However, Catanzaro also said the Tensor Core requirements are higher, and obviously, the older GPU architecture has worse Tensor Core performance. We'll see if NVIDIA can really make it happen.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Bryan Catanzaro highlighted the importance of decoupling the updated flip metering from the CPU to reduce frame time variability (and, therefore, improve frame pacing) by a factor of five to ten compared to before. Last but not least, he claimed that playing a game with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reflex 2</a> (which is also AI-based) feels much more 'connected' and he believes that especially latency-sensitive gamers will love it.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more NVIDIA DLSS 4 coverage on Wccftech as we get closer to the launch of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>

                <p>Marvel Snap was made unavailable in the US shortly after the TikTok ban went into effect on January 19.
