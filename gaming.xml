He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A lot of <em>Polygon</em>’s staff was laid off following Vox Media’s sale of the publication to Valnet, but two of its former guides writers are launching their own guides-focused website: <em>Big Friendly Guide</em>, which you can find at <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/">bigfriendly.guide</a>. Ryan Gilliam and Jeffrey Parkin founded and are co-owners of the site.</p><p>Guides make Gilliam “feel like I’m helping someone enjoy something that’s very important to me and I know is important to them,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “And so when I lost the opportunity to do that at my usual 9-to-5, I wanted to continue it.”</p><p>“I hate sounding immodest or bragging, but what Ryan and I got really good at was helping people play video games,” Parkin says. Their work on guides helps people have fun with games, he adds — and assists with things like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-guide/23728443/giant-white-stallion-horse-god-find-tame">getting a giant horse in <em>Zelda</em></a>.</p><p><em>Big Friendly Guide</em> will make most of its content available for free, and the guides themselves won’t be paywalled. But Gilliam and Parkin will also be opening a Patreon for the site as a way for people to support the work, which will also give people access to a Discord. There will be a weekly podcast that’s free for everyone and a monthly subscriber-only podcast where Gilliam and Parkin will discuss their coverage plans.</p><p>There will be ads on the site to start. “For now, at least, we’ll run ads to keep the lights on,” according to the site’s <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/about-us/">About Us page</a>.) But the focus is more on building a community that trusts Gilliam and Parkin’s work and pays to support it. In addition to working on guides for games that interest them, Gilliam and Parkin want the community to make suggestions for guides that they can consider and respond to.</p><p>The release of <em>Big Friendly Guide</em> is just the latest outlet from <em>Polygon</em> staffers: former editor-in-chief Chris Plante launched <a href="https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-award-that-changes-the-lives">the <em>Post Games</em> podcast</a> and former curation editor Pete Volk launched <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/petevolk.bsky.social/post/3lootykftkk2v">the <em>PV Guide</em> newsletter</a>. The new outlets follow the rise of other indie gaming publications like <a href="https://aftermath.site/author/nicole-carpenter"><em>Aftermath</em></a> and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview"><em>Game File</em></a>.</p><p>With <em>Big Friendly Guide</em>, Gilliam and Parkin have modest expectations. “We’re not looking to build a brand and sell it or anything,” Parkin says. “I don’t think either of us want to get particularly rich. We want to keep doing this. That’s really what it comes down to.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This obviously applies to Stonesword Keys as well, meaning your chances of grabbing one in an expedition can feel like a stroke of luck. </p><p>However, the good news is that there are a few locations you can aim for that have a higher drop rate for this coveted item. We’re not talking a 100-percent drop rate here, but they drop frequently enough from these points of interest to be worth visiting.</p><figure id="" data-id="0709920492f24e8f9f37cdc8e5a6c9a5" data-recommend-id="image://0709920492f24e8f9f37cdc8e5a6c9a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A knight stands before a closed chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A knight stands before a closed chest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0709920492f24e8f9f37cdc8e5a6c9a5" data-recommend-id="image://0709920492f24e8f9f37cdc8e5a6c9a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A knight stands before a closed chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here are some good locations to find Stonesword Keys:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Small Castles</strong>: There are usually a few small castles on the map that can be cleared easily. They’ll sometimes have an Abductor Virgin enemy on the base level, but will more often have a quick and simple fight against a knight boss at the top. Behind the boss will be a chest that you can open, which has a good chance of containing a Stonesword Key.</li><li><strong>Medium Castles</strong>: You’ll also sometimes find medium-sized castles that are gated off and require you to enter via the sewers at the very bottom of the structure. Here, you can make your way up the wooden stairs inside to find a room halfway up containing a group of enemies. A side room here has a chest that may contain a Stonesword Key.</li><li><strong>Ruined Cathedrals</strong>: Not to be confused with the small cathedrals where you find flask upgrades, ruined cathedrals are large, broken structures that are hard to miss. You’ll encounter basic enemies here, as well as a boss located either near the altar or by dropping down a hole in the center. Bosses aside, just defeat any nearby foes and check behind the altar in the center of the cathedral for a chest that has a solid chance of dropping a Stonesword Key for you.</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to track down some extra Stonesword Keys, get out there and beat some ass at the gaols. Just don’t be surprised if one day you open up a gaol and get a whole lot more than you bargained for…ut that’s a discussion for another day!</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Since then, we've heard very little until <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-remembers-splinter-cell-exists-by-adding-steam-achievements-to-a-12-year-old-game"><u>Ubisoft remembered Splinter Cell existed by adding Steam achievements to a 12-year-old game just a couple of weeks ago</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If we're honest, today's tease doesn't provide much more information — we've got a close-up of Sam Fisher's face and a hashtag, Splinter Cell — but interestingly, the alt description is a little more revealing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Close-up of Sam Fisher from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-chaos-theory">Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</a>, showing a stern expression with focused eyes, short dark hair, and a rugged beard, set against a blurred high-tech background," the description explains.

We still don't know very much about it other than the new version will be built from the ground up using the advanced Snowdrop engine.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-30-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Destined Rivals is officially here, and boy, it’s already a bloodbath. From the stunning Cynthia’s Roserade to the menacing Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex, prices on chase cards have been crashing faster than you can say “preorder regret.”. Let's not even start on the folks who shelled out over a grand for an ETB.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond Destined Rivals, the Pokémon TCG scene is a minefield. Prismatic Evolutions and Pokémon Trading Card Game Classic are still absurdly overpriced at big-box stores, while TCGPlayer remains the go-to for cheaper singles and sealed products. Meanwhile, the MTG Marvel’s Spider-Man and Final Fantasy sets are prepped to drain wallets, and SteelSeries gear is still on sale for anyone wanting to upgrade their gaming setup. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Need a killer Borderlands collectible? That Psycho and Claptrap Diorama from the IGN Store is calling your name. And let’s not forget about the Elebase USB-C Adapters (a must-have for your messy cable life) or the Anker USB-C Cables for fast charging. Oh, and if you’re up for some gaming on the cheap, the Xbox Game Studios Bundle on Humble is stacked with hits like Wasteland 3 and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Let’s get into it.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Launches Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you'd like to pay for sealed product in this climate to rip open boosters and find your chase card, go mad and have a blast. But if you'd like to save some money long term and guarantee that chase card, TCG Player has Destined Rivals single cards available right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">. It's insane how much this set has already crashed on release day, with some chase cards crashing beyond 50% since yesterday. Looking for the best market values on Destined Rivals sealed products instead? I've got you covered with crashing prices on sealed product. Imagine being the one person in the world who paid over $1000 for a Pokémon Center Elite Trainer box? Madness:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG Stock Update</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Long story short; things are looking bleak at retail for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> right now. Almost everything is way above MSRP and seems to becoming the new normal for big box retailers. I could write a whole article and why this is and what should be done to stop this practice, but here we are. If you have your heart set on opening booster packs, have at it, but you might want to check out the sections below to save money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TCG Player Has The Same Products For Less</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">TCG Player and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG</a> secondary collectors market is significantly cheaper than big box retailers at the time of writing. This will likely be the case unless you can secure preorders on new sets such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-destined-rivals-expansion-unboxing#:~:text=Destined%20Rivals%20is%20the%20kind,building%20it%20around%20a%20character.">Destined Rivals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a>. Make no mistake products are still over MSRP, but If small businesses can undercut large retailers on TCG Player, there's something fundamentally broken in the supplier-distributor-retail chain.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Pokémon TCG Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Single <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-destined-rivals-expansion-unboxing">Pokémon TCG</a> market on the other hand is going through a grand reset right now, which is down to a few factors. The crypto bro mentally to reselling products is dying down a little and more product is becoming available thanks to reprints. We're not out of the woods yet by any means, but this weeks <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-19">Crashers and Climbers</a> show recent cards going down in price and cards from the X and Y era shooting up in value. We're 100% moving in the right direction.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Marvel's Spider-Man Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst there's only the Play Booster Box and Scene Bundle for MTG: Marvel's Spider-Man live on Amazon right now, TCG Player has every sealed product that will hit the market on launch day. I've even found some pricing on cases of sealed product for those looking to rip open a tonne of boosters, so get on it before the market value on these products shoot up.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Spider-Man Single Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunatley there's no listings for Spider-Man single cards right now considering we're a few months out from release, but I've managed to round up the listings for cards currently sitting on TCG Player waiting for presale allocations, so keep your eyes peeled.</p><p id="mtg-final-fantasy-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG FInal Fantasy Bundle">MTG Final Fantasy Bundle Walmart Preorder</h2></p><div catalogid="840f5339-ee1a-4f4f-9923-f0b63792a061" id="221751"><div id="221751" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MTG FInal Fantasy Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the only preorder I can find from a big box retailer this morning, and it's actually cheaper than the market value over on TCG Player right now. Imagine that? If you're planning on picking up Final Fantasy at launch, this is a no-brainer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Final Fantasy TCG Player Preorders</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">MTG: Final Fantasy</a> is set to be the biggest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-your-first-look-at-over-a-dozen-new-cards-from-magic-the-gatherings-upcoming-final-fantasy-set">Magic: The Gathering</a> set ever, which is a shock to absolutley no-one. Preorders are drying up at retail, but there's plenty of choice available on TCG Player right now. I've found all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-preorder-restock-latest-amazon">preorders</a> listed so far (including prerelease boxes) alongside massive cases on booster displays. Don't sleep on these preorders, MTG FF is going to fly off the shelves on release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Final Fantasy Single Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The single card market for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-spoiler-amano-matsuda">MTG Final Fantasy</a> is flying right now, so I've included over 40 of (in my opinion) the most popular Final Fantasy cards collectors and players will be chasing once packs start getting ripped. Don't want to spend money on boosters and hope? Secure your chase cards for release day instead.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">SteelSeries Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has a solid sale going on right now for a bunch of SteelSeries gear, and if you’ve been waiting for a good excuse to upgrade your gaming setup, this is it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/two-more-persona-4-actors-have-said-theyre-not-returning-for-an-unannounced-persona-4-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, we don't know if there's going to be a remake of Persona 4. But if there <em>was</em> such a thing, we know now at least three of the original voice actors aren't coming back for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Yosuke Hanamura voice actor Yuri Lowenthal took to BlueSky to say he would not be reprising his role for "the Persona 4 remake." You know, the one that no one's officially announced yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake," said Lowenthal in a since-deleted post. "I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, two more actors from the original game have spoken up, saying they won't reprise their roles. Two days ago, Erin Fitzgerald, the English voice of Chie Satonaka, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erinfitzgerald.bsky.social/post/3lqbi6257w22d" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said she hadn't been asked to come back</a>. And then just yesterday, Amanda Winn Lee chimed in to say she wasn't coming back as Yukiko Amagi:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Since, I've had several people ask me: No, I wasn't asked to voice Yukiko in the P4 remake</p>— Amanda Winn Lee (@amandawinnlee) <a href="https://twitter.com/amandawinnlee/status/1928242559685472293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">All these comments are leading Persona fans to suspect that maybe there <em>is</em> actually a Persona 4 remake coming imminently. There have been rumors to this tune bubbling up over the last year, with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-a-new-domain-discovery-is-getting-persona-4-fans-excited-for-a-possible-remake">recent domain registration</a> fueling hope that its announcement might be coming soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, assuming a Persona 4 remake is real, it's unclear why the beloved actors who originated the voices of these characters haven't been asked back. One possibility is that it's related to the ongoing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-says-publishers-ai-measures-are-dangerously-incomplete-as-video-game-members-go-on-strike">SAG-AFTRA voice actor strike</a>. Another is that this is simply what developer Atlus does, for cost or other reasons. After all, it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-trailer-reveals-party-members-new-english-voices">recast the English voices for Persona 3: Reload, including Lowenthal</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, some fans have another, zanier theory: that this is all a marketing stunt. As one fan noted on Twitter/X, the voice actors announcing they're not in the remake have made these statements in the exact order you recruit them to your party in Persona 4: Yosuke, Chie, Yukiko. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This is definitely a marketing stunt</p><p>First Yosuke<br>Then Chie<br>Now Yukiko</p><p>They're talking in order of who joins the party in p4. They're definitely in P4 remake. <a href="https://t.co/GesYoNva4O" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/GesYoNva4O</a></p></div>— Re (@Reismyname2) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reismyname2/status/1928278638480290199?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">A few people on social media have taken it further, suggesting that if either Troy Baker or Matt Mercer (both of whom have played Kanji Tatsumi at different times) announces they're not in the remake next, that all but confirms that all four actors actually<em> are</em> in the remake. It sounds nuts, but given that Persona 4 deals with themes of rejection and acceptance of one's true self, it's not totally off-base. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1kyve8t/comment/mv1e5wa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One suggestion</a> is that the original actors will actually be voicing the Shadow versions of their original characters, effectively making their original statements true... if misleading. All that said, most fans seem to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1kyve8t/interesting_theory_surrounding_the_p4g_vas/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find this theory a bit too wild</a>. It's more likely that Atlus simply recast everyone for whatever reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With so much smoke around a Persona 4 remake, hopefully we'll get an official announcement soon that will clear it all up. Perhaps at Summer Game Fest or the Xbox showcase next week?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Developed by Levine's new studio, Ghost Story Games, Judas was almost immediately labeled as "BioShock in space" by fans. But as the game's launch draws closer, it's become clear that although Judas certainly draws inspiration from the series that made Levine a household name, it's not just BioShock with a futuristic coat of paint. Judas has its own identity.</span></p><p dir="ltr">While the details are still relatively sparse, trailers, preview events, and developer interviews have painted a much clearer picture of what players can expect from Levine's latest creation. If you're interested in decoding this enigmatic RPG, keep scrolling for a breakdown of everything we know about Judas, from plot details to gameplay features and everything in between.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_does_Judas_launch_">When does Judas launch?</h2><p dir="ltr">Judas was originally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-creators-new-game-will-release-by-march-2025/1100-6511235/">slated for a March 2025 launch</a>, but March came and went without a peep from Levine and the developers at Ghost Story Games.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, there is no official release date for Judas. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/388860/Judas/" rel="nofollow ">game's Steam page</a> lists its release date as "coming soon." In a recent earnings report, <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/9a22a038-45bc-48df-8391-07705b355877" rel="nofollow ">Take-Two listed the game's launch date</a> as "to be announced."</p><h2 id="What_platforms_is_Judas_releasing_on_">What platforms is Judas releasing on?</h2><p dir="ltr">Judas will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><h2 id="What_is_Judas_about_">What is Judas about?</h2><p dir="ltr">The game's description on Steam reads, "A disintegrating starship. A desperate escape plan. You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke--or will you leave it to burn?"</p><p dir="ltr">Players will be stepping into the shoes of the aforementioned troubled protagonist, Judas. Judas is a woman who appears to live and work on a spaceship called The Mayflower. The Mayflower has recently suffered some sort of disaster, one that--based on the game's description--Judas herself is at least partially responsible for. Many areas of the ship have broken off, depressurized, or caught on fire, and the goal is clear: Survive, no matter the cost.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504185-hope.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504185-hope.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504185"></a><figcaption>It seems that most (if not all) of the Mayflower's inhabitants are robotically augmented.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504185-hope.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Based on the protagonist's biblical name, it's likely that betrayal is a major theme in the game's narrative, though it's not entirely clear if Judas herself is the betrayer or the one who has been betrayed. Interestingly, the game's trailers feature several shots of injured androids who look identical to humans with the exception of a glowing green circle on the back of their hands.</p><p dir="ltr">"The ship is… dying," a visibly injured Judas declares in the game's announcement trailer. "And my only way out of here is with one of <em>them."</em></p><p dir="ltr">Judas herself may, in fact, be an android, as gameplay footage shows her sporting the glowing green circle on the back of one hand and shooting Plasmid-like powers out of it. It's also possible Judas is actually a human who has been robotically augmented, a la Cyberpunk 2077's protagonist, V. But if that's the case, Judas has been <em>very</em> heavily augmented--another trailer clip shows her finishing off an enemy while floating around outside the damaged Mayflower … without any sort of suit to protect her body from the vacuum of open space.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504186-judas1979.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504186-judas1979.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504186"></a><figcaption>A calendar reveals the year is 1979, while text on the left side of the screen suggests Judas herself may be an AI-controlled robot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504186-judas1979.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Time travel may also be a theme in the game's narrative, as another trailer features a quick jump-cut in which Judas can be seen near a wall calendar indicating that the year is 1979. This could also be an illusion, however, as some of Judas's statements in the trailer suggest that the game takes place in a world where thoughts are recorded by a Big Brother-esque entity, and false memories can be implanted into the station's robotically augmented inhabitants, Westworld-style.</p><p dir="ltr">Other shots in the game's trailers reference "The Big Three," a trio of characters who once controlled The Mayflower. The Big Three is made up of Hope, a young woman with pink hair and a childlike aesthetic; Nefertiti, a woman with strange mechanical abilities and an affinity for fashion; and Tom, a middle-aged man in a cowboy hat. It appears that these three characters are Judas's enemies, and players may have to choose which one Judas escapes the ship with.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm here to set you free," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-judas-trailer-at-state-of-play-shows-off-bioshock-like-combat/1100-6520723/">Judas states in one trailer</a> as she presses a button, ignoring the computer terminal's warnings that doing so will cause a catastrophic failure. "Whether you like it or not."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504183-big3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504183" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504183-big3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504183"></a><figcaption>Prior to the disaster, The Big Three seemed to be quite popular with The Mayflower's inhabitants.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504183-big3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game's trailers indicate it's expected to receive an M rating. According to the ESRB, M-rated games are "generally suitable for ages 17 and up," but "may contain intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content and/or strong language."</p><h2 id="Judas_gameplay_details">Judas gameplay details</h2><p dir="ltr">While "BioShock in space" is a great elevator pitch, what we've seen from the game so far suggests that Judas is far from a BioShock clone. Yes, it's a narrative-driven first-person shooter RPG from the guy who made BioShock, and thus bears some resemblance to the BioShock series. But Judas also differs from Levine's previous work in many ways.</p><p dir="ltr">One notable difference between Judas and the BioShock series is the fact that Judas is a procedurally generated roguelite.</p><p dir="ltr">"We call it pseudo-procedural because it's not like Minecraft where everything's being generated off a set of pure mathematical heuristics," Levine <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-successor-judas-is-a-procedurally-generated-roguelite/1100-6522180/">explained in an interview</a>. "You build all these smaller piece elements in the game and then you teach the game how to make good levels essentially, and [a] good story, and most importantly, [make it] reactive to what you do."</p><p dir="ltr">The Big Three appear to Judas as holograms, and her relationship with each of them will play a major role in the game's narrative. Doing a favor for one member of The Big Three will increase their affinity for Judas, but is likely to displease at least one of the other two members, and anger comes with consequences. If Judas upsets one member, they may get back at her by ratting her out to another member by revealing her plans or current location. It's clear that Judas' story design--especially when it comes to player choices--goes much deeper than BioShock's <em>very</em> binary "Will you save the Little Sisters, or are you a complete sociopath?" narrative choice.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504184-judashands.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504184" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504184-judashands.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4504184"></a><figcaption>Judas can open the strange implant on her left hand to swap out abilities. When the hatch closes, it glows green.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4504184-judashands.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for the game's "roguelite" elements, Levine says that death is an integral part of the game. Items that allow Judas to regain health are scarce, and enemies are everywhere.</p><p dir="ltr">"You do have the opportunity when you die to go change yourself," Levine says. "Improve yourself, change your tool chest--which is a pretty broad and variable tool chest--and change the Mayflower itself."</p><p dir="ltr">For more information on Judas's gameplay, check out GameSpot senior producer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/what-exactly-is-judas-spot-on/2300-6463749/">Lucy James' breakdown of the game</a>, which she played for five hours at a preview event in 2024.</p><h2 id="Judas_trailers">Judas trailers</h2><p dir="ltr">Check out all the trailers for Judas below.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Judas reveal trailer:</strong></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSrgezyVfF4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hSrgezyVfF4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Judas story trailer:</strong></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_r-un--bA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T5_r-un--bA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Though Judas is far from a BioShock clone, it still proudly bears the hallmarks of Levine's previous work: a dystopian setting, Plasmid-esque powers, and off-the-wall set pieces like a gigantic robotic dog that Judas boards like a Bathysphere.</p><p dir="ltr">What do you think of Judas's gameplay elements and narrative premise?

The engine upgrade from Unreal Engine 4 is part of a number of new changes coming to the shooter over the coming months, including a replay system in September.</p><p><em>Valorant </em>has been running on Unreal Engine 4 since a beta of the game originally released in 2020, and Riot Games has been using Unreal 4 for more than 10 years to build the game. The upgrade to Unreal 5 will arrive with patch 11.02 at the end of July, and Riot is promising it shouldn’t disrupt gameplay.</p><p>The game’s overall look and feel should be similar, and Riot says the engine upgrade will improve framerate performance and make patch downloads faster in the future. It’ll be interesting to see what else this engine upgrade unlocks, particularly whether Riot will improve character models and animations in the future. <em>Valorant </em>players that log in while patch 11.02 is live will get a special gun buddy to commemorate the upgrade.</p><p>The second big upgrade coming to <em>Valorant </em>later this year is the long-requested replay system. It will arrive on PC first with patch 11.06 in September, followed by a release on console later this year. The replay system will let you analyze recently played competitive games at launch, and Riot is looking at adding more modes later.</p><p>The replay system should help players report cheating or bad player behavior in <em>Valorant</em>, and Riot is also adding multi-factor authentication to the game to help with smurfing in the competitive modes — where higher ranked players log into accounts to boost them. You’ll also soon be able to report accounts that are abusing rank or matchmaking.</p><p><em>Valorant</em>’s upcoming 11.0 patch later this month will also add a new map to the game, and it will be available in the competitive mode on day one. During the initial patch cycle of two weeks, rank rating (RR) losses on this new map will be cut by 50 percent while <em>Valorant </em>players get used to playing this new map.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Two of the most notable things about it are its director, longtime Rockstar Games producer and <em>Grand Theft Auto 5 </em>lead designer Leslie Benzies, and just how exceptionally little fanfare there’s been around its impending launch. A third is that <em>MindsEye</em> will feature its own spin on Roblox-style user-generated content, which Benzies hopes will be a big part of the game’s decade-spanning growth plan. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,197559,195922" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“[The studio] will support the game through Play.MindsEye, with continuous new content,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-leslie-benzies-interview-mindseye-everywhere-and-the-double-edged-sword-of-gta&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-leslie-benzies-interview-mindseye-everywhere-and-the-double-edged-sword-of-gta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he told<em> GamesIndustry.biz</em></a></span>, referring to the space where a stream of studio-made add-ons for the game will be hosted, not to be confused with Build.MindsEye, the toolset with which players will make their own new worlds and experiences. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-leslie-benzies-interview-mindseye-everywhere-and-the-double-edged-sword-of-gta&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-leslie-benzies-interview-mindseye-everywhere-and-the-double-edged-sword-of-gta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This big interview</a></span> comes less than two weeks out from <em>MindsEye</em>’s June 10 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. “Some of the content, like races, are made just for fun.

It’s not clear how exactly, and Benzies is cagey about the details in his<em> GamesIndustry.biz </em>interview, but it sounds an awful lot like Roblox-style exploitation is part of the model.</p><p>“We have plans to add multiplayer, [and] we have plans to make a full open world,” he said. “And of course, we’ve also got to look at what players are creating, and incorporate that into our plans. Given the ease of the tools, we think there’s going to be a high percentage of players who will jump in and give it a pop, see how it feels. Hopefully some will create compelling content we can then promote and make that part of our plans to push to other players.”</p><p>I, too, hope “some will create compelling content,” and by “some” I mean the team at Build A Rocket Boy, which is selling a $60 game and a paid premium pass required to access some of the additional post-launch content. Elsewhere in the interview, Benzies talks about the spectrum of crafting in games, saying he hopes the building tools will be somewhere in the middle between <em>Roblox </em>(hard but expansive) and <em>Minecraft</em> (easy but simple). Epic recently announced it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-22/epic-games-fortnite-based-roblox-killer-still-has-a-way-to-go&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-22/epic-games-fortnite-based-roblox-killer-still-has-a-way-to-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paid out over $300 million</a></span> to people making stuff in <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><p>“The dream from the building side is to allow players the opportunity to create their own multiplayer open world games with ease,” Benzies told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>. “So anyone could pick up the game, jump in, drive around, stop at a point where they see something of interest, build a little mission, jump back in the car, drive again, build another mission. Once you’ve built a couple of hundred of these, you’ve built your own open world game. So, that’s the build side.”</p><p>Those are lofty goals for a brand-new game from a first-time studio. If the underlying game can deliver something solid, maybe there’s a chance, but if not, I don’t think the promise of user-generated content will be enough to bail <em>MindsEye</em> out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Executor is one of the six default classes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, and it's unlocked automatically for all players after they complete the tutorial. If you've played previous From Software games, especially Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, then you'll immediately recognize the gameplay the Executor utilizes to defeat its foes.</p><p>However, this also means the Executor features a fairly high skill ceiling, requiring players to understand all of its abilities and strengths to use properly. Below, we'll go over the Executor class in its entirety and offer the best build for it in Elden Ring Nightreign. Make sure to also check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-nightreign-classes-and-tier-list/2900-6624/" data-ref-id="2900-6624">class tier list for Nightreign</a> to see exactly where the Executor falls compared to the other classes.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Executor_class_overview_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Executor class overview in Elden Ring Nightreign</a><ul><li><a href="#Passive_Ability__Tenacity">Passive Ability: Tenacity</a></li><li><a href="#Character_Skill__Suncatcher">Character Skill: Suncatcher</a></li><li><a href="#Ultimate_Art__Aspects_of_the_Crucible">Ultimate Art: Aspects of the Crucible</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_Relics_for_the_Executor_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Best Relics for the Executor in Elden Ring Nightreign</a><ul><li><a href="#Old_Pocketwatch">Old Pocketwatch</a></li><li><a href="#Golden_Sprout">Golden Sprout</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="Executor_class_overview_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Executor class overview in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>The Executor is a close-range melee class in Nightreign that uses a katana by default. The class focuses on swift and deadly attacks with the sword to deal massive amounts of damage up close to any enemy. The primary skill for the Executor is Dexterity, as you'll rely on your weapon speed and accuracy to inflict a majority of your damage.</p><p>However, the Executor isn't considered a tanky class, so you also need to dodge and parry enemy attacks to keep your character healthy. Fortunately, the Executor excels when parrying as long as you can predict the timing of your enemy's moves. If you can't get off a parry, then the Executor still has decent stamina to be able to dodge multiple times to get out of trouble.</p><p>You'll find that the Executor can deal some of the most damage out of any class in Nightreign, but you'll have to get extremely close to enemies to inflict that damage. As such, you'll often be at the center of attention when fighting a boss one-on-one, so you need to master attack timing and parrying to be effective with the Executor. Of course, you could also pair it with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-raider-class-guide/1100-6531927/" data-ref-id="1100-6531927">Raider class</a>, which is the primary tank class in Nightreign that can take some of the attention off you as the Executor.</p><p>Overall, the Executor is a high-damage class that is able to take away chunks of health from enemies, but you need to make sure you also play defensively, as you'll be spending a ton of time up close and personal with enemies and bosses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504148-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.16.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504148" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504148-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.16.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504148"></a><figcaption>The Executor's abilities in Elden Ring Nightreign</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504148-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.16.36.png"></figure><p>Of course, you'll want to master the different abilities for the Executor as well, which you see below:</p><h3 id="Passive_Ability__Tenacity">Passive Ability: Tenacity</h3><ul><li>Receive boost after recovering from status ailments.</li></ul><p>This passive ability doesn't come into play too often, but when it does, you're extremely thankful it's there. Acquiring a boost when you run through some flowers to relieve you of a status ailment is great for a boss fight that follows, and you can use this to your advantage as well.</p><h3 id="Character_Skill__Suncatcher">Character Skill: Suncatcher</h3><ul><li>Draw a cursed sword that can deflect enemy attacks.</li></ul><p>This is one of the best character skills in Elden Ring Nightreign, as the Executor is able to wield a huge sword that is terrific for parrying attacks and minimizing any damage you take when fighting up close with an enemy.</p><h3 id="Ultimate_Art__Aspects_of_the_Crucible">Ultimate Art: Aspects of the Crucible</h3><ul><li>Assume the form of the primordial beast.</li></ul><p>When the Aspects of the Crucible ultimate art is activated, you turn into a large wolf-like creature that can tower over most bosses in the game. The form doesn't last overly long, but you can inflict a large amount of damage and cover a ton of ground when the ability is active.</p><h2 id="Best_Relics_for_the_Executor_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Best Relics for the Executor in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>Now that we've briefly gone over the Executor's play style and abilities, it's time to tackle the Relics that you'll want to use for the class. As we mentioned before, the Executor's primary skill is Dexterity, meaning that you'll want to focus on Relics that improve that skill either directly or indirectly. However, you also want Relics that boost your defenses or sword attack power. If you're confused about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-relics-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531727/" data-ref-id="1100-6531727">Relics work in Nightreign</a>, we have a full guide that covers everything about them.</p><p>We'll go over a couple of the key Relics for the Executor below.</p><h3 id="Old_Pocketwatch">Old Pocketwatch</h3><p>The Old Pocketwatch is a Relic you receive for defeating the first expedition boss in Nightreign, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-tricephalos-boss-guide-how-to-beat-gladius/1100-6531888/" data-ref-id="1100-6531888">Tricephalos</a>. It's the main way you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-duchess-class-guide/1100-6531950/" data-ref-id="1100-6531950">unlock the Duchess class</a>, and while the Old Pocketwatch is intended for that class as a Relic, it's also quite useful for the Executor.</p><p>The Old Pocketwatch grants FP restoration for successive attacks and gives a +3 boost to Dexterity. As long as you're using a weapon like the katana during your runs, you'll make tremendous use of this Relic. If you have the default Executor Urn equipped, though, you won't be able to use the Old Pocketwatch as a Relic, as there's no green Relic Rite slot. However, you can purchase the Executor's Goblet from the Small Jar Bazaar for 1,200 Murk, which comes with red, blue, and green Relic Rite slots. The Old Pocketwatch can slide right into the green slot once you defeat the Tricephalos.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504147-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.32.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504147" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504147-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.32.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504147"></a><figcaption>Purchasing the Executor's Goblet from the Small Jar Bazaar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504147-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.32.93.png"></figure><h3 id="Golden_Sprout">Golden Sprout</h3><p>Next, you want to unlock and equip the Golden Sprout Relic. You unlock this Relic through the Executor's Remembrance quest in Nightreign, and it can slide into the red Relic Rite slot if you're using the Executor's Goblet.</p><p>The Golden Sprout Relic features three abilities, and they are:</p><ul><li>Slowly restore HP for self and nearby allies when HP is low</li><li>Roaring restores HP while Art is active</li><li><p>HP Recovery From Successful Guarding</p></li></ul><p>All three of these Relic boosts come in extremely clutch when using the Executor. Not only do you get a bonus for successfully playing defensively, but you also receive free HP restoration during your ultimate art and while your HP is low. This pairs nicely with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-more-healing-flask-charges-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531698/" data-ref-id="1100-6531698">increasing your Healing Flask Charges</a>, which you want to do throughout expeditions to maximize your HP restoration. </p><p>That does it for our Executor class guide in Elden Ring Nightreign.

			<p>We know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest</a> will have plenty of announcements, reveals, and special looks at upcoming games, and we can add another to the list as Kojima Productions has confirmed that Hideo Kojima will join Geoff Keighley on the Summger Game Fest mainstage to host a Death Stranding 2: On the Beach 'game premiere' presentation on Sunday, June 8.</p>
<p>It'll go live at 7pm PT / 10pm ET, and per the current Summer Game Fest <a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/events">schedule</a>, it'll be the weekend's final event to close out this year's SGF. According to a press release, it'll be the start of a "<em>world tour</em>" for Death Stranding 2 that will lead up to the launch, and keep going all the way into November of this year.</p>
<p>As far as what the presentation will show, the press release adds that it will be an "<em>exclusive look</em>" at the game, and that there will be other special guests joining Kojima and Keighley on stage. It doesn't go into who these guests will be, but a good bet would be that the core cast of the game will join Kojima and Keighley on stage.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of where the Death Stranding 2 tour will go, and when the tour will be making its stop:</p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-US">8th June - Los Angeles&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-US">14th June - Sydney&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-US">26th June - Tokyo&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-US">28th June - Paris&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-US">30th June - London&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-US">4th July - Seoul&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-US">6th July - Taipei&nbsp;</span></li>

<li><span lang="EN-US">October - Sao Paulo&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-US">November - Lucca&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the details for the tour have yet to be revealed, with the Kojima Productions <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/death-stranding-world-strand-tour-2?dm_i=74N0,2ARDF,2EYVRT,6HFOC,1#m-scroll-target">website</a> saying, "<em>Additional details about each stop on the tour will be revealed soon.</em>"</p>

The microSD card you used in your original Switch or Switch Lite will offer limited functionality with Nintendo’s new handheld, as it will only let you view screenshots or video clips you captured previously — that’s it.</p><p>That’s because Nintendo opted for a significantly faster spec in its new handheld console, which boasts an advertised 4.4x improvement in terms of transfer speeds over the microSD cards you might already have lying around. That improvement is signified by a small, easy-to-miss “EX” emblem etched onto the front of the card.</p><p>What’s harder to miss is how much more expensive Express cards are, with some costing more than $50 for just 256GB of storage. The Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards up to 2TB in size, although 1TB is the largest capacity widely available (that’s an overstatement, as many are sold out currently), with some cards selling for up to $200 a pop. Phew. I suppose it makes sense that they’re pricier since they’re classified as bonafide PCIe NVMe SSDs by the <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/pdf/SD_Cards_8_0_WhitePaper20200515.pdf">SD Association</a>. Walmart’s Onn label is a beacon of light, as its microSD Express cards are significantly cheaper than the competition, with its <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FONN-MICRO-SD-EXPRESS%2F15708762625" rel="sponsored">512GB model costing $65.88</a> when it’s in stock.</p><p>Thankfully, since the Switch 2 has 256GB of built-in storage, you most likely won’t need a microSD Express card immediately upon receiving your console. Getting a microSD card was a rite of passage with the original Switch since all versions, aside from the newer OLED edition that launched in 2021, came with just 32GB.</p><p>If you’re in the market for one of these pricier storage expansion cards ahead of the console’s launch, we’ve listed the available options below.</p><div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->60</span></p><div><p>Available to pre-order, launching June 5th.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->55</span></p><div><p>Available to pre-order, launching June 5th.</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yooka-Laylee developers Playtonic are laying off staff across their operations, as they wrestle with what they call “a period of profound change in how games are created and financed”. It’s not clear what these "profound changes" are, exactly – soaring budgets? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/todays-new-games-struggle-because-evergreen-hits-like-fortnite-pull-players-towards-them-at-all-times-says-former-bioware-gm">Evergreen service games drinking up all the oxygen</a>? Falling interest in the genre of mascot platformer Playtonic are best known for? Either way, the outcome is that a bunch of artists, game designers, narrative designers, producers and UI or UX people are now looking for work.

"We've all seen in recent years how the games industry has been changing, resulting in studio after studio finding themselves in situations where to continue to exist, they must make painful decisions - decisions that impact the lives of so many individual talented developers," reads a statement on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:cszak2dnc6gpo7ui2zm7ot7b/post/3lqfaiuogjk2c?ref_src=embed">social media</a>. "This isn't a reflection of anyone's talent or dedication, the people leaving have poured so much heart, creativity, and care into everything we do.”

Playtonic brand manager Anni Valkama has shared a list of departing staff on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aeevalkama_it-is-with-a-heavy-heart-that-i-now-share-activity-7333856671506563075-16fP/?rcm=ACoAAAVvKbEB4BSwtr1FhSqcqk72HAWxOtwQlK0">LinkedIn</a>. “Whether you are hiring yourself, your company is hiring or you know someone that is hiring, these are some of the best artists, designers, producers, and writer[s] you could have on your team,” she wrote.
</p>
<p>
In their social media statement, Playtonic further comment that “this isn’t simply a difficult moment” and that “the landscape is shifting, and with it, so must we.” All of which is slightly more sensitively worded than say, Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">“aligning”</a> 1900 jobs into the sun, or Take-Two’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-take-two-cancel-games-and-lay-off-hundreds-to-rationalize-their-pipeline">“rationalizing” away livelihoods by the fistful</a>, but doesn’t answer many questions.
</p>
<p>
Playtonic were founded in 2014 by former members of Rare. Their first game, a dual-character hop'n'bopper, harkened back convincingly to the glory days of Banjo Kazooie, but didn’t set my world alight as a reviewer. Their subsequent 2.5D Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair found a warmer reception, however, and in 2021 they launched a publishing division, Playtonic Friends, partnering with projects such as Demon Tides and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bpm-bullets-per-minute">BPM: Bullets Per Minute</a>. Tencent bought a minority stake in Playtonic later that year. 
</p>
<p>
2020-2021 was a boom period for the games industry at large, thanks to a whole lot of us playing games at home during the pandemic lockdowns. Many publishers expanded to meet the demand, and were left up the creek when the lockdowns ended and the cash ceased to flow in sufficient quantities for their investors. This, at least, is the increasingly worn-out elevator summary I woozily mutter to myself as I try to scroll to the bottom of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">our layoffs feed</a>. I’d like Playtonic to say more about why these layoffs were necessary.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/switch-2-xbox-playstation-exclusivity<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is on the way, and the question on everybody's minds is <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo-president-says-the-switch-2s-lower-than-expected-sales-forecast-is-due-to-its-high-price-not-us-tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how much</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it'll</a> <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/04/24/companies/nintendo-switch-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell</a>. It makes sense that its success matters to the press, business analysts, or anybody with a social media account: the Switch 2 feels like the only video game console left, the last effort of a product that, once at the core of a whole industry, is now slowly being phased out.</p><p>Yes, there are other consoles still on the market. We have the PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series X and S, and a host of handheld devices like the Steam Deck and retro emulation consoles. Sony launched a high-end version of the PS5 just last year along with a cloud streaming handheld, while Xbox is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-handheld-photos-leak-showing-off-asus-made-project-kennan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working on its own handheld</a>. Video game hardware isn't going anywhere. As long as there are video games, people will make devices that can play them.</p><p>People will keep buying them too. I have every current-generation console in my home, and we will somehow obtain a Nintendo Switch 2 to squeeze into our entertainment center. I'll switch between my PC, Xbox Series S, and PS5, playing one of the hundreds of indies in my backlog with a mouse and keyboard on my PC before heading upstairs to truly enjoy <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition's 33</em>’s gorgeous graphics on the PS5. When I go to bed, I'll pull out my Razer Kishi controller and attach it to my phone to play something through Steam Link because I can't afford a Steam Deck.&nbsp;</p><p>I know this console-laden experience isn't universal. I live in a house with another video games journalist; we can justify buying consoles because we can write off these purchases on our taxes. But I wonder if this will be the last generation where we will get every new console. When friends who aren't in video games ask me about whether they should finally get an Xbox or a PlayStation, I often answer with a shrug. I tell them to spend more money and get a decent gaming PC, or get a Switch. Which device matters less in a world where video game consoles are being replaced by cloud streaming, subscription services, and a world where the console makers themselves have other interests.</p><h2><strong>They're too expensive</strong></h2><p>There's usually some sticker shock when a new video game console is revealed, but there was a lot of it when the Nintendo Switch 2's price was announced at $450. We all assumed it was going to be higher than the Switch 1's $300 price tag, but a $150 jump felt huge for a Nintendo console that, for the first time, didn't change much from its predecessor. The price also makes the Switch 2 more expensive than the cheapest Steam Deck, and only $50 cheaper than the base PS5 on sale right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That sticker shock only got worse thanks to the Trump administration, which <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/liberation-day-trump-tariffs-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced its dreaded Liberation Day tariffs</a> the same day the Switch 2 was announced. Nintendo understandably <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed U.S. preorders</a> that same week, but that only made people more anxious for a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/industry-analysts-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-chaos-due-to-tariffs-we-are-living-in-unhinged-times" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential price hike</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And that was before we started getting price hikes across the video game industry in response to the Trump administration's tariffs. In May, <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft announced</a> that it was not only raising the prices of its consoles by up to $100, but that Xbox accessories and games were also about to be more expensive. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666584/sony-earnings-tariffs-ps5-price-us-manufacturing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony is also considering a price increase</a> of its PS5 consoles, although it <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already raised the price in multiple regions</a> this year and has been slowly <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/sony-dualsense-controller-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasing the cost of its accessories</a>. Sony blamed the most recent price hikes on "high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates." Xbox just noted "market conditions and the rising cost of development."&nbsp;</p><p>The tariffs are a good short-term explanation for these price hikes, but they also come on top of just how poorly many of us seem to be doing financially. A new report recently revealed that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cost-of-living-income-quality-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most Americans can't afford basic costs of living</a>, and wages have not kept up with inflation over decades. Beyond video games, things are just getting more expensive across the board, making the Switch 2's price tag more eye-popping for many people. Even if a $450 Switch 2 or an $80 game was an inevitability <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/cost-of-gaming-since-1970s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to inflation</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/former-playstation-boss-blames-aaa-production-costs-for-usd80-games-says-titles-with-tighter-teams-like-clair-obscur-could-be-the-way-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rising development budgets</a>, them finally becoming a reality couldn't have come at a worse time.</p><p>But video game consoles have always been major purchases, and price has always been a huge factor in whether they sell. There are a lot of reasons why the PlayStation 4 "won" the war against the Xbox One at the start of its generation, but the major one was its price. Former Sony CEO Jack Tretton was able to go on stage, reveal that the PS4 would be $100 cheaper than the Xbox One, and drop the mic, knowing that the number would be enough to sway a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/15/23306068/microsoft-xbox-one-sales-lifetime-versus-ps4-sales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole lot of players</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa noted in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250509e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Q&amp;A</a> that he expects the Switch 2 to sell somewhat conservatively due to its high price (although Nintendo predicts it will still <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/08/nintendo-forecasts-sales-of-15-million-units-for-switch-2-console.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">millions of units</a>), and that the company will have to figure out new ways to keep it selling past launch, including software updates and selling game bundles. The company also seems to think that the Switch 2 justifies its price. In an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553517/price-interview-tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with Polygon</a>, Bill Trinen, vice president of player and product experience at Nintendo, said that the tariffs and inflation weren't the only factors in the console's price; it has some hardware upgrades, like mouse controls, that "add more value."</p><p>All the economic turmoil isn't ultimately going to matter to Nintendo; regardless of price, the anticipation of a new Nintendo console after eight years is plenty to sell this thing. But there's also the fact that this is a <em>Nintendo</em> console--there's brand recognition and loyalty there, but there's also the promise that you'll get Nintendo games like the new <em>Mario Kart World</em> and eventually something like a new Zelda. It's the only console left where exclusivity really matters.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How can hardware matter when software is king</strong></h2><p>Years ago, I wrote that this console generation wouldn't be defined by stunning graphics, hardware improvements, or teraflops<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/ps5-xbox-series-x-console-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">; it's about services</a>. While Xbox kicked off the current generation's marketing cycle with a tech demo for <em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</em>, its priorities have since shifted to Xbox Game Pass and Cloud Gaming. Technology gains have stagnated considerably, to the point where Sony and Microsoft couldn't tout photorealistic graphics or processing power as much as they could with previous generations. There has to be something else.</p><p>Microsoft has decided that Xbox isn't just your console anymore, it's "Xbox Everywhere." You don't even <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-marketing-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">need</a> an Xbox console to play these days. All you need is the app, which now works on things like your <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2390368/from-today-hundreds-of-xbox-games-playable-on-firetv-heres-how-it-works.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fire TV</a> or through a browser on your mobile device. It's not a perfect experience by any means; latency is still terrible when you play through Cloud Gaming, but that doesn't matter too much unless you're playing an online multiplayer game. Before I canceled my Game Pass subscription, I was able to play <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> on my phone while I was at my parents' place over the holidays. There were some frame rate drops and lag, but it was good enough.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony's subscription service PlayStation Plus isn't as high profile as Xbox's, but it's about as robust, with multiple tiers of new and classic games that change up every month. If you pay for the PlayStation Premium tier, you also get cloud streaming, which, combined with a handheld like the <a href="https://aftermath.site/chiaki-chiaki4deck-moonlight-playstation-portal-sunshine-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Portal</a>, means you're on the way to playing PlayStation games sans PS5.&nbsp;</p><p>Even beyond subscriptions, the money is in the games themselves. As Xbox head Phil Spencer told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a>, "the software part of the business is an easier part of the business to grow and scale." There's a reason Xbox has been building its stable of first-party studios, alongside ones it’s acquired like ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard. Xbox was particularly excited about <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-phil-spencer-says-xbox-needs-to-be-relevant-on-mobile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solidly entering mobile</a> thanks to <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> maker King, and after dealing with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-signed-a-binding-agreement-to-keep-call-of-duty-on-playstation-after-its-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential Call or Duty exclusivity battle with Sony</a>, started using the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/activision-blizzard-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"everywhere" messaging</a> once the acquisition was complete. Why care about selling a fancy box when you can sell multiple games per year across platforms, along with a subscription to, as Xbox says, "<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/10/15/one-year-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wherever [players] play</a>?"</p><p>This move has been controversial, to say the least, among Xbox fanboys. As annoying as the exclusivity discourse has been over the past couple decades and how these console manufacturers have capitalized on it, it is one of the key factors that goes into figuring out which console to buy. Do you have brand loyalty to Xbox because of Halo, or are you more into the single-player experiences you'd get from Sony’s God of War? Or are you just going to keep playing Pokémon games until the end of time? That might be the only thing that sways your buying decision.&nbsp;</p><p>But we’ve finally been seeing the end of exclusivity and arbitrary tribalism as a marketing tactic. Xbox has started putting many of its first-party titles onto other platforms like <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-playstation-ps5-exclusivity-indiana-jones-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a>. It started with smaller titles like <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, but <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> and <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> are giant exclusive releases that are now on PS5. You don't need a PS5 to play PlayStation Studios exclusives anymore either, as they increasingly head to PC or sometimes even launch on both platforms simultaneously, as was the case with <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/blaseball-helldivers-2-joel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helldivers 2</a></em> and <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a></em> (RIP). It's even more streamlined for Xbox, where first-party titles always launch on both console and PC. By some accounts, this tactic has not hurt Xbox's bottom line. <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/104226/xbox-games-take-over-global-playstation-store-pre-order-charts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox games are doing extremely well on the PlayStation Store</a>, and why wouldn't they? Xbox is offering critically acclaimed games to even more people. Of course they’re going to sell.&nbsp;</p><p>The only place where exclusivity still matters is Nintendo. You will never be able to play the new Mario Party on your PC (minus any means that will get you sued into oblivion), and there's no way <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> will ever make its way to Xbox.</p><p>So as long as you're willing to wait, you can play most of a given year's big games on just one device and a Switch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>There are too many console alternatives</strong></h2><p>Long before Xbox decided to put Game Pass on your phone or sell its games elsewhere, there were so many games on so many different platforms that you didn’t need a console much at all. You might not be able to play the specific game you want anywhere, but you can play <em>something</em> anywhere.</p><p>For one, there's your smartphone, which most people have. Despite how many people view mobile gaming as a world of free-to-play, microtransaction-laden slop (it's not, for the record), that market is gigantic. It's particularly huge in Asian markets, which&nbsp; can be attributed to a lot of factors — China banning consoles in the early 2000s, which allowed PC and eventually mobile gaming to flourish, and smartphones offering a lower-cost way to play games, as a start. All you need is a decent internet connection and you can start downloading games.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, there's PC. Despite the fact that PCs and PC parts are being hit with a lot of the same manufacturing and price issues as consoles, PC gaming seems to be doing better overall than console. <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a presentation</a> that went a little viral among the press and business types earlier this year, Matthew Ball shows that the amount of games on PC has been growing since 2011, spurred on in part by <a href="https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/global-pc-gaming-hardware-market-forecast-to-surge-by-3.6-billion-in-2020-d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console shortages during the pandemic</a> and just more releases overall. This doesn't tell the full story, since <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/global-games-market-update-q1-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">firms like Newzoo</a> see PC leveling off but consoles continuing to decline, but Ball’s presentation makes the good point that PCs just have more utility.</p><p>Think about the PC as a multi-use device versus a console, which can only really be used for playing video games and watching media. While Steam dominates the PC distribution market, there are smaller storefronts like Epic, GOG, itch.io and more that add to the possible games you can play on PC. Why buy a separate box for playing games when you can access just about every game you could want to play on a device you also use for work?&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside PC comes handheld consoles, which allow you to specifically play PC games on the go. The Steam Deck continues to be at the top of the pack despite competition from Windows handhelds like Asus and Lenovo thanks to reasonable prices for the lower tier models and how much better SteamOS runs on a handheld than Windows. When you combine that with cloud streaming from Xbox and PC ports from Sony, Nintendo is still the only one of the Big Three that provides a reason for you to get its console. It's the thing that makes it "<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-says-it-will-overcome-challenges-of-generational-transition-with-unique-propositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unique</a>" in a multibillion-dollar industry.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Consoles don't have much time left</strong></h2><p>Video game consoles still have their place in our ecosystem, the biggest being that it's the easiest, most cost efficient way to play a lot of games. Sure, having a PC can streamline everything in your life beyond games, but if you want to just plug in a box and play a game with its expected quality and performance, then a console is the way to go. PCs are also getting more expensive thanks to inflation and tariffs, so I don't expect somebody's going to spend a couple thousand dollars on a computer if they can do what they want on a $500 console.&nbsp;</p><p>But consoles were dying long before tariffs came along to threaten the entire industry. With companies now relying on software and services rather than hardware and new products coming on the scene to fill a need consoles can't, it's no surprise that manufacturers seem to be moving away from them. Nintendo of course hasn't, but once the Switch 2 launch comes and goes, we'll see for sure what the console market really looks like.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of that future seems to be console-makers pegging their hopes on <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-games-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a>, a troubling indication of where we're at in 2025, when instead of marketing new technology or ecosystems to sell consoles, companies are looking at one game as the future. Meanwhile, Xbox and PlayStation are hoping you'll buy their games wherever you already are, instead of on their machines. The only standout is Nintendo, which is hoping you'll buy its console <em>and</em> its games, because you can’t have one without the other.&nbsp;</p><p>The video game industry has long been defined by machines. There have been console wars, infighting, countless articles on whether you should buy an Xbox or a PlayStation. Companies have risen and fallen on whether they can compete with the Big Three or if they chose one console over another for a game launch. There are people who have, for better or worse, based parts of their personalities on which company they like best. Many of us have to budget every few years to get a new machine to play new games. This is how it's been for decades, but that status quo is about to change.&nbsp;</p><p>I can't stress enough how much the Switch 2 is going to sell. There will be millions of Switch 2s shipped and likely shortages at most major retailers. People will complain about the price but still get the more expensive <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. But after that? We're in uncharted territory, likely one where consoles as we knew them are dead. That's going to change how we play games, whether we want it to or not.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract"><h3>Zenimax Union Reaches Tentative Contract With Microsoft</h3></a><p>The QA worker union has been bargaining for nearly two years</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs"><h3>Another Day, Another Round Of Layoffs At EA</h3></a><p>Black Panther is canceled, and workers (once again) suffer the consequences</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Former Rockstar developer Leslie Benzies is launching a new game, MindsEye, in June. Naturally, people are connecting the game to GTA, which Benzies worked on while at Rockstar. Benzies has now reacted to the phenomenon of people comparing MindsEye to GTA, saying it only makes sense, but also asking fans to judge MindsEye for what it is.</p><p>"There's always comparisons, and I think that's how humans work," Benzies told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-leslie-benzies-interview-mindseye-everywhere-and-the-double-edged-sword-of-gta" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>. "As kids, we're taught to put a triangle into a triangular hole, and a square into a square hole. I think we do that for the rest of our lives, and we like to describe something new as 'it's X plus Y, with a bit of Z in there'. It makes things easy for us. It's maybe humans optimizing the way we communicate."</p><p>These comparisons serve MindsEye and developer Build a Rocket Boy well in some respects and poorly in others, he said. To make his point, Benzies recalled a quote from musician Dave Grohl who said when he formed Foo Fighters that no one cared about the new band; they only cared about Grohl's previous band, Nirvana.</p><p>For MindsEye, Benzies said he hopes fans give the game a fair shake. "The guys have built something very cool, and I just hope people can see it for what it's trying to be," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Benzies said Build a Rocket Boy considered many different options for what would become MindsEye, but making a direct competitor to GTA was never the plan.</p><p>"I'm not sure it would've been smart as a company to say, 'We are going to compete with the biggest game on the planet.' I'm not sure that would be the best business decision to make," he said. "We went through a bunch of different designs, and to tell our story, this is what we landed on."</p><h2><strong>What is MindsEye?</strong></h2><p>So what is MindsEye? And how is it connected to Build a Rocket Boy's Everywhere? Benzies explained that MindsEye is "one story in an epic universe," with this story focusing on the character Jacob Diaz. Other stories will focus on different characters in other periods of time.</p><p>"That's the way we're going to fill out the universe over time--so when you travel around, all the stories will be connected by one overarching theme, and each story will have different mechanics. And we'll give these mechanics to players within the creator tools," Benzies said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s3jVJaFrbM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Benzies said the team has purposefully held back information and footage for "huge parts of the game" to avoid spoilers in a story that will "take some unusual twists."</p><p>"MindsEye sits bang in the middle of our story. So, we're going to go back 10,000 years, then we're going to go forward a certain amount of time. It's the relevant piece of the puzzle that will have players asking questions of what the bigger story is," he said.</p><p>As for Everywhere, this project is "going to show up again pretty soon," Benzies said, and when that happens, the company's wider plans might make more sense.</p><p>"Everything we're working on, there's a story behind it--a big overarching story. So Everywhere will come back, and it fits into this story somewhere. I can't tell you [where], because it would be a spoiler. But that's going to reappear soon, and it will all be a part of the same product," he said.</p><p>In other news, Build a Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard has suggested that the bad word of mouth about MindsEye is part of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-claims-theres-a-concerted-effort-to-trash-this-gta-like-game/1100-6531866/" data-ref-id="1100-6531866">"concerted effort" to trash the game and his studio.</a></p><p>MindsEye launches June 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. As for the GTA franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> is set for release in May 2026.</p>

		<p>Ubisoft have posted a picture of Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell on their official Twitter feed along with a pair of eyes, some lips and the tag #SplinterCell.&nbsp; The series has been a favourite of fans for many years but the last game was Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist which launched in 2013, so it’s about time for a new game, right?</p>
<p>Well, probably not, in fact it’s perhaps more about Lady Gaga as she is headlining Tudum, Netflix’s yearly fan show that highlights up-and-coming films and tv series. You will have almost certainly forgotten that in July 2020 Netflix and Ubisoft <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/31/splinter-cell-anime-netflix-john-wick/">announced an animated show based on the game.</a> The Ubisoft post on Twitter is just ahead of this year’s Tudum, which will start at 1am BST on May 31st, 2025.</p>


<p>At the time a report on Variety suggested that two seasons comprising sixteen episodes in total had been greenlit. Derek Kolstad, who is one of the key writers behind the John Wick films. had been linked as an executive producer and writer for the series.</p>
<p>A trailer for the series was released eight months ago, you can watch it below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splinter Cell: Deathwatch | Official Announcement | Geeked Week '24 | Netflix" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdVrikMkoNY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>However, there’s a small chance Ubisoft are going to reveal something about the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/15/splinter-cell-remake-confirmed-ps5-xbox-pc-release-date/">Splinter Cell Remake</a> that they announced way back in 2021 and have not said a thing about since then.</p>

<p><em>“Ubisoft has greenlit the development of a Splinter Cell remake that will draw from the rich canvas of the brand. Led by Ubisoft Toronto, the game will be rebuilt from the ground up using Ubisoft’s own Snowdrop engine – the same engine being used to develop Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, as well as Ubisoft’s upcoming Star Wars game – to deliver new-generation visuals and gameplay, and the dynamic lighting and shadows the series is known for.”</em></p>
<p>Creative Director Chris Auty, Producer Matt West, and Technical Producer Peter Handrino took to the Ubisoft to answer some questions.</p>
<p>“A lot of time has passed since the original Splinter Cell, and even since the last sequel – enough time to miss an entire console generation,” explains Peter. “So now we’re going to take the time to explore what this means for us, for light and shadow, for animation tech, for gameplay, AI, even audio. We’re going to ask ourselves, “where does it make sense for us to innovate?”</p>
<p>“We’re going to be straddling the line between the spirit of the old, and the comfort of the new, so that we can excite and surprise new players, but also make sure that when our returning players pick up the controller, they have that sigh of relief, saying “Ahhh, they got it.”” concludes Matt.</p>

		<p>CD Projekt RED has revealed that it will be releasing another update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt later this year, and that this update will add cross platform mod support. This update will allow players to create and share mods across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS, with all mods being available as free content. The release of this update is part of the celebration of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s 10th anniversary.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt — 10th Anniversary Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWOkT7l0yWQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The mod update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will require a little bit of work from players to use. If you want to access mods you will need to set up an account on<a href="https://mod.io/">&nbsp;mod.io</a> and link your CD Projekt RED account to it. Those on PC can still use the likes Nexus Mods and Steam Workshop, but console players will need to sign up to mod.io to use the modding function. Additionally, if mods are being created that use scripts will require REDkit too, but mods that change things like textures will not require REDkit. Mods will not be creatable on PS5 and Xbox Series XS.</p>
<p>A release date for the mod support update for The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is yet to be confirmed.</p>
