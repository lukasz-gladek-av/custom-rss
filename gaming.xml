		<p>The yearly awards season is always a great time to look back and reflect on the highs of the video games industry of the previous twelve months, and there really have been a lot of highlights! There’s been unexpected hits in the likes of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, there’s been long-awaited sequels like Hollow Knight: Silksong that actually manage to live up to the expectations… but to focus <em>only</em> on the highs is to overlook the troubles and major failings that continue to plague the industry through the past half decade.</p>

<p>Once again it’s studio closures and layoffs that are the biggest disappointment of our year, and while job losses were nowhere near the extent of what we saw in 2024, they were still hugely impactful.</p>
<p>One of the biggest examples of this was Warner Bros. Games Studios closing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/warner-bros-shuts-down-monolith-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Monolith, Player First Games and WB Games San Diego in one fell swoop</a>, cancelling the long-in-development Wonder Woman game in the process. It was another super hero game involved when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-shuts-down-developer-cliffhanger-games/">EA cancelled their Black Panther game and closed Cliffhanger Games</a>, we also saw Ubisoft Leamington closing its doors, Avalanche’s Liverpool studio, Microsoft’s The Initiative, and job losses at King of Meat developer Glowmade, People Can Fly, Jagex, Don’t Nod, Crytek, and so many more.</p>
<p>It certainly feels more difficult than ever to manage to bring a game to release and then get it the notice and attention that it needs to survive (not least when a live service is planned around it), but there’s too many instances where very profitable companies are making cuts with some handwaving about AI to sweeten their investor, or where some degree of mismanagement has led to a game’s development drifting and sliding to the point it’s unsalvageable.</p>

<p>Here’s hoping that 2026 can see us turning a corner.</p>
<h2>EA’s Saudi-funded Buyout – Also Disappointing</h2>
<p>It’s not just financial bankruptcy that we have to worry about in the games industry, but a moral bankruptcy as well. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/28/electronic-arts-saudi-investment-fund-trump/">Electronic Arts announcing that they had agreed to sell their company</a> entirely to private investment, with the cash coming from Silver Lake Management, which is Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, and a much smaller stake going to Affinity Partners, the company of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner’s… which is also backed by the PIF.</p>
<p>Saudi money has been flooding out of the oil-rich country and its fellow Gulf states for a long time, most commonly seen as various acts of “sports washing” to distract from and diminish the impact of things like the country’s stance on women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, the assassination of outspoken Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and other human rights violations. PIF money has gone towards buying up football teams, founding golf tournaments, securing motorsports races, and more. However, it’s also been a part of gaming for a long time, and the Public Investment Fund already owned 10% of Electronic Arts and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/12/niantic-sells-gaming-division-and-pokemon-go-to-saudi-owned-scopely-for-3-5-billion/">all of Niantic</a>., It also has stakes in Riot Games, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/pif-public-investment-fund-of-saudi-arabia-ea-activision-and-take-two-shares/">Activision Blizzard</a>, Nintendo, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/pif-public-investment-fund-of-saudi-arabia-ea-activision-and-take-two-shares/">Take Two,</a> Capcom, Embracer, Nexon, and <span data-complete="true">Koei Tecmo. They’ve also taken ownership of SNK and the Esports World Cup.</span></p>

<p>Buying up EA is their biggest move yet for the games industry, and it’s deeply concerning on so many levels for how this is inevitably getting the green light from the US government, for what this means for EA’s workforce when there’s talk of widespread use of generative AI, and obviously on a moral and cultural level. Will this see LGBTQ+ positive campaigns be sidelined in EA’s football games, and more significantly, the impact this will have on The Sims ability to represent its community.</p>
<h2>Whatever it is that Xbox is doing… – Also Disappointing</h2>
<p>Having spent so long rebuilding and expanding their gaming business through the trying times of the Xbox One generation, to see Microsoft meander and slide through the 2020s has just been a bit sad. Sad and confusing.</p>
<p>2025 was another year in which we felt the way that the Xbox business is shifting away from being a direct competitor to Sony and Nintendo and towards just being another publisher on their platforms. More Microsoft-published games were confirmed and released for PS5, and that has led to significant points in time where the majority of the best-selling games on PlayStation have been Microsoft games – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5’s</a> port was a big success, for example, and there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">the Halo remake announcement too</a>.</p>
<p>And that cross-platform shift could be a solid direction for Microsoft to take, if didn’t also feel like they were sacrificing everything else they had built up. The Xbox Series consoles have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/20/xbox-series-xs-consoles-get-another-us-price-hike-in-october/">become ludicrously expensive through more price hikes</a>, almost as if they’re being priced to fail, there’s the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-2025-price-increase-ubisoft-fortnite-crew/">massive price increases for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> thinly veiled behind added services and content that I doubt many people want.</p>

<p>Of course there were also the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-by-xbox-the-initiative-shutdown-rare-turn-10-affected/">mass layoffs in the middle of the year</a> that saw The Initiative shutdown and its Perfect Dark reboot cancelled, the cancellation of Rare’s Everwild, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/turn-off-the-engine-and-retire-the-car-turn-10-signals-end-of-forza-motorsport-support/">end of support for the Forza Motorsport franchise</a> (in favour of Forza Horizon), and more.</p>
<p>Part of the undercurrent to all of this are Microsoft’s two biggest bets of the last couple years. The company is all-in on generative AI, needing to show a growing install base, and wanting its employees to be dogfooding while developing, and there’s Activision needing to keep churning out Call of Duty games every single year, which has led to Black Ops 7 fumbling the FPS crown to Battlefield for the first time.</p>

<p>Where will Xbox end up in a few years time? It’s difficult to say, but we want to see it still be relevant outside of being a third party publisher and an increasingly expensive subscription service.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-goes-all-in-on-airtag-clearance-no-need-for-budget-trackers-as-this-4-pack-deal-hits-all-time-low-2000656018</link>
            <guid>1394260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Find My app is an incredibly useful tool for keeping track of your belongings, and it’s something I’ve personally relied on more times than I’d like to admit. From the time I accidentally left my iPhone at a restaurant to when I forgot my MacBook under a coffee shop table, this app has been a lifesaver. Even when my Apple Watch fell into a river—I didn’t manage to find that one—but the app did confirm the watch was somewhere in that river (I should really keep better care of my stuff). It’s clear that the Find My app is an essential tool for keeping track of your Apple devices. And, if you’ve ever wondered if you could track more than just your iPhone or other Apple products, there’s good news—AirTags are here to help!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>AirTags are tiny, quarter-sized discs that can be attached to almost anything you own, making them just as easy to track as your iPhone or iPad. Whether it’s your keys, wallet, or even a gaming console like a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, you can use these clever little gadgets to keep tabs on all your things. One of the most practical uses is for travel. If you’ve ever had your luggage go missing at the airport, placing an AirTag in your checked bags could save you days of stress and confusion.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking about picking up some AirTags, Amazon currently has a great deal.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/"> Normally priced at $99 for a four-pack (which breaks down to about $25 per tag), they’re currently on sale for just $65.</a> This discount of 34% saves you $35, making each AirTag cost just about $16. It’s a pretty solid deal if you want to make sure your most important items are always within reach.</p>
<h2>Couldn’t Be Easier</h2>
<p>Setting up the AirTags is incredibly simple. All you need to do is tap one to your iPhone or iPad, and it will instantly pair with your device. Once connected, the AirTag will appear in the Find My app alongside your Apple devices. From there, you can give each AirTag a specific name to keep track of exactly what it’s attached to—like naming the one in your purse “Purse” or the one on your keys “Keys.” This way, you’ll always know what’s what.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself searching for a lost item around the house and know it’s somewhere nearby, the Find My app lets you trigger the AirTag to play a sound. The AirTag has a built-in speaker that makes it easy to find your lost items, whether they’re buried under a pile of clutter or hidden between the cushions of your couch. It’s a simple but effective way to save time and frustration when you’re on the hunt for your stuff.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Yen, Chikara and much more.</p>



<p>Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless is a comprehensive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-active-climb-and-jump-tower-codes-roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> RPG where players develop their anime-inspired fighter by training five core stats, mastering special abilities, and defeating increasingly powerful enemies. The main objective revolves around continuously improving your character through the game’s “endless” progression system, unlocking powerful anime-inspired abilities, and watching your fighter evolve into a formidable combatant.</p>







<p>Advancement hinges on five core stats—Strength, Durability, Chakra, Sword, and Speed—each unlocking different combat abilities as you progress. Players earn Yen as the primary currency from defeating enemies and completing quests, which is spent on multiplier upgrades that dramatically increase training efficiency. The game features a unique Champion gacha system using Chikara currency, where rare Champions like Serious Saitama can provide massive stat multipliers to accelerate your growth. While these resources can be accumulated through regular gameplay, the fastest way to jump ahead is by redeeming promotional codes. </p>

<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes, so players can redeem the active codes safely.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless Codes Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like most Roblox games, it is rather simple to redeem Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless codes. That being said, for players who may be new to the Roblox ecosystem, here is a step-by-step guide to redeeming Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless Codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless in Roblox</li>



<li>Find the arrow button in the bottom-left corner</li>



<li>Click on it to scroll through the menu</li>



<li>Find a blue icon, and click on it to open the code box</li>



<li>Type or paste a code into the text box</li>



<li>Click on enter and claim the freebie</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-anime-fighting-simulator-endless-codes">Where To Get More Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless Codes</h2>



<p>Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official AFS: Endless Discord server, which has a dedicated codes channel where all new codes are posted first, and the developer’s social media accounts where they announce updates and milestones for this popular anime-inspired fighting game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself. This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Year In Review: Bethesda Must Go Back To The Drawing Board After DOOM: The Dark Ages]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-bethesda-must-go-back-to-the-drawing-board-after-doom-the-dark-ages/</link>
            <guid>1394251</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Once I finished DOOM 2016 and DOOM: Eternal, I was excited to jump back in again. Less so Eternal, but it’s a fantastic sequel to the untouchable first reboot. DOOM: The Dark Ages is arguably the most complete and well-crafted of the trilogy, but I find it the least memorable and least replayable of the three.</p>



<p>In a bid to expand and evolve, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-update-2-2-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dark Ages</a> feels like an extension of its predecessors, more than a full-scale demonic overhaul. Furthermore, everything new mostly misses the mark, and can make the experience go from Imp to limp very quickly. id Software probably has an ideas board more bloated than a Mancubus after a Christmas Dinner, and there’s plenty of hope for the next trip to hell.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-won-t-spell-doom-for-the-franchise">It Won’t Spell DOOM For The Franchise</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A step back. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>I think DOOM is the quintessential first-person shooter franchise, as well as the most important one. Wolfenstein 3D helped the FPS genre crawl, but 1993’s DOOM stood on its own two feet—and throats of Baron of Hellish foes. Level design, music, the guns, the gore, and the thematic touches just exude a badass aura that few have even come close to.</p>



<p>Following DOOM 3’s survival-horror detour, there was a long wait for a new game. The infamous, canceled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concept-art-and-footage-surface-of-the-cancelled-doom-4-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM 4</a> project is better consigned to history, and thank our stars it was. We got the DOOM 2016 reboot instead—which I actually think is the best DOOM game everbut that’s for another conversation.</p>



<p>Eternal upped the speed and mobility and gave us Godmode Doomguy. I’ll never forgive the Marauders’ design, though, and I’ll die on that fiery hill! Both games are fantastic in their own unique right, and then you’ve got DOOM: The Dark Ages, which serves as a prequel. id Software decided to make its level design more open and chaotic, give us a Doomguy Dragon and Kaiju-inspired levels, and tighten up the game’s story with more cutscenes and character development.</p>



<p>In trying to do more, TDA does <em>too </em>much, and actually takes me away from the thing I enjoy most about DOOM: Killing lots of demons with fun weapons in small-to-medium-sized levels. But it’s still a good game!</p>







<h2 id="h-less-is-more-more-or-less">Less Is More, More Or Less</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Good, large dragon doggie. Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Long story short…I don’t prioritise story when it comes to DOOM, and I’m sure I’m not alone in that sentiment. DOOM 1 and DOOM 2 achieve so much through visual and environmental cues and clues. How am I supposed to rip and tear when you won’t let me rip and tear? The Dark Ages’ Dragon levels are cumbersome and uninteresting, and while I can appreciate the attempt to freshen things up, the Mecha Doomguy sections are boring. </p>



<p>The shield and the slower-shield-based parry gameplay are solid, but you’re always aware that it’s a conscious effort to slow the game’s pace down (not as much as the Marauder, grr), and negatively juxtaposes the game’s identity. I’m not saying I want Doomguy to go shopping for some Sonic the Hedgehog shoes and borrow a Titanfall jetpack, but there needs to be a balance. </p>



<p>Ironically, I believe that balance is still DOOM 2016.</p>



<p>id nailed everything with the game. I’d like to see the next DOOM game be more akin to 2016, and maybe borrow the odd bit of parkour from Eternal, and even some of The Dark Ages’ incredible visual aesthetic. It also wouldn’t hurt to broker peace with Mick Gordon, I beg. In the same way that DOOM 3 was starting to steer the ship away and veer off on a completely different course, I think the same needs to happen again now.</p>



<p>The series is as popular as ever, but it felt like everyone forgot about it as 2025 went on. Let’s fuse old-school and new-school DOOM again. Finding key cards in well-designed levels that don’t just rely on being open, and adding depth with hidden platforms and switches galore. A beastly soundtrack supported by grizzly battle scenes is also a must. Let’s waste less budget on theatrics and inject that into R&amp;D on fun gameplay mechanics and ideas, and re-reboot DOOM again.</p>



<p>What do you think id and Bethesda got wrong with DOOM: The Dark Ages? What needs to happen for the next iteration?

			<p>There is little doubt that the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> launched with <strong>far more third-party support</strong> than the original <strong>Switch</strong> did eight years ago. </p>



<p>Back then, the shift to a hybrid console was still a gamble, and Nintendo was coming off the colossal flop of the <strong>Wii U</strong>, which made third-party developers understandably wary of spending their precious resources on ports for the Switch. That meant only three third-party games were available in March 2017: Just Dance, Bomberman, and Skylanders. Not exactly heavy hitters. </p>



<p>Compare it with the Nintendo Switch 2 third-party launch lineup:</p>



<ul>
<li>Street Fighter 6 (Capcom)</li>



<li>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition (CD Projekt Red)</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy (Avalanche Software / WB Games)</li>



<li>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (Capcom)</li>



<li>Split Fiction (Hazelight / EA)</li>



<li>No Man's Sky – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Hello Games)</li>



<li>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster (Konami)</li>



<li>Civilization VII – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (2K / Firaxis)</li>



<li>Hitman: World of Assassination – Signature Edition (IO Interactive)</li>



<li>Sonic X Shadow Generations (Sonic Team / Sega)</li>



<li>Fortnite (Epic Games)</li>
</ul>



<p>The incredible success of the original Switch and Nintendo's smart choice to pursue what is essentially a 2.0 edition with its successor made it far easier for developers to invest in supporting Nintendo's platform. So easy, in fact, that the problem reversed itself: now, there were too many developers who wanted to get access to the Nintendo Switch 2 devkits, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/while-the-biggest-studios-have-gotten-priority-many-are-still-trying-to-get-a-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led to the big studios obtaining priority access while many others were left wanting</a>, thus inevitably delaying their ability to release games on the console.</p>



<p>The situation <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-devkit-developers-access-nintendo-driect-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still hadn't improved by July</a>. As recently as early October, we received word <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-can-technically-do-path-tracing-war-thunder-dev-didnt-get-switch-2-devkit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an exclusive interview</a> that War Thunder developer Gaijin Entertainment had still not received its Nintendo Switch 2 developer kits. </p>



<p>Now, though, insider Nate the Hate (who had also confirmed in late August that many developers were still waiting for their kits) wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1py9h8n/natethehate_switch_2_devkit_availability_to_third/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the situation has 'largely been resolved'</a>.</p>



<p><em>In the case of Call of Duty… it doesn't mean they got a devkit super late, either. Just late enough that they couldn't get the work done to launch the game sooner. The devkit delivery situation has largely been resolved.</em></p>



<p>In the earlier portion of the statement, Nate was referring to <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jez Corden's recent rumor</a> that Activision is preparing to launch a Call of Duty game for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 soon, thus abiding by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-year deal made by owner Microsoft with Nintendo</a> as part of the stipulations to get the Activision acquisition through the regulatory gates.</p>



<p>With more developers having access to Nintendo Switch 2 devkits, fans should prepare for a deluge of ports in 2026-2027, especially with the new console <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outpacing its predecessor in sales figures</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="5a6ceee95033b"><a title="Metroid Prime 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5a6ceee95033b/metroid-prime-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Like other iconic Nintendo series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> has a timeline documenting Samus' space adventures from past to present. Although the newest outing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is very much its own thing, it is still part of the Prime series as a new chapter.</p>
<p>Outside of the first-person entries, it's now apparently been mentioned by Nintendo how this game fits within the <em>entire</em> history of the Metroid series. <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/60211">Speaking to Famitsu</a> recently, Nintendo's development team reportedly told the famous Japanese gaming outlet how the latest Switch and Switch 2 outing is set <em>after</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> on the Super Nintendo and <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_fusion">Metroid Fusion</a> on the Game Boy Advance (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/metroid-prime-4-timeline-placement/">thanks, Nintendo Everything</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cegsmktx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>In saying this, it's reiterated how the new entry takes place in "another dimension", meaning there is no need to worry about the timeline or possible impacts on the 2D Metroid series. As a result, players can jump into this new adventure without any prior knowledge and enjoy the original setting. It has been an 18-year wait between this game and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Corruption</a>, after all.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review of Metroid Prime 4 here on Nintendo Life</a>, we also mentioned how newcomers would be able to enjoy this new adventure without having to understand the history of the series. If Nintendo, Retro Studios or a prominent Nintendo figure says anything else about how exactly Beyond fits within the Metroid timeline, we'll provide an update.</p>

<p>Arc System Works finally delivered the long-awaited Switch update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>Now, in a new development update, it has addressed the future of this particular version of the game. It mentions how the Switch version has required "a great deal of effort and ingenuity" and as a result, the team is currently examining what exact form future updates "beyond Version 2.0" could take.</p>
<p>The feasibility of this is dependent on how far the development team can push itself, and if it's able to overcome technical challenges.

<p>Developing and operating the game on Nintendo Switch required a great deal of effort and ingenuity to work within hardware constraints.</p>
<p>Based on that experience, we are currently examining what form future updates beyond Version 2.0 could take for the Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
<p>Please note that feasibility will depend not only on technical challenges, but also on how far we can push ourselves as a development team, as well as on feedback and support from our players. All of these factors will be taken into account as we make our decisions."</p>

<p>In a brief update on social media, Level-5 has confirmed it's now surpassed <strong>1.5 million</strong> copies in worldwide cumulative sales. As part of this, the developer is celebrating with a new illustration and a limited-time sale on the eShop.</p>
<blockquote>

We've seen the incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, SaGa Frontier 2 Remastered, and Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles in 2025 alone!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, one game that continues to be left out of that conversation is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a>, which released alongside the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-gifts-2025">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in June. If you're a recent Switch 2 owner and are looking for a new RPG to play, look no further than the fantastic game that is Bravely Default.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster for $29.99</h2><div catalogid="681de1aa-cde5-4374-8e89-64521fd58645" id="233911"><div id="233911" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>BRAVELY DEFAULT FLYING FAIRY HD Remaster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has discounted Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster to $29.99 with a limited-time deal, which marks the lowest we've seen this game to date. Originally released in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS, Bravely Default follows four heroes across the world of Luxendarc as they attempt to reclaim the world's four crystals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bravely Default is a fascinating game for many reasons. It initially was set to be a Final Fantasy game, but it shifted mid-development into its own game despite retaining key elements of the series. Revo, best known for his work as Linked Horizon for Attack on Titan, composed the soundtrack, which is still, to this day, an incredible RPG soundtrack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaster brought new minigames, a refreshed UI, and other solid quality-of-life features like fast-forward, encounter rate adjustments, and more. While this is unfortunately a Game-Key Card, the download is only 11GB, so you will not need much space available on your Switch 2 to download this one. This is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">best Switch 2 games</a> you can buy right now, so don't miss out on this deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

<p>In the title’s latest game update, lines of code such as “via.store.Native.ns2UpgradeEdition” have <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-monster-hunter-wilds-update-gives-hope-for-a-nintendo-switch-2-version/">reportedly been added</a>.</p>
<p>The general consensus seems to be that it’s a reference to a possible <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1pxw8id/potential_new_info_on_t_gog_possible_switch_2/#lightbox">"Switch 2 version" of the game</a>. Capcom hasn’t said anything about bringing this new entry to Nintendo platforms, but it has already shown strong support for Nintendo’s new hybrid system with games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt-13CJKg9tJk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7qmjgwi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The main concern among fans is tied to the game’s performance. When Wilds launched earlier this year in February, there were issues identified with this aspect of the title as well as the visuals on next-generation console hardware and PC. Capcom has rolled out multiple title updates since then, but hunters are still experiencing problems.</p>
<p>How Wilds would perform on a system such as the Switch 2 remains to be seen, but there have already been some stunning efforts on Nintendo's new device including CDPR's work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and Capcom has demonstrated its abilities with Street Fighter 6. Of course, there's no guarantee this discovery in Monster Hunter's latest update will necessarily lead to an announcement.</p>
<p>If you missed the news, Capcom has locked in multiple releases for the Switch 2 in 2026 (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/mega-man-returns-in-2027-with-a-brand-new-entry-for-switch-and-switch-2">and beyond</a>). Some of these titles include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> in February, the spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> in March, and its new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> in April.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ethan Gach’s Top 10 Games Of 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/best-games-2025-silksong-final-fantasy-tactics-9-kings-2000655728</link>
            <guid>1394107</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The thing that surprises me most about these personal GOTY lists, which I’ve been doing most years since I started working at <em>Kotaku</em> (including in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-games-2023-zelda-cyberpunk-baldur-s-gate-3-a-1851130971">delivery room for my third child</a>), is just how little I remember them after they go up. I could guess what was on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ethan-gach-s-top-10-games-of-2020-1845962135">2020 list</a>, or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ethan-gachs-top-10-games-of-2018-1831323132">2018 one</a>, or my very first one from 2016, but I would probably get half of them wrong.</p> <p>The dirty little secret about these lists, at least for me, is how fluid and ephemeral they are. What was in my top 10 shifted throughout the year and that variance didn’t stop once the list was published. I lock in my choice but always harbor doubts, not just about the games themselves but most of all about my own ambivalent feelings toward them. Those change, evolve, and usually just get more complicated over time.</p>

 <p>Each of those lists would probably be different if I compiled them today. But that’s sort of the point. They are snapshots of what I thought I felt at the time. Maybe they help, even if only slightly, to clarify someone else’s feelings about one of their favorite games of the year. Or, even better, turn them onto something they hadn’t already tried. I know, though, that mostly we all just skim the lists to see how much they overlap with our own, and what we think that says about our own tastes and the other person’s. So if you haven’t already skipped ahead, here are my top games of 2025 in alphabetical order:</p>

 <h2><em>9 Kings</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656028" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656028"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656028">Sad Socket</figcaption></figure> <p>A beautifully elegant mash-up of minimalist tower defense strategy and roguelike deckbuilding, <em>9 Kings</em> is still in Early Access and already pretty much everything I want it to be. The introduction of a quest mode late in the year basically added an entire second game. Nothing brought me more joy this year than snuggling up on the couch and watching my brain-dead synergies scale in unexpectedly deadly ways.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655381" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655381"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655381">Embark Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>This is the first modern game to get me to break my “no mic with randos” rule. But <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ real trick is just how rewarding it makes playing the multiplayer extraction format as a solo outsider. It does a wonderful job of blending immersive PVE encounters with unpredictable PVP run-ins in a way that adds to the richness of the sci-fi world rather than making it feel like a series of incentive-driven hamster wheels. Solid gunplay, great atmosphere, rewarding progression.</p>

 <h2><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000017750" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000017750"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000017750">Jump Over The Age</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>, a tight-knit sci-fi TTRPG, feels practically sprawling compared to the first game. That scope can occasionally get unwieldy or see the game run into pacing issues, but the fusion of dice-roll skill checks and light resource management with branching dialogue and player choice yields an unforgettably grim but evocative voyage through cosmic backwaters on the decline. Never have the stakes been so high for even the most trivial tasks. <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> reminded me that letting go is often hard but necessary, and that knowing it isn’t the same thing as actually doing it.</p>

 <h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000002350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002350"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002350">Image: Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure> <p>Everyone’s favorite French-infused, Unreal Engine 5 reskin of <em>Final Fantasy X</em> is as good as they say. I’m not on board with all of the game’s narrative choices, and I’m less impressed by the apparent novelty of a good JRPG in the year 2025 than some, but<em> Clair Obscur</em> is rock solid in so many departments and sets a new gold-standard for (non-tactical) turn-based combat. The writing and performances are especially superb, and none of it would amount to a hill of beans without the (mostly) excellent soundtrack.</p>

 <h2><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000896">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>If we judged games by merely by the sum of the joy or boredom they produced moment-to-moment, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> would not rank very highly. But games are more than just graphs of the emotions they produce across dozens of hours of playtime.<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is an ambitiously chaotic action platforming collectathon that feels incredibly novel for the first five to eight hours, loses all steam and inventiveness in the second and third acts, and then comes roaring back with one of the best closers of any modern Nintendo game. Could <em>Bananza</em> have been more? Probably. Was it enough? Definitely.</p> <h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001602" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001602"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001602">FromSoftware</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Nightreign</em> is an excellent action-RPG but a top-notch multiplayer game. It uses the superficial trappings of a <em>Fortnite</em>-like battle royale to completely reinvent open-world exploration, problem solving, and the classic FromSoftware boss fight. It’s less like being thrust into an i-frame boot camp than embarking on a road trip where you know the car will lose a tire, run out of gas, and stall out in the worst possible place, but persevere and the place where you break down in the middle of the night will soon begin to feel like the home you never knew you missed.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628143" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628143"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628143">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>The best RPG job system to ever do it, combined with an A-tier story and S-tier music, yields an all-time classic that never fails to prove why so many people are still obsessed with it, whether you give it one hour or 20. The remaster is overly cautious with improvements and stingy with new content, but it avoids the cardinal sin of trying and failing to improve on what was already a masterpiece.</p>

 <h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628704" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628704"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628704">Sucker Punch Productions / Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>Last month I went to an Italian restaurant and ordered their Spicy Crab Vodka. The first bite was surprisingly delicious. Every bite after that was equally delicious. The fact that every bite from beginning to end effectively tasted the same did not diminish the dish’s overall effect, or how much I still think about it. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> feels a bit like that. What it lacks in variety or novelty, it more than makes up for with quality, craftmanship, and the confidence to know exactly what it is and be the best version of that. It’s impressively huge and uncompromisingly slick, backed up by great writing and some incredible performances.</p> <h2><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639596"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639596">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>I played a lot of great 2D action games this year. None of them, in scope, precision, and ambition, ultimately held a candle to <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. It incorporates some of the tried-and-true elements of Metroidvanias and Soulslikes but transforms them into a unique, intimate, at times frustratingly galling journey that asks a lot of you but is generous with its rewards. It’s not perfect, but the flaws it does have only come into focus because of everything else it nails. On my deathbed a snow globe will slip from my hands and crash onto the floor as I mutter the name “Bell Beast.”</p>

 <h2><em>Split Fiction</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000005179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005179"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005179">Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s never a good sign when I want to start off an entry with some sort of acknowledgement of a game’s biggest weakness, but maybe it’s a testament to just how insanely smartly designed <em>Split Fiction</em> is that its trite premise and often grating banter did not substantially detract from the whole experience. <em>Split Fiction</em> is so effortlessly good at what it does, it makes it easy to overlook just how infrequent it is to get such a tightly paced, well-balanced action-adventure, particularly one that keeps finding ingenious ways to one-up itself all the way through to the very end.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Konami Is Aiming to Release a New Silent Hill Game in 2026, and in 2027, 2028, 2029, etc, “To Keep the Buzz Around Silent Hill Constant”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/konami-aiming-to-release-new-silent-hill-game-each-year-to-keep-buzz-constant/</link>
            <guid>1394074</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Before <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/">Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> was released in 2024, the most recent <strong>Silent Hill</strong> game was technically P.T. in 2014, the famous teaser that never became a full project. Before that, it was Silent Hill: Book of Memories on the PS Vita. Whether you count P.T. or not, that's still at least a decade between releases. Now, after Silent Hill 2 Remake in 2024, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-reaches-1-million-copies-sold-faster-than-silent-hill-2-remake-konami/">now Silent Hill f in 2025</a>, we've had two Silent Hill games in two years, and according to <strong>Konami</strong>, the company wants to keep that pace up if it can.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61923?page=7">Famitsu</a> (via machine translation), producer <strong>Motoi Okamoto</strong> says the company is aiming "<em>to release about one [Silent Hill] title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles</em>," turning the long-dormant horror series into an annual franchise.</p>



<p>Now, Okamoto doesn't call this goal a new mandate for the company and the franchise. It doesn't seem to be the case that he wants Konami to have a Call of Duty-style development pipeline to ensure that they can pump out a new game on an annual basis. But he describes it as a goal the company would like to hit, in an effort to "<em>keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Following the release of Silent Hill 2 in October 2024, we were able to deliver Silent Hill f in September 2025, and the Silent Hill series is now back on track. We aim to release about one title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles. We're not sure how far we can achieve this, but we'll do our best as the producer of the Silent Hill series. Ideally, we'd like to keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant</em>."</p>



<p>Could Konami set up its own production pipeline to make its horror franchise an annual series? Sure, it could; it's definitely a big enough company, and it could easily throw money at both establishing teams of developers internally and contracting other studios to make new games in the franchise each year. </p>



<p>It even theoretically has another two years of leeway to set up such a pipeline, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">Bloober Team already working on a remake of the first Silent Hill game</a>, which could arrive in 2027, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-listed-retailer-march-26-2026-launch/">Silent Hill: Townfall set to arrive in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Is that what it should try to do with the series? That's a different question with a different, and more complex answer. Trying to push out new games in the series before they're ready could be the noose that Konami ties itself and hangs the series on. A quick glance at any game franchise that has annual releases, like EA Sports titles and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">Call of Duty,</a> shows that you can't possibly keep up the level of quality we've seen, even with the previous two titles, year-in and year-out.</p>



<p>Keeping "<em>the buzz</em>," as Okamoto describes it, around the series, a constant factor could arguably be hampered by trying to release a new game every year. Especially as the quality of releases degrades, as it is likely to do with a new release annually. If Bloober Team is able to release the remake of the first game by 2027, and Townfall makes its rumoured 2026 release, then we'll see where Konami is at in 2027 with making what Okamoto describes as an ideal a reality.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/these-are-the-guys-who-brought-gta-v-s-thug-trio-to-lif-1333412658">Actor Ned Luke,</a> who portrays Michael De Santa in <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and <em>GTA Online,</em> has been swatted a lot. In fact, he gets swatted so often that in a recent clip going viral online, it appears that he and one of the officers checking on the call know each other by name after so many run-ins.</p> <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2651379727?tt_content=full_vod_button&amp;tt_medium=clips_watch_page&amp;t=0h37m32s">during a <em>GTA Online</em> livestream with <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> voice actor Rob Wiethoff</a>, Ned Luke was swatted by someone. While Luke played the game live on Twitch, two police officers were invited into his house by someone. One of the officers then yelled out to Luke, “You’re being swatted again!” as he entered the room. Here’s the clip from the December 23 stream as shared by YouTube channel IceBladeNinja.</p>  <div> <p>Swatting is the act of calling the police on someone who is streaming in the hopes that law enforcement will arrest or disrupt the content creator. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting#Injuries_or_deaths_due_to_swatting">It’s a dangerous thing to do</a> in a country like the United States, which has armed officers ready to open fire.</p> <p>This most recent swatting incident for Luke happened about <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nedluke/clip/BloodyEnergeticVanillaHoneyBadger-tg-qEFmBN165JTKk">30 minutes into the stream</a>. After a short and friendly chat with law enforcement, Luke continued broadcasting on Twitch for another hour and a half. Based on publicly posted information from the actor, this appears to be at least the eighth time since late 2023 that the 67-year-old has been swatted while streaming online. That might explain why the police officers in the clip above seem so chill, and one of them appears to be on a first-name basis with the actor.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-michael-actor-ned-luke-swatted-while-playing-on-thanksgiving-stream">In November 2023, on Thanksgiving,</a> Luke was swatted. He posted about the incident online, <a href="https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1728128625734742489">claiming it was the sixth time</a> it had happened to him due to his private details, like his address, being leaked online in the past. <a href="https://gamevro.com/ned-luke-gta-5-voice-actor-swatted-again-livestream/">On December 29, 2023</a>, Luke was once again swatted, this time with police officers calling him and asking the actor to step outside. ‘</p> <p>Hopefully Luke won’t have to put up with frequent swatting in the future. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSv1RJVkezG/">On December 27, the actor posted on Instagram</a> that at least one person involved with swatting him was now facing federal charges and would be in court in January of 2026 over their alleged swatting activity. “Fuck around and find out,” said Luke on Instagram. “Many more names discovered and provided.”</p> </div>

                <p dir="ltr">What do you think of when you think of a woman in pain? There are no tidy universalisms here, but for many of us, even most of us, pain is private and domestic. You could think of a mother shouldering burdens alone while her husband is at work. The father in the waiting room while the mother screams with strangers. A woman going to the doctor about an ache, only for him to tell her to lose weight and deny the problem is even happening.</p><p dir="ltr">All these things are simple clichés--tropes stolen from life and television. When Silent Hill f conjures a woman's private pain, it is with cutting specificity. In one of the most grisly moments of body horror in video games this year (or ever, really), protagonist Hinako turns into an emblem of her own sorrow, her own compliance, her own screaming rage.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How Silent Hill F Is Connected To The Rest Of The Series</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers follow.</strong></p><hr><p dir="ltr">Like its predecessors, Silent Hill f takes place both in a "real world," covered in fog and invaded by twisted human forms, and in an "other world," which distorts the real. Unlike its predecessors, the gap between the real world and the other world is clearly delineated. Whenever Hinako falls unconscious, she wakes up in the other world. At first, it would seem that her experiences in her hometown are "real" and her time in the other world, marked with Shinto monuments and dream mansions suspended over water, is fake. However, the game's first ending calls this binary into question. The sequence’s final moments reveal Hinako to be much older now than her appearance would suggest. The girl we've been playing the whole time is almost a psychic scream, a representation of the younger Hinako whose dreams were betrayed by the older.</p><p dir="ltr">What was that betrayal? Nothing but the rite promised to all women: marriage. Her parents have promised Hinako to a suitor to settle a family debt. The real world represents how the arrangement slowly strips away her connections to her friends, her family, and herself . The other world stands in for the process of her courtship. The process of playing Silent Hill f, at least in an initial playthrough, is the process of tearing Hinako apart along those axes. She is both victim and thief. One version of her weds the thing that drains the other's world of life.</p><p dir="ltr">In the other world, a mysterious man only called Fox Mask courts Hinako. After a few preliminary trials, including ritualistic killings of her close friends, Hinako descends a staircase to yet another set of ritual grounds. At each site, a new torture awaits. First, Hinako saws off her own arm, then cultists brand her back, and finally, they slice a portion of her face off and replace it with a fox mask of her own. It is easy enough, though gruesome, to write it out. But the visual presentation is grueling.</p><p dir="ltr">Before each ritual, the fox cult display the tools of their torture. Then, they go about their work. The camera work is unsparring, but off center. We see a medium close-up of Hinako's face as she pulls the saw across her shoulder, or blood spilling between her feet as one cultist carves a knife into her face. There is a sense of witnessing, wanting to avert your eyes, but not being able to look away. Like all of Silent Hill f's cutscenes, there are no interactive elements. Here, that fact underlines how Hinako is treated as an object, which Fox Mask and the cultists chisel to their own liking.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of words of comfort and strength from Fox Mask, the cultists are totally silent as they conduct the rituals. They communicate their intent only through gesture and presentation. The effect is almost like a pantomime. These rituals are familiar to everyone present except Hinako. The camera frames her alone, in ordinary schoolgirl clothes, totally surrounded. She is ignorant; the cultists are her teachers. They cut their lessons on her body.</p><p dir="ltr">Hinako's violent transformation rings out across the rest of the game. For one, it acts as the most profound distinction between the two Hinakos. While the student Hinako wields baseball bats, pipes, and if she is lucky, a kitchen knife in the real world, the other Hinako gains a magnificent, monstrous fox arm, a spiritual weapon that will never decay or break. The brand lets her open new doors, while the mask sees hidden paths. The more Hinako becomes a bride, the more power she gains.</p><p dir="ltr">However, that power makes her more vulnerable. With each power, Hinako's "sanity" meter drains. Whether it is an accurate localization or not, I feel "sanity" does not accurately communicate how the mechanic works. One could also describe it as "will" or "resistance." Hinako's fox powers drain sanity and the regular food objects of the town restore it. It represents Hinako's willingness to give in to becoming a bride. The more Hinako embraces the fox, the more sanity she'll expend. The difference in how those mechanics impact the two different Hinakos makes an argument. Every time you use the arm, or regret its absence, you cannot help but think of Hinako's pain in acquiring it, of the tears of blood rolling down her cheeks.</p><p dir="ltr">The ritual's horrifying power is something of a double-edged sword. In subsequent endings, the game turns redemptive. Fox Mask, actually a boy named Tsuneki Kotoyuki, is kind-hearted and well-meaning. Hinako reconciles her two selves. There aren't exactly any thematic problems with this. Fox Mask's good intentions are even a profound provocation. The system dehumanizes, however kind-hearted or well-meaning its agents are. Yet, Silent Hill f's ultimate run of boss fights and reconciliations can't help but feel hollow in the face of the game's prior violences.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, it's hard to hold its deflating final ending, unlocked after a minimum of three complete runs, too much against Silent Hill f. Few games can claim to have any moments of such startling, unsettling power. Fewer still elaborate on those moments with intelligence and complexity. Silent Hill f does both and much more besides. It matters how much a game makes you feel. Each time Hinako bowed her head to harm, I felt such terror, revulsion, and aching, aching sadness. The feeling will stay with me long after the details of Silent Hill f are gone from my memory.</p>

			<p>It's finally time to discover <strong>Wccftech's five best games of 2025</strong>. But first, let's take a moment to look at what happened this year in gaming.</p>



<p>Sadly, it was another year of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>heavy layoffs</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>studio closures</strong></a>, as the industry continues to readjust to the post-pandemic world and the challenges of a market entirely saturated with game releases that often steal each other's visibility. The other major topic of the year was the use of AI, which divided opinions within the development community and <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">culminated in the Larian controversy</a> when the studio admitted to using it during production to expedite certain basic tasks. It's easy to predict that this subject will be discussed more in the coming years, with further controversies likely to arise.</p>



<p>Thankfully, many great new releases brought fun and joy to all those who genuinely love this entertainment medium. When looking closer at the most unanimously acclaimed new titles launched this year, by the way, it's hard not to call 2025 the year of the indie-ish.</p>



<p>Some of the best games released this year were, after all, made by smaller studios with budgets that did not even approach the dozens or even hundreds of millions that the top studios can spend nowadays. Perhaps that's not so unheard of, but the difference is, those games tended to be the so-called 'rough gems', often featuring innovative mechanics but also a lot of 'jank' somewhere in the overall product due to a lack of resources. </p>



<p>This time, though, these games were almost as polished as the best triple-A examples, and often outshone them in innovation and ingenuity. That said, there were also some great AAA releases this year. Without further ado, keep scrolling to read our ten best games of 2025 and vote in the community poll.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/clair_obscur_expedition_33-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-9-5">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9.5</a>)</h2>



<p>The poster child of the small-team revolution is undoubtedly French developer Sandfall Interactive. With a budget of less than ten million dollars for their debut game, they proved that turn-based JRPGs are absolutely vital and that small developers can punch so far above their weight that they even outshine far bigger, critically acclaimed productions, breaking the existing record for most prizes won at an edition of The Game Awards with 9.</p>



<p>Most importantly, they delivered an amazing, unforgettable game in the hands of fans. Here's Francesco De Meo's summary from the Wccftech review:</p>



<p><em>Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hades-2-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-hades-ii-10">Hades II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10</a>)</h2>



<p>Despite being an independent company of a small size (around 25 employees), Supergiant Games is no stranger to having its games celebrated far and wide. Almost all of its games (Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades) received acclaim, and the first Hades even won several game awards. This time, though, they attempted a sequel and absolutely nailed it, as mentioned in David Carcasole's review:</p>



<p><em>Hades 2 is a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/silksong_art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong </h2>



<p>Team Cherry's latest game was also a sequel to a beloved indie title. The Australian team surprised everyone with the original Hollow Knight in 2017, selling over 15 million copies in eight years and garnering acclaim as one of the greatest Metroidvania games ever made. </p>



<p>However, the development of Silksong was quite long. It actually started even before the release of Hollow Knight as a DLC for that game, but then it morphed into a much larger project, and the developers went quiet for a very long time. In 2023, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed-as-development-is-still-continuing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced another delay</a>, and it wasn't until the latter half of this year that we got the very first details about Silksong, just in advance of its September 4 launch.</p>



<p>In the end, the long wait was absolutely worth it, as Silksong received heaps of praise for the game's artistic vision and its improvements to key systems, including combat, pacing, boss fights, and narrative. Silksong is a challenging game, but it's also fair, which is another feat that's far from easy to accomplish. Thus, it earns its rightful place among the best games of 2025.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/a316285a09eceee300a8f0cb007599cf20aa6404a105a05a-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h2>



<p>Whereas both Silksong and Hades were sequels to beloved indie games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a> came out of nowhere with a brand new IP. Granted, many of the members of AdHoc Studio had previously worked on Telltale's successful releases, but Dispatch was still a big surprise. Who knew that having to ditch a cool mech for a desk job would be so fun?</p>



<p>Seriously, though, the game is incredibly well-made in every regard, from the gorgeous comic-book-inspired art style to the witty dialogues, iconic characters, and engaging story that is as far removed from traditional superhero fare as you could imagine. At its budget price, it is practically a must-buy.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SplitFiction_KeyArt_RGB-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-8">Split Fiction (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8</a>)</h2>



<p>Hazelight Studios is another team that started small and slowly carved itself a niche for split-screen co-op exclusive games with interesting settings and stories. Their new game, Split Fiction, is every bit as enjoyable as A Way Out and It Takes Two, and even more refined in some areas. Critics and fans alike loved it; the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/split-fiction-becomes-million-seller-in-just-two-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became a million seller in just two days</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed four million units sold in two months</a>. There's even <a href="https://wccftech.com/sydney-sweeney-will-reportedly-star-in-a-split-fiction-movie-adaptation-with-wicked-director-jon-m-chu-at-the-helm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a movie on the way with Sydney Sweeney set to star</a> (in all likelihood, as Zoe Foster). If you have someone else who enjoys playing this type of game, getting it for co-op is a no-brainer.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-10">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10</a>)</h2>



<p>Warhorse Studios was once an independent studio as well. The first Kingdom Come: Deliverance was crowdfunded via Kickstarter, after all, but following that game's successful release, the Czech developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-kingdom-come-deliverance-warhorse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was acquired by THQ Nordic</a> (now Plaion). With a much larger budget at their disposal, they were able to create a much bigger, not to mention more refined, open world RPG that fully realizes their original vision. Chris Wray gave it a perfect ten and commented:</p>



<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ghost-of-Yotei-Key-art.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-8-8">Ghost of Yotei (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.8</a>)</h2>



<p>Sucker Punch struck gold with Ghost of Tsushima, 2020's excellent action/adventure game. Their new IP sold exceptionally well, prompting Sony to get John Wick director Chad Stahelski to direct a movie adaptation and, of course, fast-tracking a sequel at the Bellevue-based studio. With Ghost of Yotei, the studio retained the same formula, refined it, and presented it with another great story that every samurai fan won't want to miss. Here's an excerpt from my review:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2>



<p>Hideo Kojima has returned this year with the second chapter in the post-apocalyptic adventures of Sam (Norman Reedus), this time set in Australia. The gameplay of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is much more varied than the first 'strand game', and there's also a vastly improved combat system. The presentation is simply unparalleled, and the performances of the whole cast are fantastic. </p>



<p>It may still not be for everyone, but Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is nonetheless undoubtedly worthy of appearing in our best games of 2025 list.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ARC_Raiders_A_KeyArt_Main_01_Horizontal_3840x2160-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-9">ARC Raiders (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9</a>)</h2>



<p>If you told most people a year ago that ARC Raiders would not only be in this list but also one of those with the best chances to win, they would not have believed it. Embark stunned everyone with how refreshing ARC Raiders turned out to be, not to mention incredibly well-balanced between its PvE and PvP elements. In Wccftech's review, Kai Tatsumoto wrote:</p>



<p><em>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/battlefield-6-art-HD-1-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-8-5">Battlefield 6 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.5</a>)</h2>



<p>Out of all the games on this list, Battlefield 6 might have been the most anticipated in terms of sheer fanbase size coming into 2025. The excellent news for Battlefield fans is that their beloved military shooter franchise is back with a new installment that understands what made the best games in the saga so great. The natural outcome was for Battlefield 6 to become the best-selling game of the year, with estimates placing it near the 24 million units sold milestone.</p>



<p>In Wccftech's review, David Carcasole stated:</p>



<p><em>Battlefield 6 is an incredibly strong return to form for the series, with a multiplayer experience that is finely tuned with huge potential for what it could build into, destruction mechanics that bring a level of immersion back to the series that it was missing, and a more than solid visual and sound design package tying up how endlessly fun it is to play.</em></p>

      <div><p>The future of MCDM's fantasy RPG is looking bright. The crowdfunding campaign for <em>Draw Steel: Crack the Sun</em>, which introduces multiple substantive supplements to the game, has raised over $2 million.</p><h2>The <em>Draw Steel: Crack the Sun</em> BackerKit Campaign</h2><p>According to its <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/mcdm-productions/draw-steel-crack-the-sun" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Draw Steel: Crack the Sun</em> introduces seven new products to the game.

              <p>Valve has revealed the official list of best-selling games on Steam for 2025. They include everything you’d expect, plus a few surprises. <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a> ended up beating out <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and others for a spot in the top dozen, despite being recently labeled as one of the worst PC ports of the year by <em>Digital Foundry</em>.</p> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025">full list of the top 24 best-selling new Steam games,</a> broken up into two sections. The games within the sections are in no particular order. First, the top 12:</p> <ul> <li><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></li> <li><em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em></li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em></li> <li><em>EA Sports FC 26 </em></li> <li><em>Borderlands 4 </em></li> <li><em>Schedule I </em></li> <li><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></li> <li><em>Civilization VII </em></li> <li><em>Battlefield 6 </em></li> <li><em>Dune Awakening </em></li> <li><em>Arc Raiders </em></li> <li><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em></li> </ul> <p>And numbers 13-24:</p> <ul> <li><em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em></li> <li><em>Dispatch </em></li> <li><em>Dying Light: The Beast </em></li> <li><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana </em></li> <li><em>Europa Universalis V </em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em></li> <li><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em></li> <li><em>Split Fiction </em></li> <li><em>Inzoi </em></li> <li><em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em></li> <li><em>Stellar Blade </em></li> <li><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></li> </ul> <p>The list includes the big blockbusters, but also more hardcore historical strategy games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399"><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana</em></a> and <em>Europa Universalis V</em>. I was surprised to see <em>Civilization 7</em> in the top 12 despite its launch woes and fan discontent around some of the new features and the content-light end game. But then again, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> secured a top spot as well despite miserable user ratings as fans await still much-needed optimization patches.</p>

 <p>Capcom’s action-RPG also made <em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s list of the worst PC ports of 2025. The technical analysts there still seem flummoxed by how badly the game runs, even after its latest Title 4 Update, and even as the publisher’s upcoming work like <em>Pragmata</em> and <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> appears to be doing just fine on the platform. “Definitely one of the poorest games I’ve reviewed in a long time from a technical performance perspective,” Alex Battaglia said during the outlet’s <a href="https://youtu.be/s3_0yhXDKTs">annual look back video</a>.</p>

 <p>Capcom has promised <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-tu4-title-update-4-pc-fixed-2000652579">bigger performance improvements in 2026</a>, but even those will be spread out across a couple of months. It’ll be the one-year anniversary of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ launch and PC players will still be waiting to see if the game will finally be passable on that platform or if it’ll continue to run with framerate hitching and texture pop-in, among other issues.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders, Schedule I, Hollow Knight Silksong and Battelfield 6 Are Some of 2025’s Best Selling New Games on Steam]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the time of this writing, there are still just under 60 hours left in 2025, which means that the jury is still out on which game was the best-selling game of the year on the biggest PC storefront, Steam. That said, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025"><strong>Steam Charts</strong></a> has already declared the games that were part of the top 100 best-selling games by revenue on the platform, and while it doesn't list the titles in order, we know that some of the top 12 games include ARC Raiders, Schedule I, Hollow Knight Silksong, and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>At least that's the case for the list of new games released in 2025. When you look at top sellers across the platform, including games not released in 2025, the top 12 look more like what you'd expect, with Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, PUBG, Apex Legends, and Marvel Rivals making up almost half of the top 12.</p>



<p>As for the new releases, however, the top 12 make it clear that games with a multiplayer focus are still the majority of what sells on the platform, with 9/12 games either featuring multiplayer or having multiplayer as the core element. But that's not to say single-player experiences aren't selling or essential to what players are looking for today.</p>



<p>Dune: Awakening may be a multiplayer game, but you can experience so much of it without really interacting with other players. Hollow Knight Silksong is an entirely solo journey, as is The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, all of which made the top 12.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top 12 best-selling new games on Steam for 2025, sorted randomly:</p>



<ul>
<li>Elden Ring Nightreign</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>



<li>Borderlands 4</li>



<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Schedule I</li>



<li>Sid Meier's Civilization VII</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>Dune: Awakening</li>



<li>Hollow Knight Silksong</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</li>
</ul>



<p>The other notable element to this list is what's left off, specifically Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which was able to make the next tier of best-selling games, but couldn't beat Battlefield 6 and Borderlands 4, the two other first-person shooters you could argue are its biggest competition.</p>



<p>It's also worth pointing out that, whatever your stance on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">Embark Studio's use of GenAI</a>, it is incredibly impressive for ARC Raiders to arrive as a brand-new franchise and be one of the year's most popular, best-selling titles. ARC Raiders and Schedule I are the only two games that aren't based on a previously-existing franchise or series that made the list, and Schedule I's accomplishment is even more impressive when you factor in the fact that it's a self-published indie game.</p>



<p>The final tally will come after 2025 is officially over, and we'll get a list that's not in a random order once firms like Circana and Newzoo publish their findings. In the meantime, you can check out Wccftech's Best of 2025 lists, which include several of the top-selling games mentioned.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kenneth-shepards-top-10-games-of-2025-pokemon-hundred-2000655496"><span>I loved </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, but looking at a game in every stage of its development is inevitably going to make you wish a studio had been able to implement every idea it had into the final product. The infamous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>Game Freak Teraleak</span></a><span> from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>last year</span></a><span> has given us a pretty thorough look at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> journey from design doc to finished game, and while it’s interesting to see these screenshots and pieces of test footage, it also has fans weighing in on Game Freak’s processes and sharing how they feel about the final product now that they’ve seen how the sausage was made.</span></p> <p><span>YouTuber </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sdVmay2ky0"><span>TurtleBro</span></a><span> compiled all his findings in the Teraleak into a feature-length video that goes chronologically through </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s development files dating back to 2022, shortly after work on </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> had wrapped up. Some files are from so early in the process that Game Freak was using </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>’ Irida as a placeholder for the player. These screenshots and videos show some cut content and features, like additional building interiors to explore, being able to use overworld abilities around </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>, and even some additional multiplayer modes that had players throwing Poké Balls at one another, dodgeball style.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps most surprising in these early builds is a much </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148"><span>higher level of environmental detail</span></a><span> than we see in the final game. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> was memed to hell and back for its flat-textured buildings, and some of the first pieces of footage TurtleBro shows off include windows and building structures that are much more detailed. In January of 2023, many of these assets were swapped for something similar to the flat ones we have in the game now, and internal notes suggest this downgrade was a “burden” on the team. It’s here you can see a lot of the game’s initial ambitions get pulled back, though some things, like the real-time, action-based combat system, started to take shape here, albeit in a more third-person shooter style than the command-based one we have now. By March of that year, the team was on track to deliver the game we got, and morale started to improve.</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s one aspect of the development timeline that is kind of fascinating considering 2024 was the first time in quite a few years since there wasn’t a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><span>or expansion</span></a><span>: it sounds like </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>was feature complete by June 2024, and Game Freak spent around 16 months on polish before it launched the game on October 16, 2025. </span></p>

 <p><span>TurtleBro speculates that the reason the game’s visuals were deliberately downgraded was to give the team the year to spend refining the game in order to avoid a massive performance fiasco like the one that surrounded </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-teal-mask-indigo-disk-gen-9-1851109325"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> in 2022</span></a><span>, though others who viewed the game less charitably </span><a href="https://x.com/soulsilverart/status/2005368278689222901"><span>suspect Game Freak may have just shelved </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> for over a year and moved onto a new project, rather than using that time for meaningful iteration. It’s unclear, however, as the development details stop at this point; the Teraleak occurred in August, and thus, we don’t have any more of these design docs that might confirm the team’s thinking.</span></p>

 <p><span>Overall, it’s a fascinating look at how </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> went from concept to finished game, and TurtleBro does a great job of comparing images of aspects of the game from early in development to what those aspects look and play like in the actual, released game you can play on your Switch or Switch 2. Check out the full video below:</span></p>

  <p><span>I do mourn some of the stuff we lost in the development process, but that’s the risk you take when you look at unfinished work. The video puts the leaks we’ve seen from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-wave-map-leak-pikachu-professor-2000655613"><span>upcoming </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave </span></i><span>games</span></a><span> into perspective, serving as a reminder that several of the mechanics and concepts those leaks have revealed may not make it into the final product, either. We’ll know for sure when those games are revealed, which will likely happen for the series’ 30th anniversary next year.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[CD Projekt Sells DRM-Free PC Storefront GOG to Original Co-Founder for $25.2 Million, Insists It's Financially Stable]]></title>

            <guid>1393978</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt has sold its DRM-free PC storefront GOG to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński, for 90.7 million Polish złoty (approx. $25.2 million). Kiciński is also co-founder of CD Projekt itself, and currently holds 10% of share capital in the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiciński co-founded GOG in 2008, and it has operated within the CD Projekt Group for over 17 years. Selling GOG “fits” CD Projekt’s long-term strategy, according to <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a FAQ posted online</a>. CD Projekt, the Polish company behind smash hits The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, wants to focus on video game development and other projects, it said. CD Projekt is currently developing The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Selling GOG fits CD Projekt’s long-term strategy,” reads the statement. “CD Projekt wants to focus its full attention on creating top-quality RPGs and providing our fans with other forms of entertainment based on our brands. This deal lets CD Projekt keep that focus, while GOG gets stronger backing to pursue its own mission.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiciński commented: “From the very beginning, GOG has always been built on strong values and clear principles. When Marcin Iwiński and I came up with the idea for GOG, the vision was simple: bring classic games back to players and ensure that once you buy a game, it truly belongs to you — forever.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG will operate independently, it said, and continue with its DRM-free philosophy. Following the sale, CD Projekt and GOG signed a distribution agreement that specifies the terms of future cooperation, including a plan to release CD Projekt Red’s upcoming games on GOG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“CD Projekt and GOG share the same roots and values: freedom, independence, and a genuine sense of ownership,” Kiciński continued. “I believe that CD Projekt, with its exceptional AAA games, will stand, as always, behind the GOG offering — making GOG the best place on the planet to purchase The Witcher and Cyberpunk games, both existing titles and the new ones we all anticipate so much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a mature gamer, I often play classic games myself and deeply admire the creativity behind many of them. I truly believe that well-crafted classics can deliver as much joy as new releases. When it comes to pure playability, timeless games often prove to be really the safe choice, especially in a market flooded with gazillions of low-quality smaller games. Beyond preserving classics, GOG has always sought out new games with a retro spirit. I am personally involved in the development of a few games like that and they will certainly make their strong appearance on GOG in 2026.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every CD Projekt Red Game In Development</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Michał Nowakowski, joint CEO of CD Projekt, added: “with our focus now fully on an ambitious development roadmap and expanding our franchises with new high-quality products, we felt this was the right time for this move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it’s going into very good hands — we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG’s co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes. We would like to thank the GOG team for years of fruitful cooperation and wish them all the best. And to the GOG community, I say ‘see you around,’ because our upcoming releases will naturally be available on GOG as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG has long competed with Steam for the hearts and minds of PC gamers by leaning on its no-DRM policy, although Valve's platform remains the overwhelming market leader. In the FAQ, the question ‘is GOG financially unstable?’ is asked. The answer, officially, is no. “GOG is stable and has had a really encouraging year,” reads the statement. “In fact, we’ve seen more enthusiasm from gamers towards our mission than ever before.” GOG hit the headlines recently for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-pc-game-storefront-gog-gets-behind-horses-after-valve-steam-ban-players-should-be-able-to-choose-the-experiences-that-speak-to-them">getting behind indie game Horses after Valve banned it from Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like from a user point of view, nothing changes here. As for CD Projekt, it can now strip out GOG from its business, which at latest count employed 1,335 staff. In The Witcher franchise it has the aforementioned The Witcher 4 as part of a new Witcher trilogy with Ciri as protagonist, The Witcher Remake, and Project Sirius. Cyberpunk 2 is also in development, as is Project Hadar, a new IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
