                <p>Riot Games has announced that it will begin officially sanctioning sports-betting sponsorships for esports teams in its Tier 1 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/" data-ref-id="5000-509039">Valorant</a> leagues. While the company states that it still won't allow advertisements in its official broadcasts, teams themselves will be able to take money from sports-betting companies for advertising through their own channels.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, President of Publishing and Esports John Needham writes that the move is designed to take advantage of the rapidly growing sports-betting industry and to make esports-related betting more regulated. Seemingly to address concerns and head off potential criticism, Needham explains that the company is authorizing sports-betting sponsorships under a "guardrails first" strategy.</p><p>These "guardrails," Needham states, are essentially the rules by which any sponsorship must be executed. First, sports-betting companies need to be vetted and approved by Riot itself, although the company has not shared the criteria on which this vetting is done. Second, to ensure that sports-betting companies are on a level playing field, Riot is mandating that official partners all use GRID, the officially sanctioned data platform for League of Legends and Valorant. Third, esports teams must launch and maintain internal integrity programs to protect against violations of league rules due to the influence of sports betting. Fourth and last, Riot will use some of the revenue from these sponsorships to support its Tier 2 (lower division) esports leagues.</p><p>One of the biggest sources of anxiety and frustration around the explosion of sports betting in the United States has been the increasingly high frequency of sports-betting advertising, and Riot addresses this concern by promising to not have ads from these companies in "Riot-owned broadcast and social channels." This also means that teams will not be allowed to have sports-betting ads on team member jerseys. The only place these ads will be able to run are on team-owned channels. As Needham explains, "It will be up to each team to craft how sports-betting-related content shows up on their channels within the guidelines of the sponsorship program, content platform ToS [terms of service], and local regulations."</p><p>The company's justification for authorizing sports-betting sponsorships appears to center on a desire to address underground, unofficial, or otherwise unauthorized betting networks and organizations. "Sports betting--and more specifically, esports betting--is a space that more fans choose to engage with every year," Needham writes. "According to Sportradar, the total betting turnover globally involving just LoL Esports and VCT reached $10.7 billion in 2024. But here's the problem: 70% of bets across all sports are placed in unregulated markets with bookmakers who aren't licensed."</p><p>As such, the company hopes that it can bring more of this activity under the auspices of the company, where it hopes to exert some regulatory influence (and, one would suspect, be able to collect more of the revenue that flows through sports-betting apps).</p><p>Despite the blog post's efforts to emphasize protecting esports integrity, though, Needham and Riot have not addressed any of the social issues that have been caused by the growth of sports betting throughout the country. An NCAA-sponsored study, for example, found that increasing harassment of college athletes in the United States can be <a href="https://ncaaorg.s3.amazonaws.com/ncaa/wagering/NCAAThreatMatrixPilotStudyPublicReport.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">primarily attributed to anger and disappointment related to sports betting</a>. This dynamic may be even worse along gendered lines; some evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a64772215/womens-sports-harassment-stalking-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">betting-related harassment disproportionately targets women</a>. Riot has yet to state if it will take any particular precautions to mitigate potential harms caused by sports betting; most of its emphasis so far appears to be assuaging fears about match fixing or other threats to esports integrity.</p>

<p>If you've had the chance to catch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">our review</a>, you'll know we fully believe this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> "follow-up" is worth the new price of entry too, even if there are three more chapters to go. With big games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> ready and available for play, I've instead chose to sink more time into the indie darling that is Deltarune. It's silly yet simultaneously serious world and characters have their hooks in me and it's all I find myself thinking about night after night.</p><div><figure data-videoid="htp-VfCtJow" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/htp-VfCtJow?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c7531rkghwy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htp-VfCtJow" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>To help me try and silence those voices and get a few extra hours of sleep, I was graciously given the chance to pepper Deltarune's creator, Toby Fox, with a few of the questions that have been knockin' about in my noggin. Did Toby answer my questions? Yes. Did he also take every opportunity to run in a different direction and troll me? Yes, and yes, but that's truly for you to decide. Did I love every part of his reply? <em>Absolutely</em>. Mild spoilers ahead by the way.</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Zion Grassl): The game show element introduced in Chapter 3, hosted by Tenna, has his third round of the show abruptly cancelled. Did you ever have more fleshed out plans for that third round, or were you always planning to cancel it on the poor guy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Toby Fox:</strong> We made most of it, but cut it because it slowed down the pacing too much. To put it in words that fans will understand, "Your taking too long" + "the game's getting old."</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0e2e85b5b4ead/deltarune.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Mr. Tenna, sir, you're hoggin' all the air time — <em>Image: Toby Fox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What drove you to make the [REDACTED] boss fight in Chapter 3 a seemingly impossible fight and how do you playtest something so difficult?</strong></p>
<p>You mean Elnina + Lanino? Yeah, there's actually a playtester that gave up at that point... Well, I didn't make it that hard on purpose. But, I did make it so that if you get a Game Over and you have no points and no healing items, you get 2 TV Dinners for free.</p>
<p>After using "ILoveTV" a couple times, it should be enough to beat the battle just by defending and healing, so keep trying!</p>
<p><strong>What sort of music brings you joy these days and what are a few musicians you find yourself listening to? Also, are you aware of the artist Porter Robinson? I feel like you two would make great pals and I'd selfishly love to see how you two could collaborate!</strong></p>
<p>I'm excited for the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_chiptune_band_anamanaguchi_shares_insight_into_its_latest_album_and_dream_smash_bros_fighters">anamanaguchi</a> album, "<a href="https://anamanaguchi.com/">Anyway</a>".</p>
<p>I heard <a href="https://porterrobinson.com/">Porter Robinson</a> before... that's right, the name of the music video was... "<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0">Shelter</a>" <em>(upon saying that word, his eyes glaze over, he steps back into the darkness and the door closes behind him...)</em></p>
<figure><a title="that's right, the name of the music video was... &quot;Shelter&quot; (upon saying that word, his eyes glaze over, he steps back into the darkness and the door closes behind him...)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/35a7657aac7df/thats-right-the-name-of-the-music-video-was-shelter-upon-saying-that-word-his-eyes-glaze-over-he-steps-back-into-the-darkness-and-the-door-closes-behind-him.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>"I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me."</em> — <em>Image: Toby Fox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How has it been developing for Switch 2 and have you had any thoughts of how you could take advantage of the unique hardware again down the road?</strong></p>
<p>It was kind of like the Nintendo Switch, but a much much bigger number, and strong. Down the road I'd like to take advantage of the unique hardware to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>I can't believe they misspelled "Bananaz" but I'll let it slide because they turned the rock into a girl. I wonder if she was originally intended to stay a rock, but then they realized that she didn't sing rock music, she sang girl music.</p>
<p><strong>How has it felt releasing your story in chunks/chapters like this, as opposed to a fully complete package and when are you personally hoping to have the final chapter of Deltarune release? Are we cursing you by even asking such a question?</strong><strong><br></strong></p>
<p>I've never called them chunks. Maybe I should start calling them chunks? Like, here comes Chunk 5. I mean, that would be great if it was a game about cavemen, like Chuck Rock, or Bonk. That being said, I do feel like calling each episode a "Chapter" really undersells the fact that creating each one is like developing its own game. I've made the equivalent of like 2 and a half Undertales at this point. Continuously.</p>
<p>As for when it comes out, it should be out when it's done, which is as soon as it's finished, which, in my opinion, sooner would be better, but it takes a while. If it takes too long everybody is going to say " you're taking too long" and then I'll say "I'm old!" They'll have to revive me</p>
<figure><a title="When trying to ask Toby about the [REDACTED] boss fight in Chapter 3, he seemingly misunderstood us and assumed we meant the Elnina + Lanino fight. Our bad there." href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d80979356561f/when-trying-to-ask-toby-about-the-redacted-boss-fight-in-chapter-3-he-seemingly-misunderstood-us-and-assumed-we-meant-the-elnina-plus-lanino-fight-our-bad-there.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>When trying to ask Toby about the REDACTED boss fight in Chapter 3, he...ummm...seemingly misunderstood us and thought we meant the battle with Elnina + Lanino. Whoops! — <em>Image: Toby Fox</em></figcaption></figure>
<hr>
<p><em>Big thanks to Toby for taking the time away from his never ending development cycle to answer our questions.</em></p>
<p><em>Deltarune is now available on the eShop and currently includes Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4. You can also try the first two chapters for free by downloading the demo. All future chapters will be added to the paid package as and when they release</em></p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're enjoying Deltarune on Switch 2 in the comments!</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/ive-made-the-equivalent-of-like-2-and-a-half-undertales-at-this-point-a-quick-deltarune-chat-with-toby-fox]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Buffing too close to the sun.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is filled with excellent loot for Nightfarers to wield, on your expedition to take down the Nightlords. But how excellent can it get? Well, one player who found a rare weapon and decided to find out has gone viral for building their blade up into the ultimate Nightlord-slaying machine — only to see it also then ultimately tumble back down to nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this centers on Japanese YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mintius" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mintius</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/elden-ring-nightreign-player-pushes-attack-damage-to-very-limit-reaches-godhood-for-a-moment-before-glitching-out-and-becoming-completely-defenseless/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton Media</a>), who acquired the Marais Executioner Sword, a weapon that raises attack power upon defeating enemies — but usually only by a certain amount. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that Nightreign usually has time limits, thanks to its encroaching storm, this sword's power wouldn't normally have the chance to snowball <em>too </em>far out of control, despite being a strong weapon. But Mintius managed to get the right combination of enemy and encounter spawns to scale it as far as it can go, and then even further.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per Automaton's translation, Mintius hunted mobs in the Wormface encounter for "about an hour" with the Marais Executioner Sword, to see what would happen. Their attack power hit a damage cap at 9,999 after defeating 725 enemies, with the last damage value he saw as 63,375. After defeating the 727th enemy, though, Mintius was "suddenly unable to deal any damage at all," and got killed.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">「マレー家の執行剣」で1時間ほどミミズ顔の雑魚を狩り続けて検証<br>727体の敵を撃破して攻撃力は9999で余裕のカンスト<br>最後にステータスから確認したマレー家の執行剣の表示攻撃力は63375<br>725体目を撃破したところで、突如として全ての敵へ一切ダメージを与えられない状態になり死亡した <a href="https://t.co/q95neZfdu3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/q95neZfdu3</a></p>— 負けミン mintius (@amabamamabam1) <a href="https://twitter.com/amabamamabam1/status/1937574056943030323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The going theory is that Mintius hit an "overflow," and suddenly went from hitting the damage ceiling to scraping the damage floor. Much like the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nuclear-gandhi-meme-civilization/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet tall-tale about Gandhi in Civilization</a>, hitting the upper-limit may have caused Mintius to wrap back around to the lower.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mintius is apparently going to continue testing the Marais Executioner Sword, to see what kind of limits and bounds exist on it, as well as the incredible damage potential behind it. They apparently want to try doing a plunging attack on a Flame Chariot, just to see what kind of damage numbers it can put up. It will probably get wild.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the average Elden Ring Nightreign player, maybe take this as a sign to not get <em>too </em>greedy in farming up that Marais Executioner Sword when you find it. Or at least, don't spend an hour doing so. It certainly seems like a good weapon, but it looks like there's some hubris to be found in trying to take it to its highest heights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-player-takes-a-damage-stacking-weapon-to-its-highest-heights-before-it-all-comes-crashing-down]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A quick one to end the day. While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has done a fair-to-miraculous job of reviving enthusiasm for the despised QTE, players remain suspicious of minigame-style mechanics in combat systems - and when I say players I mean <em>you</em>, the people who fretted in the comments for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcoms-pragmata-is-a-clean-and-pleasant-lunar-shooter-with-a-touch-of-god-of-war">my recent article on Pragmata</a>.</p>
<p>Capcom’s upcoming space-me-daddo-shooty-doo has a debuff mechanic whereby the android girl riding on your back hacks the robots you’re fighting – a process of moving a cursor around a grid of glyphs to deactivate shields and so forth.</p> <!--more-->
<p>It’s the kind of subtask that may seem annoying on paper. I didn’t find it intrusive during my Summer Game Fest hands-on, but why should you pay attention to me, the melonhead who almost got himself kicked out of the demo session by losing his temper when the PR told him he couldn’t take a picture of the controller diagram print-out? The very same dipstick who then insisted on passive-aggressively drawing the print-out in his notepad, spitefully frittering away five minutes of the session and probably getting himself disinvited from future events? The exact same consummate wellington who has now written all this down for public consumption, just in case those PRs had forgotten?</p>
<p>No, I think you’re better off trying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>’s hacking for yourself care of <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/gameplay/">this brief browser demo</a>. It’s a cursory but solid approximation of the combat system I sampled this month, though obviously it doesn't factor in all the strafing, reloading and such.</p>
<p>I feel pretty positive about Pragmata as a whole, though I doubt it'll set the world on fire. It's a cleanly-built and straightforward shoulder-shooter with just enough intricacy to make you feel clever, even when you're smouldering with outrage and wondering if you can get #Capcomgate trending on Bluesky.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-know-you-fear-minigames-in-your-combat-so-why-not-test-out-pragmatas-hacking-in-a-browser]]></content:encoded>

I had a lot of trouble getting this quest to pop naturally. You’re meant to ask the town of Bravil about rumors, but no one wanted to talk about the ghost plaguing the river to the south. Instead, I went searching on my own. <strong>I found the Forlorn Watchman at Bawnwatch Camp</strong>. After attempting to speak to him, realizing he won’t speak unless you follow him for an hour through the woods, and finally chatting the specter up once he stops, you’ll need wind up back in Bravil for more information after taking a short swim across the river to the <strong>Mouth of the Panther</strong>. Back in Bravil, <strong>speak to Gilgondorin at Silverhome on the Water</strong>—the inn just inside the city’s gates.</p><figure id="" data-id="ea4d4228ebc3454606da9df7ff6fb8e5" data-recommend-id="image://ea4d4228ebc3454606da9df7ff6fb8e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fighting a Gloom Wraith with magic in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fighting a Gloom Wraith with magic in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea4d4228ebc3454606da9df7ff6fb8e5" data-recommend-id="image://ea4d4228ebc3454606da9df7ff6fb8e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fighting a Gloom Wraith with magic in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Gilgondorin will tell you the tale of the lost ship before sending you back to the Emma May.

He’s the cause of the mutiny, and he carries a key that unlocks the backroom, which is where you’ll find Blakely’s corpse.

                <p><a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2474026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google</a> will be making a major policy change on who will be allowed to stream on YouTube, which will affect a lot of young people. As of July 22, new guidelines state that the minimum age required to livestream will be raised to 16.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, YouTube allows teens aged 13 and above to stream solo, as is also the case with Twitch. However, the new rules (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-changes-live-streaming-policy/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a>) will mean that creators will need to be 16 years or older to livestream on the platform. Children between the ages of 13-15 will still be allowed to appear on a livestream but the policy states that they must be "visibly accompanied by an adult" or else their live chat will be disabled and their account "may temporarily lose access to live chat or other features."</p><p dir="ltr">These new measures may impact young creators trying to build an online following without the intrusion of parental supervision, but it's also a sign that YouTube is prioritising online safety for children. The policy is also only regarding livestreaming, so there does not currently appear to be any new age restriction when it comes to posting pre-recorded videos.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-putting-restrictions-on-kids-in-social-hangouts/1100-6527648/" data-ref-id="1100-6527648">Roblox also placed new restrictions on its youngest users</a> by restricting kids under 13 from accessing unrated experiences or social hangouts, following repeated accusations that the platform was failing to protect children from would-be predators.</p>

			<p>Before we saw the official reveal of Resident Evil Requiem during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">Summer Game Fest</a> event, there were <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-delayed/">rumors that the next entry into the historically linear franchise would be an open-world game</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we know Resident Evil 9, officially called Resident Evil Requiem, is in fact not an open-world game, and closer to what players expect from the series, it's easy to dismiss those rumors as just that - rumors. Well, according to Capcom, those were not rumors and were indicative of how Requiem began its development journey.</p>
<p>In an extended version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-shows-off-brief-look-at-first-and-third-person-gameplay-as-resident-evil-requiem-takes-players-back-to-raccoon-city/">Resident Evil Requiem Creator's Message video</a> that's only available through the <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/video.html">Resident Evil Portal on Capcom's website</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-reveals-resident-evil-requiem-started-as-an-online-game-but-we-realised-fans-didnt-want-it/">VGC</a>), director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed the rumors were true, though Capcom pivoted from its open-world approach after concluding that this wasn't the direction players wanted the series to go in.</p>
<p>"<em>You might have heard some of the</em> <em>rumors</em>," Nakanishi began. "<em>Things like an online Resident Evil or an open-world Resident Evil, which we spent some time experimenting with. But in the end, although we had some interesting concepts, we realized that it wasn't what fans wanted to see or play. So we went back to the drawing board and created what led to Resident Evil Requiem.</em>"</p>
<p>Having the context that those rumors were true, and that Resident Evil 9 was almost an open-world, potentially online-focused game, makes the opening statement from producer Masachika Kawata make a lot of sense, as he begins his section of the Creator's Message video by clarifying that Resident Evil Requiem "<em>is an offline single-player game</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Creators' Message - Capcom Spotlight June 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hiC3qpghP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a time when it feels like many of the bigger publishers and developers are trying to push an online focus onto historically offline single-player games, it's nice to hear a story where the team realized early enough that things needed to go in a different direction.</p>
<p>It makes you wonder how different things could have been for other games that we know went through a similar process, like how <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-details-dragon-age-the-veilguards-troubled-development-and-how-eas-attempt-to-turn-bioware-into-a-live-service-studio-plagued-the-game-all-the-way-to-launch/">EA's leadership kept pushing for Dragon Age to be a live service title</a> and realized far too late in the development of what became Dragon Age: The Veilguard that they had been barking up the wrong tree. And we all know<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/"> how that went</a>.</p>
<p>At least in the case of Resident Evil Requiem, we can look forward to its release next year with plenty of excitement, as Capcom is on a hot-streak of excellent releases. Perhaps that has something to do with their leaders having more than just hollow space and dollar signs in the six inches between their ears.</p>

            <p>Riot Games are going to let their top <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League Of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> esports teams receive sponsorship from gambling companies, in a bid to snaffle up some of the billion dollar unofficial sports betting scene that surrounds both games.</p>
<p>The publishers promise that they'll put appropriate "guardrails" in place to ensure that streams of tournaments aren't suddenly overrun by shady gambling ads, and to protect players and viewers from the psychological impacts of gambling. They even think it'll be beneficial to the community, in supposedly giving Riot more control of the existing esports gambling business. But the overriding rationale here is very much 'this is a big dirty pie and we'd rather like a slice'. </p>
<p>The change in policy will only apply to tier 1 League of Legends and Valorant teams in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. "We know sports betting isn't for everyone, and that some fans have strong feelings about it, and we respect that," Riot's head of publishing and esports John Needham <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships">explains in a blog post</a>. "However, the reality is that betting activity already exists around our sports and will continue whether we engage with it or not. </p>
<p>"Historically, this has been a restricted sponsorship category, and Riot has not engaged with betting companies," he continues. "Teams have asked us to reconsider our stance, and after years of analysis to ensure we got it right, we agreed it was time to open up this category to create more revenue opportunities for teams."</p>
<p>Needham supports this with a few figures taken from a <a href="https://sportradar.com/">Sportsradar</a> analysis. Apparently, "the total betting turnover globally involving just LoL Esports and VCT reached $10.7 billion in 2024". However, "70% of bets across all sports are placed in unregulated markets with bookmakers who aren't licensed". Riot feel it's "better to engage in allowing betting sponsorships - thoughtfully, carefully, and with the right protections - than to sit on the sidelines while risks to fans and integrity go unchecked." In other words, Riot are of the opinion that the best way to protect people from the gambling companies is to team up with them.</p>
<p>As for the "guardrails" against predatory or anti-competitive behaviour on the part of either the bookies or their player partners: sports betting companies hoping to sign a deal with one of Riot's partner teams will need to be vetted by Riot. Those companies will also need to make use of GRID, a third-party esports data-gathering platform, who partnered with Riot in 2023. As Needham comments, "using clean, official data is critical to weakening black markets and stopping shady operators from taking advantage of fans and pros". The teams themselves will need to set up an "Internal Integrity Program", to ensure they don't do anything dodgy, though Needham doesn't specify what such a program might consist of.</p>
<p>While the sports betting sponsorship will only be available to Tier 1 League Of Legends or Valorant esports teams, "a portion of Riot's revenues earned from the sports betting program" will be spent on prize pools, new tournaments and training for the Tier 2 bracket.</p>
<p>The last reassurance in the blog post is aimed at viewers: Riot-owned broadcast and social channels will remain "betting-free, which means no ads, no sponsored segments from betting partners, and no betting partner logos on team jerseys", though this doesn't appear to apply to co-streams. Teams will get to decide how sports betting shows up on their own channels "within the guidelines of the sponsorship program, content platform ToS, and local regulations".</p>
<p>As Connor Makar unfolds over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-opens-the-door-to-betting-sponsorships-in-professional-league-of-legends-and-valorant">Eurogamer</a>, the context for these announcements is that the esports industry is in need of a cash injection, post-Covid-lockdowns and following the demise of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> League in particular. Riot and parent company Tencent are in the mood to boost their numbers, going by the language around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">recent layoffs</a>. Still, none of this is really in the interest of everyday players and viewers, especially the many children who watch esports tournaments and follow the top teams. Gambling is a <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/gambling">public health problem</a>, and now, League Of Legends and Valorant are part of it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-will-let-gambling-companies-sponsor-league-of-legends-and-valorant-esports-teams]]></content:encoded>

            <p>For a little while now, a group of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> modders have been working on adding a custom adventure to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">the RPG</a> that'll see you travel to Minthara's hometown via some locations you'll remember from previous Baldur’s Gate games. It's called Path to Menzoberranzan, and its devs have now gotten thir first build working, with demo-related news seemingly just around the corner.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.vg247.com/baldurs-gate-3-path-to-menzobarranzan-custom-campaign-mod-interview">interviewed Lotrich and Tomobamba</a>, the mod's project lead and lead writer, about their creation earlier this year, around the time they'd set their sights on releasing a demo in mid 2025, with a full release to follow at some point down the line depending on how that went. Since then they've been hard at work building and fleshing out the likes of custom locations, bosses, and a whole cast of new companions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1293115909166075915/1293115909166075918/1387740347387482203">latest monthly progress update</a> on Path to Menzoberranzan's Discord server, Lotrich lead off by announcing that the team had gotten their "first working build" up and running. "We’ve made big strides on the starting location," he wrote, "The build includes combat, dialogues, companions, and a slice of the story to dive into. We're not sharing it to public access, yet, but it will provide a solid foundation for our first demo in the future."</p>
<p>With the FAQ of the server still citing a January post about that mid 2025 demo release goal, and the calendar having now shuffled around to June, I reached out to Lotrich to see if he had any updates to offer demo-wise. The modder was keen to keep his cards close to his chest, but did tease that the team's keeping some demo-related news "under wraps just a little longer".</p>

<p>Moving back to the updates the PTM crew did share, Lotrich noted that they're "deep into research on implementing custom music". They've also been working on both new armour and 3D models for the mod's companions, who'll be a fresh cast of fully voice-acted faces, rather than the existing gang of Astarion, Shart, and the rest.</p>
<p>The modder added that "reorganizing the teams to streamline our workflow and make collaboration smoother for everyone" has been a focus, while PTM's PR team have been prepping "new types of videos to better showcase our progress, visuals, and behind-the-scenes efforts".</p>
<p>Up to this point, the looks that we've gotten at Path to Menzobarranzan's progress have come through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1k3pspn/custom_campaign_path_to_menzoberranzan_city/">screenshots</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lotrichexe4860">YouTube videos</a> Lotrich has been sharing every so often. There've been some interesting snippets of characters wandering around Athkatla, with the modders having told me in that chat earlier this year that their aim with the demo would be to deliver an explorable Waukeen's Promenade and Irenicus' Dungeon.</p>
<p>We'll have to see what the mod looks like once a playable version's out. The base version of Baldur's Gate 3's an incredibly tough act to follow for anyone, but it's been cool to see these modders and others trying complex stuff with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-will-add-official-mod-tools-this-september-making-it-even-easier-to-play-dungeon-master">modding tools Larian released last year</a>. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ambitious-baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mods-first-build-is-up-and-running-and-its-devs-are-teasing-demo-news-soon]]></content:encoded>

Fulghor is one of the toughest Nightlords to beat thanks to his hard-hitting attacks combined with relentless speed. If you're trying to get all of the Remembrances, then you'll already have attempted to beat Fulghor on more than one occasion. To unlock and fight his Everdark Sovereign version, you'll need to have bested him at least once. Beyond that, here's the best way to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight, including his weaknesses and our recommended builds.</p><h2 id="Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight_recommended_setup">Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight recommended setup</h2><p>The Darkdrift Knight, and in turn his Everdark Sovereign version, is weak to Lightning damage, but has resistance against Holy damage, as this is the type of damage he deals. You'll want to equip lightning-based relics such as the Dark Knight of Baron, which is acquired by beating the Sovereign Gaping Jaw, last week's Sovereign boss. If you didn't get that relic, choose any that boost Lightning attack power, strength, or dexterity stats.</p><p>On your way to the Sovereign Darkdrift Knight, make sure to interact with the Scale-Bearing Merchant if you come across him. He gives the option to grant resistance to status ailments, enhanced armaments, an additional sacred flask, runes, or improved physique. We chose to take the enhanced armament to increase the chances of getting anything Lightning-based. The best weapon to take to face him is the <strong>Bolt of Granssax</strong>. If you don't come across it, try to find any Lightning weapon. The <strong>Sword of Milos</strong> is also valuable, since it decreases the physical damage output of all bosses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522091" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522091"></a><figcaption>Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_beat_the_Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight">How to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight</h2><p>After fighting this boss for several hours, it's safe to say he's not easy to take down. He's certainly harder than Gaping Jaw, but it does depend on your playstyle. As standard, he starts at phase two of his regular boss fight, and will already have his darkened arm that he uses for long-range attacks. He also uses it to slam down and create an area-of-effect (AoE) attack. Dodging this enables you to get some close-range hits in, as he will pause for around three seconds before continuing his assault.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522092-everdark-sovereign-boss%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522092" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522092-everdark-sovereign-boss%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522092"></a><figcaption>Do not stand in the Darkdrift Knight's golden glow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522092-everdark-sovereign-boss%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>When Fulghor is charging an attack, you can stagger him by using heavy attacks. This is crucial to giving you and your teammates a window of opportunity to get some damage in. He will occasionally stampede through the arena using his lance. The golden light that he emits while doing this stampede will explode, so ensure you're not inside it when that happens.</p><p>Breaking the boss is easier with a Colossal weapon, so it's definitely recommended to hit him with heavy attacks as often as possible to enable you and your teammates to get damage in during those phases. This is most efficiently done as either the Raider or Wylder <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-nightreign-classes-and-tier-list/2900-6624/" data-ref-id="2900-6624">Nightreign classes</a>. Ironeye can use marking, which builds more Poise damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522095-everdark-sovereign-boss%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522095" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522095-everdark-sovereign-boss%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522095"></a><figcaption>When Fulghor points to the sky, run.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522095-everdark-sovereign-boss%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>During his next phase, Fulghor will spawn clouds that rain down arrows, which track you down. This is accompanied by a twinblade attack during which he will leap into the air and spin down to the ground with a slam. He also attacks with a regular bow with tracking arrows. The only way to avoid this is to run away--and fast. He will spin attack three times before concluding with the AoE slam.</p><p>If you see a wind effect on his blade, prepare for a wind attack. He will become faster and use a nuke attack. If he starts running and leaps high into the air, he's preparing to launch an explosive arrow with a massive AoE attack, which tracks. You'll either have to perfect dodge, perfect parry, or sprint away to give yourself more time to dodge it from a distance.</p><p>The most important strategy to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight is to remember to use your heavy attack. When he starts to aim, this is your crucial window to land heavy hits and break him. Then, your entire party can begin to hit him with as much damage as possible.</p><p>Repeat this process as many times as possible, remembering to prepare to perfect dodge three times when he begins his charge attacks. Though it is tricky timing, it is possible to perfect dodge those consecutive attacks. Eventually, he will be felled, and you can reap the rewards.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522099-everdark-sovereign-boss%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522099" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522099-everdark-sovereign-boss%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522099"></a><figcaption>You can purchase Fulghor's Enhanced Relic from the Collector Signboard after the fight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522099-everdark-sovereign-boss%283%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight_drops_and_rewards">Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight drops and rewards</h2><p>Upon defeat, the Sovereign Fulghor will drop <strong>25 Sovereign Sigils for the first defeat, and 10 for each subsequent defeat</strong>.

<p>The official PR release has got all the deets you need, fellow dino-hunters!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nightdive Studios’ remastered Turok trilogy is renowned for modernizing the iconic games and bringing an epic saga to current-generation platforms. When it was first released in 1997, Turok introduced gamers to a world teeming with cunning enemies, traps, puzzles, and deadly weapons, all within a vast 3D environment ready to explore. All three of these classic games feature upgraded gameplay, high-resolution textures, enhanced lighting and rendering, and support for console gamepads with platform-specific features to sink your teeth into!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Turok</strong><br>
A world where time has no meaning and evil knows no bounds. Torn from a world long gone, the time-traveling warrior Turok has found himself thrust into an unknown land torn by conflict. An evil overlord known as 'The Campaigner' seeks to shred the fabric of time and rule the universe using an ancient artifact known as 'The Chronoscepter'. The Chronoscepter was shattered thousands of years ago in an effort to keep it from falling into evil hands. The Campaigner has constructed a massive focusing array which he plans to use to magnify and contain the power of the Chronoscepter to shatter the barriers between the ages and rule the universe. Turok has vowed to find the eight pieces of the Chronoscepter spread throughout the Lost Land and put an end to The Campaigner's evil plot...</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</strong><br>
Having defeated the Campaigner, Turok throws the Chronocepter into a waiting volcano to destroy it. Unfortunately, the blast awakens an even deadlier force — the Primagen. Once again, Turok is tasked with restoring peace to the land and stopping the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world. The sequel to the hit game Turok features a host of enemies, weapons, missions, locations, and a new multiplayer mode.<br></em><em><strong><em><br>
Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</em></strong></em><em><br>
In the third game in the classic trilogy, players choose between dual protagonists Joseph and Danielle Fireseed, siblings of <em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em> protagonist Joshua Fireseed. Together, they must defeat the titular antagonist Oblivion and its followers, the Flesh Eaters, after the supposed demise of their brother at its hands.</em></p>

Between the battle system and overworld, he felt like he was almost making two games instead of one. Plus, he didn’t really have a story for the RPG and was worried battles felt monotonous compared to the strategizing of an<em> Into the Breach</em> or <em>Slay the Spire</em>. “I wanted to get it to a point where combat felt strategic and puzzly,” Robinson-Yu wrote. “But I got the sense that battles just felt like an annoying obstacle to players interested in exploring.”</p><p>The developer said that <em>A Short Hike</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-bittersweet-journey-of-a-short-hike-1841525700&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-bittersweet-journey-of-a-short-hike-1841525700">a chill, pretty, and occasionally bittersweet journey</a></span>, was unexpectedly lucrative for him, so he hasn’t been pinched for time. But a <em>Paper Mario</em>-like adventure wasn’t necessarily feeling like a fit for the type of games he’s interested in making. “I thought there was some dissonance between the cute and grounded world I was trying to make and the requirement for an RPG story to justify lots of fights and violence,” he wrote. “I’m not against video game violence, but it always felt at odds with the kinds of feelings I wanted to express at the time.”</p><p>Outside of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pumpkin Carving MMO</a></span>, Robinson-Yu hasn’t released anything since 2019, but he’s working on a bunch of things that might come out eventually, including an “action adventure game,” a different micro-RPG using Claymation, and an online platforming roguelike. Hopefully, one of those makes it to release, or at the very least we get a demos for them as well.</p><p>. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-untiled-rpg-short-hike-free-demo-1851785213]]></content:encoded>

Don’t get me wrong, it is a much harder thing to push us into progress, which we need.”</p><p>He also says that Trump’s “unanimous” victory (crucially, he did not win the 2024 election unanimously) happened because people were so mad about being told to be nice to people that they decided to send America spiraling into fascism. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/kashana.bsky.social/post/3ls6cey4cas2w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/kashana.bsky.social/post/3ls6cey4cas2w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It was either this or pronouns</a></span>, you know?</p><p>“I think that now that the pendulum has swung… we’re past wokeness,” Schulz said. “Wokeness is done.

This is distinctly inferior to most other weapon drops in<em> TWW </em>season two.</p><p><strong>To make more powerful weapons, you’ll need Sparks of Fortunes.</strong> This crafting reagent can be created by any character by combining two Fractured Sparks of Fortunes with 250 Valorstones. The former are an uncommon reward from many sources in 11.2, such as weekly quests or defeating raid bosses, while completing just about any activity in Khaz Algar awards you with at least a few Valorstones. Two-handed weapons require two Sparks to craft, while you only need 1 for a one-handed weapon.</p><figure id="" data-id="edf7acb499c52802c15050300bf935d7" data-recommend-id="image://edf7acb499c52802c15050300bf935d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="584" data-height="382" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an inventory screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows an inventory screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Thomas Wilde / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="edf7acb499c52802c15050300bf935d7" data-recommend-id="image://edf7acb499c52802c15050300bf935d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="584" data-height="382" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an inventory screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you use Sparks of Fortunes to create your weapon, it’s set to item level 634, and can go as high as 645.

However, they do cost Undermine Crests, which are given as a reward in delves, dungeons, and raids.</p><p><strong>You can get two Enchanted Runed Undermine (ERU) Crests for free in 11.1. </strong>One is given for hitting Renown level 20 with the Cartels of Undermine faction, which isn’t difficult. The other is one of the rewards for completing the raid quest “The House Loses,” which can be done by yourself in Story Mode.</p><figure id="" data-id="e7b2e583032c5b92739099d3c4cde6c4" data-recommend-id="image://e7b2e583032c5b92739099d3c4cde6c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1013" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters stand in an armor workshop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters stand in an armor workshop." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Thomas Wilde / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7b2e583032c5b92739099d3c4cde6c4" data-recommend-id="image://e7b2e583032c5b92739099d3c4cde6c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1013" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters stand in an armor workshop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>An ERU Crest can be used in your crafting materials to upgrade your weapon to a maximum of item level 658. If you also buy a Runed Augmentation Matrix from Syenite, which costs 15 Runed Crests, you can kick your weapon up to 661.</p><p>To get the most powerful crafted weapon, you’ll need to craft it with an Enchanted Gilded Undermine Crest. These can be purchased from Syenite for 60 Gilded Crests, and the matching Augmentation Matrix goes for another 30. With these, you can take your weapon all the way up to a maximum of 681 item level. This is only three levels worse than gear from the mythic Liberation of Undermine.</p><figure id="" data-id="1e29cc396709989de3b20a13d3a9c37a" data-recommend-id="image://1e29cc396709989de3b20a13d3a9c37a" data-format="jpg" data-width="532" data-height="364" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows delve details." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows delve details." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Thomas Wilde / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e29cc396709989de3b20a13d3a9c37a" data-recommend-id="image://1e29cc396709989de3b20a13d3a9c37a" data-format="jpg" data-width="532" data-height="364" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows delve details." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Collecting that many Gilded Crests can take a while unless you’re already doing mythic dungeons and/or raids. The easiest way for a casual player to get Gilded Crests is to run Tier 11 bountiful delves. Make sure to get and use a Delver’s Bounty for one of them. You should walk away with 30-50 Gilded Crests in a week as long as you don’t run out of lives.</p><p>Alternatively, if you’ve got a friend or an easily bribed acquaintance who’s into mythic dungeons or raids, they’ve probably got more Gilded Crests at this point than they know what to do with. You can file a recrafting order for them in Dornegal so they can use their surplus Crests to enhance your weapon.</p><p>When you write it all down, the process of acquiring a high-quality crafted weapon in <em>The War Within </em>looks complicated, but it’s not that bad once you’ve done it for yourself. If you’re a casual<em> WoW </em>player looking for a power boost, however, you can’t do much better than making and gradually upgrading your own custom equipment.</p><hr><p><br>Season two of <em>World of Warcraft: The War Within </em>is currently live as of June, 2025.  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-wow-war-within-11-1-weapon-crafting-1851785210]]></content:encoded>

In their primes, Cena was the superhero company man who always won regardless of the odds stacked against him or whether fans actually wanted him to, and, by contrast, Punk was the rebellious, tattoo-covered indie darling whose real talk and wrestling chops changed the industry forever.</p><p>The yin and yang dynamic created an unparalleled chemistry that continues to this day and will be on display in the ring for perhaps one final time.</p><p>As we inch closer to their clash at Night of Champions, airing on Peacock at 12 PM ET this Saturday (their first one-on-one bout in over 10 years), we’re looking back at the Tommy guns, pipebombs, and five-star matches that have made John Cena and CM Punk’s rivalry so magical.</p></div></div><div><p>John Cena and CM Punk’s story didn’t begin in the ring. It started at WrestleMania 22 in Chicago. </p><p>Cena was set to defend his WWE Championship against Triple H. Before Big Match John’s music hit, the ramp lifted and a 1940s-style gangster car drove to the ring. Standing on its right rocker panel was a man outfitted in a blue suit and gray fedora, holding a Tommy gun.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1jspe5h/before_this_coming_wrestlemania_the_closest_cm/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1jspe5h/before_this_coming_wrestlemania_the_closest_cm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The man</a></span> was CM Punk.</p><p>Dressing in a Halloween costume to be a prop for the face of the company isn’t exactly a glamorous job. But hey, at least Punk did technically get his WrestleMania main event moment out of it.</p><p>The best part of Cena’s cartoonish entrance is the fact that the song the gangsters drove out to was once in a famous cartoon. David Farnon’s “Cape Crusader” played in the episode of SpongeBob that introduced us to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KPJ5KjdBZk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KPJ5KjdBZk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy</a></span>. It hypes up their return to crime-fighting to serve as Bikini Bottom’s geriatric superheroes.</p><p>Do with that information what you will.</p></div><div><p>The first time Cena and Punk locked horns was on SmackDown’s 10th anniversary show. An 8-man tag match featured the duo on opposing teams, along with a bunch of no-names – ya know, guys like Shawn Michaels, Triple H, The Undertaker, Randy Orton, and Cody Rhodes. </p><p>Later that year, the Cenation Leader and future Best In The World finally met in the squared circle 1-on-1. At the peak of his mightiest powers, Super Cena quickly disposed of his opponent on two separate occasions, with the second bout lasting a whopping one minute and 41 seconds.</p><p>There’s not a whole lot to write home about their earliest encounters. That said, Cena’s smooth reversal of the GTS into an STF was born and went on to become a signature sequence for the pair.</p></div><div><p>The debut of the Nexus will forever be burned into the brains of fans old enough to remember watching it live. </p><p>Midway through Raw’s main event, every member of NXT Season 1 appeared and surrounded the ring. They stalked their prey, standing on the apron Shield-style, and descended on John Cena like a bunch of clickers who located an infected.</p><p>He wasn’t the group’s only target. Daniel Bryan choked out ring announcer Justin Roberts with his own tie. Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel mauled commentator Jerry “The King” Lawler. Wade Barrett ripped the canvas padding and foam cover off the ring mat to expose its wood planks.</p><p>They made ruining wrestling cool a decade-and-a-half before Cena did.</p><p>A forgotten figure in the melee? CM Punk, who fought John Boy prior to the interference. Needless to say, their match was completely overshadowed by the chaotic spectacle.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>In 2011, CM Punk posted an impressive 6-1 singles record against John Cena, with most of the damage (including four straight victories) coming before their Money in the Bank classic.</p><p>Sure, shenanigans were involved, but against Cena, a win is a win.</p><p>Their January 17 match on Raw in particular exhibited signs of a special chemistry. A frosted-tipped Punk had just formed the New Nexus (remember them?), while Cena was on his never-lose shit.</p><p>Both stars accentuated each other’s strengths, with the Chicago native locking in an unusual leg choke hold and Cena catching Punk in mid-air off a top-rope, springboard crossbody attempt to the outside.</p><p>The back-and-forth affair concluded when Punk weaseled his way to a DQ win, thanks to interference from former New Nexus member (and current <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIcs49yPG2G/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIcs49yPG2G/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cirque du Soleil star</a></span>) Mason Ryan.</p><p>It’s remarkable to think that the landscape-shifting Cena-Punk summer rivalry was just a few months down the road.</p></div><div><p>For years, Mr. Hustle, Loyalty, and Respect ruled the WWE kingdom. He was perpetually in the title picture, either holding the world championship or chasing it. He never, ever lost cleanly. He was the Thanos of sports entertainment: inevitable.</p><p>Then, there was Punk. A former indie wrestler, he had quietly built a formidable resume with multiple title wins and a series of show-stealing feuds (his rivalry with Jeff Hardy fed families). By mid-2011, his WWE contract was coming to an end, making it the perfect time to air out his grievances with the company. And he did. Loudly.</p><p>On a June episode of Raw, the Second City Saint casually dropped the best promo of the 21st Century. Punk’s pipebomb blurred the lines between truth and fiction with surgical precision.</p><p>He seamlessly played the role of disgruntled employee, claiming he wasn’t afforded the opportunities he deserved. Relatable. Punk hated the idea that John Cena was considered the best when, really, <em>he</em> was the best wrestler in the world. No arguments there.</p><p>It felt like Punk was speaking for the WWE Universe, fed up with the status quo. He vowed to defeat Cena for the WWE Championship in his hometown of Chicago at Money in the Bank and ride off into the sunset.</p><p>The Voice of the Voiceless would make good on his promise, and then some. He beat Cena at MITB to win the title, left, returned with a new theme song, and knocked off Cena again at SummerSlam, all while injecting a heavy dose of meta-realism into a stale product and becoming the greatest anti-hero since Steve Austin.</p><p>Punk was the undisputed star of the summer, but his impact was made possible by the sovereignty of Cena, who, as it turns out, was “evitable” after all.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>The next chapter of the John Cena-CM Punk saga took place the following summer. </p><p>Punk was the reigning WWE champion, the brass ring he spent years reaching for finally in his possession. Cena held the Money in the Bank briefcase and decided to cash in “honorably,” announcing his challenge on the special “Raw 1,000” episode ahead of time.</p><p>Mayhem ensued.</p><p>As the duo slugged it out, the Big Show interfered and attacked Cena, triggering a disqualification. The DQ finish meant not only that Punk retained, but that Big Match John was the first man to unsuccessfully cash in.</p><p>After the bell rang, a conflicted Punk turned his back to Show as he continued to dismantle the Cenation Leader. The Rock’s music hit, and he sprinted to the ring to make the save. As Rock was about to nail Show with the People’s Elbow, Punk delivered an unexpected clothesline to The Great One, followed up by a devastating GTS.</p><p>Punk’s heel turn stunned the WWE Universe, and it proved that he would stop at nothing to defend his title—even if it meant compromising his morals. Cena, as we know, was built different, and their contrasting principles would deepen their rivalry even more.</p></div><div><p>If you’re jonesing to watch a stellar wrestling match, revisit John Cena and CM Punk’s bout at Night of Champions in Boston.</p><p>A villainous Punk was going on 302 consecutive days as champ, and Cena looked to avenge his failed MITB cash-in attempt a few months prior. The stage was set for another legendary battle, and the rivals put on an absolute clinic.</p><p>Counter after counter, reversal after reversal, neither was able to gain the upper hand. So, they reached DEEP into their arsenals. Punk unleashed a flurry of submission holds, including a crossface and a muta lock. He even attempted a moonsault and landed a Rock Bottom! Cena hit a suicide dive to the outside and a massive top-rope leg drop.</p><p>In the best way possible, the match felt like it was never going to end. Both men kicked out of each other’s finisher…twice. Finally, Cena nailed a German Suplex from the second rope and bridged for a cover and pinfall.</p><p>It appeared that Cena got the victory; however, the ref handed Punk the title since both of their shoulders were down, signaling a draw.</p><p>The storytelling was perfect. The psychology was perfect. The ending was perfect. Punk and Cena showed why no one could touch them in the ring.</p></div><div><p>John Cena and CM Punk set the bar so high for their matches that each time they competed, you’d think it was their last. Like it was game 7, like their lives were on the line. </p><p>Little did they know, their bout on a February episode of Raw would indeed be their swan song—for the next 12 years, at least.</p><p>The contest determined who would go on to face The Rock in the main event of WrestleMania 29: Cena, the Royal Rumble winner, or Punk, who just lost his title.</p><p>The two dynamos followed the blueprint they created at Night of Champions for pulling off a five-star level match to perfection.</p><p>The Straight Edge Superstar reversed each of Cena’s five moves of doom, while John countered Punk’s various submission holds and GTS attempts. Cena landed a sit-down powerbomb, and Punk executed a piledriver (a legitimately banned move in the WWE).</p><p>In the end, it was a surprising hurricanrana and Attitude Adjustment combination that gave Cena the win.</p><p>The long-time rivals delivered another classic because, well, don’t they always?</p></div><div><p>Watching John Cena and CM Punk share the ring at the Royal Rumble felt like a dream. Witnessing them hug and then fight in the Elimination Chamber was like seeing a band reunite to perform the hits after decades apart.</p><p>Sure, Cena has less hair, Punk’s got a bit of grey in his beard, and they don’t move quite as well as they used to, but the magic remained. In the chamber, Cena’s reversal of the GTS into an STF harkened back to their first one-on-one match on that 2009 episode of Raw.</p><p>Ultimately, the West Newbury native capitalized on a wicked curb stomp from Seth Rollins to Punk on the steel, locking him in the STF and causing him to lose consciousness to pick up the W.</p><p>Minutes later, the most do-gooding superhero in WWE history did the unthinkable. He turned heel, laying the groundwork for him and Punk to potentially clash again.</p></div><div><p>How can John Cena and CM Punk top what they’ve done in the past? They couldn’t possibly have any more cards to play, right? Wrong. Lo and behold, the “never-seen,” 17-time champ pulled the ultimate Uno-reversal out of his jort pockets in the form of a reverse pipebomb. </p><p>Last week, Cena stole his long-time adversary’s material—the material that elevated Punk to superstardom—and co-opted it to troll him. Without John, the Voice of the Voiceless would have never gotten his stage to speak, reigned as WWE Champion for 434 days straight, or gone off to UFC and AEW.</p><p>When all is said and done, John Cena will always be CM Punk’s daddy.</p><p>With the former Cenation Leader a heel and the Best in the World a babyface (another reversal), this Saturday, the forever foes will meet in the ring at Night of Champions—the same PLE where they wrestled their best match 13 years ago.</p><p>Soon, we’ll find out if they can rise to the occasion once more.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/john-cena-cm-punk-rivalry-feud-timeline-1851785211]]></content:encoded>

The result was seen as a win by Helldivers 2's community, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-fan-makes-cape-design-out-of-steam-reviews">got to work designing their own versions of the game's commemorative capes</a> sporting the game's then-plummeting Steam review score graph.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, a year later, Arrowhead has finally released an official version for all players — with the graph-like design now dubbed the "Pillars of Freedom".</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In honor of their unquestioning commitment to the defense of Managed Democracy, the Helldivers have been awarded a commemorative cape," Arrowhead wrote via a new, in-universe update posted on social media.

Sonic the Hedgehog is getting three individual Secret Lair drops, and we've got the exclusive first look at one that's all about artifacts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the gallery below to see all 7 cards in the Turbo Gear Secret Lair drop:</strong></p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering – Secret Lair x Sonic: Turbo Gear</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-best-sellers">Final Fantasy crossover</a>, which is an entire draftable Magic set alongside four pre-constructed Commander decks, this Sonic crossover follows the blueprint of similar tie-ins by being limited to three Secret Lair drops. Secret Lair is what Magic calls its series of timed releases that contain just a handful of specific cards with special art, and they are all sold direct by Wizards of the Coast rather than in randomized packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In this case, the Turbo Gear drop has six exisiting Magic cards redone with new Sonic-themed art and names, as well as one token card. That includes a few fitting staples of Magic's most popular format, Commander, like Swiftfoot Boots and Lighting Greaves – because of course Sonic's shoes deserve their own cards. Also of note, a legendary vehicle called the Weatherlight is here as Tornado, Sonic's Biplane, and thanks to a recent rules change, you could actually have that be your Commander if you are so inclined.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">WOTC says this drop is designed to complement the cards in another one of the drops that focuses on Sonic's characters themselves. While we don't have those to reveal, an example given in Turbo Gear's store description is equipping The Reaver Cleaver, reimagined here as Knuckles's Gloves, to Knuckles himself. This idea goes hand-in-hand with other crossover drops, like 2023's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-magic-the-gathering-crossover-secret-lair-spoilers">Tomb Raider</a>, where the reprinted cards are meant to fit nicely with the new Legendary creatures, almost like a little "build your own Commander deck" starter kit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Turbo Gear Secret Lair drop (as well as the other two) will go on sale on July 14 at 9am PT on <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official Secret Lair website</a>, and will cost $29.99 for the non-foil version or $39.99 for foil. You better get there on time, too, because they will only be available in a limited quantity – and if other recent crossovers are any indication, they will likely sell out fast. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

<p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692648/microsoft-bsod-black-screen-of-death-color-change-official" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a>, Microsoft's vice president of enterprise and OS security David Weston said, “This is really an attempt on clarity and providing better information and allowing us and customers to really get to what the core of the issue is so we can fix it faster. Part of it is just cleaner information on what exactly went wrong, where it’s Windows versus a component.”</p><p dir="ltr">The new design is expected to roll out "later this summer" in a Windows 11 update. This will also include a new Quick Machine Recovery feature, designed to quickly restore machines that can’t boot. These new changes can be seen as Microsoft bolstering Windows following last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/finally-deleting-part-of-system32-can-actually-fix-your-computer/1100-6525156/">CrowdStrike incident</a> when the BSOD affected millions of Windows machines, leading to one of the biggest server outages in history.</p><p dir="ltr">Windows is also taking a more headlining role in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/">next generation of Xbox consoles</a>, as Sarah Bond said the vision is to create a platform where games are "always with you" across devices, while games are not "locked to a single store."
