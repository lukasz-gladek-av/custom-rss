			<p><strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> isn't ready to release its next mainline entry into <strong>The Witcher </strong>series just yet, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-will-not-appear-at-the-game-awards-2025/"><strong>The Witcher 4</strong> was absent from recent shows like <strong>The Game Awards</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">won't arrive until "<em>at least</em>" <strong>2027</strong> according to CDPR</a>. That said, we are getting a new Witcher game much sooner than next year, with <strong>Reigns: The Witcher</strong>, a new "<em>swipe'em up</em>" game from developer <strong>Nerial</strong> and publisher <strong>Devolver Digital</strong>, arriving on PC and mobile devices on <strong>February 25, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Reigns: The Witcher takes you back through Geralt's adventures, though not exactly in the same way they played out in the original story. Instead, all of his adventures are told through the bard, Dandelion. You'll swipe left or right at different points in the adventure to steer the story one way or another, before the tale ends with Geralt faced with an untimely demise, in one way or another.</p>



<p>At the end of every run, Dandelion adds to his log of tales to be told on stage, increasing your ability to string together a truly gripping story, even if it's one that doesn't exactly stay true to how you remember it happening originally.</p>

<p>This is the sixth entry in Nerial's Reigns series, which will officially be a full decade old this coming August 2026. After the initial <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/474750/Reigns/?curator_clanid=39063225">Reigns </a></strong>title and its <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/717640/Reigns_Her_Majesty/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Her Majesty</a></strong> follow-up, Nerial immediately started applying the formula to other franchises, to great success, with Reigns games based on <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/897820/Reigns_Game_of_Thrones/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Game of Thrones</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437040/Reigns_Three_Kingdoms/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Three Kingdoms</a></strong>. The studio also has a sci-fi variant called <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663400/Reigns_Beyond/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Reigns: Beyond</a></strong>, which was the most recent release before the upcoming The Witcher variant.</p>



<p>Nerial is also the same studio behind one of 2022's more intriguing indie games, <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371720/Card_Shark/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Card Shark</a></strong>, which turned plenty of heads with its striking visual style and deceitful gameplay.</p>



<p>Even though we'll have to wait until 2027 for The Witcher 4, hopefully, this spin-off Reigns title isn't the last we hear about The Witcher in 2026, and we'll have an official word <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/">on the rumoured <strong>The Witcher 3 DLC</strong> </a>that is said to arrive sometime this year.</p>

Maisy the Cow? We're less sure about that last one.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, Geralt's quests are retold as plays by Dandelion, who holds the hero's fate in his hands. Whether sticking to the facts or stretching the truth, you'll need to keep Geralt's infamy in balance to ensure your run continues for as long as possible. And while your adventures with Geralt are likely to end in many deaths, each run will reward you with songbooks to perform on ever grander stages in the hope of ultimately reaching narrative immortality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reigns: The Witcher is developed by Reigns series developer Nerial, and set for launch on February 25 for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651600/Reigns_The_Witcher/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> and on mobile via Google Play and the iPhone App Store. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of Reigns: The Witcher this spring feels well-timed, amid a temporary lull in the launch of CD Projekt's bestselling series.

It's a mixture of cinematics and gameplay. Check it out above. And if you know anything about this universe, you probably won't be surprised that the Orks are literally driven by mayhem and sporting a reckless, no-nonsense offensive playstyle. What you may not have been expecting is the scale of the carnage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In particular, we get a great look at the Ork superunit, the Gorkanaut, which can crumple up dreadnoughts and go toe-to-toe with the likes of an Imperial Knight. Towering over the battlefield at a scale that sets Dawn of War apart from its predecessors, the number of guns on this thing could be described as both bewildering and hilarious. And that's just what the Orks are about.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War 4 has been our IGN First "cover story" all January long.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/868711/spry-fox-netflix-game-studio-indie-spirit-crossing</link>
            <guid>1417882</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/31/23433526/netflix-spry-fox-cozy-gaming-studio-acquisition">Netflix first acquired cozy game developer Spry Fox in 2022</a>, it made a lot of sense. The studio had been around for over a decade and had several hits with mobile games like <em>Triple Town</em> and <em>Alphabear.</em> That approachable style of puzzle game seemed like a good fit for Netflix’s mobile-first strategy, and, as Spry Fox cofounder David Edery tells me, the partnership also meant that the team could focus on making the experiences they wanted to build without having to worry about monetization. “We just never were that good at making money from our games,” Edery explains.</p><p>Now, three years later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837632/another-change-for-netflixs-games">Spry Fox is once again independent</a> after buying itself out from Netflix. The news comes as the streaming service’s fledgling gaming efforts are shifting, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/820289/netflix-casual-party-game-multiplayer-tetris-pictionary">a focus on TV-based games</a> as opposed to mobile titles. Even studios behind successful games, like <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">have been shuttered</a> as part of the changes. But for Spry Fox, the decision to separate from Netflix was done for a different reason: to reach as large an audience as possible with the studio’s upcoming MMO <a href="https://playspiritcrossing.com/"><em>Spirit Crossing</em></a>.</p><p>“At some point, I increasingly became concerned about the fact that being a Netflix member-only game was a real issue for it,” Edery explains. “It’s a highly social game. People want to be able to play with their friends. If their friends are not Netflix members, that’s kind of a problem.”</p><p><em>Spirit Crossing</em> is a large-scale multiplayer game about fostering friendship and community in a fantastical and adorable world. It’s the biggest experience the studio has ever made, but also feels like a natural progression; after achieving success with those early mobile titles, Spry Fox pushed further into the so-called “cozy” genre with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352488/cozy-grove-review-apple-arcade-switch-ps4-xbox-steam">the <em>Animal Crossing</em>-style series <em>Cozy Grove</em></a>. While those games are single-player, <em>Spirit Crossing</em> aims to do something similar but in a virtual world filled with lots of players. The goal is ambitious. “We genuinely believe this is our chance to reduce loneliness in the world,” says Edery. “That’s the sum total of everything that we care about.”</p><p>Development on <em>Spirit Crossing</em> predates the Netflix deal, and in fact represents something of a brief history of indie game funding over the last few years. The game’s initial prototype began life as an exclusive for Google’s Stadia streaming service. After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond">Stadia’s high-profile implosion</a>, Spry Fox retained ownership of the project, and eventually <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epicgames.com%2Fsite%2Fen-US%2Fnews%2Fepic-games-announces-publishing-partnerships-with-eyes-out-and-spry-fox" rel="sponsored">Epic picked up the game</a> as part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195152/epic-games-publishing-label-control-last-guardian-inside">its relatively new publishing initiative</a>.</p><div><p>“We genuinely believe this is our chance to reduce loneliness in the world.”</p></div><p>“That was great because they were very supportive and they gave us a big budget,” Edery says of working with Epic. “And then the Netflix thing kind of came out of nowhere. I wasn’t looking to be acquired at the time, and I certainly didn’t think it would be Netflix of all companies, but they came by and it seemed like a good idea for a few different reasons.”</p><div><p>From the outside, Netflix’s efforts in gaming have seemed chaotic. The company has tried everything from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645952/black-mirror-game-thronglets-season-7-netflix">games based on its shows</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">building a AAA studio</a> without much success. Last year at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">Netflix’s president of games, Alain Tascan, outlined a new plan</a> focused on specific types of games, including what he called “mainstream” titles aimed at large audiences, of which <em>Spirit Crossing</em> was shown as an example. Of late, however, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/845965/netflix-fifa-soccer-football-game-tv-delphi-interactive-world-cup">Netflix seems mostly focused on cloud-based games played on TVs instead of phones</a>.</p></div><p>Despite all of that, Edery says the team at Spry Fox wasn’t impacted much by Netflix’s changing priorities. “We were essentially brought in to make and launch <em>Spirit Crossing</em>,” he says. “We just kept doing what we were doing, so I think we were less affected by changes than maybe other folks internally would have been. We had a pretty clear vision and, for better or worse, we weren’t going to be steered off of that.”</p><p>Edery says that at each stage, from Stadia to Netflix, <em>Spirit Crossing</em> grew in scope and ambition. And eventually it became clear that a game built around connecting as many people as possible didn’t fit so snugly in Netflix’s plans, which limit the platforms a game can launch on. Edery notes that <em>Cozy Grove</em>, for example, was most successful on the Nintendo Switch, where cozy games are very popular. “Not being able to be on the Switch is a real limitation, possibly a really problematic limitation,” he says of <em>Spirit Crossing</em>.</p><div><p>“Not being able to be on the Switch is a real limitation”</p></div><p>So the split from Netflix was done in the best interest of the game; while a Switch version has yet to be announced, <em>Spirit Crossing</em> will be coming to PC in addition to the iPhone and Android. And there’s still a partnership with Netflix in place, as the mobile version will still be free and exclusive to subscribers. “It still has to make sense for Netflix,” Edery notes. But there are obvious risks involved in going independent, and already the team is making sacrifices. <a href="https://spryfox.com/a-16-year-old-baby-is-born-miracles-do-happen/">Edery says that he and fellow cofounder Daniel Cook have reduced their salaries to $20,000 a year</a>.</p><p>The majority of development on <em>Spirit Crossing</em> was finished during the three years Spry Fox was under the Netflix umbrella, and the team expects to launch the game this year. (<a href="https://playspiritcrossing.com/">You can currently sign up to play an alpha of the game</a>.) Even before <em>Spirit Crossing</em> launches, Spry Fox’s long journey back to independence represents a rare positive story in an industry plagued with layoffs, cancellations, and studio closures. But there’s one big thing the team still has left to do, and it’s not something Edery is looking forward to: “We have to figure out how to make money now.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/868711/spry-fox-netflix-game-studio-indie-spirit-crossing]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Anime AI Closed Captioning Situation Is Crazy]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/anime-ai-subtitles-closed-captioning-no-gun-no-life/</link>
            <guid>1417870</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_captioning?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Closed captioning</u></a> has been around since the 70s with the express purpose of creating subtitles as a “transcription or translation of the dialogue when sound is available but not understood” by the viewer, whether sound is muted, drowned out by ambient noise, or the user is deaf or hard of hearing. Closed captions by and large are all but essential in today’s media landscape, either because actors whisper or a show’s dynamic range is screwy. A lot of people watch TV with subtitles these days, including English-speaking anime fans. Unfortunately for those anime fans, the closed captioning for Crunchyroll shows over the past couple of years has severely declined in quality, and it looks like it's going to become an even bigger problem for how we watch anime industry-wide.&nbsp;</p><figure><a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/crunchyroll-fails-to-meet-industry-standards-for-closed-captioning/?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Crunchyroll fails to meet industry standards for Closed Captioning - Anime Feminist</p><p>Despite having a near-complete monopoly on the anime streaming industry in 2024, Crunchyroll does not offer closed captioning for the majority of its English dubs.</p><p><span>Vrai Kaiser</span></p></div></a></figure><p>These issues were first brought to light by <a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/crunchyroll-fails-to-meet-industry-standards-for-closed-captioning/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Anime Feminist back in 2024</u></a>, where writer Vrai Kaiser wrote that in the wake of Crunchyroll’s huge merger with Funimation for <a href="https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/sony-pictures-tv-funimation-acquisition-1202511492/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>$143 million</u></a>, the anime streamer didn’t meet the industry standard for closed captioning with its English-dubbed shows. In the piece, Kaiser noted that outside of a few Toonami shows like <em>Attack on Titan</em> and <em>My Hero Academia</em>, most shows don’t have closed captioning. It was an issue Funimation remedied back in the day to ensure all of its English-dubbed shows had closed captioning options in accordance with the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/closed-captioning-video-programming-delivered-using-internet-protocol-ip?ref=aftermath.site"><u>CCVAA</u></a>), but that change didn’t carry over when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crunchyroll-workshopping-solution-for-funimation-users-lost-digital-libraries?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Crunchyroll merged Funimation’s library</u></a> into its own in 2022—a merger that led to fan outrage over <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crunchyroll-president-responds-to-concerns-over-lost-digital-copies-due-to-funimation-merger?ref=aftermath.site"><u>losing digital anime content they once owned on Funimation</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, Kaiser reported that as of February 2024, a Crunchyroll spokesperson said it was still working to add more closed captions to its catalog.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B-DX0Zolr6g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Absolute State of Crunchyroll"></iframe></figure><p>At worst, Crunchyroll’s subtitling creates the annoying scenario where you’re given two options: English and English CC. The first option translates Japanese text written within the show, where things like text messages, signage, and the like are translated in concert with dialogue—something that’s especially helpful for readers who are either curious or need to know <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwOvgfpI7Xo&amp;pp=ygUTY3VsbGluZyBnYW1lcyBydWxlcw%3D%3D&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>all the fucking rules in <em>Jujutsu Kaisen Culling Game Part 1</em></u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The latter, in theory, provides viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing with captions that convey information about background noise and speaker changes within a show. But more often than not, Crunchyroll’s closed captioning, alongside its subtitling as of late, has become a far cry from what the company used to offer. This is a result of the popularity of anime rising exponentially. Crunchyroll as a company has an insatiable need to beef up the quantity of its shows in its streaming catalogue without giving a damn about the quality of its localizations. While Crunchyroll has claimed it doesn’t use AI for its subtitles or closed captions, the kinds of errors being made in these captions have made viewers suspicious. Especially, because, well, they have been caught red handed before.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:g3lhmk72xsmti52dckfnclef/app.bsky.feed.post/3lswcbtkwec2t" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigmeoi7mwfovh7r6w2jhbygbly4kiyxeextt4qyupnfcsybrth4qq"><p lang="en">Beyond disappointed to find Necronomico and the Cosmic Horror Show's subs on @crunchyroll.com are blatantly and openly ChatGPT.

Speaking with Aftermath, a spokesperson provided a statement saying the “AI-generated subtitles were employed by a third-party vendor, which is in violation of our agreement.” After that, the show’s German subtitles no longer include the ChatGPT prefix, according to <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-07-01/crunchyroll-german-necronomico-and-the-cosmic-horror-show-subtitles-listed-chatgpt/.226206?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Anime News Network.</u></a> However, that hasn’t stopped the anime from having a bit of a tarnished reputation as the “AI” show online in the wake of its subtitling incident.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crunchyroll's episode 6 dub release of The Banished Court Magician was  late, probably due to some internal issues. When it finally went up, the  primary JP-EN subtitle track had been accidentally replaced with a dub  closed caption track revealing Ollang in the file headers. <a href="https://t.co/sNpp1a5QeG?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/sNpp1a5QeG</a></p>— Daiz (@Daiz42) <a href="https://twitter.com/Daiz42/status/1993599878925046112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>The second time was last November, in a report from <a href="https://animecorner.me/crunchyroll-appears-to-use-ai-generated-closed-captioning-in-fall-2025-anime-the-banished-court-magician-aims-to-become-the-strongest/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Anime Corner</u></a>, where former Fakku developer <a href="https://x.com/Daiz42/status/1993599878925046112?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Daiz</a> posted on Twitter that Crunchyroll appeared to have used AI in the closed captioning for the sixth episode of the show, <em>The Banished Court Magician Aims to Become the Strongest</em>. Upon further digging from Daiz, they discovered that the episode’s screwy closed captions were because Crunchyroll was working with <a href="https://ollang.com/?lng=en&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ollang</u></a>, a San Francisco-based company that, you guessed it, touts its usage of AI to get the job done using buzzy corpo speak like “optional human-in-the-loop” and “localization, reimagined for the modern enterprise.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mind you, Crunchyroll president Rahul Purini told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2025/04/08/inside-crunchyrolls-latest-plans-to-expand-the-anime-universe/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Forbes</u></a> last April, “We are not considering AI in the creative process, including our voice actors. We consider them to be creators because they are contributing to the story and plot with their voice.”&nbsp;</p><p>Forbes also noted that Purini added that they are, however, looking at AI to improve back-end systems and enhance the customer experience through features such as discoverability, recommendations, and personalization, rather than touching the shows themselves.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>(Images: Crunchyroll/Madhouse)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The most recent example came from the folks in the Aftermath Discord. In the third episode of <em>No Gun No Life</em>, an anime about a detective with a gun for a head, eagle-eyed viewers pointed out some really weird closed captions. In this scene, two characters approach the gun-headed detective, with one of them saying, “So you’re Juzo, the Resolver?” However, with the English closed captioning on for the show, the pair instead approach him saying, “So your Jews are resolver?” A slip-up, sure. But given that Crunchyroll has been caught using AI for its captions before, it has set a precedent for fans to believe any mistranslation in their closed captioning <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-goonswarm-fortnite-postal/"><u>must be due to AI</u></a>. Aftermath reached out to Crunchyroll for comment about its closed captioning and whether AI is involved in the process.</p><p>There have been instances where bullying has convinced companies like Amazon to reverse its AI initiatives, such as abysmal <a href="https://aftermath.site/prime-video-ai-beta-english-dub-anime-banana-fish-no-game-no-life/"><u>AI dubbing</u></a>. But companies tend to follow the leader, and one of Crunchyroll’s major competitors in the anime market, Netflix, has had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-is-now-using-ai-for-subtitle-localization-custom-ads-and-more?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter"><u>no qualms about publicly stating that they will use AI in subtitles</u></a>. </p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders is Getting a New Ban System, But Players Don’t Think It’s Tough Enough]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ban-system-not-enough/</link>
            <guid>1417837</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders underwent a major update today as Embark Studios delivered Headwinds, the first of <strong>four </strong>content drops coming between now and April. It introduced seven new quests, a minor map condition, two new Augments, and some other bits and pieces. The team at Embark also revealed that, very soon, a new anti-cheat <strong>ban system </strong>will be implemented to combat malicious players.</p>



<p>In a footnote in the patch notes for the recent ARC Raiders update, the team explained that a permaban is the result of a cheating spree, but players don’t think getting to that point is happening <strong>fast enough </strong>for it to be effective.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-need-tougher-anti-cheat">Does ARC Raiders Need Tougher Anti-Cheat?</h2>



<p>Over the festive period, ARC Raiders players were suffering under the weight of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploits, cheaters</a>, and a bit of content stagnation brought on by everyone at Embark Studios going off on a well-deserved break.</p>



<p>Now that they’re back, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-four-months-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive roadmap</a> has been revealed, detailing content up to April 2026.</p>



<p>Today, the first part of that roadmap, an update dubbed ‘Headwinds’, was delivered. It introduced some fresh content, a map condition that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fills Buried City with birds</a>, and seven short new quests for players to conquer. It effectively opens up some of the game’s lore, too.</p>



<p>However, one element in the recent patch notes hasn’t filled players with the joy that the positive notes have.</p>



<p>Almost at the end <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-13-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of the update</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A three strikes progressive ban system is in the process of being implemented. Bans will progress from 30 days, to 60 and finally a permaban for repeat offenders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Those who tussled with these more malicious players in recent weeks feel that the ban loop isn’t strong enough for anyone <strong>caught cheating</strong>. The item was subtitled ‘Anti-Cheat’, but it reads like this is a <strong>general </strong>approach to banning players caught breaking the rules, and not <em>just </em>cheaters.</p>



<p>In any case, a cheater being banned for just 30 days feels like little more than a slap on the wrist. The second infraction earns them a 60-day penalty, but it takes <strong>three offences </strong>for them to receive a permanent ban. That’s three times that somebody could be caught <strong>using cheats to manipulate the game </strong>before Embark Studios says, ‘Enough.’</p>



<p>Other extraction shooters, like Escape from Tarkov, issue permanent bans upon <strong>a single detection </strong>of cheating, and they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheaters-banned-battlestate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly reveal which users</a> have been kicked from the game. Sure, they might make a new account and come back, but the strong-arm approach is there at the initial stage.</p>







<p>Do you think ARC Raiders needs tougher anti-cheat, and that Embark Studios is risking displeasing the majority of its userbase? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>Eman Ayaz, the actor believed to be playing Farah in the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, has said she found out - like the rest of us - that the project had been cancelled online.</p>
<p>"Last week I experienced the most devastating moment of my career," <a href="https://x.com/emanayazz/status/2015623611680210980">Eman Ayaz said in a video shared on X</a>. Her brother messaged her asking if she was okay, which prompted a puzzled response, so he sent her a link to the news and then she realised what was going on. "And that's where I read it has been shelved forever," Ayaz said. "I was just in total shock."</p>

<p>Ayaz, 26 years old, does not name the project she was involved in, for NDA reasons. Nor does she mention Ubisoft or Prince of Persia or Sands of Time. But the timelines match up - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft announced it was cancelling the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake last week</a> - and Ayaz has allegedly retweeted Prince of Persia content on her X account before, though I can't find these tweets - perhaps they have been deleted. That's what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qnj46j/after_prince_of_persia_sands_of_time_remake/">people on Reddit seem to suggest</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>"We were all really looking forward to it being released this year"</em></blockquote>
<p>In her video, Ayaz said this project was "life-changing" for her, because there aren't many big roles for Canadian Pakistanis, who tend to be "unplaceable" from a casting point of view. She said she landed the job three years ago after a "rigorous" audition process and was planning to use its release to springboard a move to the US. This was her stepping-stone moment but now it's not to be.</p>
<p>"I have dedicated the last three years of my life to this project," Ayaz said; she even went as far as acting with a broken foot, apparently. "And I've waited and waited for the day it was finally going to be released and I could finally talk about it." She filmed marketing material recently, she said, within the past couple of months. "We were all really looking forward to it being released this year, so it felt like emotional whiplash to find this out in such a random way."</p>

<p>Because the project has been cancelled, Ayaz can't apparently publicly attach her name to it. "It's just as if it never existed," she said, "which is a hard thing to wrap your head around when it's been your life for so long. This project existed, even if the world never got to see it."</p><p>Ubisoft announced the Sands of Time remake cancellation last week as part of major restructuring at the company, closing two studios, cancelling six projects, and delaying several other games. The Sands of Time remake was the only cancelled game named, and the blanket reason given for the cancellations was the games "do not meet the new enhanced quality [and] more selective portfolio prioritisation criteria". The Sands of Time project had been struggling for a while, however, having been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">announced in 2020</a> and suffering multiple delays since then.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years">restructuring knocked a third off of Ubisoft's share price</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-worker-unions-reportedly-vote-to-strike-as-publisher-proposes-200-voluntary-redundancies">strikes are expected in France, where Ubisoft is headquartered</a>, in response to a voluntary redundancy initiative.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terraria">Terraria</a> dev Re-Logic is kicking off 2026 in style with the <em>monster</em> 'Bigger and Boulder' update, rolling out on Switch today.</p>
<p>As is so often the case with Terraria content updates, this is a big one. The headline additions are a new crafting interface and inventory management tweaks, a fresh World Seed menu, and brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/palworld">Palworld</a> crossover content. Of course, there's much more besides, including improved lighting and language support, new blocks and decor, bonus transformations and more bug fixes than you'd think possible.</p>
<p>The full patch notes for ver. 1.4.5 were shared on the <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-1-4-5-bigger-boulder-available-now.145773/#post-3386339">official Terraria forums</a>, and we have gathered together everything in the 'Content Changes &amp; Additions' section for you to check out below — you'd be here all day if we included the 'Balance Changes' and 'Bug Fixes' too, but those are also available in the forum post for you to read at your own leisure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Hytale,</strong> the <strong>Minecraft-like</strong> MMO that went through a long journey of <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/">the game being acquired by a major publisher</a>, only <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">to be shut down by said publisher</a>, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/">saved by its original creators</a>, and finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/long-awaited-minecraft-like-mmo-hytale-launches-early-access/">put in players' hands earlier this month</a>, has reached another milestone, further marking its meteoric resurrection.</p>



<p>The game is officially one of the "<em>fastest-growing mod communities</em>" on the popular mod platform <strong><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/">CurseForge</a></strong>, with Hytale players downloading <strong>more than 10 million mods</strong> for the game, with a little more than <strong>2,000 mod creators</strong> supplying more than <strong>3,000 mods</strong> in just two weeks.</p>



<p>CurseForge has been the official mod platform for Hytale since it launched, and <strong>Hypixel Studios</strong> founder and chief executive officer, <strong>Simon Collins-Laflamme</strong>, even credits the platform as a part of Hytale's success.</p>



<p>"<em>I have no regrets saving Hytale, and that’s entirely because of the community and our partners like CurseForge and Tebex who have made our early access launch a massive success</em>," Collins-Laflamme said in a press release. "<em>We came full circle, starting as modders and turning it into a game. Seeing fans build mods, worlds, and experiences at this scale, just weeks after launch, just validates why rebuilding was worth the risk</em>."</p>



<p><strong>Uri Marchand,</strong> chief executive officer and co-founder of CurseForge's operating company,<strong> Overwolf</strong>, added, "<em>Games are better when players get to create alongside the developers</em>. <em>From teenagers experimenting with the endless UGC possibilities to seasoned modders who have achieved a billion downloads, we’re giving Hytale creators a real path to build, share, and earn from their work through CurseForge and Tebex</em>."</p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme has also been highlighting mods on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account, further reiterating his love for Hytale's foundations as a mod itself.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Hytale kicked off to an impressive start, with Hypixel Studios reporting a "<em>very high</em>" number of concurrent users when the game launched earlier this month. Even before it launched, Collins-Laflamme announced that the game had already sold so well on pre-orders alone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-saved-says-hypixel-founder-studios-dev-costs-next-two-years-funded-by-pre-orders/"><strong>the next two years of development costs</strong> for Hypixel Studios were already funded</a>.</p>



<p>Beyond the mods that Collins-Laflamme has highlighted, its modding community is also already pulling off some incredible feats. One mod that is not yet public but is particularly impressive has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-crossplay-support-with-minecraft-thanks-to-impressive-mod/">added <strong>crossplay support </strong>between Hytale and Minecraft</a>. Two completely separate (albeit very similar) games, speaking to each other and allowing players in Hytale to play alongside their friends in Minecraft. It'll be even more impressive if/when the mod is made public. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-removes-text-from-steam-linking-it-to-the-creators-of-titanfall-2000663557</link>
            <guid>1417801</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>From the moment <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-small-team-sizes-are-a-problem-2000663511"><em>Highguard</em></a> was revealed in December at the Game Awards, the free-to-play shooter has been marketed as coming from people who helped create and develop <em>Titanfall</em> and its battle royale spin-off, <em>Apex Legends</em>. But now, <em>Highguard</em> seems to be backpedaling away from making that direct connection.</p> <p>On January 26,&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><em>Highguard’s</em> big launch day on PC and consoles</a>, the devs quietly made a small but very interesting change to the game’s store page on Steam. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/highguard-from-creators-of-apex-legends-wwphyYY"><em>Highguard’s</em> original Steam description said this</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>From the creators of <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Titanfall</em>, comes <em>Highguard</em>: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.</p></blockquote> <p>But on Monday, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/history/#:~:text=All%20rights%20reserved.-,Change%20U%3A71820520,-23%20hours%20ago">as documented by SteamDB</a>, this was tweaked to remove all mention of <em>Titanfall</em> and its spin-off. Now the store page simply says:</p>

 <blockquote><p><em>Highguard</em> is a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.</p></blockquote> <p>This is a significant change, considering the very first words we heard about <em>Highguard</em> publicly from Geoff Keighley included direct mention of these EA-published sci-fi shooters and how the studio behind <em>Highguard</em> was made up of former <em>Titanfall</em> devs. <a href="https://youtu.be/twK-acOec9o">Here’s what Geoff said at the 2025 Game Awards before debuting <em>Highguard’s</em> first trailer</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>“Our final world premiere comes from 61 members of the team that built <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Titanfall</em>. Four years ago, the principals founded a new, independent studio with the hopes of pushing the shooter genre forward…”</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/26/highguard-preview/">An <em>Xbox Wire</em> post published on launch day</a> also directly mentions <em>Titanfall</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>. But <em>Highguard’s</em> store pages on the Xbox and PlayStation digital storefronts don’t mention either game or the studio’s connection to them.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted <em>Highguard</em> PR and its devs to find out more.</p> <p>Of course, some are already speculating as to why this change was made. Did EA’s lawyers get involved? Did the devs behind <em>Highguard</em> want to distance the FPS, which is receiving horrible reviews on Steam, from <em>Titanfall</em> and their former colleagues’ work? Or did someone in marketing simply decide the Steam store page text was too long and wanted to shorten it up? We don’t know for now, but either way it is a very curious change and just one more odd development in the <em>Highguard</em> saga.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/868558/highguard-online-shooters</link>
            <guid>1417774</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The routine is familiar by now. A new online shooter with bright, colorful graphics launches and rockets up the charts despite the fact that you maybe haven’t even heard of it. Or maybe it just has a really forgettable name. But everyone seems to be talking about it, and it’s free, so you figure you may as well jump in. This moment of promise and anticipation may end up being the best this game will ever be — and there’s a good chance that feeling won’t last long.</p><p>I could be describing any number of games, but the most recent example is <em>Highguard</em>, which just launched on the PS5, Xbox, and Steam. The 3v3 shooter is the first release from Wildlight Entertainment, a new studio made up of veterans from <em>Apex Legends</em>, <em>Titanfall</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em>. That pedigree is enough to pay some attention to the game, which was originally revealed as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/841973/the-game-awards-2025-annoucements-news-trailers/archives/2">the final announcement at The Game Awards last month</a>. But it’s also doing some interesting things. The developers call it a “raid shooter,” but I’ve found it easiest to understand as a sort of first-person shooter take on a MOBA like <em>League of Legends</em>; each team has a base, and your job is to balance getting improved gear, protecting your own base, and completing various objectives to take down your enemies’ HQ. Also, you can ride a bear.</p><p>It’s a complicated setup, and after a few matches I’m not entirely convinced I fully understand the flow of matches, which could be a problem for wider adoption. It’s certainly not as pick-up-and-play as something like <em>Fortnite</em>. Though as you’d expect from people who worked on <em>Titanfall</em>, the action feels great, with excellent gunplay and smooth movement. It’s also a hero shooter, so you pick from characters with <em>Overwatch</em>-style ultimate powers that can let you quickly turn a battle in your favor, or smash through your opponents’ defenses. They can be a lot of fun when you pull them off properly.</p><p>When you’re in the midst of a tight skirmish, defending your teammates while they try to defuse a bomb, the appeal of <em>Highguard</em> is apparent. At its best it’s fast and tense and forces you to be decisive. But its complex nature also means that things can feel a little strange and messy. For one thing, the team sizes are small yet the maps are large, and so you spend a good chunk of each match wandering around a mostly empty level searching for chests to improve your armor or find a better gun. You do have a mount to speed this up, but even still, I’ve found the early portions of matches to be incredibly slow and not very exciting.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">As the ill-fated <em>Concord</em> showed</a>, the most important thing for a new online shooter is what it does differently, although even that isn’t a guarantee of success. But you need a hook to compete in a space with such established players as <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, and the annualized behemoth that is <em>Call of Duty</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/795232/ea-battlefield-6-hit-launch-deal"><em>Battlefield 6</em> managed to break through with sheer force of will</a>, while the likes of <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and <em>Apex Legends</em> have settled into a seemingly steady place where they aren’t the biggest games, but they have a strong, healthy player base. But the list of failures is also large: <em>Anthem</em>, <em>Spectre Divide</em>, <em>XDefiant</em>, <em>Spellbreak</em>, just to name a few. Many had interesting hooks — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/29/23187883/activision-blizzard-spellbreak-acquisition-battle-royale-world-of-warcraft">It’s <em>Fortnite </em>but fantasy!</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211078/spectre-divide-preview-mountaintop-fps-game">You can control two bodies at once!</a> — but it wasn’t enough.</p><p>As much fun as I’m having with <em>Highguard </em>during the launch week, I’m also not convinced that its strategic matches, slick gunplay, and oddball fantasy setting are enough for lasting success in such a competitive space. It’s different, but not <em>that</em> different, and it can be hard to explain what it really is. The odds are certainly against it. So for now I’ll just enjoy the experience while it lasts — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price">and be ready to do this all over again in March</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/868558/highguard-online-shooters]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a> developers Red Hook have announced that game files for Mythic's troubled boardgame adaptation will be given away to project backers, after grimly concluding that Mythic are no longer able to manufacture or deliver the thing.
</p>
<p>
The Darkest Dungeon boardgame was Kickstarted in 2020, soaking up $5.7 million in funding. Based in Luxembourg, Mythic Games have done well out of crowd-funding, raising over $19 million in five years, but they have been struggling financially nonetheless. They <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1162110258/darkest-dungeon-the-board-game/posts/3557431">asked DD boardgame backers to chip in more money</a> in 2022, after material and shipping costs spiked amid the Covid pandemic and the opening stages of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Mythic finally went into liquidation this December, reportedly following a criminal investigation into fraudulent behaviour and misappropriation of funds, which was terminated for lack of evidence. The company’s closure has left several projects worth millions of Kickstarter dollars in purgatory. There are many Ancestor quotes we could invoke here, I guess. I'm going with "more dust, more ashes... more disappointment."

</p>
<p>
Prior to biting the dust, Mythic managed to ship the first of two “waves” of Darkest Dungeon boardgame materials to backers. Amid the liquidation proceedings, a representative of the company also told <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/12/10/darkest-dungeon-board-game-maker-mythic-games-officially-liquidated-fails-to-deliver-on-millions-of-dollars-worth-of-crowdfunding-projects/">Board Game Wire</a> that they would provide backers with the STLs – aka, digital 3D models that you can use to print game pieces - for both waves.</p>
<p>This was actually impossible at the time, however, because Mythic don’t own the copyright on Darkest Dungeon's designs, but a former Mythic staffer has now secured permission from Red Hook to share the files.
</p>
<p>
“As many of you know, the financial situation at Mythic Games has been strained for the past several years,” Red Hook <a href="https://www.darkestdungeon.com/news/regarding-mythic-games-and-the-darkest-dungeon-board-game/">write on their official site</a>. “We have been keeping an eye on the situation, hoping for the best. Unfortunately, at this point, Mythic Games is no longer able to manufacture or deliver the Darkest Dungeon board game.
</p><p>
“We put our trust in Mythic Games to deliver on their promises and uphold the Darkest Dungeon name,” the post continues. “We won’t mince words, their collapse and inability to fulfill Wave 2 orders is an enormously disappointing development and we know it deeply affects many Darkest Dungeon fans. 
</p>
<p>
“Recently, we were contacted by an ex-Mythic employee who asked for our blessing to distribute the project files to all backers. While we at Red Hook don't own or control the board game files themselves, we were happy to give our permission for our copyrighted material within those files to be distributed to backers for non-commercial use.”
</p>
<p>
If you backed the Darkest Dungeon boardgame, you should now have an email from the Kickstarter campaign with a link to “all game files, including files of the rules, 3D models and more”. If you haven’t received the email, give darkestdungeonrescuefiles@gmail.com a shout.
</p>
<p>
It’s good that some of the project has been salvaged, but email attachments aren’t a patch on getting a chunky new Crusader figurine in the post. “Unfortunately, Red Hook has neither the board game manufacturing expertise nor have we had the ability to divert funds of the scale required to remove whatever obstacles Mythic has faced without endangering our own operations,” the videogame's creators conclude on their site. “We only hope that this final gesture can be a silver lining in an otherwise disappointing situation.”

            <guid>1417756</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For months ahead of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>‘s February release date, rumors have persisted that the game is “<a href="https://screenrant.com/resident-evil-9-open-world-rumors-good-bad/">open-world.</a>” That would certainly be a significant shift away from previous games, but it’s not something players should expect from <em>Requiem</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/26/resident-evil-requiem-director-sets-the-record-straight-this-isnt-an-open-world-game">according to director Koshi Nakanishi, who said as much in an interview with <em>Game Informer</em></a>.</p> <p>“[The development team] did just want to make clear one point,” Nakanishi said while speaking to <em>Game Informer</em>. “They’ve seen some speculation of whether there’s any open-world elements in the game, and they just want to set the record straight that this isn’t an open-world game.”</p>

 <p>He continued: “The main concept behind this game is combining the very different gameplay of Grace and Leon into a cohesive package, and having those two gameplays represent the <em>Resident Evil</em> series, and I think when you play the game, you realize that, or you will find as well that the development team picked the best approach to do this.”</p> <p>For years, the industry has been obsessed with open-world design. People want more freedom, more hours, more map. But the notion that <em>Requiem </em>might be an open-world game didn’t sit well with <em>Resident Evil</em> players who love the series’ linear, tightly controlled storylines. The horror of <em>Resident Evil</em> is informed by its design, and an open world would significantly shift the way players experience it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0mgOPbpagc">Footage shown last month of a city street with cars and pedestrians</a> sparked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q5dlc8/resident_evil_requiems_path_tracing_trailer_by/">some of that open-world speculation</a>, which can now be hushed thanks to Nakanishi’s statement to <em>Game Informer</em>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-the-final-preview">In its <em>Requiem</em> preview, <em>IGN </em>said</a> that Grace’s portions of the game should be “familiar to anyone who has played&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2</em> or&nbsp;<em>7</em>.” Leon’s sections, meanwhile, “stirred up our muscle memory of playing <em>Resident Evil 4</em>,” <em>IGN</em> said.</p>

 <p><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, the ninth mainline game in the franchise, will be released on February 27. Capcom’s last <em>Resident Evil</em> Game, <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, was released in 2021.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>IEM Katowice is officially no more, and the competition has moved to Krakow for 2026. This monumental change seemed drastic at the time, but fans are now readying themselves to visit a new city for this supersized tournament. In this guide, we’re breaking down everything you need to know about IEM Krakow 2026, including the schedule, teams competing, and where to watch it.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in IEM Krakow betting or just want to watch your favourite teams and players enjoying Counter-Strike 2 action live on stream, read on.</p>







<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-schedule-and-location">IEM Krakow 2026 Schedule and Location</h2>



<p>IEM Krakow 2026 will take place at the TAURON Arena in the city of Kraków, Poland. It’s set to run from January 28th to February 8th, and in that time, 24 teams will fight for the lion’s share of a massive $1 million prize.</p>



<p>Here’s the <strong>IEM Krakow 2026 schedule and format:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Play-In Stage</strong></p>



<p>During this stage, 16 teams come together for the Play-In round, which features a double-elimination bracket and a series of best-of-three matches. It’s a whittling round here, and only the top eight will make it through to the next round to face the higher-seeded competitors.</p>



<p><strong>Group Stage</strong></p>



<p>The Group Stage includes the eight successful teams from the Play-In Stage and the eight that had already qualified with a higher seeding for IEM Krakow. The teams will compete along another double-elimination pathway, with each group being made up of eight teams in total.</p>



<p>The Group Stage <strong>winners </strong>go through to the semi-finals, the <strong>runners-up </strong>advance to the Quarterfinals as <em>high seeds</em>, and the <strong>third-place teams </strong>go through to the Quarterfinals as <em>low seeds</em>. Only the top three teams from each group will land in the Playoffs.</p>



<p><strong>Playoffs</strong></p>



<p>The Playoffs will crown the champion at IEM Krakow 2026. This is a single-elimination bracket with a best-of-five grand final that will see six teams fight for the grand prize – $400,000.</p>



<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-teams">IEM Krakow 2026 Teams</h2>



<p>Here is the full list of the teams qualified to compete at IEM Krakow 2026:</p>



<p><strong>Directly Qualified</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Team Vitality</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Team Spirit</li>



<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>MOUZ</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>The MongolZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Play-In Teams</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Aurora Gaming</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Legacy</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>3DMAX</li>



<li>Astralis</li>



<li>PARIVISION</li>



<li>HEROIC</li>



<li>paiN Gaming</li>



<li>FUT Esports</li>



<li>Ninjas in Pyjamas</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>



<li>BC.Game Esports</li>



<li>NRG</li>



<li>GamerLegion</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-predictions">IEM Krakow 2026 Predictions</h2>



<p>Team Vitality enters the running as the primary title contender, despite recent losses. For a safe IEM Krakow bet, you’d consider backing them, or for similar odds, Team Spirit. FURIA has been on a resurgence of late, and the Brazilian roster could make for a middle-of-the-road bet if you’re playing outrights.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, a swing-tier squad like Team Liquid and Ninjas in Pyjamas could manufacture an underdog win that could result in a nice return for Counter-Strike betting fans.</p>

<p>It’s time to crawl out through the Fallout one more time with episode 8 of Fallout Season 2. Amazon’s stunning adaptation is reaching its conclusion, and Season 2’s episode 8 release date draws closer than a Bloatfly to your irradiated presence.</p>



<p>The Ink Spots famously sang about not wanting to set the world on fire, and yet, Amazon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a> adaptation has constantly been on fire. Every episode has knocked it out of the park. Fallout Season 2 has been a joy to watch from start to finish, and the high stakes are about to be raised one more time in New Vegas.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fallout-season-2-episode-8-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Episode 8 will show great steel once more. Credit to Amazon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Tuesday, February 3, is the official release date for Fallout Season 2, episode 8.</strong></p>



<p>The last couple of episodes of Season 2 have been rejigged by Amazon slightly. But you have no excuse for missing it now with this information! The reason for Amazon’s tinkering with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-episode-7-release-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode 7</a> and episode 8 was “Due to strong participation and interest,” which, in short, was to make it available for more regions earlier and cut down on potential spoilers.</p>



<p>No one wants a finale ruined for them, making this a commendable gesture by Amazon.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-season-2-episode-8-start-times-amp-dates">Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 Start Times &amp; Dates</h2>



<p><strong>The United States claims the first release time for Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 with a 6 PM PT start time on February 3. Insider Gaming has also provided more time zones for you to check out, including GMT and AET.</strong></p>



<p>It’s the United Kingdom who are probably most at risk for an episode 8 spoiler due to the 2 AM start time! Whereas many other regions are getting more favorable start times.</p>



<p>Take a look at this table and see when Season 2 episode 8 airs for you.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Region</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 Dates &amp; Release Time</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">6:00 PM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">8:00 PM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 PM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">2:00 AM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1:00 PM—February 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM—February 4</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>If episode 8 is even half as good as the rest, then Fallout’s newest batch of TV is about to go out with a Megaton ending, atomic bomb-sized bang.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good morning, Vault Dwellers! Due to strong participation and interest, we have amended the start times for the remaining Season Two presentations. Episode Seven will now begin Tuesday, Jan. 27 at 6 p.m. PT, and Episode Eight will now begin Tuesday, Feb. 3 at 6 p.m. PT.
