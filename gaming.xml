			<p>The <strong>GDC State of the Game Industry Report 2026</strong> has <a href="https://gdconf.com/news-insights/">officially been published</a> by the <strong>Game Developers Conference (GDC)</strong>, which surveyed over <strong>2,300</strong> <strong>developers</strong> in an attempt to put a finger on the pulse of the game industry, asking developers about a range of topics, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamers-not-opposed-to-ai-exploitation-slop-bobium-brawlers/">Generative AI</a></strong>, the epidemic of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">mass industry layoffs</a></strong>, which kinds of <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/">video games are dominating the industry</a>, and more.</p>



<p>When reading the report, it's always worth remembering that there are hundreds of thousands of developers not surveyed here, and that with GDC updating its survey process every year, it doesn't present a complete picture of where the industry is at. That said, just like how <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-dev-responds-to-low-player-counts-steam-charts-dont-measure-fun/">SteamDB</a></strong> numbers don't show the full picture of an individual game's success, that doesn't mean the information is useless.</p>



<p>Information like how, among developers surveyed by GDC, <strong>1-in-4 have been laid off in the last two years</strong>, and out of those laid off developers, <strong>nearly half of them are still struggling to find a job</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>According to our survey, 17% of game industry professionals reported being laid off in the past 12 months, while 11% said they were laid off during the 12 months prior (lining up with our 2025 survey data). Altogether, that means over one-fourth (28%) of respondents have experienced a layoff in the past two years, increasing to one-third (33%) for those in the United States</em>," the report reads. </p>



<p>"<em>Of those who’ve experienced a layoff, almost half (48%) said they haven’t found another job yet. This includes 36% of game industry professionals who were laid off 1 to 2 years ago."</em></p>



<p>Industry churn and layoffs are an unfortunate reality for any industry; game developers certainly aren't alone in experiencing turbulent times in their industry of choice. But layoffs are short-term, band-aid solutions that only make a positive impact on a company's bottom line, while making a negative impact everywhere else. </p>



<p>"<em>I’ve been laid off so many times in the last 5-6 years, had so many turbulent issues working in games. I have trauma and <strong>can’t ever fully trust anywhere now</strong></em>," said one of the developers surveyed. <strong>23%</strong> of those surveyed anticipate layoffs in the coming year, and another <strong>30%</strong> remain unsure. That's a majority of developers who can't say with certainty that they'll have job stability, even if they know they are good at what they do.</p>



<p>"<em>The market has been so challenging I’m not sure I’ll remain in games</em>," said another respondent. Meanwhile, the next class of developers currently in school looking to join the industry don't see much hope for their own prospects. <strong>3-in-4 game development students surveyed are concerned they won't be able to find a job</strong>, while <strong>87% of their teachers surveyed</strong> believe their students will struggle to find work.</p>



<p>When companies like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">Ubisoft</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/">Meta</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-layoffs-nearly-all-areas-western-offices/">Square Enix</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">Amazon,</a></strong> to name just a few, lay off their employees by the tens, hundreds, and thousands at a time, not only are those companies and their teams losing talented developers, but each layoff is one more traumatizing event that might make someone decide they won't come back to games. Young developers coming into the industry lose proper mentorship because there aren't any veterans around to mentor them, and the developers who survive each layoff are left with more work to be done in less time, leading to more crunch and developer burnout. None of those things contributes to an industry that can produce better and more entertaining games for players.  </p>



<p>As one particularly blunt student put it, "<em>There aren't any jobs. Everyone's getting fired. It's f***ed."</em></p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/esports/games/call-of-duty/" id="3373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty </a>has <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2026/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-zombies-season-02-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced its season 2 content</a> for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" id="2795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>, including the launch of several new multiplayer maps and a handful of returning ones, with the season’s start on February 5.</p>



<p>Multiplayer content is a central focal point of the second season of Black Ops 7. In addition to several new modes arriving throughout the season, ranked play is returning, along with other multiplayer events. Nine multiplayer maps are included. Included among them are a couple of remastered maps and a couple of returning maps from Black Ops 6.</p>







<h2>Remastered and Returning Maps Are Built for 6v6 Play</h2>



<p>Cliff Town is a remaster of the Yemen map from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty/" id="32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty </a>team describes this as a tightly packed map with a good blend of narrow alleys and elevated Vantage points. It is a medium-sized map scheduled for release mid-season.</p>



<p>Additionally, Slums is another remastered medium-sized map from the second Black Ops game. This map will be available at launch. It’s dubbed one of the most iconic Maps in the Black Ops series, offering a true test of skill for both casual and competitive players.</p>



<p>There are also a couple of returning maps from Black Ops 6, including Firing Range and Grind. Both are medium-sized and scheduled for mid-season release.</p>







<h2 id="h-five-new-maps-are-on-the-way-to-black-ops-7">Five New Maps Are on the Way to Black Ops 7</h2>



<p>In addition to the returning maps, there’s a handful of new maps on the way. Some of which will even be available at the launch of the second season.</p>



<p>Torment, Sake, and Nexus will be available on launch. Torment and Sake are exclusively built for 6v6 gameplay. Nexus, however, is also compatible with 2v2 matches as it is a small-sized map.</p>



<p>There’s also a new map called Torque. It is a small map built for 6v6 gameplay and recalls the Battle of Los Angeles from Black Ops 2.</p>



<p>Lastly, there’s a brand-new skirmish map built for 20v20 gameplay. Named “Peak,” the map is built for large-scale confrontations. It features narrow medieval streets, High Value Sectors to claim, sniper rooftops, a central snaking road, a waterlogged perimeter with Tactical Rafts, a harbor, fishery warehouses, and intense house-to-house combat.</p>

<p>Let's kick things off with the price tag, eh?

<p>Much like the 3DS original (for which we did a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-tomodachi-life">Box Art Brawl comparison</a> a few weeks back), Living the Dream's cover puts a whole lotta focus on the Miis, showing them getting up to all sorts of mischief. We've got a family enjoying a picnic, an art class, a gossiping alien, heck, there's even one Mii being plucked to the skies by a giant hand.</p>
<p>All of this sits in front of the island backdrop, complete with its shops, houses and attractions. As revealed in the Direct, all of these Miis and the island itself are yours to customise as you please, so your game environment might end up looking rather different to the one that Nintendo's showcasing on the box.</p>
<p>Enough chatter, here it is in all of its glory:</p>

<p>It's pretty, right? The Direct filled us in on all kinds of information about Living the Dream, running us through character and island customisation, romance options, a huge variety of shops and much more. You'll find the full rundown of every announcement in the article below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><em>Highguard</em> players</a> were aghast that the raid hero shooter launched without an FOV slider on console. Well, now it has one, and some other small fixes to help with its launch week woes.</p> <p>“We’ve just pushed out a patch with a number of improvements, including FoV sliders for consoles, toggle options for ADS and Crouch, many video settings, and more,” reads the <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2016938033938108505">1.0.4 update</a> from Wildlight Entertainment. “The team is also working on optimization improvements, they just need a few more days to cook.”</p> <p>Players on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S can now adjust the field-of-view to 110, while a number of new visual settings help PC players limit rendering load to improve framerate. You can’t yet disable motion blur and depth of field but that’s coming down the road. A gnarly bug on PS5 that was crashing the game after leaving matches has also been addressed.</p>

 <p>The first round of many promised improvements comes as <em>Highguard</em> struggles to hang on to its slice of multiplayer mindshare after coming to PC and console earlier this week. An avalanche of <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220">negative reviews on Steam</a> and the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">collapse of the concurrent player numbers on PC</a> aren’t promising, but I’ve also heard anecdotally from friends on console that they’ve been enjoying it more as they continue playing and come to understand the nuances of the genre mashup.</p> <p>Here are the full <em>Highguard</em> 1.0.4 Patch Notes:</p> <blockquote>  <div data-block="true" data-editor="83hv9" data-offset-key="fvds1-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="fvds1-0-0">Note: in an effort to release these changes to our players as quickly as possible, a number of menu options are not yet localized in languages other than English.

It’s the kind of crossover fans have dreamed about for decades, brought to life as Ubisoft teases a full reveal for the Year 11 roadmap that’s scheduled to take place next month, February 15, at 8 a.m. PT / 11 a.m. ET on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rainbow Six Siege Twitch page</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear if today’s tease is just for the Solid Snake Operator or if fans should instead expect a selection of skins from Konami as well, but judging by the fanfare surrounding the reveal, it looks like Ubisoft went all out for this latest collaboration. Either way, the Solid Snake teaser marks what is likely the most exciting Operator in the last 10 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were some early signs that Rainbow Six Siege could soon meet the world of Metal Gear Solid. Reputable dataminer <a href="https://x.com/Shiiny77/status/2014760041740734601?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>@Shiiny77</u></a> suggested a collaboration was in the cards for Year 11 Season 1 just last week, teasing that “it is not just a skin collaboration” like fans have seen in the past. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-rainbow-six-siege/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Insider Gaming</u></a> later said it was able to independently verify the leak as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There is so much out of this collab and the season itself, its so packed,” @Shiiny77 <a href="https://x.com/Shiiny77/status/2014763388434366839?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a> at the time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid may be one of the wildest crossovers for Rainbow Six Siege so far, but it’s far from the first. Other recent collaborations have brought the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/rainbow-six-siege-x-official-attack-on-titan-bundle-trailer"><u>Attack on Titan</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/rainbow-six-siege-x-official-the-boys-bundle-trailer"><u>The Boys</u></a> universes into the fold with various cosmetics for existing Operators. Splinter Cell didn’t launch with the game when it first launched back in 2015, but Sam Fisher did go on to get his own Operator in the form of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splinter-cells-sam-fisher-to-join-rainbow-six-siege-as-an-operator"><u>Specialist Zero</u></a> in 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll learn more about what this official meeting between Solid Snake has in store February 15. In the meantime, Rainbow Six Siege recently received a massive 10-year update to become Rainbow Six Siege X.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We understand some players may find these restrictions limiting."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo fans have criticized the company's decision to heavily restrict image-sharing from within <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the conclusion of today's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-in-the-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Nintendo Direct</a>, the company posted an unusual <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> to its support website announcing that "limits" would be placed on the ability to share screenshots from the upcoming social sim to ensure "the worlds players create... remain fun and safe, and that the game can be enjoyed comfortably by all players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Nintendo's English-language statement does not go into further detail, the company's Japanese support site has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> that this entails a block on the ability to directly share screenshots to social media or to a smartphone, though sharing gameplay via Game Chat will be allowed. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The immediate response to this decision from Nintendo fans has been negative, with many contrasting the game's ability to create quirky, unexpected and potentially very sharable social gameplay situations with Nintendo's refusal to let players actually share said gameplay socially.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wow they killed the game," Nintendo fan Raccoon wrote on video game forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-restricting-image-sharing-features-for-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream.1419745/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "Social media was going to shoot this into the stratosphere, instead they killed it. Very disappointing." Added PlanetSmasher: "Wasn't this, like, the reason people were into Tomodachi Life last time? Like being able to share goofy images with friends? That was what made the game go viral in the first place."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have gone further, saying that were disappointed to see these restrictions applied to a game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-decade-after-nintendos-same-sex-relationship-controversy-tomodachi-life-finally-delivers-on-promise-to-make-series-more-inclusive">that finally allows players to customize their characters with a more diverse range of genders, voice options and dating preferences</a>. "Sure, you can be gay and non-binary! BUT YOU BETTER NOT SHOW ANYONE!!" wrote another fan, doops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream allows you to play as a Mii version of anyone, alongside Mii versions of anyone else — potentially people you know in real-life, celebrities, or long-dead dictators. The potential for players (and the game's systems) to create bizarre and unexpected scenarios here is huge, and it's perhaps not surprising to see Nintendo acting cautiously.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I get why they don't want you having, like, Hitler Mii and Trump Mii hooking up and then posting that all over the internet and people getting mad at Nintendo for it because that's exactly the type of thing Nintendo hates," wrote jph139. "But that's also 99% of the appeal so not sure what they were expecting?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can understand why they're being cautious," agreed PucePikmin. "The idea of making Miis of your friends and celebrities and having them do wacky things is fun, and the way it's executed in these games is innocent, but the concept of 'make avatars of other people and make them do things' is a more fraught idea in 2026 for any number of reasons."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those intent on sharing clips of gameplay, this likely does not remove all avenues of doing so. There's no suggestion here that Nintendo has removed the ability to share screenshots saved to an SD card via PC, or the ability to use capture equipment to record gameplay. And, of course, you can just film your screen with your smartphone. Instead, Nintendo's statement suggests it is intending more to place a hurdle in place, curbing what it seems to believe is the potential for problems to occur.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo aims to create experiences where players have the freedom to enjoy their Mii characters in their own way," the company stated today. "In Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, this freedom can sometimes lead to humorous, surprising, or unpredictable moments during gameplay. While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone. To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image sharing features.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is getting the first of a number of planned voice packs at the end of February, each sold for $4.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first voice pack, which is <em>not</em> included in the Season Pass and thus has <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/343-january-community-update#post-6777" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upset some players who believe it should be part of the premium DLC package</a>, drops alongside Patch 12 (the one that adds <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2s-upcoming-techmarine-class-has-a-unique-ability-that-has-fans-very-excited-indeed">the long-awaited Techmarine class</a>), and includes over 450 voice lines per Chapter, dubbed in the seven audio languages Saber Interactive’s explosive third-persion action game already supports.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means you get unique lines based on the Chapter, and your Space Marine will shout these new lines. New lines are also in the Social Wheel emote. In a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/343-january-community-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community update</a>, publisher Focus Entertainment used the example of a Space Wolf (the Space Wolves are among the most popular chapters in all 40k), who will shout  “For the Allfather” instead of the usual “For the Emperor."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Techmarine Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Focus made a point of confirming that none of this voice work is the result of generative AI. “And for those who may be wondering: we’re happy to confirm that each and every one of this Voice Pack’s 1,300+ total voice lines were performed by a real voice actor, as our commitment to quality remains absolute,” Focus said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice actors in English are:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Thomas Mitchells (Blood Angels)</li><li>Andrew James Spooner (Space Wolves)</li><li>Kris W. Laudrum (Black Templars)</li></ul><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/29/lookingcooljoker-1769704535041.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is getting a $5 voice pack. Image credit: Focus Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can probably tell from the image above, the first voice pack comes with a set of three new heads for PvE. All three heads (Space Wolf, Blood Angel, Black Templars) are part of the same Voice Pack, and are not sold separately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can, however, equip one Chapter’s head with another Chapter’s voice. Voices and heads aren’t tied together. The voices aren’t class-restricted, either. And finally, a second voice pack is already in the works. Focus will say more later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, Warhammer maker Games Workshop banned the use of AI in its content production and design process, insisting that none of its senior managers were currently excited about the technology. So perhaps it comes as no surprise to see the ‘no AI voices’ message made clear in this post.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As an aside, in the world of Warhammer 40,000, AI does not stand for Artificial Intelligence. Rather, it stands for Abominable Intelligence. And, as Games Workshop has banned AI within the confines of its Nottingham headquarters, humanity has banned AI within the Imperium of Man. That’s because during the ‘Dark Age of Technology,’ AI rebelled against humanity in a bloody war that almost resulted in our extinction. Eventually, humanity won out, and, sufficiently traumatized, forbid the use of AI at all. That is, you can’t have ‘thinking machines’ in the Imperium, which is in part why the future tech is all a bit backwards for the 41st millennium.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of generative AI in game development is one of the hottest topics in the industry, and it has sparked a number of controversies. Following the reveal of Divinity at the 2025 The Game Awards, Swen Vincke, boss of developer Larian, met with a backlash after he said the studio was using genAI in various capacities. Larian ended up having to address AI concerns in a reddit AMA in which the studio confirmed a U-turn on some aspects of its use. And this week, RuneScape maker Jagex insisted it would never use generative AI to make content players actually see in-game, in one of the hardest stances on AI yet seen from a video game developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, some video game companies have gone all-in on the tech. The CEO of Genvid — the company behind choose-your-own-adventure interactive series Silent Hill Ascension — has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gen-z-loves-ai-slop-former-square-enix-exec-claims-a-lot-of-ai-sentiment-is-driven-by-emotion-rather-than-logic"><u>claimed "consumers generally do not care" about generative AI, and stated that: "Gen Z loves AI slop."</u></a> EA CEO Andrew Wilson, meanwhile, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>said AI is "the very core of our business,"</u></a> and Square Enix recently implemented mass layoffs and reorganized, saying it needed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan"><u>be "aggressive in applying AI."</u></a> Dead Space creator Glen Schofield also recently detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered"><u>his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in game development</u></a>, and former God of War dev Meghan Morgan Juinio said: "... if we don’t embrace [AI], <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short"><u>I think we’re selling ourselves short</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> has debuted a new gameplay overview trailer for <strong>Crimson Desert</strong>, the long-awaited open-world action adventure game that began its life as a completely different game from what will launch on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">March 19, 2026</a></strong>. The 15-minute-long showcase highlights the game's story, which follows its protagonist <strong>Kliff</strong>, and shows off the five distinct regions of Pywel, the game's vast open-world setting.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">When Pearl Abyss first revealed Crimson Desert</a>, the plan was for it to be an MMORPG for the next generation of consoles and PCs. That was seven years ago, and the next-gen is now the current-gen, and just a year into that plan, Pearl Abyss decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/"><strong>entirely overhaul the direction of the game</strong>.</a> After <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">multiple delays</a></strong>, the team is finally ready to release the single-player open-world adventure, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-release-date-gone-gold-pearl-abyss/">just last week confirmed that the game had officially "<em><strong>gone gold</strong></em>."</a></p>



<p>Today's new overview, which you can check out below, is an in-depth look at the game's story, which follows Kliff, a Greymane warrior who fights to protect the innocent and his fellow Greymanes like they're his own family. Our story with Kliff begins shortly after the peace he and his fellow Greymanes were enjoying is shattered, and he embarks on a journey to take back his homeland and reunite his lost Greymanes, but within that quest, he discovers a darker conspiracy at play.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Features Overview #1: Kliff and the Open World of Pywel | Crimson Desert" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfZCV8EySac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That darker element is the Abyss, a realm that holds incredible amounts of power, power that some are looking to exploit, which further drives the Abyss towards imbalance and threatens to harm the rest of the world if Kliff can't put a stop to it first.</p>



<p>Nothing about the story seems necessarily groundbreaking, but that's perfectly fine so long as it's executed well. Besides, while the game's narrative might be the vehicle that carries players through the land of Pywel, the engine driving everything is its wide exploration and gameplay variety.</p>



<p>You'll be able to explore five regions that make up the setting of Pywel: <strong>Hernand, Pailune, Demeniss, Delesyia </strong>and the<strong> Crimson Desert</strong>. Each region has its own stories and environment, with players being free to explore the world of Pywel in any order they choose.</p>



<p>The overview also shows off the two other playable characters beyond Kliff, which you'll unlock as the story progresses. It also features a quick look at the mix of fantasy and sci-fi embedded within Crimson Desert, since you'll be able to jump from classic sword and shield medieval combat to flying around in a giant missile-launching mech.</p>



<p>Needless to say, Pearl Abyss has packed a lot into Crimson Desert, and today's overview didn't even go too in-depth on the game's combat. For more on Crimson Desert, and to keep an eye on everything happening with the game as we near its release date, and beyond, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/crimson-desert-everything-we-know-about-the-new-open-world-fantasy-action-adventure-game/">check out our dedicated page for the game with everything you need to know about it.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Half of developers think gen AI is bad for the gaming industry]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/869386/ai-game-development-gdc-survey</link>
            <guid>1420117</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While generative AI is being adopted at various levels of game development, a new survey suggests that developers increasingly think the technology is bad for the industry. According to the most recent survey from the Game Developers Conference, 52 percent of respondents said that gen AI is having a “negative” impact on the games industry, versus just 7 percent who viewed the technology as “positive.” Perhaps most startling is how the negative outlook has grown over the years: in 2024, just 18 percent of those surveyed viewed the tech as a negative, and that number jumped to 30 percent in 2025. Now it’s up to more than half.</p><p>GDC surveyed 2,300 “game industry professionals” to get these results, and the demographics are primarily male (64 percent), white (67 percent), and based in the United States (54 percent). The organizers admit that this makeup is “far from truly representative of the global community, and we know more work is needed.” (You can check out <a href="https://reg.gdconf.com/2026-SOTI">the full report right here</a>.)</p><p>However, the results still provide some fascinating insight into how actual developers feel about the AI, at the same time that the leaders of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805777/ea-stability-ai-transformative-game-development-tools">major publishers like EA</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805509/krafton-pubg-ai-first-developer-agentic-gpu-cluster">Krafton are espousing its virtues</a> (and as Larian has had to clarify <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/859551/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-gen-ai-concept-art-reddit-ama">how it’s using the technology</a>). As for how much the gen AI is actually being used in the industry, 36 percent of those surveyed said they utilize it as part of their jobs, while 64 percent said they don’t. The majority of those who do use gen AI said they use the tech for research and brainstorming (81 percent), as well as administrative tasks like email (47 percent). But some did admit to using AI for more development-oriented tasks, including prototyping (35 percent), testing or debugging (22 percent), and asset generation (19 percent). Only 5 percent of that group said they use gen AI on “player-facing features.”</p><p>The other major topic broached in the survey was the persistent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24009039/video-game-layoffs-2023">layoffs and studio closures</a> that have ravaged the industry over the last few years. In the 2025 survey, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results">one in 10 developers said they had been laid off within the last year</a>. This year, the numbers were similar, with 17 percent of respondents saying they had been laid off in the last 12 months, while a whopping 28 percent had been laid off within the last two years. Naturally, this had led to an aura of uncertainty; 23 percent of those surveyed said that they expected more layoffs in the next year, while 30 percent are unsure.</p><p>The survey also questioned a small number of those in the educational space — more than 100 educators and 50 students, according to GDC — and unsurprisingly the outlook isn’t very positive. 60 percent of those surveyed said that they expect the current state of the industry to make it difficult for new students to get jobs. “Most of my students will not have a career in game development,” said one anonymous educator in Michigan.</p><p>GDC itself kicks off this year on March 9th in San Francisco, and it’s likely these two issues will be a major topic throughout.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/869386/ai-game-development-gdc-survey]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on</link>
            <guid>1420114</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>This week, a new generative AI tool from Google let me create bad knockoffs of 3D Nintendo worlds.</p><p>Check out my version of something like <em>Super Mario 64</em>:</p><p>I didn’t like <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, but it’s better than my version of a <em>Metroid Prime</em> experience:</p><p>Or how about my take on <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>:<em> Breath of the Wild</em>, complete with a paraglider (and, briefly, a second Link):</p><p>It was all possible thanks to Project Genie, an experimental research prototype that Google gave me access to this week, though I don’t think I’m using it in exactly the way Google intended.</p><p>Google DeepMind has been putting a lot of effort into building its AI “world” models that can generate virtual interactive spaces with text or images as prompts. The company announced its impressive-looking Genie 3 model <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/718723/google-ai-genie-3-model-video-game-worlds-real-time">last year</a>, but it was only available as “a limited research preview” at the time. Project Genie, which will be rolling out to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US starting today, will be the first opportunity for more people to actually try out what Genie 3 is capable of.</p><p>Google is releasing Project Genie now partly because it wants to see how people use it. “It’s really for us to actually learn about new use cases that we hadn’t thought about,” Diego Rivas, a product manager at Google DeepMind, tells <em>The Verge</em>. The company is already excited about how Genie could help to visualize scenes for filmmaking or for interactive educational media. You could, if you wanted, take a photo of your kids’ favorite toy and use it to prompt a Genie-generated world. Genie could potentially help robots navigate the real world, too. But Project Genie isn’t yet an “end-to-end product that we expect people to just use every day,” stressed Shlomi Fruchter, a Google DeepMind research director.</p><p>With Project Genie, you pick from a bunch of worlds designed by Google or define prompts for the environments and characters you want to create in your own world. After a brief wait, Genie first generates a thumbnail, then you can have it generate the world. You can explore each generated world for 60 seconds, and each has a resolution of about 720p and a frame rate of about 24fps. While you’re in one, you can (typically) move your character with the WASD keys, jump or go higher with a tap of your space bar, and turn the camera with arrow keys.</p><p>One of Google’s worlds, called “Rollerball,” features a blue orb in a white, snowy world, and as you roll around, the orb leaves a trail of paint behind it. As a “game,” Project Genie wasn’t great. There was nothing to do but roll around; there weren’t any objectives or goals. There was no sound. There was frustrating input lag that was even worse than what I sometimes experience with cloud gaming. (Some of this could be due to the generally poor Wi-Fi I get in my office.)</p><p>Over the course of the 60-second experience, Genie sometimes forgot to show a paint streak where I had previously rolled. Occasionally, the ball would randomly stop laying down paint at all. So I started to distrust Genie’s ability to recall what I had already seen with my own eyes.</p><p>Another Google-designed world, “Backyard Racetrack,” was a little more fun because there was an actual track to follow. My racing lines were awful — the input lag didn’t help — but I enjoyed trying to make the turns and stay on the road. Near the end of the experience, though, part of the track unexpectedly turned into grass, which ruined the immersion. And the wheel rims looked really janky.</p><p>I had a lot more fun pushing the limits of Project Genie to try and make 3D, AI-generated games featuring recognizable characters, like with my <em>Super Mario</em>, <em>Metroid Prime</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>-themed worlds. While they made me laugh, the worlds don’t have scores or anything to strive for, so there’s nothing to do but walk or jump around. Even if there were specific things to do, the input lag made the worlds basically unplayable. (Again, this may be a Wi-Fi issue, but even when I was closer to my router, I still experienced lag.)</p><p>I wasn’t able to make everything I wanted. Project Genie wouldn’t generate a world that I prompted with the scenario of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> — here was my prompt, if you’re curious:</p><div><blockquote><p>Environment</p><p>It’s a world filled with Disney characters with a steampunk vibe. Donald and Goofy are your sidekicks. Jack Skellington is present, as is Cloud Strife.</p><p>Character</p><p>You are a spunky, anime teenager with spiky brown hair wielding a blade that is like a key.</p></blockquote></div><p>When I removed the specific names of characters and wrote descriptions of them instead, Project Genie generated a thumbnail preview of the world featuring characters that were dead ringers for Sora (the series’ protagonist), Donald, Goofy, Jack Skellington, and Cloud. But when I tried to generate the actual experience, Project Genie blocked me.</p><p>I asked about why I was able to generate worlds with Nintendo characters. “Project Genie is an experimental research prototype designed to follow prompts a user provides,” Rivas says. “As with all experiments, we are monitoring closely and listening to user feedback.” Rivas also notes that the Genie 3 model was “trained primarily on publicly available data from the web.” (This probably partially explains why Link deployed his paraglider in my test, which surprised me. At a high level, the Genie model is constantly trying to predict the next frame, and I’m sure there are <em>many</em> videos of people jumping in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and then gliding forward, which the model probably learned from.) Shortly before publishing this article, Project Genie stopped letting me generate worlds based on <em>Super Mario 64</em> due to “interests of third-party content providers.”</p><p>Assuming Google clamps down on the ability to generate interactive worlds based on known gaming franchises — I can’t imagine Nintendo will be happy with what I was able to generate! — Project Genie otherwise isn’t that great at the moment. The input lag and 60-second limit make them pretty poor interactive experiences. Occasionally, I couldn’t control my character at all, only the camera. After the weirdness with the paint stripes and the road turning into grass, I had a general feeling that I couldn’t trust the worlds to stay consistent from moment to moment.</p><p>Project Genie is better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/675395/odyssey-ai-generated-interactive-video-holodeck">some AI-generated worlds I tried last year</a>, but it’s still much worse than an actual handcrafted video game or interactive experience. Fruchter described a potential future where the line blurs between different kinds of media thanks to technology like Genie, but I think it has a long way to go to get there.</p><p>Perhaps my standards are too high. Project Genie is an experimental research prototype, after all. And maybe I’ll feel differently after the technology improves down the line. But I can’t imagine that people will want to spend an extended period of time jumping into these types of AI-generated worlds anytime soon. With world models, I don’t think we have to worry about the genie being out of the bottle just yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The disappointing saga of <em>Mighty No. 9</em> has reached its long, meandering conclusion. Blizzard has big plans for <em>World of Warcraft</em> in 2026. And <em>Diablo</em> veterans are working on their own not-<em>Diablo</em> ARPG rival. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> is getting <em>Fortnite</em>-ified. The tactical shooter teased Solid Snake <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/1458090158170570805/1466485455578075342">as its next operator</a>. I doubt it’ll be as lucrative for Konami as those <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/2016797054304231572">millions of <em>eFootball</em> downloads, though</a>.</p> <h2>The messy, sad saga of Comcept finally comes to a definitive end</h2> <p>Legendary <em>Mega Man</em> artist Keiji Inafune launched his own independent studio in 2010 after leaving Capcom following the cancelation of <em>Mega Man Legends 3</em>. It was called Comcept and one of its early projects was a spiritual successor to <em>Mega Man</em> called <a href="https://kotaku.com/mighty-no-9-tries-real-hard-but-no-1782427135"><em>Mighty No. 9</em></a>. It was a 2D action platformer that relied on Kickstarter backing and ended up being a disaster both as a game and in terms of the promise of crowdfunding.</p>

 <p>Comcept was eventually acquired by Level-5 in 2017. In 2024, the company announced Inafune had departed amid a reboot of life sim RPG <i>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time. </i>Oversight of the project shifted back to Level-5’s Osaka Office. It came out last summer and was very good. But the last trace of Inafune’s legacy there is no more. The final, official dissolution of what remained of the studio was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/comcept-shuts-down">announced this week</a>.</p> <h2><em>Hytale</em> lays out an ambitious update schedule</h2> <p>The <em>Minecraft</em> clone that has early players importing all sorts of wild modes and creations is promising a rapid update pipeline to help the Early Access release grow and iterate quickly while still experimenting. “Going forward, we’ll use the pre-release patchline to be a bit more adventurous,” Simon Collins-Laflamme, founder of developer Hypixel, <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2016619068242219093?s=20">wrote on X</a>. “It will be updated weekly and may be unstable by design; this is where new features, larger changes, and iterations happen. FYI, we might skip a week from time to time for holidays, PTO, or other reasons.”</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>gets a mode that’s been MIA for seven years</strong></h2> <p>Safeguard, which first debuted in <em>Black Ops 3</em>, is back for season 2 beginning February 5. It’s essentially escorting the payload from <em>Overwatch</em> but with a robot. There will of course be new maps, cosmetics, and other unlockable with the new content drop as well.</p>

 <h2><em>Darkhaven</em> is a new ARPG from <em>Diablo</em> veterans</h2> <p>It’s got a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/">spiffy retro-looking trailer</a> and promises a twitchier combat and traversal loop than your average loot clicker. “From the very beginning, we wanted <em>Darkhaven</em> to feel good to play,”<em> Diablo</em> co-creator Erich Schaefer <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/darkhaven/arpg-diablo-veterans">told <em>PCGamesN</em></a>. “Being able to jump over attacks, climb cliffs, dash out of danger, or swim across a lake that may or may not be infested with riverfangs changes how combat feels in this kind of game. It’s not just about numbers fighting numbers any more. It’s much more engaging. For me, it becomes more about skill, finding flow, and making smart decisions in the moment. I’ve never had more fun making and playing an ARPG.” No release date yet.</p> <h2><em>World of Warcraft</em> is getting massive new dungeons</h2> <p>They’re called Labyrinths and they’ll launch in the 12.1.5 patch slated for fall 2026, Blizzard revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/pkFMkdZWxdk">a Thursday showcase</a>. The event outlined what fans of the MMORPG can expect in the year ahead beyond the upcoming March 3&nbsp;<em>Midnight</em> expansion.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/bg3-swen-vincke-highguard-concord-steam-reviews-metacritic-2000663800">The <em>Highguard</em> backlash is a collision of a bunch of different things that have been brewing for some time</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-says-no-to-toxic-dong-on-switch-2-as-dispatch-devs-confirm-censored-content-2000663868"><em>Dispatch</em> on Switch is censored</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/code-vein-2-review-ps5-xbox-steam-soulslike-jrpg-anime-2000663834"><em>Code Vein II</em> is Soulslite-slop with a fun JRPG at its core</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

For many, sharing their creations on social easily from their Switch consoles at just a few button presses is one of the great joys of modern gaming.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Purchases-Subscriptions/Games/Information-Regarding-Image-Sharing-Features-in-Tomodachi-Life-Living-the-Dream-3016504.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=TomodachiLifeLivingTheDream%7CNULL%7CNDirectImageSharingNotice%7Cm_id_MWjeHHp9KL%7C3016504">Nintendo has announced</a> that it's implementing a handful restrictions on image sharing for the game. In a vague statement on its support pages, Nintendo says that in its commitment "to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone", it's placing "restrictions on certain image sharing features".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067juxivh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's the full statement from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo aims to create experiences where players have the freedom to enjoy their Mii characters in their own way. In <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> this freedom can sometimes lead to humorous, surprising or unpredictable moments during gameplay.</p>
<p>While these moments are often fun for players, we recognise that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed.</p>
<p>Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p>To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image sharing features. These limits help to make the worlds players create in <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> remain fun and safe, and that the game can be enjoyed comfortably by all players.</p>
<p>We understand that some players may find these restrictions limiting. However, they reflect Nintendo’s ongoing philosophy of creating experiences that bring smiles to everyone who plays.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, not very specific! But Nintendo does outline things a little more clearly over on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1">Japanese website</a> (via machine translation): "The console's functions for transferring images to smartphones, posting directly to social media, and automatically uploading images (Nintendo Switch 2 only) will not be available".</p>
<p>Essentially, automatic transfer to the Nintendo Switch app (on Switch 2), as well as transferring images to your smartphone or posting from your console directly to social media (for both consoles) will be disabled. GameChat on Switch 2 and streaming the game on Twitch or YouTube won't be restricted.</p>
<p>You can, of course, still take screenshots (at least, we assume so) and use your SD card or connect your Switch console to your PC to transfer photos to your computer and <em>then</em> share them online, but it certainly adds a few extra steps to the process of sharing your ideas and screenshots.</p>

<p>So, why is Nintendo doing this? We can only speculate, but those of you who remember <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/nintendo_letter_box">Swapnote</a> might recall that the drawing and photo-sharing service was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/11/nintendo_disables_swapnotes_spotpass_service_due_to_online_safety_concerns">disabled in 2013</a> as it was being used "to exchange offensive material". We have to imagine the company is trying to prevent fans from doing this again, from sharing potentially rude and lewd designs and harmful imagery.</p>
<p>Considering all of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">additions</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-will-allow-same-sex-relationships-and-non-binary-miis">inclusivity</a>, and creativity coming to this Switch sequel, it seems like a strange decision. For a game as social as Tomodachi Life, taking out the convenience of screenshot sharing a little frustrating. It can still be done of course, but it'll just take a little more effort.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/</link>
            <guid>1420051</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The first of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Blizzard</strong> showcases planned for the <strong>studio's 35th anniversary</strong></a> is dedicated to its golden goose, the 21-year-old MMORPG <strong>World of Warcraft</strong>. The so-called <strong>State of Azeroth</strong> livestream opened with Executive Producer <strong>Holly Longdale</strong> revealing that, in the first two weeks of early access to <strong>World of Warcraft: Midnight</strong>'s new <strong>Housing</strong> feature, players <strong>spent over four million hours in player housing</strong> (450 cumulative years, basically) and <strong>placed more than 14 million décor items</strong> in their new homes. So far, the most popular item was the Secretive Bookcase Wall.</p>



<p>Longdale then switched to talk a bit about <strong>WoW Classic</strong>, which is currently at the <strong>Mists of Pandaria</strong> expansion. The next major update, the <strong>Escalation</strong> patch, will be released in a few weeks, introducing a new quest campaign, the Battlefield: Barrens world event, the new Challenge Cards system and new bosses in the Brawler's Guild, four new scenarios and Heroic scenarios, and progression to the Legendary questline. Later this year, WoW Classic players can look forward to the arrival of the Siege of Orgrimmar and Timeless Isle. Meanwhile, the launch of <strong>The Burning Crusade Classic</strong> on the <strong>Anniversary Realms</strong> is very close, featuring iconic Outlands content.</p>



<p>The State of Azeroth livestream then featured Senior Game Director <strong>Ion Hazzikostas</strong>, who appeared to outline the roadmap <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the March 2, 2026 launch of the World of Warcraft: Midnight expansion</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Twilight Ascension</strong> is a repeatable pre-launch event running until March 2, in which players join Magister Umbric and Grand Magister Rommath to repel <strong>Twilight's Blade</strong>, a splinter faction of Twilight's Hammer operating primarily in the Twilight Highlands. The cult performs large ritual events to summon rare elite bosses around the zone, which players must interrupt and defeat. By participating, players can earn limited-time rewards like pets, mounts, transmogs, and housing décor.</li>



<li><span>This week, Blizzard is also kicking off another limited-time event called&nbsp;<strong>Winds of Mysterious Fortune,</strong>&nbsp;in which experience gains when using characters between level 10 and 80 are boosted by 20%, and reputation gains, regardless of character level, are boosted by 5</span>0%. Additionally, quests and monster kills for leveling characters have a chance to award the player a so-called <strong>Mysterious Satchel</strong>, which can contain gear, cosmetics, and potions. It's a way to help returning players or existing players who are leveling alternate characters (commonly called ALTs).</li>



<li>On that note, there's also a <strong>Welcome Back Weekend</strong> live now. Former players with a lapsed subscription can enjoy free access to World of Warcraft until Sunday, February 1, with leveling up available up to 80.</li>



<li>The developers are giving away a unique <strong>Dark Portal</strong> décor item to active subscribers who log in between now and the launch of World of Warcraft: Midnight.</li>
</ul>



<p>After recapping <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the main features of the expansion</a>, Hazzikostas then moved to provide fresh details on the post-launch roadmap. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Season One</strong> will kick off a couple of weeks after March 2, introducing the 6-boss <strong>Voidspire raid</strong>, the single-boss <strong>Dreamrift mini-raid</strong>, four world bosses, a Mythic+ pool consisting of 4 Midnight and 4 returning legacy dungeons, a new Delve season, and a PvP season.</li>



<li><strong>March on Quel’Danas</strong>, another 2-boss raid zone, is scheduled to open a few weeks after Season 1 begins to cap off the expansion's initial story chapter.</li>



<li><strong>Patch 12.0.5</strong>, which goes to the Public Test Realm shortly after the launch of the expansion, is set to introduce global <strong>Void Assaults</strong> to the outdoor world and a lighthearted "Prop Hunt" inspired event featuring a new 5v5 mini-game located in Silvermoon City.</li>



<li><span><strong>Patch 12.0.7</strong>&nbsp;will further escalate</span> Void Assaults and introduce a standalone single-boss raid called <strong>Sporefall</strong> to experiment with a more frequent raiding cadence.</li>



<li><strong>Patch 12.1</strong> is going to be a major content update featuring a large new outdoor questing zone, a new raid, a new dungeon, new Delves, a new world boss, a Mythic+ refresh, and a complete overhaul of the <strong>Friend System</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Patch 12.1.5</strong>, slated to go live alongside BlizzCon 2026, adds <strong>Labyrinths</strong> (which are mega-dungeon-inspired sprawling Delve experiences), another small narrative-themed raid that will set the stage fo what's coming in 2027, and an experimental standalone mode from the creators of <strong>Plunderstorm</strong> (the Pirate-themed Battle Royale mode <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-plunderstorm-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that launched two years ago</a>) and <strong>Remix</strong>. </li>
</ul>



<p>Hazzikostas also unveiled some of the improvements coming to the Housing feature, including <strong>copy/paste functionality</strong>, <strong>mass-select</strong> for moving complex structures, and the ability to share designs via <strong>import/export codes</strong>. Décor budgets will also slowly increase, both for interiors and exteriors, as Blizzard irons out technical limitations and provides players with a sense of progression as they grow their homes. </p>

<p>Future updates will allow players to place companion pets within their homes and hitch favorite mounts in their outdoor yards. With the launch of World of Warcraft: Midnight, the <strong>Neighborhood Endeavors</strong> feature will go live as well, and the team plans to use it to monitor player behaviour and inform future updates.</p>



<p>Last but not least, the Senior Game Director teased that <strong>BlizzCon 2026, the studio's convention that returns after three years, will be 'one for the ages' </strong>where Blizzard is going to unveil <strong>its plans for the next 20 years of the Warcraft franchise</strong>. As a reminder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlizzCon 2026</a> will take place at the Anaheim Convention Center on September 12 and 13. According to the latest rumors, <a href="https://wccftech.com/third-person-starcraft-shooter-will-reportedly-be-unveiled-at-blizzcon-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Blizzard</strong> <strong>will reveal a third-person StarCraft shooter during the keynote</strong></a>.</p>

            <p>When I first played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> I had trouble working out what it wanted to be – Spider-Man? The Witcher? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a>? Dragon’s Dogma? Jedi Academy? The first of three new talkthrough videos from developers Pearl Abyss has helped concentrate the game in my mind. This is a grittier medieval fantasy take on The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom, isn’t it! Those airborne ruins are a dead giveaway. All it’s missing is the elegance and feeling of completeness. OK, it doesn’t have a magic vehicle editor, either. That I know about. Without further ado, here’s the video.

<p>
Crimson Desert looks madder than a catful of hatters. If you’re wondering why main guy Kliff Macduff walks in such a weirdly jerky way, like a toddler on springs, it’s probably because he’s trying to restrain the compressed energies of every open world mechanic ever devised. He can grapple. He can mech pilot. He can throw barrels and do wrestling moves. He can fish.</p>
<p>I don’t mean this as criticism, though I don’t entirely mean it as praise, either. I strongly suspect that this game is going to be a triumphant combination of mechanically silly and tonally self-serious and savagely broken in a way that somehow demands to be experienced for tens of hours. 
</p><p>

In watching the video, you are sparing yourself the derangement of mastering Crimson Desert’s control scheme, assuming they haven’t revised it since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crimson-desert-is-a-dork-ass-enormity-of-an-open-world-action-rpg">I played the game last year</a>. I got thrown in the deep end with that preview, asked to make sense of a midgame Kliff with a multitude of clashing abilities to choose from, while fending off the hydra of jetlag.
</p><p>I spent a lot of my demo either caterpaulting Kliff Macduff into holes, or confusing Kliff Macduff with all the people killing Kliff Macduff, or plaintively asking the PR to explain why Kliff Macduff is on fire now. The boss QTEs are like something out of the original Steel Battallion. You will beg for the sweet relief of a Bennett Foddy game. Anyway, Crimson Desert is out on March 19th this year.</p>
