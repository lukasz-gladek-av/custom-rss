			<p>If anyone thought the recent confirmation of a GTA VI delay (the game's launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been moved</a> from Fall 2025 to May 26, 2026) would harm its hype, the first viewership registered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the second trailer</a> will make them reconsider.</p>
<p>According to Rockstar Games (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-views-record-1236210396/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via The Hollywood Reporter</a>), the trailer that suddenly aired two days ago surpassed 475 million views across all platforms in the first twenty-four hours. This makes it the most-viewed trailer of all time, not just among games but across all entertainment, beating the previous record of Deadpool vs. Wolverine, which stopped at 365 million views. The recent trailer for The Fantastic Four: First Steps registered around 200 million views in the same timeframe.</p>
<p>For comparison, the first GTA VI trailer only garnered 93 million views. However, it was a YouTube exclusive, and it still managed to become the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-breaks-100-million-youtube-views-is-the-biggest-non-bts-video-ever-for-its-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most-viewed non-music video of all-time on the platform</a>, second only to a couple of songs from the South Korean boy band BTS.</p>
<p>That trailer also helped bring its featured song (Love Is a Long Road, made by Tom Petty) to the top of the music charts, and the same is true this time around with the new trailer's song, Hot Together by The Pointer Sisters. According to Spotify, the song's popularity grew by 182,000% (not a typo) following the debut of the GTA VI trailer.</p>
<p>Sulinna Ong, Spotify’s global head of editorial, stated:</p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto cuts through popular culture like almost nothing else. Music has been synonymous with the series since the very beginning, so it’s great to see fans both new and established connecting with an iconic track in this way.</em></p>
<p>Yesterday, Rockstar Games also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-confirms-latest-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-was-captured-entirely-on-ps5-includes-gameplay-and-cutscenes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> that the trailer was captured on Sony's PlayStation 5 hardware with a mix of gameplay and cutscenes. Given how great it looked, that's highly reassuring. PlayStation 5 Pro users may get even better visuals or higher frame rate options.</p>
<p>As for PC, Rockstar hasn't said anything about the platform's launch window yet, but a prominent manufacturer of PC gaming peripherals <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckons</a> GTA VI should be released only a few months after the console debut.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2019’s Death Stranding transcended the framework of ordinary video games by metaphorically depicting cosmology and even anthropology through the act of delivery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a game that challenged the idea of human connection through refreshing gameplay mechanics that fundamentally reexamined the very act of movement. To me, Death Stranding was an undeniable masterpiece that delivered a viscous flow of concepts. Now that I’ve played its sequel for more than 30 hours at a special press event at Kojima Productions’ Tokyo office, I am starting to realize that it may have been only the beginning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach can be seen as an attempt to take the premises of the first game to the next level. While taking the player on a journey across the border of the UCA (United Cities of America), its symbolic depiction of connection feels more dynamic yet less certain than its predecessor. What questions will the new journey of legendary deliverer Sam Porter Bridges bring, and how will they be answered?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it was explicitly stated that what I played was not the final version of the game, the playable portions demonstrated a density and completeness you would expect from a final product. Fundamental elements such as movement, dialogue, and presentation are highly integrated, and the intention to expand upon the experience that the first game delivered was evident throughout.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A new beginning in a new land</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In the first game, Sam reconstructed connections between people while uncovering the truth behind Death Stranding, a mysterious phenomenon that caused disconnection between cities. Through Sam's journey of delivering supplies, players experienced movement in a way video games had not offered before, while the story gradually unfolded its views on life, death, and cosmological visions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The setting of Death Stranding 2 moves from the rebuilt UCA to the Mexican border region. Bridges, the organization that previously handled delivery operations, has withdrawn from delivery, and instead, an automated delivery system called APAS is now operating with unmanned vehicles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sam was living quietly with his daughter Lou in a remote area of Mexico, but at the request of Fragile, another returning character, he takes on delivery missions again in this region where the communication infrastructure is undeveloped. A new journey quietly begins to reconnect the Chiral Network, a communication network similar to the internet.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Photorealistic modeling and subtle facial expressions of characters have also largely improved from the first game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The photorealistic graphics that meticulously depict Mexico's desolate land are nothing short of impressive. From the texture of the dried surface to faintly rippling sand dust and rocky mountains in the distance, Death Stranding 2’s visuals drew me in right away. Photorealistic modeling and subtle facial expressions of characters have also largely improved from the first game, and the art style creates an aesthetic that transcends mere realism, forming a powerful foundation supporting its surrealistic worldview and story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The part that plays in Mexico functions more or less like a tutorial, not just in terms of gameplay, but also story and settings. While the first one overwhelmed players with numerous terms and settings in its early hours, Death Stranding 2 is conscious of being accessible even without prior knowledge. The sequel also offers a recap mode in novel style narrated by Deadman.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Death Stranding left a strong impression by overwhelming players with a vast amount of information from the beginning. By doing so, it undeniably confused more casual players not used to such a convoluted story. In contrast, Death Stranding 2 introduces a glossary function called Corpus, showing careful consideration for players who have not played the first game or those who did but found it too complicated.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">An evolution of the delivery system</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I feel that the game design of Hideo Kojima's works often comes in three layers. For example, the Metal Gear series’ gameplay consists of infiltration, danger, and stealth while its movement can be divided into walking, crouching, and crawling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same philosophy can also be seen in Death Stranding. For example, your scanning device Odradek visualizes terrain danger levels in three different colors. Death Stranding 2 follows the same rules.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like in the original, the player once again has to manage cargo weight and balance while traversing unstable natural terrain. Footing must be secured on slopes, while the center of gravity must be controlled to avoid being swept away in rapid water streams. The risk of cargo damage is present throughout the process, which makes traversing the world itself a nerve-wrecking task.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Constructions such as ropes and ladders can be used to traverse the world more conveniently. These infrastructures go beyond individual player experiences, as structures installed by other players are shared in the world as the Social Strand System. As you make use of ladders and bridges left by someone else, the solitary exercise of delivery gradually transforms into a more connected and social experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to highways, Death Stranding 2 allows the player to construct monorails too, which makes traversing its world a lot smoother. Highways and monorails require a lot of materials, forcing the player to utilize the mines to gather materials. As a result, establishing trade routes has become more central to gameplay than it was the first time around.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While traversing the world itself has become more convenient, environments have become more challenging in return. The width of rivers can double due to rainfall, while natural hazards such as earthquakes called “gate quakes” and sandstorms can occur. As a new feature, the time of the day also changes in real time, which causes additional challenges for Sam. These natural elements interfere with player actions in various ways, such as footing collapsing due to flooding and earthquakes, or visibility worsening due to sandstorms and nightfall.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A new system called APAS Enhancement allows you to use skill points to enhance stats and obtain new abilities.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To overcome these conditions, the sequel also boasts more room for customization. The “Porter Grade” indicates Sam’s current proficiency in a more direct way, while a new system called APAS Enhancement allows you to use skill points to enhance stats and obtain new abilities. From weapon power enhancement to weather analysis and footprint erasure, you can choose to have Sam specialize in either delivery, movement or combat skills. That means that while preparing your cargo was pretty much the only thing you could do to get ready for a new delivery in the first game, you can now also prepare by customizing Sam’s abilities according to your preference.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sam’s skills show that once again, Kojima is utilizing three layers of gameplay in which the player can tackle the game’s missions and obstacles. However, while delivery, movement and combat skills can all be customized, combat plays a greater role in Death Stranding 2. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">New enemies and a deeper combat system</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat, meanwhile, occurs much more frequently and has become more flexible in Death Stranding 2. In the first game, combat was limited and functioned merely as a way to secure supplies or to make your way through bases. Death Stranding Director’s Cut already added infiltration missions into Mule bases, but Death Stranding 2 builds more varied stages and systematized combat in the open world, seemingly as an extension of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New human enemy forces such as Bandits and Armed Survivalists appear, and their bases are designed as stages with simple three-dimensional structures. When infiltrating these bases, players are often forced to engage in combat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">BTs, or creatures that appeared due to the Death Stranding phenomenon, also have new types. Larger BTs with stronger attacks make the combat more challenging than it was last time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat has become more tactical as well. By throwing a speaking doll called Dollman, you can observe the insides of bases from above to grasp enemy placement and movement lines. While close combat remains important, remote stealth attacks with the Blood Boomerang, precision shooting with sniper rifles, and utilizing assault rifles and grenade launchers give the player a multitude of new options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's even possible to put down Sam’s backpack, allowing for more agile and nimble movement by completely separating him from his cargo. Weight management directly connects to mobility, which greatly enhances tactical flexibility.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether to engage in direct combat, choose stealth or avoid combat altogether, freedom of approach has increased when compared to the first game. The APAS Enhancement even allows you to refund skill points, welcoming trial and error to find the playstyle that suits you best.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2 has four difficulty settings – Story, Casual, Normal (which I played), and Brutal – providing flexibility in how much you want to invest in the game’s expanded combat as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Did the trailers say too much?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As partially revealed in trailers, after a series of dramatic events, Sam will cooperate with Drawbridge, a civilian company established by Fragile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The setting moves from Mexico to Australia, and a journey to spread the Chiral network begins once again. A mobile base called DHV Magellan (Deep-Tar Hunting Vessel), named after the explorer Ferdinand Magellan who travelled around the world, functions as a hub for the player.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the name DHV Magellan suggests, the story steps into themes reminiscent of colonial domination. Furthermore, the rise of a private political organization called APAC (Automated Public Assistance Company) shows similarities with the PMC (Private Military Company) depicted in Metal Gear Solid 4. Since I haven't witnessed the story to its conclusion, it is too early to speculate on how these motifs will come to fruition in the full game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Death Stranding, people were isolated and only porters traversed the dangerous outside world, which has been noted by many as a portrayal that seemed to foresee the Covid-19 pandemic. In Death Stranding 2, the APAC seems to resonate with recent movements of America's DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency). With such eerie points of convergence with reality, I can't help but feel that there is a significance worth noting in contemporary times regarding how connections will be redefined in Death Stranding 2.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As the name DHV Magellan suggests, the story steps into themes reminiscent of colonial domination.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of particular note is the presence of actor Luca Marinelli, who plays a mysterious man. Both Marinelli’s acting ability and the presentation of scenes he appears in leave a strong impression. The mystery of who this man is and why he stands in Sam's way will have players speculating for sure. Marinelli and his character are just as captivating as Mads Mikkelsen’s Cliff was in the first game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One concern I had during my 30 hours with the campaign was that I realized that the trailers contain content that delves quite deeply into the main story, to the extent that a lot of what happened throughout the game I was already somewhat aware of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could it be that too much has been given away in the trailers? Or is there a big surprise awaiting players when Death Stranding 2’s full picture is revealed? We can only eagerly await the game’s June 26 release.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Metal Gear Solid mastermind Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding established the two opposites of division and connection as its themes during a pre-pandemic world, and its highly conceptual story structure and innovative delivery- centered movement mechanics blew open new possibilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now in its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, he poses the same question in an even more complicated form: "Should we have connected?" With its June 26, 2025 release quickly approaching, we wanted to know what kind of position Kojima had taken when creating its story now that the divisions in our world only continue to grow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The development of Death Stranding 2 proceeded under the unprecedented circumstances of the Covid pandemic. How exactly did Kojima reconsider the meaning of "connection" and reconstruct it while being forced to reckon with his understanding of technology, production environments, and the nature of our <br>relationships with one another?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/07/gettyimages-2204212002-1746647578565.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hideo Kojima will soon release Death Stranding 2. Photo by Lorne Thomson/Redferns.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In this interview, Kojima talks about his philosophy framing the game's production, what was left behind in the previous game and carried on to the new one, and contemporary society and its relationship to his games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Locations and New Elements</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What were you trying to accomplish for Death Stranding’s sequel?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> I'd like to ask you to think back to the beginning of Metal Gear Solid. No weapons appear at first, and you only acquire them after going up the elevator. Placing weapons at the very start will cause players to pick them up and start killing enemies, so we consciously decided to not do that. But that part turned out to be unpopular, with some people saying they couldn't get up the elevator. Still, we had to design Metal Gear Solid so that players learned how stealth works. For Metal Gear Solid 2, we made it a little easier to use weapons and aim at specific parts using a POV angle, as many players were already aware of stealth games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was the same for Death Stranding. There aren't many games about delivery, so we first had to get people accustomed to it first. For the sequel, we wanted to allow players that want to fight to do so more freely. Players can use weapons, and it's now easier to drive cars and motorcycles. For the story, the first game was about Sam and Cliff, but this time one of the main themes is Lou and what her existence means.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Death Stranding depicts deeply emotional themes such as loss and sorrow. Are these based on your own experiences?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> About half of what I create is based on real experiences, while the other half is based on fictional experiences. Themes like where people go when they die come from a very private place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What made you choose Mexico and Australia as new locations for Death Stranding 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> I can’t say too much, but first of all, Mexico is contiguous to the UCA, and there was a need to connect to neighboring cities. As Sam says many times, it's possible that it could lead to an invasion. In the first game, players connected  America from east to west. This does mirror the pioneer age, but are we going to do the same thing when making the sequel? My initial thought was to do something  completely different, which was a story about cutting off connections. But doing that would mean reusing the setting and environment of the first game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My thought process was that we needed a continent that's about as long across as North America that faces the ocean to both the north and south. Eurasia would be too large, and Africa wasn't right either. After thinking about it, I decided on Australia. I came up with the concept of Plate Gate as a desperate measure being used to connect it. We could potentially keep on creating sequels if we use this approach, but there aren't any plans to make any.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Why did you decide to add the concept of there being both night and day?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> We did this in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain as well, but I wanted to properly include the passage of time in an open world. Gazing at the sky as the sun rises and sets is something that couldn’t been done in the first game, in part due to engine-related reasons, but it's been put into the sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Night scenes were far too dark at first, so we changed a lot when it comes to lighting. Cutscene lighting changes depending on the time of day too. It wasn't easy building a game that could account for that. There are times when I want to use film-like backlighting in specific scenes, but this is a game, not a movie. What's being seen will change based on the player. I'd personally like you to play certain cutscenes at night, but it's fine if you see them at another time of the day too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also included the option to go to bed and wait for the morning before leaving. This is something we've been sure to include because I imagine there will be players that don't want to travel at night. Metal Gear Solid V had a system where you could smoke to advance time, but this game does it in more natural ways, like going back to bed in a private room after waking up once.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Kojima Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It felt as though there's an emphasis on strategic combat in Death Stranding 2. What kind of effect did this change have on the game's design and storytelling?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> It's not that I'm simply pushing combat. The game is still fundamentally about cargo delivery, but combat has become more flexible. Players have the choice to take a detour around enemies or use a car or motorcycle so as not to encounter them. This does mean there's a need for new weapons as well, though. Some of the staff on Death Stranding 2 worked with me on the Metal Gear series, so there were times when people worried that it was getting a little Metal Gear-ish. My personal explanation for it is that we simply pursued more enjoyable combat. This is actually connected to the theme of "we should not have connected."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This even relates to war. Our world today is connected by a rope that is the internet. But at the same time there’s conflict going on in the world. We ultimately can't connect to each other in harmless and inoffensive ways alone. Higgs tells you that ropes on their own are not enough. Maybe we also need sticks to connect with one another. The story keeps on progressing in that direction. That doesn’t mean that you will be forced into stealth. I don't even use stealth myself.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Social Strand System and how it connects to real-life social media</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Were you ever surprised by what players did with the Social Strand System in the first game? If so, how did that affect the production of Death Stranding 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> Whether players would really use the Social Strand System or not was an unknown to us. When I play the game myself, I use ladders and make bridges, but I don’t build any of the highways; I just use what someone else made. That's why I was concerned if people would really make roads themselves when the game came out, but it turned out that a lot of people did nothing but that. That was a pleasant <br>surprise for me. I wanted to make sure that the sequel would have more interesting things to do for those players as well. The monorail is one such element. One point of debate within the team when making the first game was likes. They aren't a form of currency, and they don't make you stronger. Staff members reacted negatively to that, but I placed importance on how good it feels to receive likes even <br>if they don't have any value, similar to how that feels in real life. It's a strange game design choice, you know. But even the staff members who were against it at first ended up being pleased by the implementation in the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't know how systems like these will be received until the game actually comes out and we see everyone's reactions. For the Director's Cut, we took a look at player data and decided what to remake based on the points for improvement we found there. This sequel is being developed based on the player behaviour. Personally, though, I wanted players to put down their cargo more often when they  <br>fight. Even when we had people test the game out, a lot of them tended to believe that they'd lose their cargo since that may happen in the real world, but we didn't make many changes to that part of the game during that time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You are known to be active on social media, but it seemed as though there was a shift in theme between these two games. The first Death Stranding was about people connecting, while Death Stranding 2 asks if we really should be connected.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> Death Stranding was developed before the pandemic. There were movements toward division at the time such as the United Kingdom leaving the EU, and so both its story and gameplay were created based on my thoughts on that during that time. But then Covid started three months after making the game, and I was truly shocked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now in the 21st century, though, we have the Chiral Network... which is to say the internet. Spanish flu struck in the early 20th century, but we were able to survive this time because we were connected by the internet. We started working remotely, while concerts and live events vanished. We had no choice but to rely on the Internet. Children couldn't go to school or play and had to stare at screens all day. I think we didn't have any other choice at the time. You'd turn on the TV and hear about how the metaverse was the next big thing, but that isn't how human communication works. You don't meet people by chance that way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So in other words, your thoughts about social media have changed, and that's being reflected in this title?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> This may sound strange, but I made the first game based on the theme of, "We're in danger of being divided and isolated, so let's connect." Then Covid hit after it came out. After actually experiencing that, I felt that maybe it’s not such a good thing to connect so much. That feeling is foreshadowed in lots of different scenes and settings, including "the stick and the rope." I think there are portions that players <br>will only understand once they reach the end of the game. What I felt during the pandemic is quite strongly reflected within this title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The logo for the first Death Stranding features strands dangling underneath the logo. These are meant to represent connection, but the strands dangle from above the logo for the second game. It’s kind of like the logo for The Godfather. This applies to Dollman too, and you'll find enemies dangling from strands if you go to the weapons factory as well. I added a lot of moments that will make players aware of the presence of different strands. When you really think about it, what does it mean to be connected? I hope you'll play the game when it comes out at the end of June. You've all gone through Covid, so there should be something to resonate with for everyone.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Casting and Collaborating with Artists</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How did you approach and find new cast members for Death Stranding 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> As we show you in the opening, Fragile shows up when Sam and Lou are living together. That was something I wrote while we were still making the previous game. I told Léa (Seydoux) in January 2020 that I wanted her to appear in the sequel. But due to the pandemic, we were unable to record, leading to a delay at the time. At least we were able to release the PC version and the Director's Cut during that period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since this game was made during the pandemic, the process took four to five years. This involves scanning and digitizing, choosing costumes, and more. It's not as if we can shoot everything in one three-month period like a film. It had to be done at regular intervals while making everything else, and it's pretty tough work. What determines whether you can work with someone in this kind of situation is your mutual bond. I start with the people I like, the people who I like to see in films, and the people I want to work with. I go and meet these people directly. We'll end up knowing each other for a while, and so over the course of having meals with them and such I'm able to decide whether or not I want work with them, and that's when I'd figure out the details through their agent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lindsay Wagner, who played Amelie, is someone I loved since I was young, but a younger staff member responsible for her (CG) data didn't know who she was. They said that as they saw her face each day, though, they ended up becoming a fan. In fact, by the time  production was nearing its end, they had bought the Blu-rays for The Bionic Woman. So that’s how I select the actors. I do auditions sometimes, as well, but it’s more about the connection. It’s the same for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game">OD</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Physint</a>, and other projects, too.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2 Cast</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Are there any cast performances in Death Stranding 2 that you like in particular?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> That would have to be Neil and Lucy. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-he-cast-his-solid-snake-alike-for-death-stranding-2-to-try-and-surpass-mads-mikkelsen">Neil is played by Luca (Marinelli)</a>, and I actually made a comment promoting Martin Eden, which he's in. When I did that, Luca emailed me in English himself, saying that he had been a fan of mine since he was young and that he'd read what I wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will probably let down fans of Mads (Mikkelsen), but it wouldn't be right for Cliff to return in the sequel because his story has already come to an end. That means I needed to cast someone who can surpass his performance, though I wondered if that’s even possible. That's when I thought of Luca and made him an offer. At the time I was trying to find someone who could play Lucy as a counterpart to <br>Neil, only for Luca to ask if I had already decided on his partner. When I said no, he suggested his wife. His wife, Alissa Jung, isn't just an actress but also a film director. When I met her in person, she seemed perfect to play a counsellor and so I offered her the role.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once we ended up filming Neil and Lucy's scenes, most of them involved the two characters on their own, which was kind of interesting. Luca is a stage actor as well, while Alissa is an actress and film director. There were times when they tried to put me aside and direct themselves!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You need a lot of people when working in a performance capture studio, such as makeup artists, record-keeping staff, and more. They were all spellbound during Neiland Lucy's scenes. That had never happened before, which goes to show just how amazing the scenes we captured were.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2 - Release Date Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How did your collaboration with Woodkid, whose music is included in the game, come about?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> When I was on my way back to my hotel during a January 2020 trip to Paris, I was introduced to Woodkid as a musician who was a fan of mine. He asked if I would listen to the music he was working on. The song was Goliath, and it was incredible. The song hadn't come out yet, and I fell in love with his music from then on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I returned to Japan and watched his music videos, I was shocked to see a world featuring beach-like scenery and whales, just like Death Stranding's. Ryan Karazija, the frontman of Low Roar who I collaborated with in the previous game, had passed away and I didn't know what to do for the sequel's music, but when I offered that role to Woodkid he gladly accepted it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like I was worried about who would replace Mads, I was worried about the music, and I've gotten texts asking if it's really possible to create a musical experience better than Low Roar's.  It was received very well worldwide, and Woodkid said to me for the first time that he actually had felt immense pressure that people would say they don’t like it and reject him because it wasn’t Low Roar, but he was assured after seeing the positive response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How do you go about selecting which songs to use in a game? How much of your personal taste in music is reflected in that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> Like the previous game, I've asked Ludvig Forssell to handle the soundtrack. Of course, Woodkid's songs are in there, too. I pick musicians who I listen to and enjoy regularly. Similar to casting, I contact them directly and get permission to use their music, or they'll let me know that they want to write a new song for me that I then use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What was the most rewarding part of creating Death Stranding 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kojima:</strong> I wrote the proposal for this game while isolated during the pandemic and worked on it with people whose faces I couldn't see for the most part, only really meeting Yoji Shinkawa once a week. I imagine the same went for any studio. If we can't all gather and we can't shoot, what should we do? But even under those circumstances, I was fortunate to have everyone's help as we made progress on the <br>game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd say it was around 2021 when we seriously began performance capture work. But I wasn't allowed to go to the Los Angeles studio at the time and had to connect there remotely from Tokyo to direct the actors there. I used my smartphone, my iPad, and all kinds of cameras, but directing remotely really did drive me mad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just when I didn't know what to do, someone from Sony HQ let me borrow two window-like monitors that make two-way voice communication possible, which allowed me to find a way to record. It still wasn't easy, though. When someone's working right next to you, you're able to make discoveries and realizations about what to do. But if you're working fully remote, there are a lot of times when the timing<br>or details of a report get delayed. Even if someone makes a mistake, it isn't noticed right away. Still, I think we'll find a way to make it safely over the finish line. At the time, I really thought that it wouldn't be possible to complete the game. So what has been the most rewarding? I think I’m just really happy that we can finish making the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Thank you for your time.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Lorne Thomson/Redferns.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-trailer-biggest-video-launch-of-all-time-rockstar-says-eclipsing-deadpool-and-wolverine<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Rockstar may have nudged the release date of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> back into 2026, but that doesn't mean interest has faded in any way, shape or form.</p>
<p>The second trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6 blasted its way past 475m views across platforms in just 24 hours. This makes the trailer the biggest video launch of all time, Rockstar told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-views-record-1236210396/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p>
<p>To put that figure into more perspective, the publication notes the trailer for Deadpool and Wolverine was viewed 365m times in its first 24 hours, while The Fantastic Four: First Steps debuted to more than 200m.</p>
<figure>
</figure>
<p>The first GTA 6 trailer was released all the way back in December 2023, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-proves-its-dominance-as-trailer-breaks-youtube-records">clocked up 93m views in the first 24 hours</a>, which is significantly less than the second trailer. The first trailer was exclusive to YouTube, however, and at the time of writing the second trailer only has 84m views on the platform. I say 'only' like it is nothing, but let's be honest, this is still hardly an insignificant number by any stretch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, and as has been the case with many songs, Hot Together by The Pointer Sisters has additionally seen a boost since it was featured in the latest GTA 6 trailer. Spotify said streams of the song had risen by 182,000 percent since its release.</p>
<p>"Grand Theft Auto cuts through popular culture like almost nothing else," Sulinna Ong, Spotify's global head of editorial, said in a statement. "Music has been synonymous with the series since the very beginning, so it’s great to see fans both new and established connecting with an iconic track in this way."</p>
<p>Following the second trailer's debut, Rockstar updated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-cast-and-locations-revealed-troublesome-rappers-vice-city-and-beyond">GTA 6's website with details on the upcoming game's cast and locations</a>. Then yesterday, the developer confirmed the latest GTA 6 trailer was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-says-gta-6s-latest-trailer-was-gameplay-and-cutscenes-captured-entirely-in-game-on-ps5">a mix of "gameplay and cutscenes" captured "entirely in-game" on a PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is set to arrive on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May</a> 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has forecast 15m sales of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> console over the remainder of this financial year.</p>
<p>The console will launch next month and, by March 2026, Nintendo has predicted 15m console sales and 45m sales of software, according to its latest financial report.</p>
<p>The original Switch console sold 14.87m units in its first year on sale (Q4 FY17 - Q3 FY18), meaning Nintendo is predicting its new console will sell quicker.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-hopes-to-beat-switch-sell-20m-switch-2-consoles-in-first-year-analysts-say">Analysts had predicted Switch 2 sales of over 20m</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">Nintendo recently admitted demand "far exceeds expectations"</a> and warned of stock shortages. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">Trump's tariffs in the US</a> will also impact sales.</p>
<p>As for the original Switch console, hardware sales are down 31.2 percent year-on-year, while software sales are down 22.2 percent year-on-year. This is expected as the console nears the end of its life cycle and its follow-up has been announced.</p>
<p>Total lifetime sales for the Switch 1 are now at 152.12m units, just behind the DS at 154.02 units. The number of annual Switch 1 users has dipped slightly from 129 million to 128 million, but remains high.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> has sold particularly well, reaching 7.48m units. This makes it the fastest-selling game in the series on Switch, although <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party">Super Mario Party</a> hit lifetime sales of 20.1m. Still, Jamboree will see a second life with its Switch 2 upgrade.</p>
<p>Sales of other new games in the last fiscal year include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> (3.7m), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario">Paper Mario</a> The Thousand Year Door (1.9m), Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership (1.6m), Luigi's Mansion 2 (1.6m), and Donkey Kong Country Returns (1m).</p>
<p>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, meanwhile, has sold a further 6.2m copies this financial year. Its lifetime sales are now 68.2m copies, ahead of Switch 2's flagship launch game Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>Interestingly, digital sales increased by 3.3 percent year-on-year, with 62.9 percent of software sales being digital in the last quarter. Sales of Nintendo games have traditionally been physical, but this slowly appears to be changing - perhaps more with Switch 2 considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">most third-party physical releases don't have the game on the card</a>.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has released its financial report for the financial year 2025, and it has some interesting stats. What we know is that the Nintendo Switch has surpassed 152 million units sold, making it second to the Nintendo DS which had over 154 million units sold. When it comes to the Switch 2, Nintendo is forecasting 15 million hardware sales in financial year 2026, which runs from April 1st 2025 to March 31st 2026. On top of that, Nintendo expects 45 million software sales for the Switch 2.</p>



<p>As you would expect, after the Switch 2 launch Nintendo does forecast a drop in sales for the Switch for financial year 2026. The company expects the hardware sales numbers to shrink by 58.3% compared to financial year 2025, to a total of 4.5 million. That would leave the Switch on course to hit 156 million units sold, which would make it the best selling Nintendo console ever. Nintendo also expects a drop in software sales for the Switch by 32.4% to 105 million units from 155.41 million units. The drops in both of these have been forecast to be made up by the Switch 2 hardware and software sales.</p>
<p>Speaking of software, Nintendo confirmed that 24 titles sold over a million copies in financial year 2025, with 15 being first party titles and 9 being third party titles. Of the new titles, Super Mario Party Jamboree hit 7 million sales, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom 3.7 million sales, Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door 1.9 million sales, both Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership and Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD hit 1.6 million sales, while Donkey Kong Country Returns HD hit a million sales. For Switch software lifetime sales, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe leads the pack with 68.2 million sales, followed in second place by Animal Crossing: New Horizons at 47.82 million sales, and Super Smash Bros Ultimate in third with 36.24 million sales. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has reached 32.81 million sales on Switch, while follow up The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is at 21.73 million. Pokémon Scarlet/<br>
Pokémon Violet has hit 26.79 million, just beating Pokémon Sword/Pokémon Shield which came in at 26.72 million sales.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">Nintendo Switch 2 release date is set for June 5th 2025</a>, so only a month away. Pre-order stock is currently sold out everywhere at the moment.</p>

                <p>My first go-round with Death Stranding was a complicated one.</p><p dir="ltr">Longtime fans of Hideo Kojima were salivating at the prospect of the first project coming out of his post-Konami studio. No one knew quite what to expect. Early trailers didn’t help much. Was this just … a delivery game? Were we in store for a Metal Gear Solid 2-like gotcha moment when we played the final product? Not really! It was, in many ways, a “delivery game.” Albeit one wrapped in a narrative and universe that made Metal Gear Solid (samurai President clones and all) seem like a realistic depiction of tactical stealth action by comparison.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Death Stranding 2 - On The Beach Trailer Full Breakdown</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I hated it. I don’t know what I expected or wanted out of this new IP, but something about holding the trigger buttons to lean left and right to avoid falling over instantly turned me off. I found the game monotonous, needlessly obtuse, and described it in a way only a veteran games writer could. Namely, I went on podcasts and said it “****ing sucks” and also “sucks s**t.” There’s a reason people pay me to talk about video games.</p><p dir="ltr">Seven or eight hours in, I dropped it. It wasn’t until the Director’s Cut two years later that I decided to give it another shot. I walked past the living room and saw my wife playing it, and she was carefully approaching a river and scanning it with her Odradek (the little flappy scanner thing on Sam Porter Bridges’ shoulder). It seemed too perilous to cross the deep water with all the cargo she was carrying, so she continued down the river bank until she saw a safer path forward.</p><p dir="ltr">This shouldn’t have been a eureka moment for anyone, as examining the land and delivering packages with caution is one of the main things the game tasks you with. However, I had rushed through my original experience with Death Stranding in order to meet a coverage embargo. I sprinted from objective to objective in order to see as much of the game as possible so that I could talk about it on a podcast in a timely manner. Turns out that’s not the way to play it! So I gave the Director’s Cut a shot, took my time with it, and was quickly ashamed of my words and deeds. Death Stranding is a great game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490428-1%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490428" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490428-1%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490428"></a><figcaption>Death Stranding 2 has a star-studded cast.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490428-1%286%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When I heard I’d be travelling to Tokyo this year to play <em>30 hours</em> of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, I told myself to remember my past mistakes and meet this sequel on its own terms. I would take my time, play it “right,” and hopefully have a better first experience this time around.</p><p dir="ltr">Having played through the original was a huge benefit when it came to my early hours. There was no surprise when I was confronted with the need to balance Sam’s cargo. And since the world had already been exhaustively established in the first game, I wasn’t suffering from constant whiplash when bombarded by one bewildering concept after another. Within the first half hour, a character brings you “the finest chiral-printed diapers” and my brain just registered that as a normal thing to say in this world. It’s like how eventually in Metal Gear Solid, we all just accepted that “nanomachines” as a concept could explain everything from psychics to vampires.</p><p dir="ltr">Let’s back up a bit from the chiral diapers though. You first gain control of Sam Porter Bridges during a tremendous opening sequence, which tasks you to simply “return home with Lou,” the baby from the first game. On paper you’re simply walking across precarious rocky cliffs, but the Kojima magic is hitting you from all angles. Triumphant chanting and drums set the tone as you clamber across cliff faces. A “gate quake” strikes, causing boulders to cascade down the hills around you. Opening credits flank Sam with the signature style of Kojima’s longtime title designer Kyle Cooper. Sure, you may just be walking from Point A to Point B, but I’ll be damned if Kojima doesn’t make it feel <em>cool and important.</em></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490429-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490429" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490429-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490429"></a><figcaption>Vehicles continue to be a great way to traverse flat terrain.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490429-1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When Sam finally arrives at his camouflaged shelter in the mountains, we get a glimpse of his new life. It’s 11 months after the events of the first game and he seems to have found something resembling peace. Instead of the sterile private rooms he resided in during his transient past, this shelter feels homey and borderline cozy. Happy pictures of the father and daughter cover the walls, toys are strewn across the floor, and Lou is being fed things other than Monster Energy. But in a trope that Kojima has loved since he presumably saw Commando in 1985, it’s time to pull the grizzled vet back in for <em>one more mission because he’s the only man for the job. </em>For the record, I very much enjoy this trope as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Fragile (not that Fragile) shows up unexpectedly and shatters this sense of calm. Humanity is still on the brink of extinction, Bridges no longer oversees the UCA’s distribution network, Die-Hardman is no longer the President, and Fragile is suffering from “Jumpshock” after too many trips to the Beach.</p><p dir="ltr">I could sit here and try to explain everything going on in that last sentence but thankfully I don’t have to. One of the most welcome additions to Death Stranding 2 is the new Corpus feature. It’s an in-game glossary that can be accessed at any time, even during cutscenes. It’s exhaustive, giving you in-depth explanations on demand regarding the story, terms, characters, and mechanics. A similar system was put to great use in Avowed, and no universe needs it more than this one. I found myself referring to it regularly, and it really did help me gain a further understanding of what was going on and what I needed to do.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490430-1%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490430" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490430-1%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490430"></a><figcaption>You'll meet plenty of threats throughout your many journeys. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490430-1%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Your first order of business sounds simple. Sam lives near the border of the UCA (formerly USA) and Mexico, and Fragile wants you to extend the chiral network across the border to a lab operated by Deadman. A giant BT is heading that way, and Fragile offers to babysit Lou so Sam can focus on the mission. I won’t go into the specific story details that influence Sam’s journey this time around, but I will say that the first 7-8 hours of the game take place in Mexico before events ultimately take our crew to Australia. My remaining 20+ hours of gameplay during this event took place here, starting from the West Coast and working my way east. I was told that the 30 hours I played added up to roughly 30-40% of the overall game, so it remains to be seen if more continents lie ahead for Sam.</p><p dir="ltr">Not long into the journey, Sam finds himself on the DHV Magellan, a behemoth of a ship that can navigate tar currents and takes on the distinct appearance of the top half of Metal Gear Rex. Residing on the ship is an expanding motley crew of colorful characters, and their interplay is one of my favorite narrative improvements to the sequel. There was no shortage of interesting characters in the original game, but your interactions with them felt somewhat siloed off. Here’s Heartman’s house where you talk to Heartman. Here’s your private room where Fragile shows up. Here’s Mama’s lab where you talk to Mama. In Death Stranding 2, you frequently find yourself going back to the Magellan and interacting with a group of characters, and it really helps. It’s like the difference between the first three seasons of Arrested Development with the whole cast and that weird fourth one where they could only get like two actors together for any scene.</p><p dir="ltr">The Magellan is piloted by Tarman, whose appearance is modeled on Mad Max director George Miller. He’s missing a hand for reasons you’ll learn in a flashback, and suffers from “phantom pains” as a result (yes, he uses that phrase). My understanding is that because his hand is “dead,” it’s a BT of sorts and that’s why he can pilot through tar and the beach? Look, I’m trying my best here. Also, a tar-covered flying cat follows him around.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490431-1%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490431" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490431-1%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490431"></a><figcaption>Help out your fellow players!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490431-1%282%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A talking mannequin torso named Charlie is the mysterious benefactor that funds the DHV Magellan as well as Fragile’s new organization (named Drawbridge). Tomorrow, played by Elle Fanning, is a woman that Sam finds in a different realm. She’s discovered in a golden cocoon of sorts and is virtually silent at first. As she spends time with the crew on the Magellan, she begins to open up and eventually demonstrates some spectacular abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Next up is my guy, Dollman. This dude is the best. He was originally a human man, but somehow his “Ka” (soul) wound up in the “Ha” (body) of a puppet. It doesn’t seem to bother him much, because he just hangs out on Sam’s belt or on a shelf in the Magellan and offers friendly advice and conversation. Every single time I go back to Sam’s room, the first thing I did was see if he had something new to say. And a little pro tip: If he’s interested in any specific song on Sam’s music player, be sure to play it for him.</p><p dir="ltr">At one point, he asked me if I wondered how he maintained his youthful appearance. Despite that not being one of my first 50 questions I’d have regarding Dollman, I heard him out. You see, there’s a woman on the Magellan named Rainy. She’s a pregnant woman that for some reason causes Timefall rain all around her if she steps outside. Timefall rain ages everything it touches, but in a 1.5-meter radius around her body, it actually causes Corefall rain--which makes everything it touches younger. So every once in a while, Rainy will take Dollman into the shower with her. The shower water turns into Corefall, and Dollman is forever young. Simple!</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490432-1%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490432" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490432-1%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490432"></a><figcaption>Like its predecessor, this is a pretty game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490432-1%284%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A ton of little moments made me smile or laugh during the event, but it was a moment with Dollman that tickled me the most. He’s dangling off my belt as I approach a river. The poor little guy is trying his best to explain to me the dangers of high water levels, and I confidently decide to start wading in regardless. As he’s mid-sentence, my waist dips below the water level and his friendly advice turns into frantic gurgling as water floods his little puppet esophagus. Like they accomplished with Metal Gear Solid, Kojima and the crew manage to balance a deadly serious (albeit ludicrous) main storyline with moments of incredible comedic sensibility.</p><p dir="ltr">As this is still a bit of a “delivery game” between the cutscenes, the comedy can frequently come from unexpected, unscripted moments. When I first got my tri-cruiser bike, I loaded it up with cargo and excitedly tested out the boost function as I sped out of the garage. I probably should have surveyed the area ahead of time, as I immediately careened off a cliff, crashing the bike and scattering cargo everywhere.</p><p dir="ltr">While you’ll eventually have the familiar experience of falling into the river and seeing your cargo helplessly flow downstream, the more frustrating qualities of delivering cargo are significantly reduced this time around. I noticed that I wasn’t having to micromanage my leaning nearly as much, and I rarely fell down. Lou will still occasionally cry, but not with the Yoshi’s Island-like frequency of the first game. I soothed her once or twice in my 30 hours of playing, but it never felt particularly necessary.</p><p dir="ltr">Numerous environmental features are introduced, and they’re more cool than frustrating. “Gate Quakes” rattle the earth, while wind storms, rising water levels during rain, “chiral cinder” showers, and forest fires serve to vary up the experience. Trekking through an America that looked like Iceland in the first game was certainly beautiful, but the variety is much appreciated this time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490433-1%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490433" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490433-1%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490433"></a><figcaption>Death Stranding 2 features plenty of new characters in its cast.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490433-1%287%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I made a mistake in my early hours, as I played Death Stranding 2 perhaps <em>too </em>similarly to how I played the first game. Lethal combat was discouraged in the original, as killing an enemy ran the risk of creating a “voidout” (massive explosion). As a result, I routed my early deliveries in the sequel to go around enemy camps rather than through them. I avoided combat, but after talking to other press at the event, I learned that I missed an important cutscene featuring a red cyborg samurai that sounded reminiscent of the horrifying introduction to Gray Fox in Metal Gear Solid.</p><p dir="ltr">More importantly, I learned that I shouldn’t be avoiding combat. Unless I missed something, there is no risk of creating voidouts as the weapons are non-lethal. Rubber bullets are the standard for your guns, and weapons like “tranq grenade launchers” are the norm rather than lethal alternatives. I unlocked so many weapons in the first game but was afraid to use them because I didn’t want to kill an enemy, so I usually avoided combat or stuck to options like the bola gun.</p><p dir="ltr">Once I retrained myself to play it as a stealth-action game, it greatly improved my enjoyment and I started looking forward to camps of enemies. I snuck up onto some high ground near an enemy outpost and threw Dollman into the air above it. In mid-air, my puppet buddy acted as a surveillance drone of sorts, tagging enemies and notable cargo. After calling him back and thanking him for his service, I tossed a decoy grenade that created some holographic wildlife to distract the bandits. Despite being historically terrible at stealth, I was able to knock out two enemies from behind before blowing my cover and resorting to more direct action. Sprinting around and dodging gunfire, I learned that I could perform pro-wrestling moves like a crossbody block or Kenny Omega’s V-Trigger if I jumped while approaching enemies. A mixture of melee combat and explosives (non-lethal of course) took out the rest of the bandits, I robbed the camp of its cargo, loaded it up onto a stolen enemy vehicle, and drove off to cash it in. I’m not going to say that this game is “MGS V meets Death Stranding,” but it’s certainly a hell of a lot closer to that than the first game was.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490434-1%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490434" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490434-1%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490434"></a><figcaption>Best to customize your backpack for whatever challenges your next journey might task you with.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4490434-1%283%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even BT encounters are greatly improved. In the first game, frequent BT occurrences would require Sam to hold his breath and sneak around at a snail’s pace if he didn’t want to trigger a frustrating sequence involving trudging through tar as enemies chase you. While that can still happen in Death Stranding 2, you’re much better equipped for the situation. Many weapons are effective on BTs, such as the new Blood Boomerang that siphons blood from Sam and can eliminate BTs with one well-aimed headshot.</p><p dir="ltr">Boss fights are better across the board, including an excellent early encounter with a hulking red mech. An Oblivion-style “Sam’s Stats” feature allows skills like terrain traversal and carrying capacity to level up passively as you play. A new skill tree is introduced that can be respecced on the fly, depending on the situation. Everything in this game is less laborious and more fun.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the first game, it can be meditative in the quiet moments as you traverse the environment. But when the game wants to get loud, it does not hold back. One chapter--titled “Conflagration”--is one of the most visually stunning sequences I’ve ever seen in a game. Even running on a base PS5, it’s a spectacle that culminates in a boss encounter that rivals the best of Metal Gear Solid. Mechanically, it’s essentially a shootout with a boss and multiple soldiers, but tonally and visually, it’s Kojima firing on all cylinders and it’s truly jaw-dropping.</p><p dir="ltr">I’ve been to countless pre-release events, and in the best-case scenario, it usually winds up with a preview along the lines of, “What I played during my hour-long demo was great, let’s hope the final product can match what they showed off!” But I played 30 hours of Death Stranding 2 before writing this preview. I can confidently say that it’s excellent, and I can’t wait to do it all again (and much more) when it releases next month.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> already has a concept in mind for Death Stranding 3, but doesn't plan to make it himself.</p>
<p>Death Stranding was Kojima's first game from his new studio Kojima Productions, and will be followed up next month by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear whether Kojima intends for Death Stranding to be a long-running franchise, but there's a new narrative device in the sequel that would allow, plot-wise, for future installments - <strong>some spoilers for Death Stranding 2 follow</strong>.</p>

<p>In a Q&amp;A during a preview for Death Stranding 2, Kojima discussed why he chose Australia as the setting for the sequel instead of America, and how this could be expanded further in future games.</p>
<p>"America already has the UCA [United Cities of America], so for the sequel, I debated whether to use the same sort of setting or not," Kojima said. "The first idea I had was that you would have to go around disconnecting everything you connected, because you learn that connecting was a big mistake. But that didn't feel right, as it would just be reusing the same environment."</p>
<p>"I wanted an area that was sprawled from east to west like America and also somewhere that faced the ocean to the north and south. In that case, Eurasia or Africa felt like too big of a continent, but in terms of size and scale, I felt that Australia was a good fit."</p>
<p>Kojima then "squeezed out" an idea of the Plate Gate, which in-game acts as a portal to another continent and allows protagonist Sam Porter-Bridges to travel to new environments.</p>
<p>"If I use this Plate Gate concept, I could make endless sequels!" said Kojima. "I, of course, don't have any plans to do that, but I already have a concept for another sequel. I am not going to make it myself, but if I passed it on to someone else, they could probably make it."</p>
<p>For more on the sequel, check out my extensive preview of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach detailing more on the game's premise, its expanded gameplay, and strong influence of Metal Gear Solid.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be released on 26th June exclusively on PlayStation 5, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">revealed at Kojima's SXSW panel in March</a> along with a ten minute trailer revealing Luca Marinelli's fake Snake character.</p>

When he came to, Mamorukun found himself in a mysterious world.</p><p>“Hi everyone~! Welcome to the Netherworld!”</p><p>According to the Netherworld shrine maiden Jigokudani Fururu, she summoned “chosen souls” to save the Netherworld from crisis.</p><p>Ignoring the protests of the boys and girls gathered with Mamorukun, Fururu continued her explanation.</p><p>Currently, someone is trying to open the gate to the “Dark World” in the Netherworld. As a result, the residents of the Netherworld are cursed. To save the Netherworld, you must purify the residents and prevent the gate to the Dark World from opening.</p><p>“Now, brave ones!

A quick tap fires a “small curse bullet” that lands directly in front of you.</p><p>Touching the deployed curse field curses both enemies and yourself! Holding the button charges a “large curse bullet” that flies far. The initial shockwave can erase enemy bullets and grants brief invincibility!</p><p>Cursed enemies continuously take damage. Defeating them yields many score items!</p><p>When you’re cursed, your power and speed increase for a certain time. However, while cursed, you can’t shoot curse bullets, and once the curse ends, your power decreases. <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter the power of curses to advance through the vast Netherworld.</p><p><strong>Game Modes</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a title="Genres > Arcade [77 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">Arcade</a> Mode</strong> – Play the 2008 arcade version.

            <title><![CDATA[There Is No Getting Back On This Ride]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/marvel-thunderbolts-movie-im-so-tired</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there-is-no-getting-back-on-this-ride.1183848/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/marvel-thunderbolts-movie-im-so-tired<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Because I work in a nerd-adjacent field, I've been asked a lot over the last few weeks whether I was going to go and see <em>Thunderbolts</em>, and every time I'm asked I give the same answer: lol absolutely not.</p><p>This is not because I am pre-emptively criticising an individual film without having seen it, or that I am giving shit to those who <em>are </em>excited to go see it. For all I know this could be a fun little superhero romp, a lighthearted couple of hours spent in a cinema watching actors blow shit up. But then, this is not really an individual film, is it? It's a mere chapter, the latest instalment in a movement that lost me (and a lot of other people) a long time ago and will likely never get us back.</p><p>You can point to all kinds of factors behind the colossal success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe between 2008 (when <em>Iron Man</em> was released) and 2019 (when<em> Avengers: Endgame</em> hit cinemas), and whichever one you point to--the chemistry, the humour, the effects--would be a fair point. I've always figured the series' success was broadly based on something more fundamental, though, something that goes beyond the merits of any of the individual films or the people involved in making them.</p><p>Comic books are modern mythology, a cornerstone of Western popular culture (and American in particular), but they have also grown over the decades into an impenetrable mess of conflicting canon, characters and storylines. You can say that you love Superman, and I will believe you, but the average person has not read an actual Superman comic since they were a kid, if ever, because to commit yourself to reading superhero comics is to subject yourself to the torment of burying yourself under almost a century of bullshit.</p><p>That's why even at points in my life when I have been super into comics, and there have been several, I was never really into Marvel or DC stuff. I sought out fresher stories with a clean plate, like <em>Tom Strong</em> and <em>Planetary</em>, whose sagas I could get a handle on from beginning to end, not those with encyclopaedic levels of baggage behind every character, location and reference.</p><p>The real strength of the MCU was that it felt the same way. It brought us everything great about comics--the adventures, the escapades, the one-liners--but without any of the burden. <em>Iron Man</em>, <em>Thor</em>, <em>Captain America</em>–all these film series started from scratch, and so millions of people around the world were able to watch as these movies told new and self-contained stories, despite the fact they all starred very old characters.</p><p>Or, at least, that <em>was</em> the strength of the MCU until <em>Endgame</em>. The conclusion of the <em>Avengers </em>saga left Disney and Marvel with a void to fill, and instead of filling it with whatever a new generation's version of the MCU could have been, they just started shovelling whatever leftover and rebaked slop they could find in there instead. So we got a succession of TV shows and movies that felt cast adrift from the series that broke box office records, full of new actors in old costumes and brighter spotlights on lesser characters, each one telling a new story but also one that wove into those that had come before.</p><p>As these films and shows began piling up, that central appeal of the MCU began to wane. The whole point was that these were simple stories for the masses that you could partake in every few months, as good-to-amazing films hit the big screen through that 2008-2019 run. But when those simple stories started continuing in movies less people were seeing and cross-referencing the events of TV shows even <em>less </em>people had seen, that created problems.</p><p>I first noticed this a few years back, when I found that it was becoming a struggle to keep up with everything. I don't know if it was the volume of information I was now supposed to be retaining or just that the quality of the films and shows that were conveying it had gone downhill, but somewhere around that first slate of TV shows (<em>Wandavision</em>, <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>) and <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em> (2022), staying in step with the wider Marvel narrative had stopped being a pleasure and had started feeling like a chore.</p><p>I used to be into the Marvel movies because, for the most part, they were fantastic big-screen adventures. I followed the story because I <em>wanted </em>to follow it, but lately it's been more about obligation than pleasure, Marvel keeping you forever hostage, because how could you possibly enjoy <em>Captain America VII: Shield Party</em> if you haven't seen the Disney + series <em>Black Widow Goes To Washington</em>, which itself only makes sense if you know the backstory from <em>Hawkeye Nearly Died Under A Snow Plough</em>?</p><p>I finally hit my breaking point by the end of <em>Loki's </em>second season. I made it all the way through to the final episode, one that was piling increasing amounts of intrigue and major new villain reveals into the canon, before turning it off only a few minutes in, because...well, everything I've just said hit me within a few seconds of stark realisation, like a bucket of cold water being dumped on my head. I haven't watched a single Marvel movie or TV show since.</p><p>And let me tell you, it feels <em>great</em>. Where even five years ago I would be watching Marvel trailers and then movies like they were homework, I now see brief mentions of announcements on my social media timelines and feel nothing. I can't recommend it enough. It's liberating. Every hour of the last three years that I would have been stuffing Marvel slop into my brain I've instead been doing quite literally anything else, from playing with my kids to helping run a website to watching, gasp, other types of movies.</p><p>To make that break, though, means making the break. You can't step off the ride then try to get back on later while it's still moving, not without a ton of homework that would defeat the point of getting off in the first place. I have no idea what <em>Thunderbolts</em>' deal even is! I half-recognise people from old movies, I see some assholes from TV shows I did not enjoy and have stopped watching, and I have no idea what they're doing here or why I should care. Being off the ride really highlights how much of a ride it is; that somewhere along the line the MCU stopped being about making cool movies (that made billions of dollars) and started being, like so much else in our modern hellscape, about user retention.</p><p>Which has worked for Disney, to a point: even in its reduced state, Marvel stuff still makes a lot of money, still has millions of fans around the world who keep turning up again and again to consume it, and I'm so tired of criticising stocks-addled movie executives that I can't even fault them for trying to make the line keep going up, as much as I can't get angry at a dog for barking.</p><p>As a result of that greed, though, and a complete inability to let go of the golden goose that was the MCU, Disney has created something so much more than a series of fun movies that all tied into one another. They've created an obligation, a cultural job you need to clock in for to keep getting paid, and like all shitty jobs, there are few things on Earth that feel better than quitting and never going back.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-iv-max-traffic-speed-tom-walker-finished"><h3>He Did It</h3></a><p>Far and away the biggest Grand Theft Auto-related news of the day</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

His story recounts events that transpired throughout 2017 or, according to Darrah, “the most impactful 12 months in BioWare’s history.” He touches on not only decisions that affected the early development of last year’s Dragon Age game but how a change in attitude was tied to the final days of development on Mass Effect: Andromeda.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It starts in late 2016, when Darrah was moved over to the team that would handle the last stages of development on Andromeda. He says his “feeling at the time” was that the Dragon Age team felt “jerked around” and had “no support from BioWare or EA.” The hope was that Darrah could aid in getting Mass Effect out the door so the next Dragon Age could utilize more resources, though this ultimately didn’t quite pan out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This was the first time where we had this leadership discontinuity, where the person in charge of a project left that project to help someone else, some other project, while the project continued to run,” Darrah explained. “In the cast of Mass Effect: Andromeda, I don’t think the impact to Dragon Age was huge. It wasn’t very long, but it did set this precedent as this being a thing that we could do, and it’s not a good thing to do. It is incredibly dangerous to have a project run while it’s missing some of its core leadership.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect: Andromeda launched in March 2017 and, in Darrah’s own words, “it doesn’t go well.” Throughout this time, BioWare was still adjusting to a structural change that saw the team reporting to new leadership at EA that was “hyper interested” in its projects and plans. He calls the change dramatic, noting that the studio’s new bosses weren’t interested in continuing work on Mass Effect due to its recently troubled launch. However, Darrah didn’t feel like Dragon Age was getting the support it needed even after Andromeda was shipped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The former BioWare lead says he approached current EA CEO Andrew Wilson and former EA executive Patrick Söderlund with his concerns and was reassured of Dragon Age’s importance to the company. While EA offered few resources in an attempt to maintain the studio’s work in the summer of 2017, Darrah along with the rest of the BioWare staff were told that studio veteran Casey Hudson would be returning. It was a major shakeup that staff was made aware of without notice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You have to remember: I am the second most senior person at BioWare,” Darrah said. “Casey was interviewed, and hired, and prepared to be brought back entirely without me being consulted in any way. Would me have being involved in the process have changed the decision? No, I don’t think it would have, but there is an immense amount of disrespect involved in making a hire of this impact, in making a decision of this import, without involving the second-most senior person at your studio in any way.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah then predicted that BioWare would shift its focus to Anthem. When his concerns were shared with EA, he was told that leadership was committed to giving Dragon Age the attention it deserved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As we all know, that’s not what happened at all,” he added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA’s interest in Anthem ballooned until its similarly troubled launch in 2019, all while Darrah felt his trust in the company was being “constantly hammered” and “constantly challenged.” Resources were continuously pulled away from what would eventually be known as Dragon Age: The Veilguard all the way through 2019, leading to what Darrah says were “fundamental” changes to the nature of the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Age: The Veilguard would go on to release in late 2024 as BioWare’s latest AAA fantasy RPG. Despite positive reviews from critics (we gave it a 9/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">our review</a>), EA painted its launch as a letdown, saying in February that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-failed-to-resonate-with-a-broad-audience-gamers-increasingly-want-shared-world-features"><u>failed to “resonate with a broad enough audience.”</u></a> These were comments former BioWare developers later pushed back on, with some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-co-creator-offers-ea-some-advice-follow-baldurs-gate-3-developer-larians-lead"><u>suggesting the company should follow the lead set up by Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many Dragon Age developers were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">laid off in January of this year</a> as the studio shifted its focus back to Mass Effect 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <p>
A year and a half after Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard for $69bn, the US Federal Trade Commission's continuing attempts to block the deal might finally have come to an end following the 9th Circuit Court's decision to deny its appeal of a 2023 lower court ruling.
</p>
<p>
The FTC has been battling Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard since it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-near-deal-to-buy-call-of-duty-maker-activision-blizzard-report">proposed in 2022</a>, arguing - in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-suing-to-block-microsofts-69bn-activision-blizzard-acquisition">antitrust lawsuit filed in December that year</a> - the deal would "harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets." After a substantial amount of legal back and forth throughout 2023, the US courts (alongside regulatory bodies around the world) cleared the way for Microsoft's deal to proceed, and proceed it did.
</p>
<p>
However, despite the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's acquisition was completed in October 2023</a>, the FTC has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-resumes-case-against-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard">continued to petition the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, asking it to overturn a lower court's July 2023 decision <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftcs-final-attempt-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-has-failed">not to issue a preliminary injunction halting Microsoft's deal</a>. However, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/microsoft-wins-ftc-appeal-challenging-69-bln-activision-blizzard-deal-2025-05-07/">reported by Reuters</a>, the 9th Circuit Court has now upheld the earlier ruling, saying the lower court "applied the correct legal standards" and that the FTC failed to provide sufficient evidence Microsoft's deal would lessen competition.
</p>
<p>
In order to pursue its case further, the FTC would need to convince the US Supreme Court to overturn the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling, or it could resume its own internal administrative action that was put on hold in 2023 pending the 9th Circuit's decision. But with a new US administration in power and a new Trump-appointed chairman helming the FTC, the agency's focus may now be elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
As for Microsoft, it has been reaping the benefits of its $69bn acquisition since the deal was finalised in 2023; the company's Q1 2025 financial report showed a substantial 61 percent year-on-year increase in Xbox content and services revenue, largely thanks to Activision Blizzard.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Control 2, the next big single-player game from Remedy, will be made on a smaller budget than its last single-player feature, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a>, chief executive officer Tero Virtala confirmed.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/remedys-next-big-game-is-being-made">Game File,</a> Virtala spoke about how this will be done, and how it's about Remedy learning from past mistakes to go "<em>from surviving to succeeding</em>."</p>
<p>Virtala says that €50 million is what he thinks the studio needs to make a good Remedy game, and that's the budget Control 2 has, which is slightly less than what Alan Wake 2 cost to make. Remedy has always been known for creating exceptional single-player experiences that have critics raving about them, but they're never able to achieve the massive commercial success that other single-player games of the same ilk can achieve.</p>
<p>Even Alan Wake 2, for example, only recently surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/">2 million copies sold</a> since its 2023 launch. That's not to say 2 million isn't a huge milestone, but it makes you scratch your head when you think about the fact that Alan Wake 2 is widely agreed to be one of the best single-player games and narrative experiences in video games in years. It gave Baldur's Gate III a real run for its money when everyone thought Baldur's Gate was a shoo-in for game of the year. And yet, Alan Wake 2 is well behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-reportedly-sold-15-million-copies-vincke-hopes-next-gen-tech-will-bring-his-dream-rpg-closer/">Baldur's Gate III's 15+ million copies sold</a>.</p>
<p>It's not surprising, therefore, to learn that Remedy is looking to streamline its process, so it can still make the kinds of games it is renowned for, without fear that it won't survive.</p>
<p>Control 2 is currently in <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-full-production-remedy/">full production</a>, but in the meantime, Remedy's next game will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-info-all-post-launch-content-will-be-free/">FBC Firebreak</a>, a cooperative multiplayer game set within the world of Control, which is due out next month on June 17, 2025, on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> is a new Metroid-like adventure from Raccoon Logic Studios, which kicks off by dropping you on some backwater planet in space, with no gear, no backup on the way, and pretty much nothing at your disposal besides your wits and what you can salvage from your ship's wreckage.</p>
<p>It's a very open-ended start to the game, and you'll see your quest list fill up faster than you can get to everything on it. But there are a few tasks that you should prioritize, and a few gameplay&nbsp; when you land in Nu Florida, to really get the best experience possible out of your time with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>
<h2>Best Tips For Starting Revenge of the Savage Planet</h2>
<h3>ABS - Always Be Scanning/Surveying</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>While the whole opening premise of Revenge of the Savage Planet is that you're dropped on this planet with nothing, there are plenty of resources in the wreckage from your ship, the tech that Alta Interglobal has left behind, and just the natural resources from the planets you visit, that you can use to make your journey easier. Scanning everything you can is also part of your character's progression, so whenever you enter a new area, it's worth jumping into the scanner mode to see if anything is highlighted orange, which means it hasn't yet been scanned.</p>
<p>The second part of this is to always be surveying the area. If you're playing on a controller, then you're going to be constantly clicking R3. This helps you keep the direction you're heading in top of mind, because it's very easy to lose track of your goal otherwise.</p>
<h3>Get Your Upgrades Sorted</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are plenty of upgrades you can shoot for at the top of the game, and you'll hit all the key ones by going through the main questlines, like adding a grapple to your whip. But there are a few you also need to prioritize from the start. No fall damage is a huge one, for example, that you should clear as soon as you can. Same goes for getting a double-jump, though that is unfortunately more involved than it should be, since you need to complete multiple environmental tasks to get to the point where you can unlock the double-jump upgrade. Upgrading your mask to filter out toxic gas is another that you'll want to get as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Basically, if it's to do with exploration and movement, you should focus on doing it as soon as you can. It's worth your time to jump to the next planet and progress the story to hit some of these key upgrades that can make the time you spend just exploring each planet you go to a lot more fun.</p>
<h3>Isolate Before You Capture</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>In the same way you'll want to scan everything, you'll want to capture all the fauna you encounter in Revenge of the Savage Planet. In some cases, doing so is pretty straightforward. Some of them don't require you to stun them first, you can sneak up and grab them with your whip. Most, however, will require that you engage them in combat and hit a weak spot a few times before you can whip them and pull them into what looks like a wormhole, transporting them back to your home base. Any damage you take while pulling them into the wormhole will stop you from being able to pull them in, and you'll have to redo the whole capture process.</p>
<p>There are often multiples of the kinds of creatures you'll be looking to capture all hanging out together, and trying to capture one of them in a scenario where the rest will surely catch on to what you're doing is a recipe for disaster. Until you've eaten enough of the orange goo you'll find on each planet, and even after you've upgraded your health and stamina significantly, you're very squishy. You'll die faster than you think if you aren't careful with how you approach a group of creatures, and you need to capture at least one of each to research them and unlock more upgrades for yourself.</p>
<p>So don't just try and pull one in if it's not completely safe. The animation for doing so is far slower than I would have liked it to be, and while Raccoon Logic could make it a tad faster, that feels unlikely. Best to be prepared and plan your capture strategy when approaching a new group of creatures you haven't researched yet.</p>
<h3>Avoid combat whenever possible</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>You gain some resources from killing the local fauna on each planet, and you're often thrown into scenarios where you need to fight your way out. But when you're exploring the planets you visit, avoid combat as often as you can.</p>
<p>It'll be difficult because many creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet are hostile just from you walking by them, so you'll hear the combat music start and stop plenty of times throughout your playthrough. But trust me when I say it's a much better use of your time to try and find resources in the environment through whatever objective you have or environmental puzzles you find. Those will always give you more resources than random combat scenarios will.</p>
<h3>Your Blaster Sucks On Purpose, Use Everything Around You Instead</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>The blaster you start the game with, for the most part, sucks. But it sucks for a reason, which is that you're not meant to just pull out your blaster with every hostile creature you face. It'll help you, for sure, but you're also meant to use the environment around you. Don't just rely on your blaster to take care of everything.</p>
<p>To be clear, it's not because your blaster won't be able to handle whatever you come across. It will, but it won't be as effective, or as efficient, as the environmental hazards you can use to your advantage. Especially after you've unlocked the ability to fire various kinds of goo.</p>
<hr>
<p>These are the main things you'll want to know when starting Revenge of the Savage Planet, and if you keep them in mind, you're sure to have a smooth start in the game's early hours.</p>

                <p>Nintendo might be synonymous with video games today, but the company actually got its start as a playing card company. Founded in 1889, Nintendo originally produced Hanafuda--a type of card used to play a variety of games dating back to the 16th century. Playing cards are obviously no longer Nintendo’s main attraction, but the gaming giant hasn't forgotten its humble playing card roots. Nintendo has continued to release card decks, albeit not as many these days, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Legend-Zelda-Trump-Playing/dp/B005XR3K5M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">traditional 52-card Legend of Zelda</a>- and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Super-Mario-Playing-Not-Specified/dp/B003PDUQBM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario-themed decks</a> as well as unique <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Mario-playing-cards-red/dp/B01683O7BA?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hanafuda cards featuring characters from the Mushroom Kingdom</a>.</p><p>Nintendo playing cards are primarily sold in Japan, though a bunch of imported decks have popped up on Amazon over the years. Prices tend to change often because you're buying from resellers with limited stock, but the decks typically ship from Amazon and some even have Prime shipping.

            <p>
A day after dropping jaws and making the recently anounced delay even tougher to bare, Rockstar has confirmed GTA 6's hugely impressive second trailer was a mix of "gameplay and cutscenes" captured "entirely in-game" on a PlayStation 5.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">second trailer dropped earlier this week</a>, offering a closer look at its world - which includes the return of the Miami-inspired Vice City - and its sprawling cast of characters than we saw in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">2023's scene-setting first showing</a>. Rockstar subsequently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-trailer-2-analysed">detailed character breakdowns</a> and dozens upon dozens of screenshots for eager fans to scrutinise still further.
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, plenty of chatter immediately ensued, some of it lauding the incredible amount of detail on display, some of it frantically sharing screen captures of Jason's rippling torso, and some of it casting doubt on the little note at the end of the trailer claiming it was all captured on PS5. At the very least, people speculated, Rockstar must have <em>surely</em> meant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>?

<p>
But the developer has now moved to quell any lingering doubts, suggesting that, yes, everything we saw in its most recent trailer was indeed generated by Sony's now nearly five-year-old console, and all of it was in-game. "Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 2 was captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5," the studio <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1920181314092765494">confirmed in a statement shared on social media</a>, "comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes."
</p>

So there you go; let dazzlement and bewonderment be yours. The downside to all this excitement, of course, is that GTA 6 is still some considerable way off following its recent delay. Publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">previously</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">repeatedly</a> insisted GTA 6 would launch this autumn, but last week - after months of reports suggesting a delay was likely - Rockstar announced a new release date of 26th May next year, saying it needed "this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."

And while its new release date leaves a big GTA-shaped hole in the 2025 release schedule, it does at least mean publishers previously unwilling to commit to launch dates for their own titles fearing GTA 6's dominance are likely now moving quickly to fill the void. Earlier this year, game execs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-publishers-talk-challenges-of-gta-6-launch-in-new-report-we-dont-want-to-be-anywhere-near-that">bemoaned the "havoc" Grand Theft Auto 6's lack of a release date</a> was causing, with one saying, "We don't want to be anywhere near that."

With a full year still to go until GTA 6's arrival on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, it might be some time before Rockstar reveals more. But for those keeping track, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">everything we know so far</a>.
